    "If you want a good class on American Literature take this class.",
    "Absolutely no question: take this class. No background in literature needed, though having a basic foundation in U.S. history (and, after ENGL 127, American Lit) proved helpful on a personal level though absolutely not necessary for assignments. Professor Smith is a giant. He's highly intelligent, articulate, funny, and caring. Really all around great dude. The readings are the biggest strength of the course. You'll really go through the canon of the era in depth and have a chance to read some classics you likely skipped in high school like the rest of us (Twain's Huck Finn, Edith Wharton's House of Mirth, James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man, Williams Carlos Williams, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, Amy Lowell, Faulkner's The Sound & The Fury, to name just a few). The assignments are really fair and fun to write, particularly because the reading list is so excellent. Really, if you have any interest in U.S. history, literature, or a knowledge of the Americas, take this class. It's a great one.",
    "A really great, in-depth exploration into American Literature of this time period. It covers a lot of important gaps you might have in your readings and although the reading is a lot to keep up with, the assigned readings are all really interesting, entertaining and valuable pieces of work to know in terms of American Literature in general.",
    "Don't take this class unless you really like the books covered and are interested in a Lit class. Don't take this if you're looking for an American Studies type course because that stuff is barely touched on. I thought it was a pretty boring class and I didn't get much out of it other than a lit credit for my major, but if you really like the books on the list you might like the class. Also, I had a really great TA that helped tremendously, so try to get one that's helpful and enthusiastic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The reading list is great; Professor Smith is great. Reading James and Wharton back to back is a little rough. Ultimately, exam-wise, if you actually go to class you'll be more than fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The curriculum was put together very well, and each section was connected to the next with a lot of thought and in a way that yielded great insight. Professor Smith is an engaging lecturer, and his last few lectures on \"The Sound and the Fury\" were especially lyrical and insightful.",
    "American Lit was a fantastic class! Caleb Smith's lectures are a pleasure to listen to he always offers really insightful comments about the readings, and he is very eloquent. Section was also awesome take it with Phoenix as a TA if you can, because he's the best! Two papers and a final, which was a lot cumulatively, but not too hard. Also, some of the most seminal works of American literature are on this reading list, from Faulkner to James to Twain. If you love literature, you will love this class!",
    "This class is fantastic. Professor Smith is a brilliant lecturer and he managed to present some material that I normally would have found somewhat dull in a fascinating way. Overall, the books and poems read in this class range from fantastic to good with his insights being invaluable. My only complaint is that there was a LOT of reading, and sometimes the pace at which we were expected to keep up was a bit to brisk.",
    "Am Lit CW-WWI is a great course! Caleb Smith is a) super knowledgable, b) a very engaging lecturer and c) really amusing (and comes up with the best lecture titles!) The class follows the rise and fall of literary realism and specifically the ways in which the realists engaged with issues of race, gender, and economic inequality. Except for James' The Portrait of a Lady, the readings were all very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this course. To my fellow American Studies majors, don't be afraid! This is not an overly english-y course.",
    "AMST282 is a fantastic course--Prof. Smith is an amazing lecturer, and because of this I really looked forward to each class. Definitely recommended!",
    "I would recommend for a basic survey of American literature. It's not the best class I've ever taken, but it's solid.",
    "If you have the chance, take AMST282. Professor Smith will amaze you and the reading is incredible. Doing the readings didn't feel like doing work for a class. Professor Smith's lectures are probably some of the best at Yale.",
    "ENGL 282 has many interesting works from all sorts of authors. The best part about it is the diversity of works-- by women, by people of color, by rich and by poor. It is a standard English lecture-- it has section, as well as two papers and a final. I did not find it mind-blowing, but I did really enjoy quite a few of the books and stories. Section was a bit of a drag, but I believe they'll be trying to improve it next time. I would recommend the course for English majors and English majors specializing in American Lit--you'll get a good taste of all sorts of styles and topics.",
    "As its title suggestions, ENGL 282 traces a trajectory through American literature from the Civil War to WWI. The syllabus is divided into several units that put emphasis on how these decades of American literature specifically dealt with issues of identity, especially when various identities became divided (i.e. racial identity, gender identity, and socioeconomic identity). These course units seem particularly relevant and meaningful given the context of today's society, and for that reason, yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student."
