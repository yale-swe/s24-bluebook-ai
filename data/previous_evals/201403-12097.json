    "I found this gem of an eval from several years back and I'm going to quote from it because it's so apt: \"If any other teacher besides Professor Osuji were teaching this course, we would never have gotten through all of the material. But Professor Osuji dragged us through this course the same way Achilles dragged Hector behind his chariot around Troy, which I guess in the end was a good thing for us.\" Prepare to cover a lot of material in a very short amount of time. This class is a lot of work (6 psets total, each one taking 15-20 hours to complete). In the end, though, I'm glad I learned a lot about separations (which is important whether you're going into research or industry) and gained some proficiency with Matlab.",
    "This course provides an introduction to separation processess crucial to the chemical industry, such as distillation, absorption, extraction, chromatography etc. The course can be intense for students who have no background in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and mass transport.",
    "A great course. Osuji assigns about 5 bi-weekly problem sets which are roughly 20-30 pages each. This course requires an expert knowledge of Matlab, and if you don't have that, you pretty much have no chance in this course. Every problem set requires extensive knowledge of Matlab. The book is incredibly complex and offers a few examples. The best preparation for a course like this is to buy the Separations book by Wiley and few other Separations textbooks and start reading them the summer before you plan on taking it. Exams are very challenging, requiring you to recall a lot of material in under 1.5 hours. Osuji determines your grade based upon your quickness of recalling material and your depth of understanding. This class is intended to defeat you if you are not prepared.",
    "Take the course, you learn a lot. Chances are if you're looking at it, you have to take it. Try and enjoy it. Hopefully they'll have changed the book.",
    "Separations as a topic is really cool: the first half is distillations, the second half is other types of separations tike membranes and chromatography. If its taught by Osuji, then buckle up and get ready to be dragged through the entire book (see the eval referencing Achilles). The problem was mainly that Osuji told us that he expected us to pull all-nighters in order to finish problem sets, so he assigned huge problem sets that were often impossible to solve without answers to earlier, unassigned book problems, tables from earlier chapters that we didnt cover, obscure equations, etc. He also didnt seem to look at how the problems were actually solved: once, we asked him for help on a problem, and he realized that he didnt even understand the solution and he hadnt even looked at it before. Be prepared for long problem sets, and try to get familiar with Matlab before the course, as you use it a lot and knowing it will save you a lot of time on the problem sets. Exams are pretty concepts-focused, but make sure you know the equations behind the concepts, as writing those down will often give you nearly full points."
