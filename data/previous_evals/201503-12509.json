    "Good L4. Didn't like 5 days a week. Prof. Cividanes was absolutely amazing!!!",
    "Spanish 140 is a reasonably paced class that puts emphasis on your ability to communicate in Spanish, not so much your ability to memorize vocabulary. I would certainly recommend this class because it can improve your level of Spanish tremendously.",
    "SPAN 140 is very similar to a high level high school Spanish class. The work is very reasonable, it allows you to develop your skills in all areas of the language and be very prepared for the L5 classes. Sometimes the grading could be very harsh and the structure of the grading scale may need to be dealt with so it does not penalize so harshly for small mistakes. Cividanes though was a great professor and I would highly recommend her and her class as they are very helpful in developing one's spanish skills over the semester.",
    "much better than SPAN 130.",
    "Spanish 140 08 was a great course that improved my Spanish. Ame was a wonderful teacher who was helpful, fair, and especially improved our speaking skills.",
    "This class, above all, really helped me improve my speaking. I would definitely recommend this class to other students because it gets you on the track of speaking so well that you really want to keep studying Spanish (at least, in my case).",
    "This class was really good. I took L3 last semester and this was by far more enjoyable. There's not as much online work and there's more chances for actual conversation and delving into Hispanic culture. You're also presented with interesting movies and readings, so I liked it. Also, you should take this with Prof. Cividanes. She's amazing.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class if you're interested in really pushing your Spanish skills to the next level. I found it more engaging and creative than L3, especially with the novel and the movies! Professor Cividanes was an amazing professor who was engaging and gave great feedback. She's especially wonderful with the literary and artistic analysis you do throughout the course, since that is her specialty! Take this class, and take it with her :)",
    "Okay so here's the thing, I have a final paper due tomorrow that I'm spending all my time on. I understand that since I did a lot of the work for minitab that I'm also the person who is most familiar with the process, but that also means that I have put in a lot of hours already. But I get what you mean, and I definitely want a good grade for this, but the thing that takes the longest amount of time for me is writing because wording things right just takes me a while. I could right down all the steps, since they're very straightforward, though",
    "Spanish 140 covers more advanced Spanish grammar and subject matter. A few of the sentence structures we learned seemed obscure, but a good class for anyone who is trying to become fluent in Spanish. Cividanes is a fine instructor."
