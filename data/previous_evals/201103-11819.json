    "Having the freedom to write whatever I wanted for my senior project was the single most gratifying experience of my undergraduate career. Definitely apply to the writing concentration!",
    "If you are a life-long poet interested in maturing to the level of a professional writer, with that amount of control over the quality of thought that goes into your work, and with an interest not justin making new things, but in coming to terms with old ones and reconciling your entire oeuvre, then now is the time to get into the Writing Concentration and hop on board the poem train. Wow! I would do it all over again if I could.It's pretty much: revise two or three a week and write one, until the midterm, when you also re-hand in drafts of the entire thesis every week, with a potential order for the poems, as well as revisions and new poems.",
    "Absolutely. If you've spent your first three years at Yale taking creative writing courses, why not let a creative work be the capstone of your academic experience? My only caution--put your all into this project, don't simply let it be a fun alternative to a research project or a long paper.I was so lucky--I worked with an advisor who set up a weekly meeting time with me. This meant I had a semblance of structure (even if it wasn't as rigid as it would be in a class or a workshop): I had a new poem due each week, as well as at least 2 or 3 revisions. The steady pace, the constant feedback, and the amazing one-on-one time with my advisor gave me confidence that I was churning out something strong (and that I wasn't scrambling to turn in a half-assed thing at the last minute).",
    "Yes!"
