    "ENGL 114 introduces students to effective writing for university courses. The four major essays reflect different essay types that one will likely encounter in other courses. Each section focuses on a different topic. I would suggest taking this course, but really try to take a section that has a topic that interests you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The general consensus on 114 is that it's really for people that are weak writers, but I would recommend it to most people. The section topics are interesting and it's a great introduction to writing at Yale.",
    "English 114 is a great way to strengthen academic writing and critical thinking, and I think that it is a great course to take upon first coming to college. It helped me to build the skills I will need throughout my Yale career.",
    "Yes I definitely would! English 114 11 helps you distinguish a strong foundation for writing at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. My biggest tips would be to go to office hours with work prepared to go over or at least questions to ask. Plan out your writing ahead of time and try to avoid putting off work until the last minute, and make the most of the detailed feedback comments.",
    "ENGL 114 teaches students how to write different forms of papers. It is a great class to take so that you know what Yale is looking for when writing papers. The war and commemoration section is extremely interesting and you read pieces of work related to the topic.",
    "Of the English 114 sections that I shopped, this section was definitely a strong option, especially for someone who enjoys learning about war, and the theory behind it. Many English 114 sections seemed to have less inspired topics, but I was very motivated to do a lot of work for this class, because of I enjoyed learning about the theory of war.",
    "ENGL 114 11 is a course that brings you glimpses of global war. It has a particularly strong emphasis on WW1 literature and history. It utilizes texts and media that concern war to force the students to contemplate arguments that have strong moral and philosophical implications. The professor is wonderful. The discussion of monuments may or may not interest students. The class culminates in a TED talk and an op-ed piece that is a fun and different approach to the style the class mainly focuses on."
