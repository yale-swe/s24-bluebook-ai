    "The course has been one of the best I have attended so far at Yale University. In addition to the instructor's knowledge and experience in the field of infectious disease, the intimate setting (e.g, less than 15 students) offered a unique learning experience. The course has truly affected my approach to public health.",
    "A very good and interesting class. Really enjoyable however I would have enjoyed some more lectures and less discussion. Sometimes discussions really got out of hand and the professor should have stopped and redirected them. Other than that, I learned a lot and really enjoyed it.",
    "This was a great interdisciplinary course that really touched upon all aspects of public health that I hope to use in my future career. There was an emphasis placed on having a hard science background but I felt that I did not utilize it that much in the discussions. At times there were too many readings. Lectures every once in a while or for part of the class would have been useful. I liked having discussions about water and sanitation and all the aspects of an infectious disease-environment, human behavior, and policy of implementing programs and the realistic view of how it should be approached.",
    "The course was excellent and should be offered again and mimicked for other subjects. It played on students strengths and was multidisciplinary in the best way.",
    "Excellent course in structure, organization, content, etc...",
    "A little basic for a graduate-level class, but the students came from such different backgrounds (forestry, public health, epidemiology, undergrad) that it may have been hard to jump into more advanced topics."

    "Instructor: Kristina Marie Talbert-Slagle \u00a0The instructor is very dedicated to the field of water-borne infectious disease and her knowledgeable background is evident during class discussion. In addition to be kind and generous with her time and efforts, I sincerely believe she sought to instill the same dedication in her students.",
    "Instructor: Kristina Marie Talbert-Slagle \u00a0Great professor. As mentioned above, I think that Kristina should have guided discussions a little better, but other than that, a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Kristina Marie Talbert-Slagle \u00a0Time management of class could have been better and improved after midterm evaluationsGreat choice of articles and structure of the course from concepts of water usage, infectious disease and leading to sanitation and application of everything learned in the courseShe is easy to approach to discuss both coursework and general future career decisionsThis is a seminar so the class is more discussion based",
    "Instructor: Kristina Marie Talbert-Slagle \u00a0She was great. Really passionate and dedicated to the course and the subject.",
    "Instructor: Kristina Marie Talbert-Slagle \u00a0Excellent! She did such a great job engaging us and giving us excellent readings.",
    "Instructor: Kristina Marie Talbert-Slagle \u00a0Kristina was Very open to class feedback and opinions. She makes her expectations clear from the start, and is very fair. She fostered a very great environment to have meaningful discussions in."

   "comments": [
    "I would not even think twice about strongly recommending this course to another student. Not only is itso relevant in the field of public health, the material taught in class is moving and eye-opening. Overall, it is an exemplary public health course, especially in the division of epidemiology of microbial diseases.",
    "Great course! Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend the course to fellow students. I know that the course may not be offered again but I felt I was at an advantage to take the course and be selected to be in the class. This course should be kept even if the instructor changes. For public health students it really encompasses everything that we learn from core courses.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course. It was interesting and was very different than other courses I've taken at Yale. Awesome perspective on Public Health and Global Health and Disease by focusing on water as the common thread.",
    "Excellent course about problems with water in developed and developing countries. I absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student."
