    "This is a class that caters to the avid traveller. If you are not interested in the topic of travel or you cannot relate the material to personal experiences, you might find this class rather boring. Although the essay grades seemed to be returned a bit harsher than other English 114 classes, i would not be afraid to take this course. You truly become a better writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it proves to be a solid introductory college writing course that provides one with a good foundation for what is expected in college writing. I feel that this class has allowed me to strengthen my writing skills in many ways, specifically in terms of structure and argument. I feel that I progressed well throughout this semester, and I feel that I now understand how to craft a claim and argument more effectively and persuasively. I also think I have improved the structure of my essays. From this course, I will take away these newly developed and sharpened skills and put them into practice in future college courses. Additionally, I will use the insights gained from our various texts and class discussions to continue to widen my perspective and mindset about travel and tourism.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Intensive and burdensome, but absolutely helpful, especially to those who are not used to academic writing",
    "Great class, definitely take it!",
    "Very much like a high school english class, but a good transition into the college work load."
