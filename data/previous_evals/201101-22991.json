   "comments": [
    "Excellent. Incredible. Must-take class. Professor Smith is wonderful and you learn a lot about some really interesting topics.",
    "Take it if it's offered as a seminar, or if you're a poli-sci major.",
    "Good course! David Smith is fantastic. I would recommend takingother bioethics courses first if you have not taken bioethics before just because this is more complex and philosophical, but it's a great course nonetheless. If you're more interested in policy than philosophy, you might want to look elsewhere.",
    "Wonderful class. There is a lot of reading, but 99% of the readings are really interesting and enjoyable. The class is structured by having two-page papers due once out of each pair of weeks, and then a final paper. You need to get the hang of how to write the papers, but after that you realize what a good idea they are, since they allow you to express your ideas about a topic and criticize or support the authors in a focused way. Classes were mostly discussion. Professor Smith gave some background information, but then let the conversation run its course, for the most part. People talked about the subjects of their two-page papers and we were able to really analyze the readings in an in-depth and interesting way. Most of the readings were philosophical and a couple were policy-oriented, but you could choose any topic for the final paper (10-15 pages, based on the readings). I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in bioethics and doesn't mind a bit of a weekly reading load.",
    "Expected much much more from this course from past reviews and was dissapointed. Though Professor Smith is an awesome awesome professor, this course is way more abstract than I thought it would be. If you've never taken an ethics course, think twice about taking this, because although the topics sound cool, my all the wording can get very annoying mid-semester. Readings are kind of dense, but workload is okay. Even the final paper isn't that bad. Take it just to learn from a fantastic professor who truly cares about his teaching for undergraduates.",
    "One of the best classes at this university (and not in the way something only pretend great like Cold War or Intro Psych is). You must take it.",
    "It's a pretty easy class where you can get away with doing very little work, or if you are very interested there is a ton of reading that you can delve into in more detail. Professor Smith is nice, although not hugely exciting (pretty funny at times though). I would recommend it as an easy fifth class.",
    "Professor Smith is an excellent facilitator of class discussion. I did not think that the 40-person seminar model was going to work at the start of the semester, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the class ran very smoothly and many valuable and intellectually stimulating discussions ensued. Smith is also fantastic at forging a personal bond with his students; you will really feel as though he cares about you and what you are getting out of the class.",
    "study different components of bioethics. recommend it if your interested in the subject.",
    "This is a GREAT class. I would recommend taking an introductory bioethics course first (I didn't) because the material can be a little overwhelming without that background. Professor Smith is a great great professor and is always willing to give extra help and get to know each student individually.",
    "This class is a very philosophical and in-depth look on different views on the topic of ethics and dying, such as in abortion, organ transplantation, and dementia. It may be helpful to have a slight background knowledge of bioethics or of these issues. In the class mostly the students discuss their views and Professor Smith facilitates the discussion while interjecting with short spurts of lecture. It will definitely make you think more about these issues. But don't take the class if you aren't going to do the readings - then there is no point. I know some people got away with only doing the readings for the weeks in which they had to write the short paper (2 pages), but then its pointless to sit in class and not know what's going on. I recommend this class to people who like to talk about their views, listen to other people's perspectives, and want to learn more about bioethics.",
    "I would not necessarily take this class unless you are a very vocal person with already strong opinions on healthcare. Though there isn't much work, for some reason the class is not tremendously engaging on a day-to-day basis.",
    "The course is a small lecture; I would describe it as a \"discussion-driven lecture.\" Although it's a lecture, the whole class period is a discussion of that week's topic. Professor Smith will know your name and remember who you are. It is interesting because although it is larger than a seminar (I think our class was 35 people), you get to know people in your class in a way that you definitely wouldn't in your standard lecture.The readings are interesting, and I would say you definitely don't have to do all of it. Every other week you actually don't even have to do the reading because you won't be handing in anything on that week's reading (every other week you do a short reading response on some aspect of the week's reading and are expected to describe what you wrote about to the class).It was not as much work as my other classes. I only did the reading every other week and the final paper was not bad to write; you can write about any topic we covered the whole semester.",
    "I would heartily recommend it. It is a class where topics such as end of life care and abortion are discussed with honesty and sensitivity such that no one is made to feel judged for their opinions. It is very relevant for those seeking futures in public health, policy and medicine.",
    "Take it! It was a bit big this year, which made class discussions good (since there were lots of perspectives) but still intimidating to speak up if that's not your thing. Enjoyed the readings and writing the papers were really good exercises in thinking about the topics at hand. Really came away with a broad overview of the issues in abortion, end-of-life decision making, organ donations, etc.",
    "I would recommend this class, interesting and thought-provoking"
