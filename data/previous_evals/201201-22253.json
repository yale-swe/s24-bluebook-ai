   "comments": [
    "It's not too challenging of a class and it enables you to get a sense of poverty relief programs in developing countries. Most of the students in this class had spent time in developing countries and could therefore relate to everything we learned with personal anecdotes.",
    "This course was amazing! It was at times a little bit too much reading, but I really enjoyed the format of the class, writing a focused final paper and the progression from econ to the politics of poverty alleviation.",
    "If international development is your thing, you'll love this course. Even if it's not your thing, it's a pretty easy course that meets a distribution requirement for the EPE major, and you'll still learn something. We had some really interesting discussions in this class. There's a decent amount of reading; you definitely don't have to do it all because a lot of it is repetitive, but a decent amount of it is also interesting. Ana De La O is also super smart. The expectations in this course are pretty reasonable as far as grading goes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It is not very difficult, but you learn a lot and it's a lot of fun.",
    "TAKE IT!!",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "I had high hopes for this class, but I was ultimately disappointed. I wish it had more substantial class discussions. Professor De La O is clearly very qualified and an expert, and I wish she had held us to a higher standard. However, if you commit to doing the readings, you can learn a lot from the class (I think the majority of my classmates didn't actually do the readings).",
    "Political Economy of Poverty Alleviation is a really well-taught class that introduces you to lots of different aspects of development - not just economic development, but social, political, and human development more generally as well. You learn a little bit about everything: defining what poverty is, the roles of geography and institutions in determining the level of poverty, whether democracy is better for development, etc. You also learn a bit about the philosophy behind development: whether we should just consider incomes, or also consider other measures of well being, when formulating development policies. Professor De La O is really good at leading class discussions as well. I'd suggest taking this as one of your first development classes (after intro micro and macro) if you're interested in this field, as it gives a pretty good overview of the subject and what it's doing in the world out there.",
    "The class is overrated, but not bad.It's basically a survey course of various theories of economic development relevant to less developed countries: whether democracy helps development, how anti-poverty programs are targeted, etc. You read a few articles every week and then talk about them in a seminar composed of more or less equal parts EP&E, Global Affairs, Poli Sci, and Econ students.The articles are generally pretty interesting, but written in a dry and predictable manner. And class discussions can be fun, but frankly most of the time spent in class was devoted to repeating exactly what the articles said; looking back, I can't say that I really learned anything or started thinking about poverty in a different kind of way.It is pretty easy (workload and grading), and it draws together a very interesting group of students. But I don't think you'll learn much more than you could garner from reading the abstracts of the reading list."
