   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a lot of work without actually learning that much. I do have an appreciation for astrobiology now, but it was a waste of a course credit for me.",
    "This class was awesome. I really can't phrase that better. It changed my life. It could definitely be different depending on the other people in the class, but I thought this was an irreplaceable experience.",
    "Astronomy 030 is basically a mixture of biology, astronomy, and science fiction. I would recommend this class to anyone because it is a class where there is great in class discussion and it is exceedingly interesting, at least to me.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The question of the existence of extraterrestrial life had been nagging my existence for quite some time and I was really glad I got the opportunity to take this class. All of the reading material is very interesting stuff that I definitely would have read for leisure. The problem sets can be a lot of work, but I thought it was well worth it.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 030 01 to another student who is interested in getting a pretty broad overview of current topics in astrobiology and who likes learning in a relatively unstructured way.",
    "ASTR 030 is an excellent course taught by an excellent professor. If you love space\/astronomy\/NASA\/what have you but don't have the math background needed to actually major in it, this course is a dream. There is a lot of work (and a lot of reading), but it's overwhelmingly interesting. If you're paying attention in class and interested in the material, the work isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Not to say that it isn't a lot of work; it is just interesting work that tends to fly by rather than drag on. That said, the one negative point is that Prof. Faison did not keep up with grading. The midterm excepted, nothing since the first week of October was graded by the end of the term. In such a work intensive class, this makes all your hard work sometimes feel pointless. So, in short, take this class if you're interested in Astronomy and space. You won't regret it; it's excellently taught and super interesting. But _don't_ take this class if you just want a writing\/science credit.",
    "This was the best class I have ever taken, and it has changed my life. I now know that I want to pursue science in some way. I can't imagine how different things would be now if I would not have gotten into this class.",
    "I would recommend this to another student as it does provide interesting insight in an uncommon subject and also does provide the student with a wide breadth and introduction to various subjects.",
    "A great class that explores an interesting aspect of our place in the universe.",
    "Yes, take this course.",
    "ASTR 030 is an outstanding course that covers many scientific topics in the context of searching for alien life. The professor is outstanding, the course work is pleasantly challenging, the topics are on the cutting edge of science and fascinating, and it is a phenomenal class for both science and non-science majors. I would highly recommend this course to any student."
