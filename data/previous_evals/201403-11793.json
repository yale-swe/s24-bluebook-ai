   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended for students interested in the social, cultural, and psychological analysis of photography in how it relates to memory. Workload is relatively light with a weekly reading response done on an interesting array of readings (most of which are workable, a few of which are more sophisticated but end up being ironed out during class anyway). Final project is pretty open, lots of freedom in determining what you'd like to culminate your learning into.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in taking a theoretical approach to the history of photography.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in photography and its use in society. Professor Wexler is wonderful. The course has a final project that involves analyzing an archive of your choosing. This is one of the best parts of the course.",
    "Theories on how to \"read\" photographic images. Many are historical, having to do with memory, etc. I would recommend yes, it is an interesting class even if photography is not your primary interest. You see these images around you every day and it's great to learn to see them in a more rich\/deep manner.",
    "Take a look at the syllabus! Please note that the class is very theory intense. If this is of interest to you, take it! I think this course will make a nice lecture, but was hard as a large seminar. Prof Wexler is amazing and an expert in her field.",
    "Photography, History, and Memory covers a wide range of subjects relating to the act of and usage of photography: narratives of memories lost and found, of control, of erasure. It's a very interesting subject, and there are many interesting readings (that are maybe a tad too long, but you can generally skim through some of them to get the general picture). I would recommend if you're self-driven enough to actually do the readings and prefer a more free-form kind of class.",
    "I found there to be more of a focus on memory rather than photography. Readings were interesting though not always discussed thoroughly or cohesively. The final paper is very much what you make of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar! The readings are interesting, and the work load is not too bad. There are weekly reading responses and a final paper, which I enjoyed writing. It was also a good mix of people taking the class: mostly art history, american studies, and wgss undergrads as well as some photography grad students.",
    "A wonderful course. Interesting and difficult readings, in-depth and well-led class discussion, a wonderful final project. Dr. Wexler strikes a great balance between scholarly analysis and artful creativity in the readings and final project. I'd strongly recommend this course."
