If I hadn't read them before, I'd have had to spend at least 4 hours a week on this class. But I ended up spending about an hour a week, just doing the weekly concept sheet. During weeks when other things were due, I spent several more hours working on this class.",

    "Excellent. It covers a broad range of topics while addressing historical and current issues related (even tangentially) to food. I wish all classes which dealt with health policy was structured this way.",
    "The class was as good as it could have been, while being a very large lecture. There were several really interesting speakers, who are renowned in the field. It was definitely fun listening to them talk, and learning from them. Of course, Dr. Brownell is also world-renowned, so it was a privilege to hear him lecture, as well. If you understand that you won't have class discussions or have much of an opportunity for one-on-one conversations with the professor, you won't be disappointed by this class.",
    "I loved this course. It was incredibly informative and engaging. The issues were timely and we had the opportunity to hear from some amazing guest speakers. The only drawback of the course was that it was at 9 in morning...other than that, it was great!",
    "This is a fabulous class overall. The lectures were fascinating and well-presented, and the assignments were engaging, useful, and manageable. I wouldn't change anything.",
    "Great topic and great lecturer. The TAs could have been better",
    "I liked the first half of the course (up to midterm exam). I felt the second half of the course was an info-mercial for Kelly Brownell and the Rudd Center. It focused very heavily on the negative effects of food marketing and advertising, food industry practices, and \"sugar sweetened beverages.\" I would have appreciated more coverage of the psychology of food, MUCH LESS emphasis on food industry activities\/marketing\/advertising, and more integration of how biology and psychology influence politics\/policy (e.g. how does the food industry use knowledge of psychology in their marketing and advertising choices? if so, what specific aspects of psychology for persuasion, etc? what are the psychological and biological explanations for why people may overeat?)",
    "A great course!",
    "amazing course with very current and applicable information",
    "Great course - interested in the material, and the readings were relevant to the subject matter discussed. Materials also up to date, and included new information from year to year.",
    "It gives a fantastics overview of all things related to food in the U.S.I felt it could give a more international view at times as well."

    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Kelly is a very effective speaker and presenter. Things are always clear, concise and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Dr. Brownell is a great lecturer, and despite how busy he is and how famous he is in the public health field, he does respond to email and is very sensitive to the needs of his students.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Dr. Brownell is a phenomenal lecturer and more than just filling us with information and opinions, he encouraged students to ask difficult questions and form opinions on the answers to those questions for themselves. I would have loved to have some kind of discussion section for this class or to be able to ask questions during\/after class because it would have been interesting to hear others' opinions as well.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Fabulous lecturer! Great structure and presentation of lectures. Wouldn't change anything.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0While the slide were slightly hard to follow when studying, Kelly's presentation style was great.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Half of the course was focused very specifically on Kelly Brownell's academic interests. I thought the course could have broader in scope, with less focus on his specific interests and agendas. As a lecturer, he was engaging and clearly presented the information.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0It was truly inspiering to be in this class with Prof Brownell. He is a capasity in the field and Yale should be proud to offer a course like this!It is alway interesting to hear people express their opinions and Prof Brownell does this in a very good way and remainds objective in his teaching. He makes clear difference when he expresses his opinion and makes it also clear that others might have different opinions.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0amazing!",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Clear lecturer, would have liked more interaction with him during\/outside of class.Much of the content was posted on open courses as well - very similar to the class itself. Great option, but then lost some of the lecture value when you knew you could get it elsewhere.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Very well measured speaker and clearly thoughtful in putting his presentations together. However, he does come across a little boring and bland at times."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The topics are interesting and relevant to current issues and Dr. Brownell's enthusiasm and optimism are contagious.",
    "Fabulous class! It will teach you everything there is to know about food, from a number of different perspectives. The assignments are creative and interesting.",
    "Awesome course but definitely and undergraduate, not graduate. Limited opportunity for exploration and self guided discovery.",
    "It was a good introduction to some of the issues surrounding food (production, consumption) and food policy, however, many of the views are slanted toward Kelly Brownell's beliefs. If you go into the course as I did, with an expectation that a large portion of the course would be advertisement for Kelly Brownell's work with the Rudd Center (which it was), and you are okay with that, then it is a decent course. Although I personally did not care for that aspect of the course, the other portions of the course were informative and interesting (on food production and agriculture and the biology and psychological aspects of food). He is a clear and engaging lecturer and made the material interesting, even though I sometimes thought he was using the course as a way to further his agenda or convince students of his opinions.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "extraordinary~!",
    "Great class - my favorite this year. I recommended it to all my friends who are interested in food and food policy.",
