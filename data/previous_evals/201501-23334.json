    "Very informative and relaxed course. Glad I took it.",
    "Assignments weren't very helpful in understanding the subject, and grading really wasn't feedback-oriented.",
    "Great presenters",
    "Very good course. The professor invited lots of speakers, which I think is very helpful and broaden my horizon.",
    "I LOVED that this course was taught by several guest lecturers who were specialists in their field; this brought a lot of variety to lectures, and kept the interest high",
    "The course was not interactive enough. It just consisted of listening to whoever the guest speakers were that week.",
    "While I fully appreciate the epidemiology of cancer, I think that material could be much better taught, and helped to be retained. I appreciated the variety of guest lectures and the diversity, but some guest lecturers were definitely better than others. Reconciling the material as a student is quite difficult given the fact that we only have 3 assignments throughout the course of the semester. Some of the material itself is also quite repetitive from other epidemiology classes. I would prefer more epidemiology type assignments i.e. study design, etc. Dr Cartmel was also extremely vague about the final examination and what would show up on it."
