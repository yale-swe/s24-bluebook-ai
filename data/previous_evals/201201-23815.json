    "pro:comprehensive and all the assignments are really helpfulcon: too much slides...",
    "This is a great class tought by one of the best professionals in the field. Several of the visiting lecturers were also extremely knowledgable and engaging. These are some of the major strengths in the class. There is also a field trip to YNHH. This field trip is helpful for students to gain a more comprehensive perspective of hospital epidemiology and infection control practices. The only weakness of this class is that there isn't enough time to cover many of the topics in full detail. Some details were also left out as a result of being beyond the scope of the class. Overall, more is better in this course as there is much to learn and keep up with in this field.",
    "good overview, good selection of readings. I thought the assignments were appropriate and relevant to understanding of the course materials. I especially liked the in-class group activities.I thought the reading assignment lists were not easily accessible.There were too many separate documents outlining class requirements and readings. Perhaps consolidating them would make assignments easy to find.",
    "This was a great course and I really enjoyed learning about the different topics in hospital epidemiology. The guest speakers were helpful in helping us understand material. I also thought the assignments, including the group project and exam, were helpful in reinforcing course topics. I really enjoyed the small class size.",
    "Very informative and interesting class. The instructor keeps things interesting and is a very good lecturer with a lot of first-hand experience. There are 3 written HWs during the semester, all of which really added to my knowledge. The final was very fair and I think the take home final is an appropriate format for this course.",
    "S: Projects, lectures, and hospital tourW: none",
    "Very nice course. I learned a lot about hospital dynamics and I would recommend it to those who plan on working in a hospital.Really enjoyed the classroom debate.Really enjoyed the guest lecturers.Very well structured with fair exam\/hw questions."

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Humorous, stylish. Maybe talking a little fast",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry's class is fantastic! Her class should be a divisional requirement. She presents the course information clearly and concisely so that there is no confusion. Her expectations are high and she challenges students to think creatively. In some cases it was difficult to tell if she was asking rhetorical questions or if she wanted answers from the class. One weakness was her tendency to occasionally speak over the invited guest lecturers but it was mostly to share her wealth of knowledge.",

    "Highly recommend",
    "This class is an excellent overview of the public healt infectious disease surveillance systems that are in place in hospitals around the Unites States. This is a fantastic class and I would recommend it to all YSPHers.",
    "This was a really great course with great material. I would recommend it to anyone interested in hospital epidemiology and how Infection Control personnel work in hospitals to solve problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is even mildly interested in this subject because it is one of the better courses in the MPH program.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. The lectures are very interesting and hospital tour was fun. Totally recommend it to EMD students should take this class, and especially if thinking in getting into Medical Student."
