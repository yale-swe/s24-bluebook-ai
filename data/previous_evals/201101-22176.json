    "Questionable if this actually deserves a QR credit. The class looks at the meaning of words in a formal approach, covering basic, BASIC set theory, basic first order logic, through some higher order approaches. Basically everything is framed as a function and the application of the \"QR\" part of this class to the work is really straightforward functional compositionality. That said, it's a pretty easy going class, readings aren't absolutely necessary, homeworks are straightforwards and generously graded, so was the midterm. A new way to think about what parts of a sentence actually mean.",
    "This is a QR in which you don't have to do math, but you DO have to pay attention and work hard. Don't be fooled, my friends -- it starts slow, but there's a lot of logic involved and unless you're entirely engaged in class, you'll fall behind.",
    "This is a challenging course, so by no means an easy QR. But if you put in the work and pay attention to details, and if you are interested in language and linguistics, it's can be a very fulfilling course.",
    "This class is an introduction to semantics, if this field interests you I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Do not take this class unless you are a linguistics major who is already familiar with the material. It is poorly taught, uninteresting, and incredibly difficult--not worth taking for the QR credit.",
    "I might recommend it, depending on what someone is looking for. If you are looking for a good QR course, I don't think this one is the best-- I didn't feel like it challenged or expanded my abilities to think quantitatively and logically, but the different linguistic models were interesting. It was definitely a new and different way to look at language for me.Sections aren't required, but I think they were usually helpful for me-- even if I didn't feel like Ihad any questions, the TA usually gave problems and examples that led to questions or emphasized something I might have payed less attention to in readings and lecture. The format of the class was really nice. It was a lecture, bu the professor was great about keeping track of how lost people were and looking at questions and problems that the students thought of.Also, just as a side note, I think it can be kind of a tricky class if you're not good at differentiating between \"normal\" sounding sentences and anomalous ones, or if you sometimes get lazy\/distracted\/lost in multi-step processes (this is a problem for syntax trees and lambda calculus.)",
    "Don't take this class if you're just looking for a non-math QR. It's only interesting if you actually care about linguistics. However, if you are interested, you'll learn a lot and find new ways of looking at language, which is fascinating.",
    "Don't take it - it's not worth your time as either a linguistics major or as a QR.",
    "A great introduction to truth-conditional semantics, a terrific class, and a very talented professor. I would say to take the course if at all you can. It is not difficult at all, but at the same time very stimulating and extremely interesting.",
    "The class deals with how language and meaning are formed compositionally in a quantitative manner. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in language\/linguistics- it might be boring for others.",
    "Some of the major topics of this course are set theory, first order truth-conditional logic, type theory, and lambda calculus. I remember reading the reviews for this class last semester and not knowing what any of these optics were, so that didn\u0092t really help, but I\u0092ll try to explain things keeping in my mind my point of view one semester ago.The course is really an introduction to truth-conditional semantics. It is not about lexical semantics (which focuses on individual expressions such as to \u0093death\u0094 or \u0093to think.\u0094 The course does not examine nuances of language from the literary sense of semantics. Instead, the course focuses on patterns in the ways that meanings of different types of expressions can combine and contribute their meaning to the meaning of larger expressions. For example, you will learn the answers to the following questions: \u0093How does a transitive verb combine with two \u0093nouns\u0094 to form a sentence?\u0094 or What statements must hold in order for another statement to be true? The psets only take about 2-4 hours a week, and are worked through relatively easily. Most of the problems or uncertainty I encountered had to do with notation, but TAs are readily available to clear those types of things up.Ashwini Deo is a really clear professor, who explains every concept very well, and presents material in an organized easy-to-follow way, complete with a comprehensive handout for each class. I did not do any of the readings, but never felt lost in class. Unfortunately, one might feel the urge to not pay attention in class or to skip class, since the handouts show exactly what was covered, but I think the discussions had, examples covered, and questions ask make going to lecture certainly worth it, and much better than just looking at the handouts yourself later on.",
    "Analysis of the semantics of English language using set and type theory. I liked the course enough as a non-linguistics major, though I certainly don't feel that the way I process meaning in language has changed after subjecting it to formal analysis. Not a lot of work - pset almost every week, midterm, and final. Concepts can get a little confusing a feel diffuse at the end. Professor Deo is a wonderful professor, though - she's incredibly enthusiastic and is definitely a student advocate.",
    "Do it if you like logic and language.",
    "I would say to take it if you are interested in Linguistics and especially Semantics and need a QR, but if you are just looking for an interesting Linguistics class, there are many others in the department that are more engaging."
