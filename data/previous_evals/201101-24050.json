    "Would have",
    "Sure. This is a good class with a very intelligent professor. You will spend a lot of class time on presentations, though.",
    "If you want to learn about political economy without all the tedious formulae and calculations of academic economics, take this course. Prof. Roach is a fantastic instructor and the reading list is marvelous. It is a course in which the real-world importance of economics, with both its strengths and limitations, comes through vividly.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. The workload is REALLY light. No one does any of the reading (I just read the introduction to each book\/paper and was way ahead of the curve) and other than that, there's just a really easy group presentation and a longer final paper. At the same time, however, you do learn some pretty cool stuff, and Roach is the man.This class is different from other economics classes in that it is not really at all quantitative and doesn't focus on details. It's more \"big picture thinking.\" Some people might not like this, but others (particularly non-econ majors) will really appreciate it. It's an interesting way to approach economics and gives you some insight into how policymakers actually weigh decisions.As for the content, the lessons from Japan are pretty important. You'll find that Roach is SUPER repetitive and you learn all the important stuff in the first few weeks, but it's still a good class. I'd recommend.",
    "Absolutely! This is one of my favourite econ classes at Yale!",
    "Take it if you are interested in the recent financial crises.",
    "I would excellent class.",
    "A great class for anyone interested in economic challenges today, and the future of economic policy making in the near future. This class is not focused on Japan per se, so non-Japanese aficionados need not be scared away.",
    "Yes, I learned so much. But it was one of the most challenging courses I've taken at Yale, in terms of course materials, the workload of readings, and the competitive\/intense class environment (mostly due to the makeup of student body in the class).",
    "Take this class, Professor Roach is amazing and the topic is 100% relevant to the current state of the world. You will learn amazing things."
