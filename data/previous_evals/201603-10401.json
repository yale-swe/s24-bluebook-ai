    "Basic graphic design knowledge: using grid systems, arranging the pictorial field, basic typography. Learnt (by myself) InDesign and Illustrator, but used it in class. Also critique-skills (learnt how to talk about other people's graphic design).",
    "I've learned to better recognize and create good design. And how to better critique my peers.",
    "I developed a great vocabulary for talking about and examining graphic design.",
    "I learned a lot of foundation design principles that improved my amateur pieces almost immediately. I also think I gained insight into how to think about creative challenges and work outside my comfort zone artistically.",
    "I notice graphic design after taking this class which is something that shows me how much I've taken away from the class and that I appreciate the subject much more now."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: solid alternation between critiques and studio sessions. Great professor, great TA. Interesting assignments. Weakness: I wish we had had a topic switch over the second half of the course, instead of working on an extra long, 3 part, assignment.",
    "It's just a bit unorganized in terms of communication between professor and students.",
    "This is a good foundation for graphic design. Well taught with an inspiring field trip to the Albers foundation. Henk included presentations about early to modern graphic design which was great and invited a designer from the Hillary campaign to present their work. Lots of critiques throughout the course which was helpful for my development as a graphic designer. The course kind of dabbles in a bit of everything, so I don't feel super comfortable without Henk there to guide me, but definitely a step in the right direction.",
    "Great mix between studio time and lectures. Great field trips.",
    "I think that if the assignments had been posted online, it would have solved some peoples confusions about due dates and requirements.",
    "Strength is that it's engaging but weakness is the time it takes outside of class to complete work for an introductory class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. Great class.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in design at any level. Even if you're not a typical art student.",
    "Absolutely. You'll spend considerable time working outside and in class but it is worth it. Prof. van Assen is very passionate about design, his enthusiasm is infectious and you learn alot every class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in graphic design or anything marketing related.",
    "Highly recommend. As a person who did four years of art in high school and sent in AP portfolios, this class was remarkably refreshing. Now that I'm a senior, I regret I didn't take this sooner. I could've easily been swept away by the amazing design department here. Even as an engineering major like I was, you have to find time to fulfill your Hu distribution credit. Take the leap of faith and try this course. Fair warning though, it is a popular course with limited spots. I didn't get in the first time but came back the next semester and got in. Best of luck!",
    "Definitely. I really learned a lot.",
    "If you are just starting out in design, this is a really great foundational course. It might be annoying to some people to have to spend most of the semester collaging, but I agree that it is a great way to isolate aspects of design that the computer would convolute. It can take a lot of time, but it is really a course that you get out of it what your put into it. So, I think it is possible to do thinks minimally and do well in the course, but the more time you spend editing and making detail work, the more you will learn.",
    "If you are willing to put in the work and have one then yes"
