   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are a Russian major, love Russian literature, love Nabokov, or are a native Russian speaker who reads well--- I'd recommend it. Not a huge amount of work and exams\/grading is easy. But you are expected to read a lot and the text gets more and more difficult. Nabokov is awesome, and so is Professor Muravnik.",
    "Nabokov is a difficult author to read, especially in a non-native language, but Kostya does a fantastic job teaching. The readings are difficult to keep up with in Russian. The assessments, however, are pretty fair- a test and vocab quiz on each work, and weekly\/biweekly 1\/2 page-1 page reading responses. It was a little fast paced for me which was frustrating at times, but looking back I think I got a lot more out of it than I realized at the time.",
    "\"The more you love a memory, the stronger and stranger it is,\" but the trouble is that I'm not really sure whether I liked the class. I loved Nabokov's work before I took the class, and I love it even more now, but there was something intellectually cruel about this class. At every turn, Constantine would dazzle us with the intricacies of Nabokov's literary riddles, beautifully knotted narratives that he insisted we would only be able to unravel through dawdling delectation of the tomes. Yet he demanded that we race through the novels at breakneck speed, all but precluding any deep thoughts about the works. Had the class been twice as long, all of the books might have fit, but as it was, we barely scratched the surface of and . There's simply too much \"meat\" in each novel to give all four an adequate treatment in a single semester.",
    "This class focuses only on Nabokov's writings, starting with short stories and moving on to larger novels. There are frequent vocabulary proficiency exams, weekly reading responses, exams on every text, and a large take home as a final. I would definitely recommend this class to someone proficient in Russian looking to improve their understanding of literature, but would not recommend it to students who have trouble speaking or understanding Russian.",
    "Great class! The reading's are incredibly dense and challenging for non-native speakers (Nabokov's English prose is even difficult for most Americans), but Muravnik does a great job of leading the class through the material, exposing us to the intricacies of aesthetic philosophy. His insights are fascinating and provide a much richer context for understanding the various novels covered in the semester. He's also an incredibly kind and compassionate man who will go out of his way to make everyone feel comfortable contributing to classroom discussions that may seem daunting at first. Overall, This is a very rewarding class.",
    "Take it if you have to take it. The instructor is great - he really knows his Nabokov and explains things well. However, I do not think this class was particularly enjoyable. My Russian did not really improve at all. There is a threshold of the degree of difficulty, above which the material is so overwhelming that you don't actually end up processing any of the things you are exposed to. This class shot way over that threshold.",
    "This course is significantly more difficult than fourth-year Russian, but some semesters is the only class students learning in Russian can take. The course goes beyond just a reading and understanding of the texts themselves and includes a study of the theory of aesthetic and Nabokov's views on art. Despite the difficulty of the subject material, Professor Muravnik is wonderful and patient in guiding students through the course.",
    "This class was very interesting and Professor Muravnik was a very engaging, witty, and clear professor. It was very fast paced and had a lot of reading to do. It felt a tad rushed at times but overall I learned a lot and am very glad i took the course."
