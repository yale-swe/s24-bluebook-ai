    "This course provided a thematic rather than chronological overview of architectural history and theory in the 20th century. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would highly recommend the History of Art 739.",
    "Good introduction to canonical texts of 20th-century architectural theory.",
    "I would recommend the course, and summarize it as a compelling way of understanding how discourses of modern architecture were often formulated in response to larger epistemological transformations as well as transformations in material culture. For humanities students in general, the course is useful in asserting the inherently interdisciplinary and theoretical concerns of architectural history."

   "comments": [
    "This course was of a slightly different ilk in the sense that the content was largely at the periphery of a strictly art historical account. We did touch on art, and read texts by critics and theorists who are concerned with art, but for the most part it was up to us as thinkers and students to make those connections (not necessarily a bad thing). The course certainly helped deepen and extend my knowledge of architectural history, which I think is useful for me to apply to topics and issues that are more directly art historical.",
    "",
    "This course allowed me to see discourses of modern architecture in a new light, and to greater understand contemporary architectural historical scholarship, especially in terms of the discipline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns with epistemological transformations and their impact on architecture. By understanding how these transformations have impacted the discipline in the past I see clearly how architecture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impulse to instrumentalize its history is a theme, and a project which as often obscured by practitioners and historians alike."
