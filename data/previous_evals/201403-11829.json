    "I think I was probably one of the only science majors in ANTH 116taking it for the social science credit rather than a science credit. Keeping that in mind, I thought that overall the course was a nice introduction to Bio Anthro. To be honest, I stopped reading the textbook after only the first few weeks but kept up with the primary literature Watts posts as a supplement and this worked nicely. Watts isn't the most dynamic lecturer, but he's clear and concise.",
    "If you really like monkeys and evolution and biology, take it for an easyish science credit. However I found it a bit boring.",
    "This course wasn't as easy as I expected it to be. Work in section was easy, and besides the first one, the problem sets were too, but the midterm was challenging. Professor Watts is clearly extremely knowledgeable on the subject, but lectures were boring, especially in the beginning of the course when they were more bio-heavy.",
    "This class is a good introduction to biological anthropology. The lectures can be a little dry, but they got more interesting as the semester went on. The midterm is very reasonable, as are the problem sets (we only had 5 in the entire semester). Lab\/section is pretty enjoyable. It's a good science credit, and also good for fulfilling the anthropology major requirements.",
    "If you need a science credit, it's an easy one, but be warned, it's boring. The lectures seem to exist outside of time and drag on and on endlessly. At some point during the semester I just stopped going to lecture (still got a B on the midterm though so its possible).",
    "This class covers an interesting topic without being too difficult. It is a great combination of both science and social science, and I appreciated being able to take a course that involved biology even though I am not a science major. I would recommend this class because I learned a lot and really enjoyed the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone in three cases: (1) they need a not-so-hard science credit; (2) need a not-so-hard fifth science class to fulfill a major requirement; or (3) want to be a professional anthropologist. This course is not very hard. With good lecture attendance and ample studying for the midterm and final (which are both harder than you'd expect but not impossible by any stretch) you'll know the material well enough. The median grade on the midterm was within the expected range by Yale standards, probably a B+. With that said, this class can be incredibly boring. Professor Watts is an incredibly kind, sweet, knowledgable man (you can't complain that he doesn't know just about everything about anthropology forward and backward). But particularly the first half of the semester before the midterm, the material is very, very dry. The first half covers, essentially, pre-modern humans, and the second half covers the rise of modern humans. If you like learning about monkeys and primates, fossils, and Discovery Channel-esque readings, you'll enjoy this class. If not, take something else. It's one of those classes that'll be ostensibly so easy that you'll never attend lecture and only realize the week of the midterm and final that you are incredibly, incredibly behind. Also, \"lab\" is kind of a joke and not very helpful. Though the TAs are wonderful!",
    "ANTH 116 is basically the study of human evolution. If you want to take a soft science, this is for you. Be warned, though the class is very little work throughout the semester, the midterm and final are very very hard and expect you to remember LOTS of details about things mentioned in class. Make sure to study lecture slides and lab sheets thoroughly and you should be fine. Other than that this class is great.",
    "It's a good way to get your science credit. Just make sure you pick up a little bit of material each week so you don't have to cram super hard for the tests. Also, do the study guides that Dr. Watts sends out!!! They're super helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend ANTH 116 to another student looking for a very interesting and practical SC.",
    "Overall, the class covers a very interesting topic that of human evolution. Since the lecture is not the most engaging one out there, I do admit that some commitment is needed to succeed in the course; however, I would still recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to the field of anthropology. The course itself is not very hard: the reading is supplementary but not required, the midterm requires no more studying than any other midterm, PSETs are easy if you take good notes. Also, the labs\/sections are fun you get to look at bones and learn more about human fossils, evolution, and physiology. The only real con of this class, however, is the dullness of the lectures; everything else, though, is great.",
    "A broad overview of a variety of topics in the field of anthropology. Lecture material was clear, and professor and TAs were helpful. All the information are in the powerpoints.",
    "ANTH 116 is a good science credit for non-science majors. People interested in the humanities or social sciences might even find the information interesting, particularly the second half of the course, which discusses the development of modern human behavior and society. While it is not a gut, the material is generally accessible and the workload is not too heavy. The class is composed of two lectures a week (powerpoints are posted online; the material can be dry) and a lab weekly (which is mostly groupwork and allows you to ask questions to TAs). The midterm and the final both have a good deal of multiple choice questions on them and are not too difficult. Problem sets are roughly weekly, and though grading on them can seem somewhat arbitrary, they are pretty closely tied to each week's lectures. Sometimes the class can be more \"sciencey\" than expected, but overall it is geared towards people with only a pretty basic background in biology.",
    "This is a phenomenal introduction to biological anthropology! I took it in conjunction with a more theoretical anthropology class, so it was very interesting to see not only the vast diversity in the discipline, but also how two different strains of the same field articulate the same questions. Prof. Wattss lectures are extremely up-to-date, and provide the right mix of technical information about genetics etc., and more cultural knowledge about early human behaviors, etc. Sections are great, as you handle real artifacts and fossils and learn not only about the course material, but also get an understanding of the ways that scientific knowledge is produced and disseminated. Take the class! The one drawback is that labs and p-sets arent worth very much, so your grade depends on the midterm and the final, which are very in-depth. Study EVERYTHING (no matter how technical it seems) and youll be fine.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I took it to fulfill a social science requirement (I'm a MENG major), and it was a great choice: easy, interesting, and relatively science-y.",
    "If you need a science credit but you aren't a science person, this is for you. I'm not at all a science person, but this class hasn't given me any trouble. The day to day work amounts to none and the assessments are hard, but fair. If you pay attention in class and section and take notes, this class should be fine. Its basically all memorization and simple concepts. If you can't memorize easily, then this is going to be a bit harder for you. Also if you expect to sit through the lectures and text the whole time, then it will also be hard. Lectures are boring, but if you push through them it will be 100% worth it in the end. Basically, but in the effort during class and right before the exam, and this is an easily-earned A.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting science credit. The opportunity to handle actual human and primate remains in section is reason enough to take it. The exams aren't as hard as they're cracked up to be (they're mostly multiple choice, so not much of your fate is in your own hands anyway). Plus, with a few manageable p-sets thrown in, you can feel like you're not taking a completely gutty science credit.",
    "This is a really interesting class content-wise. Not much work, but I definitely suggest going to class.",
    "I took this course to fulfill a science credit - as many people do - and so I'm not sure how much of all this is applicable to the experience generally. That said, the course is certainly very interesting when it comes to the material and provides a welcome chance to look at people from a scientific angle. Certainly, it seems like a stimulating and engaging way to get a science credit if that's what you're looking for.",
    "OK so personally, I really enjoyed this class. INCREDIBLY simple PSETS. Just a midterm and a final you have to study a bunch for, but don't we always. Yes, the lectures are oftentimes dull. But the subject matter, in my opinion, is fascinating! It's our human ORIGINS! And it's so amazing to see the progression from primate to homo sapien, and study just what it is that makes us truly human. It really taught me so much - I quote the things I learned constantly - would recommend if this stuff interests you and you can put up with not-the-best lectures\/not going to class all the time. (the powerpoint has essentially all the info you need to do well on midterm\/final!)",
    "A manageable science for the nonsciency, but not so interesting",
    "Take it. -lectures can be a bit boring (and they're 75 minutes). -labs are painless, just show up -exams are difficult as you literally have to commit everything in the powerpoints to memory, but it's possible to do alright if you study a lot I can't imagine a more painless\/interesting science credit. I am so glad I took this course.",
    "Would if you want a science credit.",
    "I would recommend it so long as one is willing to learn a lot about non-human primate evolution. The class is a good introduction for one interested in anthropology and also wants to look at skeletons in a lab setting.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit. It could also be an easy fifth class."
