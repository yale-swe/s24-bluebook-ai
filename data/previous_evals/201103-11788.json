   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class to students who are pretty astute at picking up languages, or at least have a very good command of English grammar\/ another romance language. You also need to actually do the work and take the course seriously (that means showing up everyday-- of course there\u0092s room for a few sick days). In the end, it\u0092s very rewarding to see how far you\u0092ve come.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn French fast and have the time to put into an intro language. It is extremely fast paced, and the French in Action video method takes a little while to get into the groove, but you learn an incredible amount in a very short period. Its an incredibly worthwhile experience.",
    "If you really enjoy speaking French, it's not a hard class, since you gain a lot from practicing French casually with friends. The classes aren't hard to wake up for, since they're usually energetic and fun. It is a lot of chapters per week, but as long as you keep up with the grammar--especially during the first 2\/3 of the class--you won't have any problems.",
    "The Capretz method is a great way to learn French. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. There is really no other way to learn a language well except for intensively. This is a gem of a class!",
    "It would be very very very fast. You must like it to have the strength to work that hard to be able to keep up with the homework.",
    "French 125 is intensive, as promises the title of the class. However, your hard work DOES pay off at the end of the semester. I am really surprised I have come in only a few months. I would recommend this course to any one who is serious about learning French.",
    "Great way to pick up entry level language. much better pace than the standard pace that takes a year to get though the FIA series. Highly recommend!"
