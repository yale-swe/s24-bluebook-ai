    "Good teaching and rationale for learning Italian",
    "Very engaging and culture aspects were always interesting. I think a little more emphasis on listening could be helpful. I felt that was my weakness but that may have just been me.",
    "Strengths: Teresa is a good instructor, we have many opportunities to practice speaking; Weaknesses: we had verbal exercises to practice our grammar, but they were not as effective as the spoken exercises",
    "The course structure was very good except that the quizzes seemed to be right after one another and we didn't have enough time to review.",
    "I thought this course was run very well!",
    "Solidifying what has been learned in L1 Italian. There is a good amount of difficult grammar to learn in L2, but the instructors understand this. Everything in the course was well-facilitated. No weaknesses to report."

    "You probably have to take this course, but all of the Italian instructors are very dedicated to teaching and offering extra help, so it is taught well.",
    "Yes, definitely. I loved learning the language and the class was very fun!",
    "I would really recommend Italian.",
    "Absolutely. I would highly recommend taking the Italian language at Yale, even (and especially) without any other experience.",
    "Yes. Italian is a wonderful language with wonderful professors."
