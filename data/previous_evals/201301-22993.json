    "This is an excellent class for learning climate history and understanding the methodology of climate research. This class gives you the background to engage in conversations about climate change - a very relevant topic for today - from a more scientific and nuanced perspective.",
    "Seminar covering history of the earth's climate from the beginning to the present. There isn't coursework per se except for preparing for seminar and knowing what you're talking about. Twice (or three times) in the semester you need to be the presenter for an entire class meeting which requires a lot of preparation, but the material is interesting and the seminar environment is supportive if the presenter needs help explaining a concept. Highly recommended if you're interested in paleoclimates, perhaps not ideal for someone with little knowledge of or interest in climate science.",
    "This course ROCKED*. It was an excellent overview of earth's entire climate history; and let me tell you, there is something really oool about learning ALL of something so fundamental, and so large-scale, compared to so much of what we learn in college. Also, we spent a lot of time examining the actual DATA in papers we read, which was really rewarding- the course taught a lot about how SCIENCE should be conducted, not just about climates. Finally, it was very cool to gain an appreciation for how earth's climate operates in general, and to learn a new perspective on current climate issues.Mark Pagani was totally the man, also; he was great at explaining very complex topics to people of all backgrounds, and introduced really interesting topics of discussion to the seminar.Your grade is based on two presentations (1.5 hours long each) about periods in earth's climate history based on primary srouces. This is way elss stressful than it sounds, because Mark Pagani is ON YOUR SIDE and will step in to help you if necessary.TAKE THIS COURSE! I also spent the entire semester writing down funny quotes, and there were A LOT.*haha, get it?"
