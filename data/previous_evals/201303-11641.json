    "Very interesting and Mark is a pretty great lecturer. Probably my favorite geology course that I've taken. That being said, it's a pretty good amount of work and the tests border on the impossible. (That being said, at least this year, we all did about equally badly so our grades shouldn't take too bad a hit.)",
    "This class was definitely challenging. If you need or want to learn about geochemistry it is a great course. You learn a lot of equations and methods to solve problems involving geological settings. The psets are hard, but you learn from them. This is a lot of work. If you take it, actually reading the textbook helps.",
    "Expect to be challenged in this class if you don't have a background in geochemistry. This class goes far beyond basic college chemistry, and the concepts require a lot of thinking and practice outside of lecture. However, if you put in the work and use the TA as a resource, this class canbe very rewarding and show you the potential of geochemistry to a wide variety of issues in geology.",
    "Mark is hilarious and easy to talk to. I think he is at once very approachable and very intimidating. Once I got to know him better I understood his personality and could communicate with him. I like his teaching style and it made the class environment pretty calm and easy-going, just like he is. He is a good teacher but he moves quickly through the material so if you don't understand something you really have to not be afraid to speak up and ask questions. The tests were always a bit up in the air, we didn't totally know what to study for them but in the end Mark was fair with them and graded fairly too. I would recommend this class if you have an interest in the material! I learned a lot and liked it because I found it interesting, but if you don't, it's not going to be a fun class for you.",
    "Be wary of this class if you're chemistry skills aren't on point - it had been a couple of years since I'd dealt with the subject, and the first half of the class was tough. That being said, Pagani makes geochemistry almost unreasonably interesting. The class is pretty laid-back, but notes can sometimes be difficult to keep up with due to the lack of structure. A must take if you're a G&G major or interested in chemistry applications."
