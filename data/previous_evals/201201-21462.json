    "This class is wonderful! Professor Darnell is so smart and knows everything that you could possibly want to know about Egyptian Religion. You cover a lot of topics in great detail, and you feel like you have really accomplished a lot by the end of the semester. Also, you get to see the magicalgems collection in SML! The work isn't bad -- three essays (~8-10 pages each) and two in-class exams (lots of writing!). The reading can be a bit bulky at times, especially when it is confusing or very esoteric, but class and section help to debunk the mystery of the texts. Overall this is a wonderful class and I would absolutely recommend taking it!",
    "Take this class! Professor Darnell is fantastic, the papers are really interesting, and I'm so glad that I took this course. I didn't expect to love it, but it ended up being my favorite class all semester. We got to look at magical gems in SML, and studied love poetry and thought about Akhenaten! It was so much better than I ever thought it would be. Take this class!",
    "Interesting. You should take it, it gives you an insight into ancient religion and world philosophy.",
    "I'm pretty sure John Darnell thinks it's still 1925, but I mean this in a good way. This class is a great introduction to Ancient Egyptian religion, but might feel less disjointed if you already know some detail about ancient Egyptian history. Lectures can be all over the place, the papers are fun to write.",
    "Take this class if you are interest in Egypt, ancient civilizations, religion, history, art history, etc. This class is a great introduction to studying ancient Egypt. This class has a bit more assignments than your average lecture class, but these assignments are super interesting and really help you engage with thematerial present in lecture.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking, as the material is fascinating and the presentation is engaging. I strongly recommend it if you are at all interested in Ancient Egypt. It definitely requires some work though, and doing the readings is very important if you want to do well on the tests.",
    "I would recommend this course is you are at all interested in Egypt. Although it is based on Egyptian religion, the class focuses on other aspects of society as well which provides a nice overview.",
    "I would definitely recommend NELC 112 to another student, so long as they're willing to do a lot of (very interesting!) reading.",
    "This is a great class if you're willing to put in the work. The readings are fairly extensive and the lectures somewhat dense, but that's what makes this class so valuable. You'll walk away with an incredible amount of information and a deep understanding of the development of Egyptian religion. You're expected to know a large amount of information, what is said in lecture is not always re-enforced in the readings and readings are rarely addressed in class. However, the TA is very helpful in specifying what information you are responsible for knowing. Take this class if you have any interest in Egyptian religion or the development of religious ideas. Professor Darnell's passion for the subject is infectious and makes the class an exciting one to take.",
    "Absolutely--take this class. Professor Darnell is great and the material is fascinating."
