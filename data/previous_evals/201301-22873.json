    "This course is a survey of political thought from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. I would highly recommend it!!",
    "Definitely take Directed Studies- you will regret it if you don't! If you want a pretty easy time and pretty easy section, then take it with Professor Mantena but personally I did not have a rewarding or fulfilling time with her and never looked forward to her section, so try to take it with another Professor!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, especially if they have an interest in politics. This class is not only interesting in a historical sense of learning about past thinkers, but it also explains the sources of a lot of present-day political ideas.",
    "DS Spring H&P is absolutely incredible. Yes, the readings are long and at times hard, but nearly every one of them is incredible -- my biggest regret is not finishing nearly as many as I would have liked. Professor Mantena is an amazing person to have as your spring H&P professor. Unlike some of the others that teach this class, she is an actual political theorist, and works\/has worked with nearly all of the works you'll read. She does tend to steer the discussion, but in general her comments are insightful and have greatly helped enhance my understanding of the material. Her feedback on papers is great and will really challenge\/push you -- if you have any questions about it, meet with her during office hours.",
    "Some of the works in this course are priceless - Karl Marx and Hannah Arendt's works are both very interesting. Arendt particularly changes the way you think about modernity. But I found this class very slow and somewhat superficial. In other words, we covered the important themes but I understood about the same amount as when I finished reading.",
    "H&P is probably the DS class that changes the most at the turn of the semester. It's definitely more Political Thought than History, but that can be a good thing.",
    "An overview of the most important political thought of modern European history from Machiavelli on. An introduction to political theory and to the major historical events of modern European history."
