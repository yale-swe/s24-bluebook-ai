   "comments": [
    "Take this class. It's not too hard, not too much work (125-word reading responses each week as well as a 12-14 page final paper), and the military stuff at the end is really interesting.",
    "Absolutely recommended, for one reason in particular. This class offers a unique opportunity to work with an officer in the military and write your final essay about their work\/experiences\/etc., and that's not an opportunity that is common at Yale. The class description does sound theory-heavy, and there is a decent amount of that early on, but the second half really picks up with counterinsurgency and other military topics, which makes for a very enjoyable seminar. If you're interested in any sort of military discussion, or a practical exploration of the U.S. military's current work, there is no better course to take.",
    "I would recommend this class if and only if the syllabus fits your interest.",
    "Professor Fotos is unique because he is passionate about his subject AND his students. He's great to work with and makes this course worthwhile.",
    "The class is interesting and thought-provoking, but at times it felt slow and like it lacked direction. Class discussions were sometimes pretty empty because not everyone did all of the reading... or even part of the reading. Nonetheless I think it was an interesting class and worth taking if you like liberty in your assignments. (The final paper for our class was about anything you were interested in.)",
    "If you are interested in political science this class is an absolute must take, even if you are not planning on majoring in the subject."
