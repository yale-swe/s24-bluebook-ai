    "This was a great option for an English class. The papers were generally interesting, and writing about food gives you a chance to use a familiar subject and thus improve your actual writing, since it is important to craft pieces that can be taken seriously as writing. The grading is very fair and fairly kind. That said, the course felt a bit disorganized and Essays 1, 3, and 4 felt like they were the same thing. But it was a good experience.",
    "An amazing class, especially after English 121. The basics: four essays and one class project with a short paper and powerpoint. At first I didn't want to sign up for a 9am class that wasn't required, but I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID! Writing about larger issues through the lens of food--something that's a huge part of everyone's lives, whether in presence or absence--really challenged myself as a writer. I have improved as a writer so much. If you have any sort of interest in food and enjoy writing, this is a great course to take. Professor Stuart is also great once you get to know her; don't be put off by her sometimes seemingly standoffish demeanor. Additionally, the readings are awesome! I would do them as a treat in between other work.",
    "For those who want to learn how to write about food, this class is not for you.The essays of this class consist of a narrative essay, a recipe essay, a memoir, and a cookbook essay (which is supposedly not an intensive research paper, but is). It's basically just writing about life or a cookbook, with a lot of food references thrown in. The writing is focused on writing a story that mentions food, without much focus on how to write about the aesthetics of food itself. It's not a class to learn how to be a food critic, or a restaurant reviewer.The movies and readings are great, but they're only mentioned briefly in class...so skimming becomes the main tool of the course.Professor Stuart is nice, but she is biased. It was clear from the beginning of the class that she already knew what students would get which grades. We realized that there was no real room for improvement in her class, as we would end up getting the similar grade trend no matter how much extra time and effort we put into our writing.If you do not like the first grade you receive, drop the class. There is little room for improvement. She does not give helpful feedback in improving papers, but rather offers vague comments on drafts.The readings can be a lot to handle, especially when they're uploaded the night before they're due. By the end of the semester, we mostly skimmed the readings.There are weekly blog activities due, so make sure to keep up with food posts and workshop assignments.",
    "Writing about food was so much more than it appeared. Thinking I'd only be writing pieces concerning my favorite meals and restaurants, I was happily surprised when we delved into subjects like food ethics and domestic manuals from earlier centuries. At the end of the day, we covered so much more than the superficial.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you're looking for a manageable WR credit and you enjoy food. Fingers crossed that it's not in the morning though, as I know I could get more hungry during the middle of the day.",
    "You readawesome food writing, write 4 fun short papers, and meet twice a week in a seminar form and discuss the writing, the papers, and other great foodie stuff.",
    "If you need a writing credit and think about food a lot, this is a good class for you. The workload is manageable, you get a lot of help and feedback on your essays, and the subject matter is a lot of fun. Don't go into it expecting an intellectual revelation about the world or literature, but it's still a fun class.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course, and recommend it to any student interested in food writing or the history of food. The course challenges you to look at food in a variety of perspectives (social, cultural, political, historical) and I found most of the readings to be engaging. Despite the fact the class is about food, which seems like a \"fluff\" subject, the grading isn't that lenient and you are expected to produce substantive, meaningful writing.",
    "This was a really enjoyable English class - this coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of English or writing! Professor Stuart is great, and who doesn't like talking about (and eating!) great food. None of the work is overwhelming, and most of the readings and essays are actually really enjoyable. I never thought I'd say this, but I had fun writing the essays for class! There are 4, all 4-5 pages - 3 are personal, and 1 is an analysis of a cookbook from Beinecke. I suggest going to Professor Stuart for what she wants you to work on between your draft and final! Overall, a fun class that helps improve your writing!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who has an interest in developing their personal writing or a strong interest in learning what food writing is really all about.",
    "The readings in this class are wonderful, andmany of them will leave you hungry for food. However, you will also be surprised by food writing that manages to tug at your heart, and not just your stomach.The assignments are less inspired: a \"family foodways\" essay, a recipe essay, a cookbook essay, and a food memoir. There's also a food blog, which unfortunately is relegated to a very minor role in the class, so you get to do less eating and writing about what you eat than you might like.Perhaps most importantly, if you're hoping to learn something about restaurant\/food criticism, the course as it currently stands isn't for you, as there's not much more focus on general writing strategies than on strategies of food-specific writing. If you consider yourself in any way a foodie, you'll probably be disappointed by some of your classmates' lack of appreciation for the subtle colors, flavors, and textures of food.Prof. Stuart is a sweetheart, so definitely make time to meet with her during office hours; I found them to be more productive than the student-led workshops we did in class.",
    "YES! First of all, it's a class all about food -- you read about food, write about food, cook food, try new foods in class and in restaurants, etc. I also feel like a evolved as a writer because of Professor Stuart's helpful comments. And did I mention the whole class is writing about food?!",
    "Yes! Make sure you will enjoy reading about food though."
