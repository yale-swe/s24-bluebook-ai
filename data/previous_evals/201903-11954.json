   "comments": [
    "I wrote a whole play. It's kind of a crazy thing to walk away from a class with a full play and I am very grateful for that. I learned more about my writing by listening to the other people in the class and hearing how their work developed.",
    "I learned so much about playwriting and letting the play write itself.",
    "Playwriting\/general creative writing techniques and strategies. A lot of writing practice, world building\/character building work.",
    "I became a much better writer overall and learned how to go into a writing project without quite knowing where it's going. I improved my ability to turn autobiography into fiction, and gained a greater understanding of how the theatre provides a base for a different kind of literature.",
    "how to not be constrained by traditional rules of playwriting, stepping into the scary space of listening to the inner playwright, giving myself permission to wrtie.",
    "I learned that language fails us all the time, and that is why we love it in the theater. I learned that all great plays point to silence. I learned that we belong to each other, and that we have nothing but ourselves from which to work. I learned that I don't have to invent, I just have to see. I learned so many things in this course! I could go on and on and quote all of Deb's endless wisdom, but really, I learned to love playwriting, and I remembered why I believe in writing and theater and art in the first place.",
    "Amazing insight into the process of discovering a play as you write it practice in the skill of automatic writing an increased level of comfort with uncertainty in the creative process and finding ones way.",
    "I learned how to write a play by tuning into my inner voice."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It doesn't have much structure. I wish there had been some more deadlines so we would have built up the full-length pieces we were writing. It kind of felt like I wrote it in bursts, instead of as a gradual process.",
    "I have no problems with this course. I only wish we could have it more days a week so I could see Deb more often.",
    "Amazing class! Excellent introduction to playwriting. Not super structured, but it works for the class\/Deb.",
    "This is by leaps and bounds my favorite course Ive ever taken at Yale. Deb Margolin is above the law. If you have the opportunity to take this course, DO IT. Thank me later.",
    "The way the class was led was incredibly conducive to developing my understanding of playwriting, and I feel that I know a lot more about what it takes to write a play than before this class. In terms of improvement, my only request is that I wish the professor was a bit more upfront with feedback, because I wanted to know what exact aspects of my play needed more improvement.",
    "It can be both frustrating and freeing to have little structure to how a play should be written. I personally struggled a bit with this in the beginning, but really appreciate it by the end. It is difficult to say what can be be improved because it is such a unique process. I just encourage Deb to continue what she was doing before with the automatic writings, fill-in-the-banks, and class plays. I really appreciated being pushed to share scenes with the rest of the class as that can be a really vulnerable thing to do.",
    "strengths: you write a whole play in one semester!! weaknesses: you write A WHOLE PLAY in one semester!!! really though, the simultaneous strength and weakness of this course is that it is both incredibly exciting and incredibly challenging to write a work of this scale in so short a time.",
    "A wonderful writing community. Gets you comfortable writing without a full plan and excited to discover how your play evolves.",
    "Our in-class fill-in-the-blanks guided me throughout my writing process."

    "Yes! Deb is fantastic and it's a great way to generate work. But, you get out what you put in. Only take this if you are genuinely interested in playwriting.",
    "You would be a fool to not try and take this course.",
    "Absolutely! If youre interested in Playwriting its a great introduction to the medium and Deb is a fantastic Professor.",
    "YES YES YES this course literally changed my life no exaggeration.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was incredibly fun and incredibly educational, and Deb has tons of interesting thoughts and insights about theatre and writing that have made me a much more thoughtful writer. I really did love this class, and think anybody could have a really fruitful experience taking the course.",
    "Yes, even if you don't consider yourself a playwright. Deb will help you find the play that you need to write, and you'll be part of a supportive and dynamic community that she creates.",
    "Absolutely. The process of creating a story and creating characters is somewhat magical and Deb is a great professor to walk that journey with.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes an absolutely amazing course. Would recommend to anyone interested in playwriting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student!!!"
