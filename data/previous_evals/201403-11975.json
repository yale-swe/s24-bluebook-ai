   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course. It is well-rounded and thorough in its curriculum without suffocating the learning process. You will learn about the Earth and beyond in a past-present-future scheme, which frames our duty as humans and stewards of the Earth quite well. At the very least, take this course as a provocative and possibly-career inspiring opportunity.",
    "ASTR 130 is my favorite course. I enjoyed the entire semester and learned a ton about the universe. A lot of interesting points are presented, and the whole class is very enjoyable. Professor Fischer is the nicest Professor I've had the pleasure to have, and she is always extremely excited about what she is teaching. You should definitely take this class if you are interested in space and you're looking for a science credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend that you take ASTR 130. Professor Fischer is incredibly accomplished and is a wonderful instructor. Her passion for the material is palpable and her enthusiasm is contagious. The course does a fantastic job of tying biology, geology, and astronomy together. Accordingly, you'll learn about the origin of life and the potential for life on other planets from a few different but complementary perspectives. The workload is very reasonable and the tests are fair. The night at the observatory and planetarium is also a lot of fun.",
    "I don't recommend this course to anyone looking for an easy science. The problem sets contain a lot of difficult problems that aren't covered in the lecture or the textbook, so section attendance is pretty much essential. The lectures are on interesting topics, but are not exactly riveting. The tests are also not easy.",
    "ASTR 130 is an excellent Sc credit--lectures are pleasant and engaging, plenty of help is offered on the problem sets, and exams are straightforward. Debra Fischer is an inspiring scientist and a lovely person. You'll feel like you learned something profound and important, but without much stress. Highly recommended for non science majors!",
    "Take this class, and definitely go on the field trip if it's still offered! The course isn't much work, especially if you're a science major, and the trip is FANTASTIC.",
    "This class is the perfect way to understand a host of issues surrounding the search for life in the Universe (It exists; I promise you) and their applicability to our situation here on Earth. The grading is straightforward; it's easy to get an A if you do the work. There is no curve; it's based off pure points like in middle or high school.",
    "If you're taking a science credit just to take a science credit, this is a good one both in not being too hard and in not feeling like a gut.",
    "Astro 130 is a great class. I gained a good basic understanding of the universe through the lens of the search for life. Professor Fischer's enthusiasm is infectious and I am now considering continuing my study of astronomy. The field trip to the Canary Islands was amazing. I would definitely recommend this class if you are curious about where we come from and what else is out there.",
    "If you're looking for an intro to astronomy, especially focused on more theoretical\/philosophical possibilities for ET life, this is the class for you. It isn't always a gut though, and some of the psets required a lot more math than I was expecting.",
    "ASTR 130 is a class structured in a great way. It pulls in information related to how life evolved on Earth, how we search for life on other planets, and what the future of life on Earth is. The final was really interesting to take and study for. There were questions related to each term of the Drake equation and then we estimated numbers for each parameter, culminating on our overall esteems for the number of communicating civilizations elsewhere. This is a great science credit for non-science majors because it doesn't just sink into a specific aspect of field of science, but rather draws in many parts of science (we did chemistry and physics alongside astronomy) to cover the idea of life in the universe. Weekly homework's (that take about an hour or two), two midterms, a three page paper, an optional trip to the Canary Islands over fall break, and a final. Tons of help when needed and a passionate professor. Take it if you want an interesting SC credit!",
    "You learn the craziest things in this class, like how people are currently exploring for other earth-like planets. Astronomy is truly a humbling field of study, and the fact that evidence is building that life exists (or has once existed) on other planets and in other solar systems really puts everything in perspective! Take this course!! It is my favorite class I have taken at Yale, and I am a political science major.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, as it provided the necessary overview of principles of astronomy while delving into problems with less certain answers, exploring the universe as a whole and appreciating the simultaneous rarity and commonality of Earth. I learned a great deal about both astronomy and biology and deeply enjoyed the intersection between the two.",
    "ASTR 130 is a great class for anyone looking for a first course in astronomy, to fill a science credit, or just for an interesting 5th credit. Professor Fischer is great and really cares about making the material understandable and engaging.",
    "Good science class both for non-stem people and for stem-people looking for an easy and interesting credit. Field trip!",
    "It's a science class for people who are genuinely interested in astronomy. Though it's not particularly scientific or difficult--I suspect it's easy for more science minded people--it is still a lot of information to process. It's probably a gut, but I found it a little bit hard. That said, I don't imagine it gets much easier. I would recommend it to someone who wants to know about extraterrestrial life. In retrospect, I learned a lot.",
    "ASTR 130 is the perfect science credit. It's not difficult, but it's pretty interesting. There was an almost-all-expenses-paid trip to the Canary Islands over Fall Break (smoking hookah with TFs for credit, anyone?). Professor Fischer is a charming professor and a wonderful human being, not to mention overqualified for the course and one of the most important astronomers in her field. Plus it's in LC, for all the english majors out there.",
    "This class is basically an introduction to astronomy with quite a bit of basic biology, geology, and chemistry. It is very interesting and I learned a lot about astronomy. Professor Fischer is the best - by far. She is so excited about everything in the class that it makes it really enjoyable just to be in class. I would recommend this to everyone.",
    "An introduction to the burgeoning field of astrobiology, i.e. the study of potential life on other planets, this class centers on: -how life on Earth came to be (Big Bang, formation of the solar system, early biochemistry and evolution) -how we can find life elsewhere (possible life elsewhere in the Solar System, discovering distant Earth-like planets) -what will happen to life in the future (possible other alien civilization, cliimate change, fate of the Earth and the Universe). This class is perfect, perfect, PERFECT for non-science majors looking for a class that is not \"easy\" per se, but that rewards hard work and thoughtful preparation, especially if you have an interest in the material. Even if you only remember the most cursory details of biology, physics, and chemistry from earlier science courses, Profs. Fischer and Robinson will review that material before delving into any details. Most importantly, the questions the class discusses (how did life first come into existence? Does life exist on other planets? Why haven't we contacted aliens? Will we humans destroy ourselves before ever finding another intelligent specices?) are both scientific and philosophical, and should be engaging to anyone with a serious interest in placing themselves in a cosmological context, and figuring out how we got to where we are as a species, and where we might go from here. Recommended 100%.",
    "A great SC or fifth credit. It has a moderate workload but very interesting material if you're into science and extraterrestrial life. Professor Fischer is fun to listen to. Not very quantitative.",
    "Good class. You learn alot about the universe and the origins of life both on earth and possibilities elsewhere. Not a gut.",
    "I would summarize as a fun and rich course in science, good for science and non-science majors. I would recommend to any student because it is a very good start on science."
