   "comments": [
    "I would encourage a fellow student to take the course: It offers a detailed background in Spanish grammar, focussed more on conceptual questions than on mechanical conjugation exercises.",
    "SPAN 243 is rigorous, challenging, nuanced, and a lot of homework. However, it is manageable, and you will definitely see major improvement in both your grade as well as in your knowledge of the Spanish language. If you put the work in you will see real results.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you really wanted to polish your Spanish skills, especially if you have some interest in potentially translating someday.",
    "Spanish Grammar is exactly what it sounds like. You do a lot of grammar work! The material may be difficult but Terry makes it easy to understand (and all of the information can be found clearly stated in the book). The class does have a lot of homework but if you work hard you will do well. Although it is not a speaking class you do speak in spanish each class period and it does help.",
    "This is a good course for advanced Spanish speakers to to brush up on\/polish up your grammar skills, or finally understand those grammar nuances you kind of faked your way through in lower level courses. I would recommend this class to students who fit the above description, but not for those who are looking to improve their conversation skills. This class is definitely focused on writing skills only.",
    "This is not an easy class. I took this course because I wanted to speak Spanish more professionally but I did not learn much. I would highly recommend NOT taking this course. It was a lot of busy work to do daily and not very enjoyable."
