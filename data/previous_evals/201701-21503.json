    "Overview of different types of diplomacy, case studies of cultural diplomacy from 15th century to the present, analysis of the effectiveness of different diplomatic methods, very good introduction to writing college level research papers.",
    "I learned how music has been used over the course of history to push agendas and movements between countries. Additionally, I learned the different definitions that encompass diplomacy and what each means for the actors involved."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is great! We have a lot of guest speakers who offer awesome insights!",
    "Sometimes the discussions seemed a little disjointed because of all the guest speakers. I had trouble drawing to conclusions. That being said, most of the material was interesting and Prof Ahrendt was always engaged and the discussions were lively and rarely boring.",
    "This is a really interesting course. You have to figure out which of the readings to do and which to skim, but it's pretty low workload and also fascinating.",
    "Strengths: extremely interesting subject matter, great use of guest speakers, seminar style facilitated interesting conversation, reasonable workload. Weaknesses: some readings were more engaging than others, classes jumped from being all about music to all about diplomacy (I was interested in both independently so this was not an issue for me, but could be if one was more interested in the intersection between the two subjects). Overall, a very strong, engaging freshman seminar.",
    "The seminar definitely benefited from the interesting course material but also from the discussions being led by the students with the guidance of the professor. Perhaps the use of different media could improve the engagement of students.",
    "The course structure relied primarily on summarizing and analyzing the readings in class. While this allowed me to learn a lot about music and diplomatic history over the centuries, it limited the amount of critical engagement and theoretical application to be done. Many thematic elements were brought up in each week's readings, and at times it felt like these threads were lost from week to week as we discussed different parts of history. Greater connection between common themes shared throughout the periods we covered would help make the course feel more applicable to modern environments. The course could have included greater acknowledgement and temperance of the gravity of its claims about the role of music in international relations."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Only take this course if you are interested in the INTERSECTION of music and diplomacy (not merely music and diplomacy). Music and diplomacy is a very very specific field and this course would be amazing to someone who is interested in this specific field.",
    "Yes - if you are interested in the material",
    "I'd recommend the class to anybody interested in music.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Since Professor Ahrendt is leaving after the 2016-2017 academic year, this course will unfortunately not be offered next year. Based on this information, I would use my experience with this class to recommend to freshman that they enroll in freshman seminars. They are a great way to get the seminar experience without having to apply to upper-level seminars, meet other freshman, and engage in insightful conversations.",
    "The course was definitely eye-opening in regards to what the states of the world are doing that isn't necessarily presented in the media daily. The course showed the importance of music in creating policy change as well as collaboration between countries.",
    "If you are looking for an interesting music history course that ties music and international affairs together throughout hundreds of years of history, you should take Music and Diplomacy. At times the class felt more like a review of historical events involving music and diplomacy than a critical analysis of them, but all in all it was a good course. Be prepared for a significant amount of reading each week, discussion of which constitutes the majority of class time."
