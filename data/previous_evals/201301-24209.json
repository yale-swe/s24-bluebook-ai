   "comments": [
    "This class took much time outside of class. There were too many assignments apart from our main group project. We had 2 five hour classes which were stressful.",
    "A LOT OF WORK! SHOULD BE MORE THAN ONE CREDIT!Strengths: team building skills, practical public health skillsWeaknesses: a lot of work, somewhat unorganized projects, assignments due almost every class, in class assessments, two 5 hour classes",
    "It's very helpful to have this practicum experience during my first year of my MPH (before summer internship). The project allowed me to integrate learned classroom skills from my other courses into a real project for a real organization for a real community.Class time seemed a little drawn out at times, not always helpful. A lot of the teamwork material is stuff that graduate level students should already know and have experience with.For me, the most beneficial part of the course was the project. However, I do expect that the benefits of the classroom portion of the course will become more apparent with time.",
    "I think the biggest strength of the course is providing students an opportunity to build upon skills learned in the classroom in a real-world situation. I think the selection of projects was quite good, and with a broad enough range to interest students from different areas of interest.I do think that the biggest challenge is helping students to not spend the last two weeks scrambling to finish projects. It's difficult to juggle a pretty large workload in this class with final projects from other courses.",
    "should be spread over two semesters or be more than 1 credit. I put SO MUCH time into it.",
    "The course has a lot of class time itself and takes up a lot more outside class time. The structure of the course could change so that there is more class time devoted to group projects - could cut out the PSAs",
    "This is a great opportunity to get practical experience and work with a group.",
    "Very good experience. At times very work intensive. Very good to work in the community.",
    "I am really glad that I took this course, I learned a ton from the real-world nature of the community based participatory research that my group completed. With our limited time frame, there was a lot of work for the project both at the beginning of the semester (IRB approval, budget, preceptor meetings, defining group tasks, creating a logic model etc) and at the end of the semester (data collection, data analysis, writing our final report, and presenting our findings). I feel that I gained the most skills during the final few weeks of the course once we had to synthesize all of the tools we had learned throughout the semester and our findings to generate a report.",
    "The projects themselves can be very engaging but the class often fails to enrich of assist the projects in a meaningful way. Much of the time is spent on fairly rudimentary lessons on team dynamic which feel unnecessary.",
    "The classes were lively and interactive. There were a lot of good discussions among students. It may have been better if it touched on building more concrete skill sets",
    "Good class for those out of undergrad"

The workload and skills gained from this course definitely came in spurts and I felt like it wasn't until the very end of the course that I really appreciated how much we had learned. I am definitely glad I took the course and would highly recommend it to anyone considering taking it.",
