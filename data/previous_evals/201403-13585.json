    "Probably my favorite class so far, through 5 semesters. Very little work with very high reward\/learning. Toshi is an amazing teacher. He's able to convey nuances (that I never knew existed in conducting) to a class of beginners in a way that few teachers ever could. If you're looking for a 5th class, want to learn a lot, and have even the slightest interest in music\/orchestra\/conducting, you have to take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "Take it if you want a rudimentary overview of the basic technique of conducting, with some practice before the ad-hoc class ensemble. Don't take it if you're already very experienced in conducting and\/or have another regular ensemble on campus to work with--unless you're taking it to get to know Toshi, in which case it could be worth it. Workload is extremely light, especially if you don't take practicing conducting on your own time seriously. Do make sure you actually prepare\/score-study before conducting the class ensemble, though, if not for the sake of your grade, then for the sake of the musicians playing in the ensemble.",
    "I would definitely recommend music 323, it is a fantastic introduction to conducting and it is extremely fun and interesting!",
    "A great course to take if you want to learn more about conducting.",
    "If you are looking for the most chill introduction to conducting this is the perfect class. Toshi is actually so smart and such a good conductor and I do think you learn things - and if you have the time to put in, you can get a lot out of practicing all the pieces we do. If you're looking for a more structured course, I would recommend Jeffrey Douma's choral conducting course (I was unable to take it so that's how I ended up taking Toshi) - but I still think this class is the best, and such fun if you have a good group. It is so chill and so comfy."
