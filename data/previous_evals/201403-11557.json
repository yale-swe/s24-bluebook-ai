   "comments": [
    "The lecture is simply boring. Both the professor's tone and his organization of class topics do not have any emphasis. It's impossible to focus in class.",
    "Did not take the class",
    "The problem sets were sometimes more work than really necessary to teach us the relevant skills, especially when they required searching for a lot of data online. That said, I thought the problem sets were generally useful, particularly because (as a non-FES or SOM student) I don't often take classes that require problem sets. So it was good for keeping my quantitative skills sharp.",
    "Arnulf is old school. While the first part of the class is rough because there is a lot of hand holding for those who need to catch up on basic concepts, he sets clear expectations, tells the students what is expected of them, and - though he may act like a tough guy who doesn't care - goes the extra mile to make sure that they are learning.",
    "Question 8: Explanations of the Material There was a sever mismatch between the material taught in class (largely high-level, macro, theoretical) and the detailed, nuanced material found in the problem sets. It would have been incredibly useful for everyone's learning if these two aspects of the course were more closely aligned.",
    "Arnulf's lectures amount to mostly rambling, and are not where I learned from the course. The readings are useful, but you can do that on your own.",
    "This is a fantastic, yet challenging class.",
    "- Professor truly cares about the material, which was great - Breadth of material covered meant little depth on many issues - Tone of class could be more inclusive - Hype around the difficulty of the exams, the grade-ranking, etc. is unnecessary - Way too time-consuming",
    "Question 4: The class might have been a bit too fast because it covers a lot of material, but it was worthy.",
    "This is an extremely important class and is currently being taught in a terrible fashion. Professor Grubler is clearly very smart and passionate with regards to this material, but his methods for conveying knowledge are illogical. The lectures are disjointed and don't flow from one class to another. It's never clear what students are supposed to be learning, the problem sets are largely busy work and not actual analysis, and the same goes for the exams."

    "A huge amount of highly valuable resources and information is provided, important concepts and means to further pursue information result from this course",
    "Problem sets",
    "Lectures were very thought provoking. Homework was excellent. Liked the personal nature of the homework. You learn a lot about your personal environmental footprint. Great source of contextualizing environmental knowledge. Practical information.",
    "A different perspective and encouragement to think critically about energy issues.",
    "Arnulf Grubler's synthesis of various disciplines. It is remarkable how one class can seamlessly incorporate everything from thermodynamics and linear programming, to Maslow's hierarchy, climate change, and to the role of energy systems in poverty.",
    "This course covers almost every aspect of the energy system, from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, will be very helpful for further use.",
    "This course integrated material from a broad range of disciplines very well. Lectures were engaging, if a bit disorganized. Also, the problem sets were effective in reinforcing class material.",
    "It covered a vast array of material, in-depth. It's the only introductory energy course of this nature. Arnulf is an engaged, lively and interested professor, who cares about his students.",
    "Arnulf is fantastic. He is incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and excited to teach. The course is incredible comprehensive and gave me a stronger background in the subject than I have gotten in any other course. Arnulf is very available for extra help, and makes the class very fun and exciting. There is a reason for everything we do, and if the student puts in the work, a lot can be taken from this class.",
    "Arnulf's full and clear understanding of the course material was one of the best aspects. He is extremely knowledgeable and has a funny personality which made lectures additionally interesting.",
    "Guest speakers and lectures.",
    "I learned a lot from the problem sets, although it would have been nice to have more guidance re: the data sources - a lot of time was spent stressing out about whether we were referencing the correct numbers, rather than truly learning the material.",
    "Although Arnulf rambles, his perspective as an accomplished professional is great, so I think it's awesome that Yale gets to have him.",
    "Lectures",
    "Provided very comprehensive general understanding of global and historical energy issues",
    "- First few lectures were great - Problem sets very helpful for learning, though too time-consuming given the other demands of the class",

    "Lectures, problem sets",
    "I learned alot about issues of energy systems comparing both developed countries and developing countries.The Energy Primer gives you an in-depth explanation of most the concepts that we learn in class. The assignments were very useful because one learns how to look for reliable data from different sources, understand the data on energy, and analyze the data.",
    "The course provided a broad overview of energy systems and provided insight into future issues.",

   "comments": [
    "The presentation of material is in desperate need of reformation. Information is presented haphazardly and instruction is unclear, at the best of times.",
    "Lecture stype",
    "Objectivity in presentation of the material sometimes convoluted the rationale\/relative importance of given concepts. A lot of material to parse through, and a bit more direction could be beneficial.",
    "Two lectures per week would have spaced out the material and made for more even lecture schedule.",
    "The workload is very high.",
    "Problem sets were oftentimes unclear in wording. Also, it would have been helpful to consult problem set solutions. Exams were overly focused on small minutae instead of the important overarching concepts. Lectures were sometimes disorganized and hard to follow.",
    "As stated before, the problem sets should more closely align with the material presented in lecture. In addition, I think the problem sets (which take sometimes 15+hours) should be amended so that they focus more on content and learning and less on petty stuff. I recall that several problem sets had us combining through poorly written reports to find a single figure or two. This was frustrating, and didn't add much to the learning process.",
    "Honestly, I can't think of anything. If only the lectures were a tad shorter since 3 hours is a long time, but that is all I can come up with.",
    "Arnulf warned us when we started the section, but the modeling section was hard to follow and not captivating.",
    "Although lectures were very interesting, they can sometimes be too long. It is hard to keep focused after a long time of the professor only speaking. More interaction with the class in the forms of debates would make it more dynamic.",
    "I think that the lectures could have been more engaging - I had a hard time focusing during the 3 hour lecture block. More interactive discussion (not just prodding students for specific responses) wold have been helpful.",
    "1) The problem sets. You end up spending too much time trying to figure out what he wants\/where he wants it, rather than actually doing the important learning from them. 2) The \"optional\" professional modules were actually \"required\" (on the FINAL!) and that was not clear at the beginning of the course 3) V2 was used as a dumping ground for SO MANY resources and it was near impossible to figure out what was important. The syllabus listed \"required readings\" but there were also numerous additional readings that it turns out were all being tested on in the final. For the midterm this was more clear, however, for the final this should be clearer. 4) the tests and in-class q&a were really just you trying to figure out what Arnulf wants to hear, rather than discussing overall concepts and learning objectives.",
    "Extra help on problem sets",
    "TAs could be more helpful in understanding how to go about correctly addressing problem set questions and give at least partial credit for attempted work on problem sets",
    "Note that my response to this question is an overall evaluation of the course - both positive and negative. For better or for worse, this was the course I was most engaged with this semester, and as I had heard from prior students, I very much had a love-hate relationship with it. I definitely feel like I learned a lot, but I don't think my (or anyone's) grade in this course or the assignments is reflective of our knowledge. Questions in problem sets and exams were ambiguously and badly worded, so that the vast majority of our effort in these assessments was spent on not learning the material, but trying decipher what specifically was being asked for. And then if we presented a response or methodology that was not exactly what was expected, even with rigorous justification of our interpretation of a vague question, we would get points off. Exam questions were primarily not based around the fundamental concepts central to \"Energy Systems Analysis\", but mostly asked us simply to regurgitate obscure figures from random sections of lectures and readings (even those not explicitly assigned), and therefore tested us not on our knowledge but on which graphs we happened to bring in with our exam notes and how quickly we could find them. Arnulf is clearly an expert in the field and I really enjoyed his lecture style - I think there is a lot that students can gain from his knowledge and insights, but the assessments in the course (problem sets and exams) need work to actually be an accurate evaluation of our understanding of the material. The TFs, on the other hand, were less than helpful in responding to student questions, and often refused to elaborate or give any useful information even during the token \"TF information sessions\" (a few TF responses I'd received even turned out to be misleading and utterly time-wasting). They did not hold their assertion at the beginning of the course that our work in the problem sets would be judged primarily on the justification of our methodology, instead penalizing based on their interpretation of the vague questions and for being transparent about our process. Point deductions from TF grading often seemed to be completely arbitrary, and at times erroneous and nonsensical. This course definitely has a lot of value, and I have heard that one possible motivation behind all the ambiguity is to force us to really analyze complex questions from multiple angles and thereby gain a greater hold of the material. But the assessments are by no means an accurate representation of our understanding and grades seem arbitrary, and I don't believe this is appropriate for a graduate-level course.",
    "- Problem sets were way too much about digging for data. That's extremely time-consuming and of minimal utility. Would have preferred to spend more time on the ideas behind the problem sets and less time digging.",
    "Problem sets.",
    "Exams were too difficult - too long and covered a lot of material. They assessed our ability to reproduce the information, not our learning.",
    "The problem set assignments were extremely vague. The questions were often unclear and even cryptic at times leaving a lot of guess work to the student in approaching the problems.",
    "The course is somehow lack of a logic, which can be hard for students to follow up and review.",
    "It would be useful to have discussion sections with the Teaching Assistants because it could help to understand some concepts better.",
    "I like this course overall. One area to improve is for homework feedbacks. TA usually hands back homework a few weeks after submission. For instance, the last homework was sent back only a few days before the exam. By then everyone is busy and wouldn't have enough time go to through the feedbacks.",
    "It would have been nice to have TA sessions to further discuss and clarify course material. More short current event-type readings to keep the course material in perspective. The class was really big; small discussion sessions would have really helped. Instructor is fairly intimidating and the large class size does not foster meaningful discussions."

    "Know the Energy Primer inside out for the exams. Come to class prepared to actively listen and with a coffee since it's later in the day and it's awesome material you don't want to miss!",
    "Start the readings and problem sets early. Focus on the readings, not the lectures.",
    "Take a lighter courseload during the semester.",
    "Start on the problem sets early and make sure you understand what the question wants",
    "Try your best, but accept defeat",
    "Only take this course if you are prepared to put in a lot of time.",
    "Equivalent to the work load of two courses.",
    "A lot of work involved; ask people who have taken the course for help; put as much work as you think is necessary for your own needs",
    "Start your assignments earlier.",
    "Find a TA and become their best friend. It's the only way you will have any clue as to what the assignments are asking of you.",
    "What the course taught is useful, try to follow up after every class, and remember to finish the readings",
    "The class was worth it. It is a lot of work, but it was interesting. The professor knows a lot about the topic and you would have to learn a lot of information but if you like energy, you will like the class.",
    "Take it if you are interested in energy efficiency or renewable energy. Or you simply want to gain more insights into energy data analysis.",
    "The assignments in this easily take somewhere between 10-30 hrs. However smart you are or how much ever you know the subject, assignments do take time. So make time!",
    "Go to the instructor's office hours early in the semester. Arnulf is a great guy but somewhat intimidating, especially in a large classroom. Going to office hours will help break down that boundary early on."
