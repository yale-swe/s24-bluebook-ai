    "The professor and his encouragement of student engagement was a huge strength. One weakness was a slightly unclear syllabus about readings and how they map onto the class.",
    "Insight by the instructor More visual aid",
    "The nature of the course made it difficult to drill down into specific issues that interested me. This could have been a two-semester course.",
    "This was a fascinating course, but did not require a lot of time. If I did not do the readings there was no penalty, and no one would ever have known. Class was a discussion. Professor Hill seemed passionate about the subjects, but somewhat nonchalant about student answers and input. It was an easy class as there were very little requirements, but overall a fascinating subject and an honor to learn from Professor Hill."
