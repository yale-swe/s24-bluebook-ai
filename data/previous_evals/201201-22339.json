    "This course is both literally and figuratively a must take. If you're an EPE major, you don't need to be convinced, so I'll limit myself to saying that you should absolutely take it with Kapustin. He's a wonderful instructor. You'll read important things and think important thoughts, as a Yalie should.",
    "If you're deciding between Donahue and Kapustin, take Kapustin. I've taken classes with both. Donahue is great, but Kapustin is a god.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in - Professor Kapustin is great, and a lot of the later readings are things you probably haven't read but will definitely have strong opinions towards. Absolutely one of the classes I looked forward to most every week.",
    "Definitely take this course--it is a great overview of some great thinkers. I was told to take it with Kapustin and not any other professor, and I am so glad I listened.",
    "Brilliant professor who is eager to help you understand the texts. His monologues\/lectures, which along with student discussion, made up the two hour sessions, and were always a treat to hear. Keep up with the readings, which are definitely carefully selected and worth your time.",
    "It's a challenging but interesting look at some of the core philosophers and philosophies that you'll encounter throughout the EPE courses at Yale. The reading isn't too bad weekly (some is more dense than others), and class discussion is what you make of it. Though I can't say anything about the other professors, Kapustin was great, and see if you can take it with him.",
    "Kapustin is a wonderfully lucid, insightful, and in many ways brilliant professor. You will not do wrong in taking this class. Even if you have previously read\/studied a lot the work in this class (such as in DS), Kapustin will provide a new analytical perspective. However, it's basically impossible to get in if you're not an EP&E major (and if you are, this is mandatory). Regardless, this is the best Classics section by far. You will not do wrong with Kapustin.",
    "Of course it's necessary for EP&E majors but it's also an excellent introduction to synthesizing strands from each of the three disciplines. Manageable workload particularly if you start working on the final paper early.",
    "Take it by all means!!! I hope you are lucky enough to get in! It is so worth it!",
    "DO THE READINGS.",
    "If you're going to take EP&E 215, I definitely recommend taking it with Professor Kapustin. In seminar, he's clearly focused on student learning rather than just the material itself, and each class helped me develop my critical thinking skills as well as my understanding of the work of the writer in question. The readings themselves can be difficult - they're often both dense and long - and you may not connect with every writer. But there will probably be at least a couple that resonate, and because of the flexibility of the paper topics, you are free to focus on those writers and questions that interest you most. Overall, great course."
