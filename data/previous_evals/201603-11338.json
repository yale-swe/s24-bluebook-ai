    "By taking this class, I began to learn the grammar for the music that I've grown up loving. It was incredibly satisfying - I only wish that I hadn't left my compositions to the last minute, because I always felt like I could have created something better!",
    "Intro Music theory in the classical style, counterpoint, melody, harmony, strong emphasis in composition",
    "I took so much away from this course! I feel much more comfortable with figured bass and functional analysis and the ability to create short compositions following guidelines of form, etc. I have a much better understanding of modulations and tonicizations, too.",
    "I learned how to analyze and compose music from the classical era as well as general knowledge about music theory.",
    "Very much enjoyed learning the basics of composition and analysis.",
    "Knowledge\/skills - Learned how to use and apply 3 different systems of analysis (figured bass, Roman numerals and functional-bass notation), traditions and idioms of Renaissance\/Baroque counterpoint and Classical harmony, form-functions common to Classical music, and beginning studies in Classical-style composition In general, I felt that my study of theory this semester allowed me to develop greater insight with regards to performance and the compositional process.",
    "Baseline understanding of key concepts in music theory and analysis. Ability to compose in the classical style."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: small class encouraged questions. COMPOSITION as assessments. Loved it!!! Weakness: Not much. Would like to listen to more things during class.",
    "This course is very strong in its organization and content. It never felt like we sacrificed breadth for depth, and all the material we covered is essential to being a well-studied musician. Perhaps the course could be improved in its variety. Although we didn't do this too often, I really benefitted from the classes where we put exercises on the board and shared our work. I wish we did this more!",
    "This course's strength is that it really provides an accessible introduction to music theory. However, as a weakness, this introduction only focuses on music theory from a western perspective which I find quite limiting.",
    "Good course. No suggestions necessary.",
    "I felt that it would be beneficial to students, when introducing concepts, if the instructor were to give more clearly-summarized notes overviewing the concept, as music theory itself is an accruance of historical traditions and thus is not necessarily logical in all aspects. I also felt that more emphasis could be placed on aural skills, e.g. hearing and identifying the structures in the music that we were studying. However, I did feel that the course did a very good job in teaching complex material, holistically, and was well-built around reinforcing and explaining concepts so that everyone understood them.",
    "The course, especially when it was as clearly taught as it was by Brian Miller, is well structured. I would have liked to have begun with more roman numeral analysis before starting counterpoint, but that's only a small critique. Functional analysis was, I feel, the most useful skill we learned this semester.",
    "could use more structure, especially towards the beginning"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any musician who is looking to have more of a foundation in theory, whether or not you're taking it for the major\/credit. Take it with Brian Miller if he's teaching it!",
    "YES! Great class. Taught through the medium of composition. Take this class, it's very fun!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was very well structured, Prof. Miller is very accessible for help and feedback, and the material is all relevant to a solid understanding of music theory!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to my peers. As someone who has always been interested in learning how to compose, this course gave me exactly the introduction and taste of composition that I desired.",
    "Very much enjoyed learning the basics of composition and analysis.",
    "Yes, particularly Brian Miller's section. He is clear and tries to make music theory as directly applicable to other music-making skills as possible.",
    "It's a good course to learn music theory, if only b\/c it forces you to allot time to learning it. However, it is definitely not as structured as MUSI 110, largely to its detriment. Definitely felt there was more background research going on than was necessary."
