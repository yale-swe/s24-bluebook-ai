    "Important.",
    "This class is useful material but couldn't be taught in a more boring manner.",
    "You have to take it, do it.",
    "You probably have to take this for the major. It's not too much work and is definitely manageable on top of a heavy courseload.",
    "Only take this if you need it for the economics major. It is not interesting enough otherwise. The work load is manageable, if you don't fall behind. Lecture is a mixed bag. I found it hard to understand-- others found it more palatable. Only 5 psets. The exams were consistently too long, though the material was manageable. Be aware of the fact that the final is on the same day as the due date for the final project. Each are worth around 20% of your grade. It becomes stressful at that time.",
    "only to fill econ requirements",
    "Yes, very valuable for future econ courses.",
    "Only take if you are an econ major. Don't take with Prof. Qian if possible.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to. If you want a stats class take Psych stats. But if you have to take it, it's definitely possible to do well without slaving over the class.",
    "It's a difficult course, Prof. Qian does not make this course any easier. I would not recommend this course, but it's a requirement for the major so you don't really have a choice. I would strongly recommend taking this course in the fall.",
    "The course is not as bad as people say it is. That being said, it's not great. Nancy is a pretty decent lecturer but expect to learn a lot of the material yourself. Obviously, no reason to take this course if it is not a requirement of your major (economics).",
    "I'd only take it if you're an Econ major",
    "yes because the information is useful outside of the classroom.",
    "If you need it for your major",
    "Take it with Nancy if you are an Econ major. I took it with Atkin's last year and dropped it and his class is so much harder and I hardly learnt anything in that. Nancy is great, her lectures are actually worthwhile going to and her slides are relevant and make sense. Gabi was also a good TA so if you have her still, that's great! The midterm was fair but the final was way way way too long so time yourself in a way that you dont stop for a minute to think. However, Nancy is great and she gives bonus points to make up for it. However, I ended up leaving way more than the bonus could compensate for and I knew everything on the paper.",
    "This class is necessary for the economics major. If you are not a economics major, I would recommend taking a general statistics course.",
    "It was okay, not as bad as its reputation made it out to me. It's strength was that the material itself was not too hard and there was a very good TF, and the expectations for the course were for the most part straightforward. The weaknesses was that sometimes, it felt like there was no point in going to lecture because Professor Qian just read off the slides, and other times the way she explained things made concepts more confusing than they actually were. The problem sets and test problems were worded really confusingly sometimes, and the midterm and final were way too long to be completed in the time alotted. Being in class was intimidating as Professor Qian often randomly called on people and made it a bit uncomfortable if you didn't know the answer. It can be improved as Profesor Qian gets more practice teaching it, and if wording on tests and psets were more straightforward. If you're an econ major, you have to take it, but I wouldn't dread or be afraid of taking this class. There's alot of resources that this class offers that you can take advantage of and if you put the work in, it's not as bad as most people make it out to be.",
    "Similar to the Intermediate Econ courses, no one actually wants to take this. However, because this course is required for the major - we all get to suffer. Get ready for a mind numbing semester. Have fun.",
    "If you have to take Econometrics, do it. It's not that hard, and you'll be fine if you at least show up to lecture (you don't really have to pay attention that much). The material is okay, but it's hard to follow Professor Qian a lot. That being said, you also don't need to buy the book\u2014I didn't use my textbook at all.",
    "It's required for the econ major, so yes. Previous reviews may it out to be the \"worst class of the major\" but I actually found the material we learned to be pretty interesting and a lot more useful than say, intermediate micro.",
    "It's a requirement for the econ major, but I felt that we did much more useful things that in STAT 100.",
    "Take it if you are an econ major (and have to) or also if you want a QR credit that you can actually take something useful away from. Not the best taught, but good material.",
    "Yes, great foundation.",
    "You have to take it for the major (Econ), otherwise I wouldn't take it. If you have to take it, put in the hours and it will be rewarded.",
    "Yes, you must take it. It's actually enjoyable!",
    "Necessary introduction to statistics and data analysis.",
    "Not a very fun course. Much of the material is a rehash of high school AP stats. The teacher isn't exactly a great lecturer either. At least it isn't terribly hard, even if you make my mistake and start habitually skipping lecture and section.",
    "I would not recommend it because it was difficult and boring.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Wasn't that bad, Professor Qian gave lots of opportunity to do well with bonuses and what not.",
    "I would recommend the class because the subject matter is interesting and practical.",
    "If you're an econ major you need to take it, otherwise it's not a necessary course in your Yale career",
    "Don't take it unless you have to because of the Econ major. Hopefully Yale has better taught and more organized stats course than this that you'd be much happier taking.",
    "Take it with Nancy Qian. She makes it easy and fun! I've heard horrible things about this class without her.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but I wouldn't dissuade anyone from taking it either.",
    "ECON 131 is a much better course than I thought it would be going into it. I really enjoyed the material and feel like I've become a better econ student thanks to this class. Professor Qian can some times be pretty hard to follow during her lectures. You will have to study for the tests and understand the concepts, but if you do, you can do well in the course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are an economics major. It is a solid introduction to probability and statistics in the first half, then data analysis in the second half. A good amount of work but you learn a lot of interesting concepts with real-world applications. Professor Qian is great; she is very kind, knows her stuff, and even takes the time to learn everyone's name. Overall a positive experience.",
    "Overall the class was fine. Lectures were boring but the grading was pretty easy. If you have to take this class for the Econ major, then take it in the Spring with Nancy. Definitely go to section.",
    "Great class. Requirement for economics majors, but don't view it as such. Completely overturned the way in which I view data and data analysis, and if anything, you get a great professor who really cares about her students.",
    "After reading previous reviews of this class that proclaimed things like \"I would rather gouge out my eyes than take this class again!\" I went into ECON 131 with great trepidation. And while this course wasn't always smooth sailing or clear waters, I have to say that it was a much better experience than I had been led to believe. The probability theory and statistical concepts we went over at the beginning of the course were digestible and fairly tested on problem sets and on the midterm (this is coming from someone who has never taken a stats course before in her life). The more empirical material focusing on statistical analysis in the latter half of the course was often quite interesting and applicable. Nancy is a warm and kind professor and a well-paced lecturer. Even though she isn't the most clear at times and it often takes a few well-focused questions from the students to clarify certain concepts, she tries very hard to make this class interesting and understandable. And having an amazing TA like Gabi Santangelo definitely helps with the comprehension :)",
    "I thought it was a great course. We learned a lot of material but Nancy was good at explaining it, and the problem sets were good supplements.",
    "I hear McKee is teaching next year - definitely, definitely take it with McKee. He is the best econ teacher in the Northeast",
    "For a large econ class, Econ 131 was not that bad."
