    "Yes. The class gives you a good overview of tax, budgetary, monetary, and stabilization policies in the U.S. and Latin America. There is a simulation exercise in some weeks where you come up with relevant economic policies being taught that week. It generally makes for good discussion. Workload was reasonable - 1 page response papers on most weeks, midterm paper and a policy memo at the end. He lectures a few times a semester which may be a bit dry if you're not that interested enough in economic policy. Not the most engaging professor at Yale, but if you like the material, don't let that stop you.",
    "Great class, gives you all the theoretical framework that supports economic policy specially from the political perspective. Descent workload, the teacher gives tons of feedback which is great",
    "I would, but with a few caveats. First, know what you're getting in to: this course had weekly reading responses that weren't listed on the syllabus. This shouldn't be a deal-breaker by any means, but just something to be aware of when planning your schedule. Second, the course alternates between lecture\/discussion of the readings (which can be difficult for some of the more technical ones when much of the class doesn't have a game theory or economics background) and the policymaking simulations, which were the best part. Definitely worth at least shopping for anyone who is interested in the politics (as opposed to the economics) of the ways in which governments make decisions about economic policy.",
    "An interesting course which focuses on understanding important concepts with well chosen and targeted reading rather than simply spamming students with a large amount of readings. Need some economics background to appreciate some of the concepts better, but not a must.",
    "I would if you are interested in understanding how the economic policies are done and how they differ in different countries. Very useful for a political science major or someone that at some point wants to work on a related field.",
    "This seminar will give you an understanding of how economic policy is created. Topics include: the budget, tax policy, stabilization policy, and, monetary policy. I would recommend this course to students interested in politics or political science who also have a background in economics."
