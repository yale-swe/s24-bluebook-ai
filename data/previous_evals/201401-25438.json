    "Yes! a wonderful example of an interdisciplinary class, and I found my growing knowledge of medieval visual and literary culture popping up in my papers and research interests in other classes.",
    "Very few other classes offer such a thorough immersion into any time period, let alone this fascinating turning point in Western history, usually neglected because of preference for the Renaissance and Reformation. What really distinguishes the course is its use of multimedia, making it seem like you are really entering into the cultural landscape of the time and getting a hold of what the experience would have been like. The theme of sacred and profane act as an engine to drive you through and allow you to make sense of this wide spread of material, but the exposure to so much beautiful art and so many unexplored texts alone makes this class well worth taking."
