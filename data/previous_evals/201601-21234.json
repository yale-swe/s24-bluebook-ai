    "In this course, you will learn so many cool things about birds. It has been my favorite course at Yale so far.",
    "Be prepared to go through A LOT of memorization in this lab. But you'll learn so much about birds, it's so worth it, and you'll be proud of everything and all the bird families you'll be able to keep in your head.",
    "Nope, no, definitely not. Unless you're obsessed with birds and an avid birdwatchers, this class is not for the common person. Seriously, you need to really care because nothing else will get you through weekly cumulative quizzes and an absurd amount of memorization.",
    "As everyone says, ornithology lab is amazing and highly recommended. It is definitely not a gut--over the course of the semester you go through and memorize almost the entire phylogeny of modern birds. The exams expect you to identify birds to family and remember the relevant ecological information for over a hundred families. With that in mind, it's amazing and you should take it. It's all looking at specimens from the Peabody collections, so you get to see absurd quantities of amazing birds. Just be ready, or take it Credit\/D if you won't be able to put the time into it.",
    "A lot of work week-to-week, but if you have any interest in birding at all, it is definitely worth it for the knowledge of bird phylogeny you gain and for the access to amazing specimens - skeletons, egg shells, skins, and feathers."
