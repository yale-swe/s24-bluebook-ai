   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for a 5th (or 6th if you're a hero) class for a semester this is an easy class for anyone who knows the basics of supply and demand. An A is very achievable, and you'll learn minimal material.",
    "Easy economics. Very basic math and concepts, but you have to really figure out how to do the psets yourself. There are few resources other than lecture to help you, so take good notes. Kind of disappointing. the class was very broad and didn't focus on the economics of natural resources such as oil trading and current event applications like that.",
    "Take it, its really easy.",
    "ECON 330 is an excellent course in natural resource economics. Mendelsohn is an engaging professor, and his lessons on natural resource valuation techniques are really interesting. The problem sets take about an hour. This course is extremely interesting, practical, and has a very light workload.",
    "The easiest econ credit in the whole world. Still, there's no curve so you better not make a stupid mistake or bye-bye A!",
    "Yes, interesting to learn from a pioneer about something unusual and important.",
    "If you're interested in economics and the environment this class is for you. The workload is manageable. Just stay on top of going to lecture since there's no textbook. Study hard for the tests and you'll definitely be fine. This class gets boring at times, but it's not too bad!",
    "Fun econ field course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you're an econ major, this is pretty much an easy A as long as you go to lecture and section and pay attention.",
    "yes! really interesting material and completely unlike what i've learned in other econ lectures",
    "MUST TAKE CLASS. If you care about the environment also take it. Great class overall!",
    "Pretty good.",
    "A pretty gutty Econ class: short problem sets, two 50-minute lectures, and required section. Exams aren't too bad (though the final was definitely trickier than either of the midterms). Mendelsohn is actually quite a good lecturer, which is good--there's no textbook for the class, so unless you want to slog through all the reading, you better go to class and take good notes.",
    "Pretty good class that is very doable. Not a ton of work, and you learn a good amount about natural resources.",
    "Great class to take Cr\/D\/F as a senior.",
    "The course was interesting but too easy. Throw a bit of harder math in there and it would be a great class!",
    "Amazing class. A must take course while at Yale.",
    "I recommend it.",
    "This was an excellent class, giving me the broad overview about the relationship between the environment and the economy that I was hoping to get in this class. The topics were interesting, diverse, and relevant. Professor Mendelsohn was a very interesting lecturer.",
    "I feel like this class was a bully pulpit for Mendelsohn. He presented his opinions on the topics and sometimes I felt like he made claims that were not properly supported (Did I say sometimes? Sorry, I meant often). The class overall is very basic and focuses on concepts rather than any empirical models. The math that you'll need to get through this class was taught to you in middle school. Doing the readings definitely isn't necessary for this class. Overall, it was a easy credit for the major, but I can't say I learned anything incredibly compelling.",
    "Yes! It's a great, easy 5th class if you need one with interesting material and discusses relevant issues.",
    "This class was ok. Not as easy as some people say, although a lot of people did well on the exams, depending on the curve. You definitely have to study for tests, and the problem sets are worded terribly. Lot of writing on the exams, so it somewhat depends on how the TAs grade us. Somewhat interesting, but a lot of times lecture was boring, and it's hard to take notes because Mendelsohn doesn't use slides and just talks. Decent econ that's not super quantitative or difficult.",
    "The material in this class was interesting and relevant to current environmental issues, and it was generally rather intuitive. There are no slides and no textbook, so it can be hard to know what is going on if you don't go to lecture. That said, lecture could be a bit difficult to follow at times, and problems are not always well-worded on PSETs. But overall a solid class that helps you understand environmental issues and the economic approach to them.",
    "A friend once described this course to me as \"environmental economics for white rich kids entering finance\/business so they can learn about how to manage their polluting companies.\" I think this is a great course to cruise along to as an economics major. For environmental studies, you may be frustrated with this course if a) you don't have a background in micro (all of this is essentially applied micro) or b) if you know a lot about the topics which lead you to believe the course's models are oversimplified versions of reality (they are). Regardless, I think it is important to take this course to learn about the conventional thinking on the issues.",
    "you learn about pollution, energy, rivers, lakes, oceans, mining, fisheries (i didn't even know that was a word), resource allocation, etc. Unless you're interested in this stuff, you'll be bored as ever in class. I would recommend it, tho cuz it's easy",
    "Easy\/Obvious class but WARNING: the curve is atrocious. Literally everyone does so well on the midterms its ridiculous. Average score is in the 90s --> NO CURVE. So even if you think you know the material really well, because its so easy and intuitive, you may get screwed over grade wise. But the class itself doesn't require too much work. Just problem sets basically every week that take a hour max. Lots of people take it as an econ gut and it totally is work wise.",
    "This is certainly an econ class that is lite on the econ. For those in the major, the problem sets may feel a bit repetitive and easy. With that said, the models are interesting and the topic is very relevant. Professor Mendelsohn is also an engaging professor and the workload is manageable.",
    "If you are looking to major in econ or environmental studies, then this course might be a good idea. Plus, it's always nice to have some background under your belt about some of the issues in environmental sustainability and the cross between firms vs environmentalists. Workload is very manageable with weekly problem sets and a few exams tossed in there.",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially for students interested in economics, the environment, the intersection of the two, or the general practice of seeking quantitative guidance in a qualitative scenario. This course really empowers students to be intelligent managers of the environment in a world with limited resources, including and especially money.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. The professors lectures are not well structured and without power points studying for exams are stressful. The sections were very helpful and were the only reason I knew what to study.",
    "Econ 330 is a solid introduction to natural resources. The information is very relevant and the workload is relatively light. My only complaint was that sometimes the lectures seemed to try and argue common sense ideas which made the course feel slow and made it difficult to pay attention. This also meant that the lectures gave a very broad overview of the material which, for a 330 level class, seemed too broad. The professor, however, was a good lecturer and drew lots of graphs and gave examples to keep the class interesting.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it. It's not conceptually difficult, but will change the way you understand natural resources.",
    "If you are interested in both econ and natural resources, then you will like this class. Weekly problem sets, two midterms and a final - pretty manageable and content is quite interesting.",
    "Don't take this if you have a ton of econ experience. It's not a fabulous class. Interesting topics but it's a bit beyond people who don't have a great econ background.",
    "Yes! Easy and interesting.",
    "I took this class as an EVST major who hadn't taken any Econ before, and I did fine. You learn some really useful material about the current state of the world. Mendelsohn is a fantastic lecturer. Not too much work. The problem sets are pretty short. You don't need to do any of the readings. If YBB says this class meets on Fridays, that is false.",
    "Interesting material. An alternate way of looking at environmental issues compared to the usual idealistic solutions you get in an environmental class. Good for econ or non-econ majors. Not very math intensive. Good overall class. Pay attention in lecture as there are no notes posted online and what he says will be critical for the short answer questions on the tests",
    "Good course. Take it.",
    "great course, take it",
    "Not much in terms of workload and definitely on the lighter side for econ classes. One usually shorter problem set a week and really no reading. The exams got progressively harder- first midterm was easy but the final was tough and wording on questions tended to get ambiguous. Material is interesting and moves at a good pace.",
    "Not rly, its not really up to standard",
    "Definitely need to put in the time and go to all lectures",
    "Good course. Not much material on midterms and finals. Must attend class because there are no slides and no textbook, so you will study from notes you take.",
    "Weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, and a cumulative final. No textbook so you should take good notes in lecture and section. I really enjoyed this course, the material was very interesting. Good course to take if you're an Econ major.",
    "YES. Absolutely. A great Econ class for someone not too comfortable with Econ. A great class to learn about interesting topics; you will actually gain practical knowledge of issues that are important today.",
    "Highly recommended for any one looking for a very easy Econ elective with little work.",
    "Pretty interesting and doable class! Weekly sections are actually very helpful and if you do the psets each week (1-2 quesfions) you can't fall behind!",
    "Very good course. I feel like I learned a ton about the environment and how to utilize resources effectively. It makes me think about how to apply economic concepts to real world problems. Not too hard as well because the instructor is crystal clear. Highly recommend it.",
    "If you're an economics major, this course will probably be very, very easy for you, with a very light workload. I didn't feel like I learned very much that I hadn't learned in the externalities section of the introductory econ classes, though.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. It's really interesting, and it's also really easy if you just pay attention in lecture. The readings aren't super necessary either.",
    "Good course for anyone interested in natural resources, economics, energy, or sustainability. Take it even if you lack an econ background- micro is helpful, but ultimately all you need is a command of algebra. Psets are easy but badly worded; tests are more or less the same. The final was surprisingly difficult, given our previous exams and psets.",
    "This is a relatively easy economics elective on an interesting topic. However, it could be substantially more interesting if the course was better organized.",
    "A class about resource economics, which is an interesting topic. Not a particularly difficult class and very intuitive. The problem sets are very doable and the examinations are incredibly reasonable. Worth taking.",
    "Definitely pay attention and take good notes in lecture or else you will have no idea what is going on since there are no class notes, no textbooks, and the reading isn't helpful. The curve is very generous, lots of non Econ majors. Definitely get a good TA. Lectures are not the best, but an easy and somewhat helpful Econ credit. Weekly psets take 20 minutes.",
    "I fully recommend this course. It will change the way you view the environment.",
    "not really hard but also really frustrating because it's a missed opportunity. I wouldn't really recommend it."
