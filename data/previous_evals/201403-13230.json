   "comments": [
    "Really the best class for anyone who wants to get a start on learning Chinese. If you took Chinese in high school or middle school, but never really felt like you learned anything, this is also a good place to ease yourself back in and start fresh.",
    "It is a hard course, but you learn a lot so I would recommend it to those who are up to the challenge.",
    "CHNS 110 is a huge time commitment. You really have to be motivated to learn Chinese. The class is difficult if you have a hard time memorizing. Since Chinese is based in characters, it's much harder to get used to memorizing both the characters, the definitions, the grammar, and the pinyin. I think that the teachers are great and the structure of the class is well-set up. The teachers are kind and approachable, and have really accommodating teaching styles. I would only recommend CHNS 110 to a person who is very motivated to learn Chinese specifically. I think if you're just trying to fill your language requirement, don't choose Chinese.",
    "CHNS 110 is a great introduction to Chinese. It is a good combination of being both rigorous and fun - I learned a lot of Chinese this semester and am happily surprised to be able to understand, read\/write, and speak several basic phrases in Chinese at the end of the semester! The class is taught by four different professors who each teach one lesson and then rotate. Most classes are limited to a maximum of 10 or so people, so you really get to become close friends with your peers (or pengyou). The daily workload is quite heavy but necessary. There are chapter tests each week and one cumulative final that covers ALL of the lessons - so make sure to memorize the dialogues you read each week in preparation for the final exam! The best way to study for the class is simply to practice - there is a mandatory tutorial session each week for 30 min with a graduate student who speaks Chinese. The session is very helpful for improving Chinese speaking skills as well as comprehension (both reading and listening). Overall, great course if you are interested in Chinese. Nevertheless, be prepared for heavy work and do not fall behind!",
    "Intensive and challenging but incredibly rewarding. Not quite enough speaking emphasis.",
    "A great intro to Chinese! They help you a lot with the tones at the beginning of the course, so you get the tones down pretty well. And then if you put in the work daily to study for the quizzes, your Chinese will improve a lot and the grade will come.",
    "I would completely recommend this class to another student. If I was to sum up the course for them, I think I'd describe it as fast-paced and energetic, with really good instructors.",
    "This was the most rewarding course I've taken at Yale so far. You make so much progress in the first semester, it's insane. Yes, it's a lot of work, but I found it wasn't quite as much as people said it was, and it was 100% worth it. You really get out what you put in.",
    "I would recommend this to my fellow students. I had a lot of fun in this class, and I also learned a lot.",
    "It is a demanding class, with no considerations whatsoever about the toughness of your other classes, if you are taking a bunch of hard classes, I wouldn't recommend this."
