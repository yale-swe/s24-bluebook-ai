    "I wouldn't really recommend this course to someone who may have come out of 230-231 feeling very comfortable with basic analysis; however, if one wants an additional one semester survey in these tools, this is a good course for that.",
    "In the end, I do feel like I became a lot better at math, specifically proof-writing and problem solving. However, the class was the absolute bane of my existence at times as the problem sets, while sometimes not particularly long, required an unbelievable amount of rigor and could be somewhat soul-crushing. Professor Jones is clearly very smart (in fact probably too smart to be explaining things well to neophytes) and cares about teaching the class, but isn't a great lecturer. Make sure to go to the review sessions for the exams, since almost all of the questions are the same year-to-year and often involve little \"tricks\" that he will show you in the review sessions. So while this class might not be the most interesting thing at the time you take it, it's very much a vegetables before dessert kind of thing. Also, if you want to get a PhD in most disciplines (certainly econ or math) it's pretty much required that you take this course and ideally more and do well in them."
