    "No, I'd not recommend this class to others, or at least while Yael is teaching the class, don'ttake it.",
    "You probably have to take it. Stay away from Yael, if you can. At all costs. You will leave lecture more confused than you came. Linear Algebra is insanely useful. You would never know it from the class. Terrible class, but probably required if you're in it since no one would stay in a class like this for fun.",
    "The substitute lecturers Yael invited in were easier to understand than she was. She should improve her teaching style - less proofs, more examples of what we're actually expected to know in psets and exams. The textbook is useless. Googling concepts was significantly more informative. I took it knowing many of my friends had tried before and failed; I essentially did the same. Wish I waited to take it in the spring.",
    "Listen to Gilbert Strang's lectures on MIT OpenCourseware - it's the only way I could figure out what was going on at all. Professor Kfir isn't a bad teacher when it comes to the material, but had strange grading policies that convoluted the course.",
    "Wait for a different instructor. I'm serious. I read the bad reviews of this class and heard things from friends, but disregarded them since I've always been good at math and didn't think it would matter. I waswrong.No matter how much you think you understand the material, a completely different application that you've never worked with will appear on the problem sets or exams. No solutions are provided to the problem sets, so it can be very difficult to figure things out.Bottom line: Linear algebra itself is an interesting subject, but this is the most unclear professor I've ever had. Wait until next semester if Yael is the only teacher available. I promise you won't regret it.",
    "Fall of 2012 the class had about 20 students in it, a fair amount of whom didn't attend class. Prof. Kfir was pretty bad, as previous reviews can attest, but I don't think she is returning. The course has a false name, Linear Algebra with Applications. We studied almost no applications, which I found frustrating and disappointing. This course did cover the general ideas of linear algebra and was successful in that regard. I shopped MATH 225 and was deterred by the speed of the course and the preparation of the other students in it, which is why I chose this class, but really, I don't think there is much difference other than the students in them. My class was full of scientists and engineers taking linear algebra in order to apply it to their fields. The course was taught in a proof-based manner; everything in class was presented with a long proof, and we were expected to prove things on the exams. I don't see how this was supposed to differ from MATH225 other than the type of students drawn to the courses. People recommend watching the MIT lectures; I found them helpful as supplements, but there is no substitution for attending class, where you can ask questions. That being said, after a few ridiculous classes where I ended up more confused than how I started, I was highly tempted to skip.",
    "No! If you want to take Math 222, take if with another instructor.",
    "obviously a core for some of the majors. Definitely revise the proofs and know your basics well",
    "I liked Yael's lectures and I loved linear algebra. If you like thinking about things abstractly then linear algebra will be great for you - you don't need to take 225 (or whatever the more theoretical one is) to think abou the theory.",
    "This is a good class in terms of the material taught but do not make the mistake of taking it with Professor Algom-Kfir."
