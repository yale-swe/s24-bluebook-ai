   "comments": [
    "Very interesting topic, but the lectures were rather vague so it didn't seem as though we really came to many conclusions. Essentially, just taking things you already know, and rephrasing them in an admittedly quite intelligent, interesting way.",
    "Just take it. At the very least you will be left wondering how the world could be this weird and at its very best the class was masterful. Just be warned the slow pace of the class will pick up after Thanksgiving and it is best to be prepared for it.",
    "I loved this class. Though at first (and honestly, even after it ended) it was hard to pinpoint exactly what the class was really about, I found the material interesting, and it is definitely something new that you won't see in any other course at Yale (in my experience). You learn things about the world that you never knew or even thought about, and it opens your eyes to seeing the world through a different lens. Light workload is nice too- really just a term paper with accompanying project.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are, hands down, the most interesting stuff I've read for a class ever (saying this as a senior, so believe me), Keller's lectures are fascinating, and if you choose a subject that really interests you, writing your paper will be just as great an experience. Yes, I did just say that - and if a class that makes doing readings, going to lecture and writing a paper actually fun doesn't sound like one that you should take, then what are you doing here get out kbye.",
    "I would go to this class just to hear Professor Easterling speak. I had heard going into the class that it was very theoretical, but its theoretical from a cultural\/ social standpoint which I think lends a different perspective than many other theory classes in the architecture department. It also provides an interesting shift in how one thinks about architecture from individual structures to the potential greater impact of architectural memes.",
    "I would recommend it as the subject matter is really interesting and applicable.",
    "I liked this course. The starting point for the course - an interrogation of global spatial forms and infrastructure, especially those that seem mundane and we generally dont notice, exploring their social effects, politics, origins, and history - is fascinating, and the first few lectures, where this topic was introduced, were powerful. I enjoyed most of the lectures, but they could be a bit hit or miss. I think they could be strengthened if there was a clearer, or maybe more specific, thesis organizing and driving each lecture, because sometimes it felt like a broad survey of modern spatial forms from around the world with only very broad connecting themes - like globalization, neoliberalism, capitalism, etc. That said, it has been very useful to get such a wide exposure to all these forms, and I think its material that will be generative for students interested in the politics of space in the broadest sense. Also, it must be said - the readings are by and large FANTASTIC. Very, very well chosen, both on a weekly basis (i.e. each weeks readings speak to each other and create very interesting interactions between them) and throughout the course (i.e. the readings as a whole tell a cohesive story). Unfortunately, students dont seem to take sections very seriously which severely dampened many of our discussions, with students zoning out on laptops or not having done the reading. But when people had done the readings, the discussions could be fascinating. For this reason, I think it mightve been productive to mix the undergraduate sections more with the graduate sections, assuming that the grad students tended to be better about doing the work. It also couldve been useful to have a short weekly reading response and a restricted laptops policy during section. Eric, the TA, is awesome. Hes very thoughtful, engaged, and dedicated to helping students.",
    "This is one of those great classes that, if you do the reading, will give you a decent idea of how to apply contemporary theory to life today. It's a bit unstructured and it's easy to slack off, but Keller deals with important problems and gives brilliant perspectives to them."
