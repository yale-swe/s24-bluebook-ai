    "a very basic intro to legal spanish. not that deep.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, great way to fulfill a language req.",
    "Heck yes!",
    "I wasn't particularly impressed with most of the course material, but it was interesting at many times. The workload is pretty light, though sometimes the written assignments get annoying. Take it if you want an easy class that you can use to practice Spanish and talk about pretty simple legal concepts.",
    "This is a really good course. You get to learn about law, such as where law stems from, different theoretical bases for it, how to become Supreme Court Justices, etc. as well as pick up the legal Spanish jargon on the way. The course keeps you up with the reading by having daily hw assignments, which is a good preparation for the midterm. The class is pretty easy, and the final paper is only 5 pages. One draw back is that the material can get pretty boring.",
    "You should take it if you want a low-stress L5 Spanish class or if you are interested in the legal systems of Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "Great course. There are 2 1-page papers each week on readings, which amount to about 20 pages each week. There is also a presentation, a final paper, and a significant participation component. I highly recommend the course for students proficient in Spanish who would like to maintain their proficiency, become better speakers, learn important legal vocabulary, and learn key concepts in Spanish and Latin American law.",
    "You have to look at this class on two levels. First, does it improve your Spanish? Second, does it improve your knowledge of legal issues?For me, the answer was yes to both, but I would guess that for others in the class the answer might have been no to both. My Spanish is not great even though this was my third L5. To really take the next step I think you need to go speak Spanish in a native-speaking country. Spanish classes at Yale have been able to maintain my proficiency and sometimes slightly improve it, but I haven't gotten a lot better. This class is the same way; my written and auditory Spanish are a bit better, my speaking maybe a bit worse. It's hard to speak more than a couple times in a class of 20+, especially when the professor lectures for most of it.I learned a lot about basic legal principles, but I knew nothing about them in the beginning. If I were a law school student, I don't think this class would have helped. Though the emphasis is on legal principles in Spanish-speaking countries, it is all so broad and basic that most of it applies to the U.S.",
    "Spanish 222 01 provides a strong introduction to law in Latin America and Spain to those who have little knowledge about how law works in those countries. The course also compares and contrast law in spanish speaking countries to law in the United States. To those who want to learn about the differences between law in the United States and law in Spanish speaking countries I strongly recommend you to take this course.",
    "The course covers the Spanish legal system. If you're looking for an exclusively conversational course, this is not exactly it because you are learning new material each day."
