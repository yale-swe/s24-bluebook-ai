    "great class take it",
    "Best decision ever for my 3L spring. I probably would never have watched 75% of these films if it weren't for this class, and I'm glad I did. Knowing you're going to have to write a response paper for each one also helps you to pay more attention and engage with the film than you might otherwise. The films and the (brief) discussions afterwards were thought-provoking.",
    "I enjoyed Capitalism Film. I do wish that the videos were streamed however or that Professor Priest would tell students in advance how long a film would last so that they could plan accordingly. I also think instead of having to do 13 responses in order to get full credit ,there should be a range of 11-13 especially given that we had to be flexible when the professor had to cancel classes.",
    "The weekly paper requirement was very open-ended and allowed me to write on any topic related to the movie which was great! I didn't feel pressured to take a certain view on capitalism.",
    "The course is aptly named. It is a simple evaluation of films as they relate to capitalism and larger market forces. Professor Priest is a fantastic person, and he is quite enthusiastic about this course. Sure--the course is rather easy. However, you do have to contemplate for the page-and-a-half long papers that are due for each film.I certainly recommend taking this if you are looking for an enjoyable course or would like my exposure to Professor Priest."
