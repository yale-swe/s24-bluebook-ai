    "#2: Dr Lee is awonderful scientist and a wonderful teacher.#6\/#10: In my opinion, this class covers too many topics at too superficial a level. Coming from a forestry perspective, I would like to see Dr Lee teach a course that covers just 3 topics rather than 20: an overview of some climatology basics (similar to what is included in this class), relationship of forests\/vegetation and silvicultural treatments to climate\/weather (microclimate amelioration, etc), and relationship of forests\/vegetation to climate change (global view).",
    "The class is not particularly related to my field of study, but there were a few very relevant lectures. Overall though, Professor Lee touched on many different topics of interest to students at FES through the lens of weather and climate, which was interesting.",

    "Again, I think the course is too fragmented and covers too much - we all have pretty specialized interests at FES, and this courses is kind of a catch-all - would Dr Lee be willing to break it into two courses, one focused on relationship of climate to forestry, and one focused on...climate and energy? The climate and forestry one could also encompass aquatic systems - ocean acidification, release of CO2 from rivers, etc. I think splitting up the course would help enrollment too. Dr Lee is such a brilliant guy and great teacher, but as the courses is designed, too few students choose to take it.",
