    "This is an intense research seminar - the weekly reading load leaves little time for working on the research paper. It is a great class for anyone interested in the issue of nationalism - it has certainly helped me refine my thinking on the topic.",
    "I think that this course is a perfect course for a student who is seeking to expand their knowledge of either the 19th century or Eastern Europe. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in 19th century history, or looking to further their understanding of the internal conflicts facing Austria-Hungary prior to World War I.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially if the fellow student is interested in modern European history or in intellectual history.",
    "I would definately recommend the course - there is quite a lot of reading, but the discussions are always incredibly enlightening.",
    "History 691 is an intense class aimed at history PHDs. Only take it if you are prepared to do a lot of work. That said, you will learn a great deal."

    "This course has helped me think about different approaches to my dissertation topic. It has also made me appreciate theory more.",
    "I feel that this course greatly increased my knowledge of Eastern Europe. My final paper topic has contributed to my research, and I will write on a similar topic in other courses.",
    "As I'm very much interested in the development of nationalism in modern Europe, I found this seminar extremely helpful in broadening my knowledge on the topic. I'm certain that some of the insights I received in the seminar will accompany me in my future research.",
    "The course increased my knowledge of Eastern European history.",
    "It broadened my horizons to Eastern Europe. My previous expertise was East Asia."
