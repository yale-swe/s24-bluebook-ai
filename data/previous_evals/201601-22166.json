    "I think I would recommend it to someone who had a strong interest in narrative history. I came to the course hoping to have an intensive writing experience, and I enjoyed the practicum, but found ultimately that it simply wasn't the kind of writing practice I needed, and so I don't think I would recommend it to someone looking to work on writing more broadly.",
    "Fantastic opportunity to think about the art of writing history. The readings, guest speakers, demos, the practicum -- all of these aspects are inspiring in their own way",
    "I am an undergrad in a major completely unrelated to History or American Studies. I had never taken a real history class before this one. I took this class because I wanted to take a nonfiction writing class. Boy oh boy I did not know what I was getting, but WOW. John Demos is a legend. What a sweet, sweet man. He left the most helpful comments I have ever gotten on my papers, and between that and the amazing way the class is structuredclass discussions focus in on the craft of writing history, authors come in to talk about their writing process (Jill Lepore! Aaahh), short pieces get workshopped weeklythis class is a \"must take\" for anyone who wants to seriously work on their nonfiction writing skills. A word of cautioneveryone else in the class, undergrads included, had at least one area of history with which they were already intimately familiar. I had to basically teach myself some random part of history in order to have the knowledge to write the papers, which made them doubly hard. It was still completely worthwhile, but it was SO much work!"

   "comments": [
    "I think it made me think more intentionally about the kind of writing that I want to do, even if that writing is perhaps the opposite of narrative history. I did not find the readings particularly relevant to my own work.",
    "I am an undergrad who has never taken a \"real\" history classthis didn't contribute at all to my dissertation or research since I don't have one. That said, this was one of the best \"writing classes\" I've taken, and I'm immensely thankful to both professor Demos and the DGS for allowing me to take itI learned so much!",
    "The professor's credentials along with the course's longevity alone make this course a requirement for history graduate students."
