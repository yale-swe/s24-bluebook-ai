    "This course provided me with a good overview of the major childhood-onset psychiatric disorders. It was heavily supplemented with accounts of current research being performed by YCSC faculty, which was also enjoyable. The clinical exposure portion of the course also allowed me to get some exposure to childhood CBT (I was in the aggression placement), which I found a beneficial experience.",
    "Broad overview of developmental psychopathology and complementary clinical exposure",
    "I learned how to think about developmental psychopathology issues from various perspectives policy maker, therapist, clinician and researcher. It was really cool to hear about various childhood issues from experts in their field.",
    "This course in its very first year provides a general overview of select topics in developmental psychopathology. A large number of guest lecturers provide clinical, research, policy, and community resource perspectives.",
    "An understanding of the assessment and various treatment approaches of developmental psychopathologies.",
    "I learned a ton about almost every childhood disorder.",
    "It was a broad survey of a variety of developmental disorders."

   "comments": [
    "The course does a good job of providing the basic information about the various topics that it hopes to cover. The practical exposure piece is also a nice touch, as this is fairly unique for an undergrad class (only being shared with the autism class and child development\/early childhood ed classes). However, as it is a guest-lecture heavy course, there is the constant problem of lecturers not knowing what material had been covered by the previous lecturers. There is not much that could be done about this except for perhaps providing guest lecturers with more information about which topics have already been covered as of their lecture. The grade in the class is also based on a relatively small number of assignments (essentially just the final paper). However, this sort of evaluation structure is not necessarily a problem, as the class becomes more about simply absorbing the information and enjoying the topics presented.",
    "Great class, but there are some chinks to be ironed out. The placements were less engaging than I imagined them to be, and often I would find myself not doing much in the lab. Maybe have a rotational set-up of placements so students can see other placements too?",
    "Clinical component was very strong as were depth and breadth of topics covered, could perhaps be improved by rotating through different clinical placements rather than sticking with one for the duration of the semester",
    "The strengths were that we learned about a range of childhood disorders and the various elements of the process e.g. Diagnoses, school services, policies regarding early childhood care etc. it was also great to get experience watching the diagnoses in the clinical sessions. The weaknesses were some speakers were better than others and we only grew intimate with one disorder in clinic setting. Another weakness was that the final paper was 20-25 pages which took a lot of time and I felt detracted from my argument, which was best covered in about 15 pages. Since scientific papers are usually less than 20 pages I think it'd make sense to have a lower page limit.",
    "There is no overarching structure to the course -- in order to properly process the distinct topics of each lecture (and minimize overlap, particularly among the guest speakers) this needs to change. Also, lectures should be kept to a time limit to allow discussion.",
    "I loved the guest lecturer format of this course. It kept the material very engaging throughout the semester and I always looked forward to class. I would have liked to rotate placements maybe once a month, as the cases in the autism clinic did get a little similar over time. I also wish some topics were covered in a bit more depth, or maybe through less conventional viewpoints (for example the lecture on gender dysphoria in ASD). I already knew a lot of the clinical manifestations and assessment methods presented and wish that we had talked some disorders in greater depth - the lectures on substance disorders and tic disorders were really interesting, and briefly mentioned some of the recent research on those topics that I would have liked to hear more about in a second lecture on the topic. I feel that a lot of disorders and approaches were covered, and that I would have gained more if less were covered but in greater depth - for example by assuming that the students already know about the disorder's etiology and prevalence from the readings. The lectures on depression and anxiety were some of my favorite because they were less fact based and presented models for the disorders I had never considered.",
    "This class is perfect-- what a college course should be. It emphasizes learning not grades. You work with kids and learn a ton.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were very interesting, professors were very knowledgable and approachable, the clinical assignment was the best part of the course (it was invaluable to get in first hand observation. Weakness: There was a lack of continuity from week to week because of the lecturer rotation. Also due dates and assignments were very unclear and the class often received conflicting information from different sources."

    "Developmental Psychopathology is a very interesting class, unlike most of the others offered in the psych department. It focuses largely on the psychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, also covering topics like psychiatric assessment, evidence-based practice, and various types of psychotherapy for children. The lecture format is a bit variable, as there are three instructors and a host of guest lecturers who cover a range of other topics. On the one hand, this is great because most topics are presented by a bona fide expert on that topic. On the other hand, there is somewhat of a disconnect between the different lectures and fairly large variance in the format (i.e. how much class discussion is involved). There is also a clinical practicum piece, much like that of the Autism and Related Disorders class. This portion of the class may be re-vamped, but in this year, students picked one of three placements around the Child Study Center (Anxiety CBT, Aggression CBT, or Autism Clinic), which they attended outside of class over the course of the semester. Grades are based almost entirely on a single 20-25 page final paper, which can be on any topic in the field of developmental psychopathology. If you're interested in learning more about childhood psychiatric disorders, this is really the course for you. The workload is light, and you get a lot just from listening to the lectures and participating in the clinical practicum. If you've taken the autism and related disorders class, the overall format is very similar (though there only a little in the content of the two courses).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is rare to have the opportunity to observe what you are learning in class in a clinical environment, which is exactly the opportunity this course provided",
    "If you're interested in abnormal psychology in children, then definitely! It was a fun course and was not very stressful the professors also cared a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in hearing about various psychopathologies from experts on the topic. The rotation of lecturers keeps the course extremely engaging, and what you learn in lecture is supplemented through direct observation of assessment in the placements. The whole grade is based on a 25 page final paper.",
    "YES.",
    "Take the class if you want a broad introduction to a lot of different developmental disorders. The class itself isn't very demanding, but your grade is based entirely in attendance and your term paper, so there is a lot riding on that assignment. The clinical observation piece was my favorite part of the course; it was really engaging to see firsthand the assessment and treatment techniques we had discussed in class. The lecturers are rotating, so rarely will you have the same professor lecturing two classes in a row. This keeps things fresh, but also causes the course to feel a bit scattered."
