   "comments": [
    "This is a course that goes overthe heat transfer, thermodynamic, and fluid mechanics of weather systems. It's really interesting, especially because I'd never taken a course on weather before. While Dr. Boos doesn't require you to prove a lot of stuff, you definitely need to be familiar with mathematical operators (gradients, etc). The book is pretty good although at times overly technical. There's not much work and the midterm is not too tough; overall a really cool course if you want to learn about weather!",
    "If you're possibly thinking of going into atmospheric or planetary science, you should definitely take this course--it's interesting, and good preparation for further study in the field. Bill is a good instructor, and the other professor who sometimes teaches this course, Trude Storelvmo, is also excellent. It gets a bit mathy near the end, but Bill doesn't test you on your ability to do tricky derivations--more on your intuitive understanding of how the important equations describe what actually happens in the atmosphere.",
    "I would recommend this course, or any other course taught by Prof. Boos, to another student without reservation. In particular, this course is a wonderful introduction to atmospheric science, particularly the physics of the atmosphere's vertical structure and large-scale dynamics. (Despite the course title, very little climate science was covered this time around.) The workload was light, in fact, almost too light, since few opportunities to practice mastery of the later course material were offered until the final exam. That said, I learned a lot, despite having minimal previous exposure to atmospheric science.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the large scale workings of the atmosphere! The class is taught really well and you gain a lot of great introductory knowledge.",
    "I would recommend it to a student studying environmental or atmospheric geology or anyone who had an interest in practical physics. It gave useful information about the physics of particulates in the air but mostly global weather and air patterns",
    "This course provides an overview of the dynamics of the atmosphere. Definitely easier if you've taken a fluid mechanics course, but Prof. Boos makes the math accessible for everyone. (It's not all intense math, either; features like the skewT-lnP plots were interesting and informative.)"
