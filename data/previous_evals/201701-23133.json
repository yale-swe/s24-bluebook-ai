   "comments": [
    "It was interesting and informative to combine art history with regular history. This course brings up many facets of daily life in the early modern period which are otherwise often lost. It's a new and interesting way to think about what we know and how we know it, as well as how we form identities, both today and in the past.",
    "Historiography, writing and analysis, researching evidence--both primary and secondary, using visual evidence for historical research, making concise arguments and presentations",
    "Whit this class most of the skills I got was critical reading and the ability to read. A lot of material and pick out infomation quickly"

   "comments": [
    "All students should know how to give a presentation by the time they graduate. It is good that this course requires both a presentation AND a longer paper. More time in the museum would be even better, but overall this is a good course.",
    "Professor Wrightson is a great professor that knows a massive amount about the course materials. The class is well organized and covers a large load of material without being overwhelming.",
    "Professor Wrightson is a great instructor and amazing at coming up with research topics. His knowledge and passion for the material is the best part of the course. I had a difficult experience with the lack of heated class discussion, but I think it says more about the people in the class than about the professor or the course.",
    "It was simply perfect",
    "The course could have a little better structure. It followed the syllabus directly but the overall direction of the class could be improved."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great course to take. It's relaxed but interesting, with good reading (and not too much), and a nice structure in terms of assignments. I would recommend it to anyone who's curious about the past, not just in early modern England, but in general, as this course is as much about ways of thinking and studying as it is about a specific period and place.",
    "Keith Wrightson is one of the world's leading social historians, which is itself a reason to take the course. The seminar discussion could have been livelier--but the readings are generally engaging, the topic is fascinating, and Professor Wrightson has a wealth of knowledge to share. I preferred the earlier weeks on antiquarianism, since the latter half of the syllabus (which focuses heavily on visual culture) started to feel a bit too centered on discussions of paintings and engravings for my taste. But that might be a plus, if you're more interested in art history\/material culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you're interested in early modern England.",
    "I would say that if you already have an understanding of the time period, you'll get a lot from the class. However, it is not an introductory class. The readings are great.",
    "I would recommend it to Anglophiles and those who want to better understand British History (or any history!) through looking at visual evidences. Overall a great class to take!",
    "Professor Wrightson is one of the most incredible and dedicated teachers I have had the privilege of being taught by. This course changes your perception of time and place in truly unimaginable ways and brings history come to life."
