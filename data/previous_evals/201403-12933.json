   "comments": [
    "This course was a very comprehensive and interesting look at modern German media, often comparing it to the USA. Professor Schenker is a very supportive instructor who has won loads of awards - she also brings candy to class! She answered emails and queries very quickly and always let us know about fun film screenings or whatever going on outside of class. This class was amazing for my language skills and there is a lot of class discussion. Attendance and participation are 10%, 20% is keeping a bi-weekly blog and doing some worksheets through the semester, 50% is based on the five creative assignments you do though the semester (writing a book chapter, making an advertisement, a radio show, an audiobook chapter and a newspaper article), and a final project or paper is worth 20%. You get a lot of freedom to explore things you're interested in. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I loved this class. Prof Schenker is a great teacher, who works hard to help you and is very generous with time and help. She's a very fair grader. This class is good for those who prefer working on papers and projects as it's no midterm\/final.",
    "Absolutely take this class! The workload is very manageable, plus Theresa makes it very fun. You get to watch German news (Tagesschau in 100 seconds) everyday at the beginning of class and learn about all kinds of media in Germany like blogs, TV, novels, newspaper, magazine, radio, etc. You compare these \"Medien\" to those in America, and as a final project you compare the two.",
    "Although this is a higher level German class, it's not necessarily a difficult class. You will continue to go over grammar, so even if you don't feel so confident in your German, you'll still do fine. Professor Schenker is very flexible (although not to the point that she's a pushover), and she puts a lot of effort into keeping everyone interested in the class.",
    "Absolutely a must if you are looking to learn a lot about contemporary German Media and culture in general. Theresa Schenker is an excellent Professor. Her classes are always informative and never boring. Take it. Your German will noticeably improve!"
