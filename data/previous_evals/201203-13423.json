   "comments": [
    "This course was a writing class about New Haven and Yale's relationship, architecture, and history together. There was reading for almost every class, writing assignments in class, and four main papers.",
    "Engl 114 seems like it is a good introduction to college writing, but had a surprisingly large amount of reading for each class. It was hit and miss when actually discussing the reading in class. Prof. Longmire was fun in class, but was only sometimes helpful when giving feedback on paper. Take this class if you are looking to learn how to write at the collegiate level, otherwise take something more interesting.",
    "English 114 15 is great if you're interested in architecture, you will learn how to argue about buildings and what you feel\/ see! If you're not, then look for another seminar as you may possibly struggle to write essays.",
    "I highly recommend taking this course and section! The essays are all very different and fun to write. The reading is never overwhelming and the Professor is a great friend to make!",
    "I would recommend Engl 114 for anyone who feels that they need a slightly stronger writing background before taking other writing courses at Yale.",
    "This is acourse about the social and physical history of Yale and New Haven, and the many interactions between those two environments. You learn about the history and development of the Yale student (and thus also the development of higher learning in America), but you also learn about the physical history of Yale's campus, about its architecture and architects; this gives the new Yale student a wonderful and healthy sense of place. Likewise, much time is spent studying modernism, city planning, and urban renewal in the context of New Haven and other American cities, which is both interesting, and very useful. Students are encouraged to get out and see New Haven, which is a wonderful message to counteract the continual admonitions from the Administration not to leave campus. I would heartily recommend this course to a fellow student, particularly if he or she had any interest in architecture or city planning, but also more generally, because knowing the history of a place\u00e2\u0080\u0094one's own place\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a useful and healthful thing when one has to construct and shape the future.",
    "If you like architecture, or is simply interested in New Haven or Yale, take this class! It's very difficult to get an A on the papers but it's certainly a very interesting subject matter.",
    "I would not recommend this class at all, particularly for internationals. It is not useful for us, it is a lie.",
    "It is an architecture and history course combined in disguise, almost. If you really hate either of the two topics, you are going to have a bad time.",
    "This is a great class for freshmen; every freshman should take it. Your writing improves and you become comfortable editing and rewriting your paper several times. This course also exposes you to the great writing resources the school has, such as the residential writing tutors, personal librarians and the archives collection."
