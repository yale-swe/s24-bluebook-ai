    "it won't be offered again, but it was a good class. interesting papers based on your own interviews. the topic was a bit broad and material was a bit all over the place, but the professors were great",
    "Fantastic topic - very, very poor organization. The course topics often seemed to be all over the place, and the readings - while interesting - often did not seem to be the best choice to represent the lessons we were trying to learn. The class was supposed to be a seminar, but it ended up having about 24 students which meant not everyone was able to participate fully. This course could work as a lecture, OR as a seminar, but not the weird lecture\/seminar hybrid we had. Course assignments included 3 papers (6-8pgs)and the final paper was a 12pg revision of one of the previous. The topics for these papers were often vague and not explained very well, leading to shockingly poor grades by quite a few students. I would take this class again if it were organized differently, but never, never again if it were the same as what I went through.",
    "This class left me, well, conflicted. The readings and papers are all fantastic: well designed, important, and interesting. I loved studying the nature of inequality in America and enjoyed the opportunity to actually do ethnographies. However class time was dull, and it was not clear why it went badly. Dudley and Bell are not bad professors, in fact Dudley is quite fantastic, but they did not do a good job with the particular dynamics of this seminar. It was also hurt by the large size, 25 students. I don't think they are teaching this seminar in this exact form again, but I recommend checking out in adaptations to it. And if you like the class dynamics, take it take it take it.",
    "This course was brilliantly organized, fascinating, inspiring, important, and fun. This may be the best class I have taken in my three years at Yale. Even though I am an upperclassman anthropology major, I felt that I learned a lot from this class about the discipline of anthropology - how it works and why it is important. Take this course if you want to learn about America, take it if you want to learn about economics, take it if you want to learn about how inequality works, take it if you want to learn about how anthropology works, take it if you want to learn about yourself, your classmates, and your family.It took a little while for discussions to come together, but that's the case in any large seminar. And by the end, the discussions were really great. Most of the reading was so fun andinteresting that it barely felt like work. The papers were challenging and took a fair amount of time, but I learned a lot from them.",
    "The course is as much about learning about the field of anthropology as it is the study of inequality in America. The questions raised throughout were interesting, and the readings in particular were helpful in terms of drawing a theme of how ethnography can inform certain issues.",
    "Overall, this was a great course, but it had a few problems. The grading for papers was harsher than expected, and the teachers' expectations were not outlined very clearly. The readings and subject matter were always very interesting, but class discussion suffered from the large class size. This is one of the few classes I've taken at Yale that actually changed the way I see the world in significant ways. Dudley is amazing and wise.",
    "If this class is 25 people again, do not take it. While the readings and assignments were good, discussion was almost always subpar. You just can't have a meaningful discussion with 25 people. Professor Dudley is cool, but did not lead discussion very well either. She and the TA Sierra had a pretty set way of how they interpreted everything, so there wasn't much room for debate--probably another reason why discussion was rather boring. It's sad because I really did like the readings and usually came to class excited about them, but during class I felt pretty uninspired. There's a lot of potential here, but I don't think it can be realized until the class size goes down.",
    "Take it for something different, especially if you've never done an anthropology class before. The assignments are really great and teach new ways of thinking and writing.",
    "I would not really recommend this class. The book list was interesting and I learned a lot, but the discussions and assignments were not great.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in taking apart the assumptions that underlie the way that individuals, groups, and systems make sense of the economy. The skills learned in the class are widely applicable to other fields. Also, the three papers for this class were very enjoyable to write.",
    "If this class is taught again, I would certainly recommend it. The anthropological perspective on inequality and economic ideology is truly fascinating. Yes, the class bent is irresistibly liberal and anti-neoliberal. Also, despite the quality of the readings, discussion sometimes sagged (surprisingly?) - partly due to class size, partly due to the lack of disagreements in class about what we read. But you'll learn some, become a better ethnographer, and become and a better writer."
