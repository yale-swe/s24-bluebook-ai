    "Yes, I would recommend the course",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an engineering elective. The class isn't terribly difficult, covers important topics in an interesting way, and is very well-taught.",
    "This course is a very effective overview of many biological topics relevant in the environmental engineering field, particularly bioreactors. My biology background is sorely lacking, so the beginning of the course felt a bit overwhelming, but once I firmed up my understanding of the material at the beginning, the subsequent material built on it very logically. I would certainly recommend this class, although it might be a lot of review for someone who, unlike me, has a background in bioreactors."

   "comments": [
    "As someone knew to Environmental Engineering, this class was a great intro to bioprocesses involved in the field. I am very happy that I took this class, as the concepts learned will be important to keep in mind as I continue with my research.",
    "I do not think that most of the material we covered in class is directly pertinent to my research, which is more based in physical chemistry. However, it is very necessary background for any environmental engineer. It helped me understand some of the material covered in the weekly seminars this semester."
