    "take it",
    "I would definitely recommend the course--I am a biology major and it was nice to have one course in my schedule unrelated to the sciences. I always looked forward to doing my homework and to going to classes. The first half of the class was a lot less work then the second half, but the second half was so much more fun as we painting larger and spent more time working on each piece.",
    "Definitely a lot of work if you want to produce something that you're proud of. But such a great time and it's awesome to have access to the studio.",
    "I didn't think the class really helped at first. We just painted over and over again and didn't really talk a lot about how to paint. But by the end of the semester, it was very evident that everyone in the class improved dramatically. It showed in our confidence and in our canvases. I am very happy I took this class. It really helps you see paintings in a stylistic perspective from brush strokes and uses of colors and different mediums and able to connect microscopic technique to macroscopic concept such as themes and motifs.",
    "If you have never painted before or been in an art class, I highly recommend this course. It is very low in expectation of artistic ability and a great opportunity to explore the art field. Outside work is manageable and not bad at all, with the exception of the final project.",
    "Take it. I'd recommend you have some drawing experience first, though. And have an open mind.",
    "I would recommend it if you want an opportunity to paint.",
    "I would recommend thus course to another student. It is a lot of work,m but you will learn a lot if you are willing to put the time in.",
    "Painting is a lot of work. That said, take this class if you want to learn the tools and techniques that will allow you to do oil paintings. I can guarantee you will learn a great deal in this class.",
    "The course was nice. Painting is a fantastic experience. The class is worth it to improve technique -- and we learned to use oils, which is a blast. As far as helpful guidance beyond handling brushes and media, though, it really depends on the instructor.",
    "Do it."
