    "Great course! The workload is somewhat high because of the weekly reviews, but I think the hard work is more than worthwhile.",
    "This course offers a wonderful overview to the current literature in the history of science, and affords useful insights into the politics and present directions of the field."

    "Great course! It might also have been useful to read more foundational history of science texts in this course (e.g. Merton, Shapin's early work, Weber). Many students in the program don't have strong backgrounds in the history of science, so adding some core texts for the field would be helpful. Although I really enjoyed the final assignments for the class, I think many students would also appreciate the option of doing an orals list. The instructor might also wish to provide more details in the syllabus about what is expected for the final assignments, just to prevent any surprises as the students plan their work for the semester. Thanks for a great course!",
    "This course helped me formulate some of the major scholars with whom I may wish to engage in my dissertation work."
