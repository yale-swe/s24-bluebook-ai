   "comments": [
    "Don't bother going to class. Read the textbook& lecture notes, but don't waste your valuable time listening to \"eeyyyy-eeeyyyy-eeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyy\" for 75minutes twice a week",
    "don't take it unless it is required.",
    "Yes, if you're an econ major. It's useful stuff anyway.",
    "A good way to understand data analysis if you are an economics major. If you aren't, don't take it.",
    "Atkin was a good lecturer and explained the concepts very well.",
    "It is a very useful class, take it if you need it",
    "If you have to take it, then make sure you study the hardest parts of the subject matter because the tests are weighted heavily on the hardest questions, so the curve is effective. If you don't have to take it, I wouldn't recommend it, the final project takes forever and you don't really learn much from it",
    "This class is deceptive. Having taken probability and being somewhat knowledgable about regression before, I thought this class would not be that difficult. Wrong. The material isn't that hard, but the professor makes the material difficult to understand. We are expected to know how to do many things that aren't covered in lecture, and part of the difficulty comes from a lack of conceptual understanding about things (ie...\"you'll get to this if you take 132\"-great, that tells me nothing about the concept).Also, the assignments can get ridiculous at times. There was a problem set that took upwards of 6 hours, and the regression assignment was a Minoan labyrinth to get through. In summary though, you might be better off not going to lecture, reading the slides, and striking up a good relationship with one of the TAs. Really though, the TAs are the saving grace to this class.",
    "This is a very interesting class. The content is useful and well taught, and the problem sets really help you understand the content. The midterm and final are a bit hard, but they are fair. The TAs were helpful. STATA was not well taught, but anyone who tries playing with it for long can learn how to use it. You will have a problem set per week the first 5 weeks, and they are long and you should review them with a friend. After the midterm the class gets a little bit more abstract and that is a little bit annoying, but if you understand the first part well, you will understand the second one. If you are into probability and statistics, this class is great for you.",
    "I would if you need it for your major. I'm in EPE and I'm using it as my statistics requirement, and I think it is one of the best stat classes that fills the requirement. I learned a lot about the methodological tools that Economists use, and it sets you up for Econ 132.",
    "The class lulls you into thinking it's just an easy stats course, but the Midterm and everything after it is extremely difficult. The regression assignment is a bear and very challenging. I routinely found myself completely lost during the lectures. Not sure how the other Profs are, but Atkin was tough to pay attention to. Don't take it if you don't need to.",
    "The first half was straightforward probability concepts from AP Stat but then when you get into the regression project, everything just gets really confusing. Definitely go in to office hours.",
    "Not necessarily just a class for Econ majors. If you want to learn basic probability or stats, this isn't a bad class. Still, it can certainly be dry at times.",
    "Obviously you have to take it for Econ. Good class. First half is statistics, second half is regression. Stata is a really useful tool to know, and I think the skills learned are also practical. Atkin is pretty good. Regression project is a lot of work",
    "Take it for its usefulness, but do not expect to enjoy it.",
    "If you are an Econ major you should take the course",
    "This is an extremely valuable class. I would recommend taking it if you're an econ major (obviously), a polisci major, or ever interested in working in business. Be warned though: it's extremely poorly taught.",
    "It was a requirement and not that bad, but don't take it if you don't have to",
    "Only if necessary",
    "I would not recommend Prof. Atkin. Although he is extremely distinguished and great in person, his lectures are unfortunately extremely boring--don't underestimate the power of that. This class has so much potential to be great from the subject material. But it just isn't and I suppose that's from the way it's taught. I feel bad writing this about some I respect but it should too be considered for a student.",
    "Good class for knowledge on stats. Psets fluctuate between easy and lengthy but its not too bad. Exams are kind of tough but definitely not the worst course in the Econ department. TFs are very helpful",
    "You have to take it for the Econ major. It's a challenging class so don't take it with Intermediate Micro unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Yes, learned a lot!",
    "AH. DO NOT TAKE IT unless you have to. It's similar to AP stats the first half of the semester but once you start regressions, the class becomes incredibly confusing and dry.",
    "I recommend this class. It teaches very useful skills and ways of thinking and it is easy to follow.",
    "The course it tough and is obviously a requirement for the Econ major. Its a good class and very applicable, I wish it was taught better.",
    "I do not recommend this class to anyone. Take it if it is a core requirement.",
    "hmmm. econometrics actually has very interesting applications, but you might not know if coming out of this class. I will say that the case studies are pretty interesting and DGA seems like a funny guy, but his class was dry, slow, and he often made simple concepts a bit ambigiuous. That being said, you can get out of this class what you put in...just keep in mind most people won't be putting much of anything at all into the course.",
    "Really good course to get your feet wet with statistics and economics. Definitely recommend. Sometimes the problem sets can take some time.",
    "This is your basic statistics course centered on economics. Take it if that's what you're looking for. Be aware that the regression assignment is interesting, but very time consuming and comes during Reading Week. The problem sets are often tedious, but overall this course is informative and is one of the most useful economics courses offered (from a practical perspective).",
    "I would recommend it because it is a useful skill set. However, I don't think anyone enjoys this class.",
    "Take it so you can be somewhat literate with respect to statistics. IT's also a much better class than the stat 101 sequence, so suck it up and take it.",
    "Econometrics is actually useful for real life; you'll notice what you learn here will allow you to actually know what's going on and contribute something in any summer internship related to finance, economic analysis, etc. The professor's lectures are sloppy, but if you put the time into the psets and pay a lot of attention to the second half of the course (regression analysis), you'll end the semester having learned quite a lot. START THE FINAL REGRESSION PROJECT EARLY and go to as many office hours as you can; don't underestimate it, it WILL consume a big chunk ofyour already tight reading period.",
    "This is a badly organized, badly taught course. I had heard warnings before taking the class, but I wasn't fully prepared for how bad it would be. Even for an Econ lecture, attendance was very low. Problem sets were unhelpful and frustrating, with a lot of busy-work style Excel analysis. The slides were confusing, and Prof. Atkin did not help with his opaque lecturing style. Sometimes it felt like Prof. Atkin and the TAs were at odds, simply because his slides were wrong or unclear. I think that if my TA had organized and taught this class, all of the material could have been covered in four weeks.",
    "You have to take it for Economics major so do it but otherwise make sure you take a stats course before this because the course goes very fast. Atkin is a good professor but sometimes gets carried away with the topics. Maybe it's because he's an expert in the field.",
    "Econ 131 is an introduction to probability and statistics, with a focus on problems related to Economics. The first half of the course focuses on probability while the second half focuses on Regression Analysis and statistics. I would absolutely NOT recommend this class to any student who is not an Economics major.",
    "Could be an interesting course but it's not. Just one of the requirements for the major. You actually learn some important skills with Stata and general statistics\/probability but the class is not taught in a way that would make the lectures worth going to. The problem sets take a long time.",
    "Where do I begin? It's a pity that the required classes in the economics major tend to be the worst ones. Lectures were simultaneously too slow and extremely unclear (Professor Atkin's lecture style didn't help), meaning that I often found reading the lecture notes on my own more practical than going to lecture. Problem sets were sometimes very easy, and other times extremely time-consuming and difficult. The exams weren't too bad, but the final regression project took probably 25 hours and perhaps summed up the nature of the course: not too hard but very unclear and a total time sink. If you aren't going to be an economics major, don't ever take this course. If you are, definitely befriend the TAs; they're extremely helpful and will answer all the questions you would undoubtedly accumulate over the course of the semester.",
    "exams are hard. curve is generous. statistics\/regression sucks. stata (the program) is cool\/useful. Only take the class if you are an econ major.",
    "You'll learn a lot about econometrics and statistics. Atkin can be a bit dull but he's very clear and will answer any questions you have. Getting to know your TAs and asking them questions on the psets and regression project is important. If you get Ben as your TA you are very lucky - he was great. The class wasn't that much work, except at the end of the term when we had a final and the regression project.",
    "Class is boring, but the content is actually kinda fun. I'll be honest, I slept through class, so I can't really speak for Atkin's teaching ability. His lecture slides are great though! Also the book is super helpful.Workload is also not bad. There were two bad psets, but the others weren't bad.",
    "Bleh tedious, especially the long psets, but useful and fairly interesting. Try to learn the theory behind what you do or you'll fail after the midterm.",
    "A good overview of some tools useful later in economics. Serious workload, especially at the end (a final and regression analysis within a week of each other).",
    "Good intro course, stata section very useful, lectures often useless.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "It's metrics. You like it or you don't. Atkin is decent and apparently the least of all evils",
    "Econometrics was a useful course, and if you're an econ major, obviously you have to take it. Professor Atkin, is very smart and a pretty good lecturer. The material covered in this course is not too difficult, and if you have any background in statistics, it will be easy. However, make sure to build about 5-10 hours per week into your schedule for the problem sets, they are by far the most difficult part of this course. That said, the tests are very fair, and not too challenging. The group project at the end of the course also isn't too much work, and I thought proved to be pretty interesting.",
    "It's definitely a useful class and is required by the major.",
    "Theoretically, a very useful class for the econ major, but would have been better if it was more econ-bent than stat-bent. Can't say I learned too much more besides what I got out of Stata. Interested to see what metrics 2 is like, and I hope it's not a crazy step above what 131 was. Would recommend taking if you have a solid stat background. Took this after STAT 230, and benefitted from the extensive work with R, regression and data analysis.",
    "It's like an intro stats course, but with more of a focus on regressions and the economy. If that's what you're after, I'd say go for it.",
    "It's an alright class. I would expect people will only take it for the major, and that's the only reason I would take it. But it's not that bad. It was tough for me to listen to Atkin's stutter, but I guess I got used to it a little. Otherwise, he's pretty good. Take it if you need to.",
    "If you're an Econ major you obviously have to take it but otherwise I think you'd learn basic stats and regressions better in other classes. That said, 131 is probably easier than most of these classes (apart from the regression project, which is very frustrating). Both exams were relatively difficult. If you've taken AP or intro stat you'll already know more than half the material in the class.",
    "As cheesy as it may sound, I definitely do see the world differently (especially claims made in the media, literature etc.).",
    "yes",
    "Definitely take this class. Lots of practical information to be learned and the professor is great.",
    "A better class than people make it out to be. It can be difficult, but Professor Atkins is good and you do learn useful things. The second half of the course covers regressions and Stata and is more applicable to research than the first half which covers probability theory and statistics.",
    "If this course is not required for your major, please don't take it. It isn't worth the struggle."
