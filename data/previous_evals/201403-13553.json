   "comments": [
    "G&G 322 is not a very good course, and I didn't walk away with understanding I was hoping for in weather and climate. It was also pretty boring and the weekly pop quizzes were a drag. And I don't think professor Boos is the best teacher. I might recommend trying the other class on weather and climate offered in the spring.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class to another student but if they had an actual interest in the deep science behind weather it would probably be a good class for them.",
    "Pretty good class. Learn a lot though it is more abstract and large scale with little about regional weather systems (though we do touch on that near the end). I thought it was a very hard class, but I had no direct G&G background.",
    "It's a good balance of breadth and depth in weather physics. I would recommend it to a student who wants to study a more practical side of physics, or a student who wants to develop an intuitive understanding of various physics concepts.",
    "Absolutely yes! Professor Boos is an engaging lecturer and the class is small and friendly. There are ~6 psets over the semester, so the workload is a bit light. That being said, make sure you're comfortable with basic diffeq (i.e. all the diffeq you would know BEFORE taking ENAS 194) and vector calc- most people who struggled were weaker at math. You'll learn a lot about how the atmosphere is structured, the physics behind precipitation, radiative heating, and weather systems. A really interesting class, and DEFINITELY ACCESSIBLE TO NON-MAJORS.",
    "Great class, I recommend it!",
    "G&G 322 was a great intro weather and climate class. I thoroughly enjoyed the practical nature of the course; next time I look at a weather map Ill have a much better idea of what its showing. I also think the course benefited from that small classroom feel. Theres something very refreshing about having a small class in which the professor is able to answer students questions. It aids with understanding and helps keep the lectures interesting. G&G was an interesting intro weather and climate class. Problem sets take a bit of time but only 6 over the course of the semester. Pretty solid class."
