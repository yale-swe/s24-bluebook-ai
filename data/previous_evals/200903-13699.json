    "I half seriously told someone the other day that this was the worst best class I'll ever take. For me the material in this class is so pertinent and important for understanding basic landscape scale environmental issues; the interaction of water in the landscape; and for developing environmental sampling design and analysis. I'm sure I'll come back to the material from this class again and again in my career - in that way it was the best class I could have taken. However, I really feel like the structure of the course and the presentation of the material needed a lot of polishing and that in some ways the material was more difficult to learn than it needed to be.",
    "The beginning of the class is tough if you don't have a good chemistry background - alot of info is thrown at you in a short period of time! but, overall you learn a TON from this class. There were two midterms and one final - so lots of studying at all times. But, having the midterms meant you were really learning the info. throughout the semester rather than leaving it till the end.The TA wasn't always great about responding to questions.",
    "For question 1 - readings could have been more textbook-based and more regularly assigned throughout the semester. Journal articles were useful but far too lengthy.",
    "1: Reserve readings were especially helpful.9: Could have used a couple of labs (maybe optional) for clarification of material. Great selection of field trips. Very helpful.",
    "This course was challenging and very rewarding; i wish more of my classes at FES were as comprehensive and fulfilling as this one. It was hard at first, but worth it.",
    "Question 3 - I think the problem sets were very useful to learning the material. I thought the Compounds assignment was a waste of time. It felt like Gabe was using his students to track down citations for a document he was trying to put together.",
    "I have no more comments to make.",
    "I really enjoyed this class - very important base for future coursework, and geared to the right people (professional managers). The compounds exercise was the only assignment that did not seem all that helpful to student learning, but since the resulting document is, it seems justified. I learned so much from this class, it still amazes me."

    "The field trips which coincided with the material we were covering in class. The requirement to go on 3 of the 5 was perfect, as I had some conflicts with a couple of the trips, but would have gone on them all. They were all very interesting and the ones I went on were very informative and helped apply what we were learning in class.I also liked having 2 \"midterms\" as it split up the material and assessed my understanding on a more periodic basis than other classes I am in. We covered a lot of material, and I don't think I would have gotten as much out of the course if we only had a midterm and final.The case studies discussed in class and in the readings were very helpful as well. Again, there was the benefit in applying the things we were learning to a real world issue. Especially the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and Long Island Sound case studies.",
    "Its pertinence.",
    "It provided a good overview of many different aspects of biogeochemistry, and the use of case studies made the theoretical information more understandable.",
    "Great overview of many topics related to water pollution. Feel like I have a good foundation moving forward.",
    "I felt that this course did a very good job of making future policy makers aware of the need to investigate the quality of scientific data.",
    "Material is very important to a career in water quality.",
    "I loved the material of the class, and found it extremely relevant and useful. The final exam, though difficult, was great--probably one of the most applied exams I've ever taken, and I can say that it was an incredibly useful exercise.",
    "-field trips were awesome-really important and interesting material. practical application of science.-problem solving approach not just info being thrown at the students-prof benoit clearly knows a lot about this stuff - a great resource to ask almost anything-highlights what is important to know, at the end you really feel like you have learned something and have skills to evaluate water samples that would have looked like a foreign language back in August.-loved this class!",
    "The material and relevance of material is very important. It should be required for all students. From that perspective I was happy to progress my understanding of subject matter.",
    "The way it was organized from start to finish. I learned so much about a subject I had no experience in. Because the class was so well organized, I was able to keep building on what I learned each week. The professor deserves a lot of credit for the way in which the course is structured, and how well he stays on schedule.",
    "The field trips were fantastic, I learned a LOT by visiting the Branford WWTP, the Living Machine, and the remediation facility.",
    "-learning how to apply the knowledge to water quality reports.",
    "The lectures and the field trips.",
    "Instructor lectures, focus on big picture instead of details (formulas etc). Synthesis questions and final exam exercise."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the topics covered in class seemed to be rushed. I would have rather had gone over the material more in depth and the ones mentioned quickly not at all if time was an issue.",
    "Updating case studies - they all seemed to be from the early 1990s (with the exception of Hubbard Brook which seems timeless). Updating the slides presented - many are old, unclear, and\/or don't reproduce well. I think a more linear progression of basic chemistry could be presented so that everyone gets on the same page and the material builds off of it rather than scatters around. Also I think more innovative ways to teach chemistry should be experimented with such as the use of models, video, etc. - trying to picture molecular interactions based off of Gabe's super rapid descriptions, frantically scribbling my own notes, and glancing up to look at poor powerpoint images or scribbled molecular formulas was like trying to read a foreign language on a speeding bus down a bumpy road....",
    "Some of the material was not explained very clearly and could have been better tied together.",
    "The first part of the course when we study chemistry - too much info. in too short of a time!",
    "I felt that many of the topics covered in class could have gone more in detail. I also thought that this class would benefit by giving the slides online rather than paper printouts.",
    "Problem sets were helpful, but too few and too lengthy to be a regular learning tool. Weekly problem sets would help refresh students on the week's material, or a regular lab session with lab reports would be useful in their place.",
    "More practice with difficult concepts (ie. maybe some additional (optional) problem sets and\/or labs).",
    "The field trips were, on the whole, great; and I enjoyed them for the most part. Driving 2.5 hours to see the Living Machine for 30 minutes was absurd. I would cut that field trip out in the future.Additionally, the Compounds exercise was completely useless in terms of increasing understanding of the material. It seemed like we were doing a favor more than anything else.",
    "-i think that there could be a lab component (maybe optional?) so that students learn how to conducts many of the tests that we 'evaluate' in results on paper, just to get a better handle on how the data is generated, etc.",
    "The TA. SHe wasn't held to a very high standard by the professor.",
    "Gabe's teaching style is so conceptual that it left many students feeling consistently overwhelmed and confused. I wish he could preface each topic with a little introduction about why it is important and which chemistry principles it builds off.",
    "I don't think that something needs improvement.",
    "It would have been helpful to have all the slides online to have access to all the pictures\/graphs."

    "If you don't have much chemistry in your academic background, hold on...its going to bea wild ride. I would suggest a book called \"chemistry for non-chemists\" that you can get from the FES library. Even after lots of study, going to all of the classes and review sessions I still found the material (especially some of the memorization needed in preparation for the exams - and the uber-rapid lecture style of Gabe) to be challenging. Good news is I felt that my tests were graded easily and so after lots of panic in the end the course was about learning - that I had a lot to write on the final exam was a reflection that I did learn a lot from the course - even though there was plenty that went over my head or I'll need to look up again in ten years when I actually need it. Go for it! it won't be easy but you'll see that it is very relevant material for understanding and stewarding our earth.",
    "I think it's a course everyone should take in environmental management.",
    "Make sure to REALLY pay attention in class and take good notes. I would also numbers the pages of the printouts he gives you so you can easily refer to them in your notes.",
    "If you have a lot of experience in the area, I do not recommend taking this course. However, for those with little scientific experience, I highly recommend this course. I also feel that for those who struggle with the material, the optional readings were very beneficial.",
    "Use the reserve readings--they're very helpful to understanding difficult concepts. If you have difficulty memorizing numbers, memorize the relationships between compounds instead.",
    "if you are at all interested in water and\/or pollution from hard science or policy perspective, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. it is awesome.",
    "Definitely take it, and don't be scared away by the chemistry aspect. It is very rewarding.",
    "Take detailed notes. Go on the field trips. Focus your energy on understanding Gabe's handouts.",
    "Don't forget about the other class readings after the first midterm.",
