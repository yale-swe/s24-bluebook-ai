    "I learned to use several resources available to me in order to figure out difficult concepts and problems.",
    "I learned that I should not take another math course during my time here at Yale. Even though this was a review of material I had covered in my math class in junior year of high school, it was still a struggle to handle all the details of this class.",
    "Knowledge of calc",
    "I took calc I in high school, but i did learn new concepts like autonomous differential equations in this class.",
    "I feel that I gained a good foundation in calculus that will help me in advanced math courses.",
    "I grew to be more familiar with calculus.",
    "I learned about derivatives and taking the slope of curves.",
    "Learned the basics of differential calculus.",
    "I learned how to use graphs to find the area of a function and then how to use a formula to find the same area. I also learned how to approximate values using different methods.",
    "differential calculus.",
    "I definitely developed the knowledge of understanding the proofs behind certain theorems which allowed me to apply them more precisely and accurately.",
    "I gained insight into how to interpret derivatives and rates of change. I also learned about limit calculations and how they relate to derivatives. These helped me to better conceptualize the concepts learned.",
    "Good for beginer level calculus",
    "I learned to master my Calculus skills and how to answer worded math problems.",
    "A strong knowledge of basic single variable calculus"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, it is a fine course for those beginning their Yale math studies.",
    "This is the most detailed math class I've ever taken because the way it was taught threw a lot of concepts at us on a daily basis. Due to this, however, there was not a lot of practice in class. The only practice was on psets and WebAssign which were for grades.",
    "A strength of this course is the broad range of calculus topics it covers. I think it gives a very good introduction to the subject of calculus. However, I don't think every student is on the same level. For example, many students have already taken AP Calc but as someone who has never taken it, a lot of the concepts presented were new for me and I don't think it was taught in a manner that benefitted students who were learning things for the first time. Also, the p-sets were considerably challenging and I had to go to office hours often to figure out how to solve the problems. This was really time-consuming, and it was difficult to manage spending so much time on math given my other classes. I think the p-sets should model more of the kind of questions we will see on exams. Also, I think more time in class should be spent on how to approach problems and using calculus in a practical manner. There were so many tips and tricks I learned from other people that helped me solve and understand problems and I wish they would have been taught in class. Overall, I was disappointed with the way Math 112 was structured for students who have never completed a formal introductory calculus course.",
    "Strength is it teaches the fundamentals But weakness is that it could be more engaging",
    "Strengths-- structure, lots of peer tutor help weakness-- class really long and boring and not engaging",
    "I feel like any STEM course, a lot of what determines success in the course depends on the student. The course was designed to help the student and I found that to benefit me a lot.",
    "This course has a strong teacher but could involve a lot more group work. Most of the class is just staring at a chalk board.",
    "On occasion the department assigned problems on tests that were unclear or whose solutions could technically be proven wrong. Some of the review sessions were also not as helpful as they could have been.",
    "The peer tutors were not always helpful, I preferred office hours because the professors knew how to tackle the specific questions.",
    "class was a little inefficient and learned more from the textbook",
    "I think more practice in class would've helped students be more engaged. I thought that my professor explained things well and at a good speed.",
    "The strengths were the support for students, continual practice that kept the skills fresh and the enthusiasm of professor Kutler. The weakness was the lack of student engagement",
    "The course helps to provide a solid background in math that is crucial to higher levels. It ensures that the students are aware of concepts. However, the course material presented in class did not prep you adequately for the final.",
    "Max Kutler is a great professor. Class is not curved though",
    "A strength was all the reviews available and the practice tests. However, webassign was not as helpful.",
    "A basic class. Not too interesting and not to hard but important stuff to know"

    "yes",
