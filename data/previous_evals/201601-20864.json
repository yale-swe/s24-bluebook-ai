    "See also 249 review. You will learn a lot from this class, from a bunch of people who really care that you do well in architecture. As someone who had never drawn (really) before, I have improved tremendously over the semester. That being said, this class is rough. It, along with 249, will take up your time and mindspace. It's not a field of study for everyone, but if you love it, do it. Strengths: - Great lectures that covered a long range of time. - Amazing professor, wonderful TAs who genuinely care about you and how you do - Well structured Weaknesses: - The amount of work often got in the way of learning. I understand that drawing more should mean that we get better, but we always get so focused on trying to do every drawing that the quality of the set as a whole decreases. Some drawings were more useful than others (extreme perspectives were great and I wish we had been introduced to these earlier on in the term. - The amount of group work honestly slowed down learning instead of speeding it up. I understand group work as a pedagogical tool, but enforcing ALL drawings to be group work became more a drag than a learning opportunity. People have different levels of commitment to this major, and different schedules because this is Yale College and not graduate school. - Non-Western drawing traditions were totally absent and it would be great to learn how others have approached drawing architecture.",
    "Draw with clammy cold hands in Dwight Chapel at three in the morning while the organ plays you the Requiem. Amaze yourself with your own creations. Don't look back.",
    "A rigorous and engaging class that will teach you to look at the buildings around you in a whole new way.",
    "To sophomores beginning their spring term planning on majoring in architecture: I know you're going to take this course regardless of bad reviews as long as it's still required for the major, because I was in the same position. Best of luck. To anyone else: don't do this to yourself. I love architecture, and there's so much potential in a class about drawing architecture, but you won't find it fulfilled here. There's no room here for any way of drawing except the one the professor and TFs want because it's the one they were taught is acceptable. Workload is unbalanced, criticism is at best pretentious, at worst hypocritical, vain, and unconstructive. Materials are also really expensive. Yale has so much better to offer.",
    "If you like thinking about space, then take this course! It is about expressing spatial ideas through drawing. It's quite a lot of work, but it's also very very rewarding. I believe that the skill you get in this course is valuable and applicable to almost all fields. It's stressful sometimes, but definitely enjoyable too.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone with a genuine interest in architectural drawing. If someone just wanted to learn how to draw better or was only sort of interested in the topic, I would discourage them from making the very significant commitment.",
    "Take the class only if you're willing to put in the time. It will be very frustrating at times, but you will make a lot of work youre proud of!",
    "This is an amazing class, you will learn so much, but you have to be very committed to the program, because it requires a lot from you.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course outside of the context of a prospective architecture major's required courseload.",
    "4-6 drawings due per week. drawings can take a lot of time. that is how i would summarize the course: a lot of time. often times, it can seem pointless.",
    "I can't say I would take this class if it weren't a requirement, as it is a buttload of work. A single drawing can take you 48 hours to finish, as they are never truly finished (which is something I learned in this class). Many of the assignments are collaborative, and I found it extremely tough to work on drawings with other students, especially those who operate on different schedules than I do. That is the biggest downfall to this class, honestly--the individual assignments were great and so much less stressful to complete. Again, I don't really recommend this class unless you are planning on majoring in architecture, but it was a pretty positive and rewarding experience by the end of the semester.",
    "Intense. Don't do it unless you are going to be major (or you just really really like drawing buildings and drawing architecture??? idk). Expect little sleep and much pencil dust. Precision and clean lines are important, so if you like to scribble (like me) you need to learn to rein that in for this class. Also, know that if you are not a major, all the sophomores will be stressed and jaded AF b\/c they are also taking analytic model and the two together = no sleep ever, working hard all the time, and also being put down for your efforts so... just be nice to them.",
    "A LOT OF WORK. You draw a lot and will probably have many late nights trying to finish the assignments. It's also very fun though. And you get close with your class through the work you're doing. And TFs are super helpful and awesome and you'll learn a lot from them if you seek help.",
    "Drawing Architecture for non-architecture majors is likely a very fun and profitable experience. That is not to say that it was not the same for architecture majors, who are required to take the course, but a large amount of stress came from trying to be successful in a course which was presented by the professor as \"if you put the effort in you will do well enough.\" The feedback received on drawings did not always feel as though it reflected the effort put in, especially the group projects, wherein one student might stay up all night while the other showed minimal effort. I did not dislike the class as a whole, and I do feel that I learn a great deal from it, but I do think that there are many improvements that could be made. A large part of the problem was perhaps the scheduling of the two required courses of the sophomore architecture majors, which made it almost impossible to get ahead on your work.",
    "They'll say just keep practicing, when you ask how to get better. And while I'm sure there is more to be said, it's true you'll be surprised at how much your patience is extended and your final products improved by the end of the semester. A bit expensive, but hey, welcome to Architecture! (Please don't mistake this for complacency, though, I think there's got to be a way around this. Any rich 154b alumni we could call up?)"
