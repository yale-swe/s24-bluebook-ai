   "comments": [
    "Do not take this class. It was terrible. Professor Drixler was the only redeeming factor.",
    "This course lays a foundation of knowledge that is important for any educated person to have. It was extremely interesting material - covering China, Korea, Japan and the Mongol Empire from 500 until present. It was not much work - 2 essays (one re-write option available) and a take-home final. That being said, the grading of the essays was very harsh and the essay topics were difficult\/boring.I'd take it if you're interested in learning a lot about East Asian history, but not if you're looking to maintain a great GPA.",
    "Absolutely not. Perhaps the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Find a different rest of the world history. Material is awful, grading is unfair, and the lectures are brutal.",
    "Good for an introductory course on East Asia. Not too good if you want an in depth course on the area.",
    "This is not an introductory class and the professors grade everything very harshly. I would not recommend this class.",
    "Very interesting and ambitious introduction to East Asia. There's really something interesting for everyone. It's fast paced and therefore cursory at times, which can be troublesome when it comes to the final. In all, a worthwhile and genuinely fun course.",
    "The readings are very important so be prepared to do all of them.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in getting a general understanding of East Asia empires.",
    "A solid survey of East Asia. The grading is a little harder than usual, as is the workload, but well worth it if you put in the work.",
    "A decent rest-of-world history class with some organizational problems. Empires of East Asia covers too much ground to remain cohesive, and lecture quality varies from exceptional to almost incomprehensible. Not too much work, especially Credit-D, but random assignments and assigned movies or definitions make it feel like a work-intensive high school class. Demographics: probably 40% East Asian non-history majors; 40% senior history majors needing a ROW; 20% randos. I would take another class in the department if you're actually interested in the topic and opt for another ROW if you're looking for a requirement-filler.",
    "Do not take it.Highest mark after the first essay was an A- (model paper) - only about 2 people in the class got it",
    "HIST 306 is a good course to take if you're interested in the area because you will learn a lot. The structure of the class partly makes up for the impossible task of covering such a large span of history.",
    "Never take this course, even if you need a rest of world credit for the history major.",
    "Yes. It's the best non-western history class I've taken here. Interesting texts. You get to learn about a long period of very important history from a variety of perspectives.",
    "HIST 306: Empires of East Asia discusses five key empires throughout East Asian history: The Tang, The Mongol, The Qing, Western Martime Powers, and Modern Japan. Discusison of empires is framed within what is essentially a larger survey of East Asian history from 500 to the present (what I believe the course was actually called the last time it was taught atYale). Overall, I found this course to be a very useful 'core course' in the greater development of my historical study at Yale.A few concerns: First, this course is often a fight between survey and more focused study of empire. I really feel as if the study of empire as a theoretical concept was lost to the more general core study of East Asian history. Some readings felt a bit out of place, and only relevant to the course description with a contortion of the standard definition of \"empire.\" Second, paper assignments were often limiting, as you have to abide by a 1000 word count. Finally, there was nothing flat out 'exceptional' in this course...just good information to add to your historical toolkit. If you are not a history major, you may want to look elsewhere.I must say, however, that Professors Hansen and Drixler are wonderful lecturers and form great complements to one another in greater discussion of the course material.",
    "no",
    "Since this course covered a large amount of history in a small amount of time, the material wasn't too detailed, but it gave a decent introduction to East Asian history and built a nice foundation for any future East Asian history courses.",
    "No. This class was way too scattered. It was trying to cover too much and for someone like me who didn't have any background history I was really confused. Also, by not having a textbook it was hard to conceptualize when in history the events we were talking about took place in relation to one another\/how they affected one another."
