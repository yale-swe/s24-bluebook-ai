    "Research Topics allowed me to get 1\/2 credit for being a Research Assistant in the Social Cognitive Development Lab. This was a great experience because I was exposed to various aspects of research and working in a lab. I participated in the lab meeting, ran children in our lab's studies at the Peabody, and did participant scheduling and recruitment. I met with my lab advisor to talk about certain studies in the lab and how to modify them.",
    "Definitely take this if you want to do more research!",
    "PSYC 495 is an easy way to get credit for doing research in a psych lab. It's a good option for students who can't dedicate 8-10 hours per week to a lab, but still want to do research for credit, as PSYC 495 only requires 5 hours per week. There is a lot of flexibility in terms of what you'll be graded on.",
    "Do it. Great way to get Psych\/CogSci credits, and it's just the best way to spend your time. Original research is important, and we should all have some experience in it before graduating.",
    "My experience was simply continuing work I did not want to abandon. I would recommend this course only if you have to do it, say for the senior requirement."
