   "comments": [
    "While the class has valuable content, it should not be labeled a comparative course. Comparison was not present in the coursework and was not encouraged in class. The reading materials were also fragmented and the connection between assignments not apparent. The professor, while very informed, does not lead seminar, he lectures. Students are not provided the opportunity to discuss with each other. I would not recommend it unless the student was looking for an extremely detailed account of the Rwandan Genocide rather than a comparative approach.If it was switched to a lecture I would recommend it.",
    "Fun and easy class. The readings are not well tied into class discussion. Because of that, you get out of the class what you put into it. Definitely do the readings: most are interesting and all provide valuable viewpoints on the genocide. Seminars were never boring but often drifted away from the syllabus.",
    "GREAT class!",
    "Would definitely recommend. Everyone should know more about this tragic event.",
    "Yes, especially as a core for EP&E as it is a different type of course to fulfill requirements.",
    "I recommend",
    "If you are intersted in the Rwandan genocide, take this course. It's a very political science take on everything, but hugely informative none the less.",
    "Good class if you'reinterested inthe UN and mass atrocity studies. Otherwise, it'll probably be a little weird for you, since this is a depressing subject.",
    "This class is your one-way ticket to understanding one of humankind's greatest tragedies from the victims, survivor, perpetrator, bystander, and historian perspectives."
