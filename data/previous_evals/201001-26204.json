    "The course is fantastic for those who need to review grammar after the AP. If you've got all the grammar down from AP, maybe you should take a different class, but this is definitely a great refresher.Take with Professor Seymour!! She has some not so great reviews from previous years but after a semester with her I'm convinced that she is and extremely helpful professor and cares about her students learning and doing well!",
    "If you want to really understand Spanish grammar, this is the class for you. Prof Seymour is very knowledgeable and also very warm and friendly. She's a Spanish grammar wizard. But be warned- this class is a lot of (busy)work. Don't take it on as a fifth class and expect to absorb the course content.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It is a good refresher on Spanish grammar if you're interested in that but I think there are many, many more interesting courses you could take and it's easy to go over grammar on your own.If you are a Spanish major, study for the test. This is a really worthless class if you have already learned the grammar before and the test is doable but you may need to prepare.",
    "Yes, if you're looking to improve your spanish in general and your grammar in particular. If you don't like grammar, look elsewhere."
