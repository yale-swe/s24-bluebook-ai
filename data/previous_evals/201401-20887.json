    "A really worthwhile course. The readings were interesting and Professor Camacho manages to make seminar both relaxed and really educational. You learn a lot about immigration and I developed a far richer understanding of the issues surrounding that. It also gives you a better understanding of New Haven. The CBL projects are helpful too, and not really stressful at all. I recommend this a lot, whether or not you've taken any ethnicity-related courses before.",
    "Can be a good introduction to the challenges that a large part of the American population face. The various topics could definitely be synthesized better, each week feels very separate. Didn't blow me out of the water.",
    "I would recommend this class! The workload is very manageable and it's a really interesting class for someone who is interested in questions of migration and \"Latino\" culture. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Readings each week, discussion once a week, final project due at the end of the term and it is a very liberal project - it is based on whatever angle you wanted to take from your volunteer service with the community organization you worked with over the term.",
    "This is an excellent course that will make you understand the Latino immigration issue in the United States from inside and out. You will expand your understanding with a combination of readings that include personal narratives, scholarly criticism of laws and policies, as well as a community-based project that will challenge you to engage directly with an immigrant community in New Haven. Highly recommended if you want to learn more about vibrant, resilient Latina\/o immigrant communities both in New Haven and beyond.",
    "This is a really wonderful course for students looking to understand not only their city but also the nation at large in an entirely new way, especially for those students who have never taken a Latina\/o studies class before. The community-based learning aspect of this class drives home concepts learned in the reading in a way I am convinced will stick with me much longer than simply doing the readings alone. An incredible academic and personal experience."
