   "comments": [
    "Solid class, a little boring in teaching methods, but it works. I'd recommend",
    "Multivariable calculus. An interesting math class and a fun step up from single variable, high-school calc. Take it!",
    "This class was definitely challenging but I also thought it was interesting. The tests were hard but also fair. There were some nights where the problem sets took hours and were a little stressful, but overall I would recommend this class because it is a prerequisite for many classes and is an interesting math class.",
    "Math 120 is a perfectly nice math course. If you enjoy math, you would enjoy this course.",
    "Math 120 is a challenging course that I would only recommend to those who are required to take it for a major or pre-professional program. The material, while useful, does not seem like it would be interesting enough to justify taking the course unless it is required.",
    "I would say basically what I said in question 1, that the content is very interesting but the class moves incredibly fast and that you don't learn where the equations you're using come from.",
    "Math 120 is a class that one definitely needs to do as many practice problems as possible for. Math 120 is a great class that really begins to show some of the real intuition behind mathematical theories and prepares students for any higher level math coursework they may take.",
    "I would not recommend this class in general. Jose was a good instructor, but the material was difficult to grasp conceptually, so it was difficult to use critical thinking to solve the problems. In previous calculus classes, it was easier to use the skills you knew to solve almost any problem, perhaps because the applications were easy to visualize and it was clear what the goal was in each problem. This is not the case in multivariable calculus, especially if, like me, you are not a STEM person. Many in the class already took multivariable before, which made it even more difficult to do well. I enjoy math (and thought I was good at it), but Math 120 made me realize I wasn't particularly suited to math as much as I thought. I took it because of the QR requirement, so I'm not upset about my performance, which was satisfactory, but it caused a lot of unnecessary stress.",
    "I took both MATH 115 and MATH 120 at Yale, and both were doable. In some respects, MATH 115 was harder, especially on the midterms. It always felt like the instructors were trying to choose difficult problems given that MATH 115's material wasn't too inherently difficult. That wasn't the case in MATH 120, where the tests were very fair.",
    "This is a very difficult class; while the problems sets themselves are not particularly challenging, the exams are very demanding and much more difficult than anything seen prior on either the homework or practice tests. Many people who take this class already have some background in multivariable calculus, which makes the curve much more difficult for those who only have math experience through Calculus BC.",
    "It's just a next level math class. Make sure you're integration skills are flawless before you decide to enter this course.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty basic introductory math class, and it is what you would expect for such a class. Average difficulty and average interest, as it would\/should be.",
    "Math 120 is your basic multivariable class. You learn formulas and apply them. The material is straightforward; if you have a good teacher, the class is not too bad. Note that there aren't actually all that many theory and proofs: this semester, ENAS 151 had more proof-based problems than we did. Overall, though, I would recommend.",
    "My experience with Math 120 was pretty bad. I think if I had a different professor, my recommendation for the class might be stronger. The material could have been interesting had it not been for the constant frustration of not understanding what was going on and why.",
    "I would not recommend MATH 120 to another student unless they needed it for a requirement. The course was not enjoyable overall and was not very stimulating for me.",
    "Essential material for future math and science courses so I would recommend it to any STEM student",
    "Very interesting material, and only one problem set per week."
