   "comments": [
    "I developed a thorough understanding of the nuances involved in diagnosing various disorders and how to think critically about issues surrounding researching various psychopathologies.",
    "This was my first official abnormal psychology course, and it was fascinating! I learned in-depth both practical clinical knowledge for diagnosis and the research that underlies the most frontier ways to understand\/conceptualize the etiology and phenomenology mechanisms of these psychopathologies. I also further developed skills in how to approach understanding psychopathology from multiple perspectives and levels (DSM, RDoC, cultural\/societal, individual, etc). I truly feel like I now have a broad, yet detailed, framework to continue to learn about psychopathology and build upon this. I loved the class!",
    "Learned a ton about the latest research in psychopathology!",
    "Taking Advanced Psychopathology with Dr. Jutta Joormann helped me understand the biological, psychological, and social factors associated with mental illness. The class also helped me understand what sort of questions can advance our current understanding of psychological disorders.",
    "I learned the theoretical basis behind various DSM-5 diagnoses, as well as recent research related to these conditions (i.e. consensus\/controversy in the field, novel findings, biological, interpersonal, cognitive, cultural aspects of psychological disorders). I also gained experience writing a grant proposal on a topic related to my research, which will prove invaluable in the future.",
    "I learned so much about psychopathology and the sometimes competing hypotheses that explain each disorder."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the readings for the course were really thoughtfully chosen and I wish the discussion time for student questions could have been longer sometimes!",
    "I thought the readings did a wonderful job capturing the spectrum of perspectives to learn about the psychopathologies and the weekly discussion question assignments were a great exercise to encourage deeper thinking\/processing of the content. I also found the classroom discussions enriching and interesting. Overall I found all the assignments for the course thoughtful and well designed to deepen our understanding, thank you for that! One small note, we often discussed emotion regulation and emotion as they are implicated in the disorders and I thought it might be nice to find time to discuss broadly the major theories and concepts in those areas of research. I realize that they are large areas of literature but perhaps a review article from James Gross or Lisa Feldman Barrett could help students who have less of a background in that? Definitely not necessary since I found this class very interesting and I learned a lot! (Written by Camila Caballero--I would be happy to talk about this further if that would be helpful!).",
    "Very interactive and discussion based!",
    "The class was amazing. One of the strengths was Dr. Jutta Joormann's understanding of the field and her unique insight on psychological disorders.",
    "Strengths: I thought this was an excellent class, and probably the most interesting one that I took all semester! The breadth and depth of recent and relevant research covered in the articles was impressive, and I thought that the lecture and discussion components of the course were both incredibly enjoyable and valuable learning experiences. This course inspired me to think critically both about topics covered in class, as well as my own future research interests. I also thought that getting a background in DSM vs. RDOC was very helpful, as were other repeated themes such as biological, emotion regulation, societal aspects of psychological disorders. I also enjoyed having Arielle Baskin-Sommers and Ty Cannon guest lecture for their respective areas of expertise. Two very minor areas for improvement: Some weeks I felt that the readings took me a very long time, and then we didn't get to all of them in class. However, I understand that there is so much material to cover and journal articles are often dense, so perhaps this is unavoidable. Also, I would have liked a little more feedback on the presentation\/ discussion section that I led, just because this was my first experience that resembled leading a class, and Jutta's feedback would be helpful for future presentations\/ TA assignments!",
    "I thought the course was well-organized and clear. Jutta's slides and lecture were extremely easy to follow and logically laid out. I thought that some of the readings were a little long but I understand that it's hard to get all of the information into one set of readings, so I didn't mind the length."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course because it covered a wide range of subjects with great detail, providing a really strong understanding of the major disorders we will encounter. It was great to delve into the theory underlying the development of various disorders.",
    "Absolutely, as evidenced by the comments I've noted so far in what I've learned and the usefulness of the assignments. I hope to use the final grant proposal assignment for my first year project and other fellowship applications!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who want to learn about the current knowledge in clinical psychology.",
    "Yes, definitely! This course is excellent for anyone who wants to think critically and better understand how psychological disorders are conceptualized and diagnosed.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in a discussion-based course on psychopathology."
