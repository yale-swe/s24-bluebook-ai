    "In this class, I gained knowledge on how to examine historical philosophical readings and tie them to the issues of the present. I learned about the significance of understanding the specificity of overarching concepts such as \"consciousness,\" \"love,\" and \"citizenship.\" Now that I understand the ideology of the Black Lives Matter movement fully, I have come to comprehend how its ideology conflicts and intersects with prevalent American ideologies.",
    "This course was a great overview of and introduction to the Black philosophical tradition, and provided insight into the ideologies, discourse, and thought at the foundation of the Black Lives Matter movement.",
    "I learned so much in this class! I'm a much much better writer with respect to academic papers, and I'm better at critical reading. It was also very cool to discuss material that was both theoretical\/philosophical but also very relevant and lived, even if the material was often really emotionally difficult (understandably). We had great discussions that I got a lot out of.",
    "I had almost no previous knowledge of the history of African-American thought and so was pleased to be taught this history. I especially learned a lot about forceful, profound rhetoric and the powerful moral effect this can have upon an audience, as I read many of the essays and speeches of the thinkers in the course.",
    "I definitely learned a more structural framework for writing analytical papers and incorporating source material in addition to understanding the history of African American thought as more of a conversation than separate ideas.",
    "This course helped me analyze past works of prominent Black authors from both a philosophical and political context. As a result, I developed my critical thinking and writing skills through essay assignments that made us identify and argue trends across centuries of work. Furthermore, due to the highly participatory nature of the seminar, I also developed my public speaking skills and was able to regularly practice synthesizing my thoughts clearly for the class at any given moment.",
    "This is the first course that I have ever taken that had a serious philosophy component. At first, I wasn't really sure how to think or write about normative ethics. However, this class helped me break down many of the ethical questions that I have with regards to race and racism in America. All in all, it was a great learning experience.",
    "I got an overview of the most important thinkers in African American history, and how their ideas tie into the contemporary moment.",
    "I gained knowledge on the history of Black emancipation thought and its contemporary implications. I appreciated the depth of conversation in the class, facilitated by Professor Lebron's effective and emotive delivery and receptiveness to input.",
    "This course allowed me to develop more philosophical and rhetorical reasoning skills, and exposed me to an interesting and engaging variety of Black literature that I had not been previously exposed to. Reading Audre Lorde and James Baldwin literally changed my lifeand the way that I conceive of intersectionality and race.",
    "I learned a lot through this course. I learned about both historical and contemporary thinkers. I also learned how to write in a philosophical tone, while maintaining the integrity of my writing.",
    "I learned to think critically about these issues, to turn literature into philosophy, and to think across time periods.",
    "LOL. Besides learning how to completely write philosophy papers 1) in the specific preference of a Professor only and 2) without any direction, I did not really gain much insight from this class. The reading list is amazing and everyone should read it, but the problem is that the course did not once mention anything new. Every week we did reading, including that of the Professor's manuscript, and came to class to \"discuss\" a summary.",
    "This class discusses the Black Lives Matter movement both from a current and a historical perspective.",
    "Students in the class learned about incredible black thinkers and philosopher who helped defined the fight for black life and humanity in this country. This was the first time I had actually read these authors and it was revelatory. The reading list is a must-read.",
    "I learned a depth and deep analysis of historical black thought, and how that contributes to our present moment. I also learned how to better organize my writing and arguments into cohesive, pointed thought."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course was that the readings offered were all amazing. Another strength of this course was that we were able to discuss all of the readings in each seminar session. One weakness of this course was that the expectations that our essays were supposed to meet were vague.",
    "Strengths: great readings, good discussions where students were engaged and invested in the material, good paper topics (broad enough for us to explore our interests). Weaknesses: I didn't mind reading Prof. Lebron's writing, but I wish we'd had more time to understand what general statements he was making. I felt like I got more out of the primary sources than anything else. The biggest issue I had with the course was the way the papers were logistically structured. They were sort of shoved towards the back end of the course, with two of them due in December. This left us with only two\/three-ish weeks to write a really really long paper (20pg), which is especially hard for those of us who have never written a paper this long and don't know how to approach it. I wish the first paper had been a week earlier, the second paper two weeks earlier, and then the final paper was maybe 15-20 pages, instead of a hard 20. Also, sometimes the logistics were unclear about when it was due and\/or it was hard to meet with the professor before each paper, given that he only really had one slot for office hours, which many people couldn't make. Don't get me wrong - loved the class and got a lot out of it! But these logistical issues often left me feeling unbalanced and confused about what was expected from me.",
    "The strength of the course is that the instructor is obviously very passionate and knowledgeable about the course and gave a very good sampling of readings from different time periods, gender perspectives, and types of writing (e.g. poetry, political activist writings, philosophy, etc.). His lectures were engaged, mostly clear, focused on the reading, and well thought out. He clearly thinks about this stuff a lot, and that is reflected in his teaching. There were two weaknesses in the course: First, I felt the instructor got a little side-tracked after the presidential election, which is totally understandable but it still seemed like recent politics distracted him from really focusing on the material at hand like he did pre-election. Second, he could put a little bit of work administratively, like letting us know sooner when papers are due, although I did find him relatively accessible during office hours, where he was always very helpful. Didn't always respond to emails either, although I suppose he doesn't have to. These are small things but are still important for students for the sake of academic planning, especially.",
    "Interestingly, the course runs like a survey course. Mile wide, inch deep approach, which is rare for seminars which usually stay very specific and confined to a small number of texts. But as a seminar, it's a lot more hands on and I'm forced to engage the material, I wish I would have done it freshmen year.",
    "The strengths of the course include Professor Lebron's vivacity and ability to keep the entire room engaged for the entire length of the seminar. His energy and clear passion for the subject matter allowed us students to give 110% of our own focus to the class. I also think using his own book chapters to frame the class was helpful in maintaining a semblance of structure, making the flow of the class smoother and easier to follow. Another strength would be the manageability of the readings - it was the perfect amount to expect for it to be completed every week and also had enough of a mix between first person accounts and external scholarship. One weakness would be that class discussions wouldn't always be as fulfilling as possible. One idea could be to offer students the chance to submit questions beforehand or Professor Lebron could share a few themes\/ideas for us to think about going into the following week's readings so that we come prepared for a more organized discussion in class.",
    "I genuinely enjoyed most of the aspects of this course. The supplemental readings beyond Lebron's book chapters were always intriguing and they left me wondering why I hadn't read them before. However, we ran out of time in some of the classes and weren't able to really cover all of the material. It felt as if we might have short-changed Hurston, King, and Lorde due to time constraints. I think that the greatest weakness of this course was the lack of conflicting perspectives. Often times it felt as though everyone in the class was in total agreement with the message that the class was putting forward, including myself. Sometimes the room felt a little bit like an echo chamber.",
    "The best part about the class was the syllabus. We read nearly all of the most important thinkers in African American history, and we read enough to get a good idea of their ideas, and their most revolutionary works, but it was also small enough that it was manageable to complete every week. Professor Lebron is very smart and was able to teach a lot on a topic he knows a lot about. However, he clearly had a point he was trying to get to and would kind of dismiss ideas that did not satisfy his vision. It could've been a lot better if he was more open-minded about the ideas the students were bringing into the class and allowed the time we had each week to shift directions if it needed to. It was definitely more of a lecture than a seminar.",
    "The class was very well thought out and reflexive of contemporary political realities. There was a real attempt to keep the class from being a mere academic exercise by emphasizing the dynamic nature of the issues and how they have evolved over time. Given this, I do think that Professor Lebron would benefit from having a TA. The readings and essay prompts were often late and this sometimes hampered ones ability to participate actively in the class. Also, given the sensitive nature of the topic, I felt that the class would benefit from a race sensitivity briefing at the start of the term, this is because I felt that a lot of the non-African American students were a little apprehensive about stating their views because of the nature of the class. I personally felt that the discussion would have benefitted from situating non-African American students within the context, not in an attempt to take usurp the attention, but to allow for more diverse contributions. Finally, I think that there needs to be clearer instructions about the papers, with guidelines about writing how to combine theories and make an argument. The final paper, which was supposed to be 6000 words, was definitely too long, with minimal guidance given. It would have benefitted from a required outline submission or a shorter word requirement.",
    "There are two main strengths of the course. First, the breadth and depths of readings assembled by Professor Lebron is extraordinary, striking the perfect balance of intellectual survey and critical analysis. The two midterm papers had extremely interesting prompts that made the best off what we read and learned in class. The syllabus and authors were a large part of why I took this class, and my, oh my, did they not disappoint. Second, Professor Lebron is an apt and engaging seminar leadera combination of critical, kind, and funny that suggests natural talent for teaching and writing. You will never be disengaged during seminar sessions, as the knowledge and enthusiasm that he brings forces students to be prepared. At office hours, he is helpful at suggesting further topics to look into and going over work that you have already done so that you can improve. He was also actively engaged with talks and lecture on campus, which were instrumental in adding new dimensions to what we learned in class, as well as making him as a resource more accessible. That being said, point blank, Professor Lebron was a terrible classroom administrator. For the weekly Wednesday seminar sessions, more than once, he didnt post the readings until Sunday or Monday nightmaking it incredibly difficult and stressful for students to budget their time throughout the week. It just seemed silly given the fact that compiling and scanning all of the readings for the entire year could have been done in an hour or two at the beginning of the year. Regarding assignments, their exact due dates were often unclear, and Professor Lebron was slowirresponsibly slowin posting the prompts. 2000 word assignments are not unreasonable, but when they are sprung on you, seemingly without warning during midterms, they are unnecessarily stressful ordeals. (That being said, the first midterm paper was handed back swiftly and with great feedback, the second midterm paper was handed back with limited, but passable comments.) The final (6000 word!) paper was poorly conceived and poorly advised. Not one week after turning in our second midterm paper, we basically needed to start work on the final paper. This would not have been an issue, if it was not for the fact that Professor Lebron had posted on the syllabus that final paper prompts would be postedand the proceeded to never mention a final paper prompt. The due date wasnt even solidified until the last session, and when it became clear that we had to conceive our own topics, he had to limit office hours to 10 minutes max in order to accommodate everyone that had questions. As a student and a teacher, I very much believe in the philosophy of setting a high standard for your students to aspire toward. But you simply cannot responsibly expect your students to reach the scholarship and research of a near-thesis length paper when your own conception of it seems to be constantly and arbitrarily evolving, and you dont provide them adequate support. It was simply too muchand I imagine he doesnt have the capacity to provide feedback or attention to each paper himself. I imagine that a lot of the administrative blunders were the result of this course being taught for the first timeand can be forgone after this first year, and when he is no longer under pressure to fulfill the millions of (unreasonable) requirements of scholars undergoing the tenure process. His raw teaching and analytical talent bodes well for the future of the course and his place at Yale though. (I.e. please keep Christopher Lebron at Yale.)",
    "The strengths of this course were the seminar style of the class and Professor Lebron's knowledge of the subjects we covered. I did not observe any weaknesses.",
    "By using the professor's book to guide the syllabus, we were able to pursue more guided assessments of the readings we were assigned, which made the process of reading much simpler. I also appreciated the focus on one thinker a week, which allowed us more time to grasp their thoughts and ask more thoughtful questions. Simply by virtue of the events happening in the world, the class was aided by the ability to see the real world applications of the philosophical topics being discussed. That being said, the lack of the context would have made the class feel harder to ground for students, which may have made it harder for students to push through some of the ideas using real world examples. It would've been nice to link the readings to more fundamental theories of philosophy rather than thinking about them solely within black thinkers, just to give the ideas more background as well.",
    "This is an excellent course. It occasionally veered too far into philosophy for me, but that is a personal preference.",
    "Strength: no other course quite like it at Yale. Teaches the nuts and bolts of af am persuasive lit and how they undergird current BLM. Weaknesses: very little feedback on coursework so most of my learning happened through my presence\/attention in class without being augmented by guided writing. The administration of this course left a lot to be desired. A lot of this could be solved easily by putting clear paper deadlines \/ word counts on the syllabus, titles\/citations of the books on the syllabus, and putting the \"prompt\"'of the final paper on the syllabus so students who miss an announcement, or even those who don't, aren't left scrambling at the end to come up with a prompt for the final paper. It would remove much unnecessary anxiety from the class, which detracted from its intellectual power.",
    "strengths: truly cannot locate any besides the reading list (and only the list, not the course's dealing with it) weaknesses: -students write an actually illegal amount of pages according to the Yale College regulations for a normal undergraduate course -discussion seemed more like a lecture with students pop corning to try and guess the specific word Professor wanted us to just know -office hours were poorly positioned for many students -professor often ran out the room as SOON as class ended when plenty of people had questions or comments for him",
    "Professor Lebron put together a strong syllabus and each class was very engaging and interesting. However, due dates were not on the syllabus, so it was not easy to plan ahead of time. As a result, the class ended up being very back loaded, which was not clear from the beginning. This class was very interesting, but I think would depend strongly on who ended up in the seminar.",
    "I loved the reading list, the manuscript, and the form of teaching, which was essentially the socratic method. There were some ways I thought the class could really improve though. First, I would appreciate more student discussion and debate regarding the topics. The Professor was engaging, but I think we would have learned a lot by exchanging ideas with fellow students. Second, many people who did not have experience with philosophy essays and incorporating secondary sources struggled to write papers up to Professor Lebron's standards. It would be great to have more structured overview or introduction to successful philosophy essays. Lastly, there was a lot of writing and the prompts were not clear or precise. Especially during finals week, this was a tremendous work load.",
    "Strengths: Learning material that is not typically taught, and relating that to a very salient topic of modern day. Engaging with social movements from a philosophical sense is extremely unique Weaknesses: Sometimes doesn't engage with the modern day enough. I know that wasn't supposed to be the point of the course, but sometimes it felt like it was just tone deaf to not talk about what was going on in America"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in black political thought and the power of civic rhetoric. I would not recommend this class to a student who wants to discuss the current tactics of the Black Lives Matter movement in-depth. The title of this course might be misleading to some, and Professor Lebron made that clear in the first sessions of the course but this course is mainly about past historical thought. You mainly have to draw these connections in your own papers outside of the seminar sessions. The seminar sessions are mainly devoted to discussing the readings, and their significance to the movement.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in the BLM movement, Black philosophy, Black literature, etc. I found it incredibly refreshing to focus on only Black writers for an entire semester, and learned so much about the tactics and strategies Black writers in America have been using over time to reach the ears of white audiences and convince them of their arguments.",
    "Yeah, the material was amazing and the topic is so relevant to life and politics right now. Sometimes Prof. Lebron was a little disorganized with respect to expectations around papers, but overall he knew a lot, was funny, and kept us engaged with good material.",
    "Yes, but only if they are interested in African-American activism and the history of black thought. Otherwise, they would probably be bored.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to other students interested in a survey of some prominent black thinkers in American history.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you haven't taken any classes on race, this class will blow your mind. If you have, I you will be less impressed. However, that's not to say you won't learn. If you come into class with a basic understanding of the arguments you will still learn how to argue about ethics in a way that you can't really get from any other class. If that interests you, you will enjoy this class.",
    "It depends on what you want out of the class. Take it if: you want a 101 on African American History\/Studies, with the ability to read and think through some of the most important writers with a really intelligent Professor who knows these works better than you would if you just tried to read it by yourself. Don't take it: if you want a seminar where your ideas can really matter, and where you get the chance to speak and really develop where the class goes every week. Professor Lebron always has a direction he's looking to go every week and will often look for people to raise their hand only to provide the word or phrase he's looking for. It's more of a lecture with classroom participation than it is a seminar. That said, I still got a lot out of the class, it just wasn't entirely what I thought it would be and it could have been better. Oh also you have to write over 40 pages so definitely make sure to factor that in because it's a TON of writing!",
    "I would recommend it if they are comfortable with engaging in discussions about race and have an interest in understanding African American history and thought. I would not recommend it if the individual is uncomfortable with difficult discussions or wary of racial discourse.",
    "Although the Making of BLM needs some tweaking to its syllabus (i.e., dont take this if Professor Lebron hasnt decreased the length of the final paper or gotten rid of one of the midterm papers) the class has a solid foundation. The syllabus and authors were a large part of why I took this class, and my, oh my, did they not disappoint. Professor Lebron is an apt and engaging seminar leadera combination of critical, kind, and funny that suggests natural talent for teaching and writing. You will never be disengaged during seminar sessions, as the knowledge and enthusiasm that he brings forces students to be prepared. At office hours, he is helpful at suggesting further topics to look into and going over work that you have already done so that you can improve. He was also actively engaged with talks and lecture on campus, which were instrumental in adding new dimensions to what we learned in class, as well as making him as a resource more accessible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Any student that is interested in the Black Lives Matter movement or African-American philosophy in general should take this course.",
    "Absolutely recommend this course! This is probably one of the most interesting (if at times saddest) course I've taken at Yale. This is an especially interesting introductory class for people who have a general idea (or little idea) about black thinkers throughout history and views on where black are today in America. It introduces you to critical writers from various time periods, a spread of ideas (some that even disagree) and various angles to think about the issue. This class was so critical to helping me articulate (and in some cases revealing) new ways of thinking about some of the important conversations surrounding race in the world today. And Professor Lebron is an engaging and fun teacher who keeps class fun but makes sure you learn. He's also fair and upfront about his grading approach, which is great for people who are new to writing in philosophy.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other students, with the caveat that this is clearly a philosophy course, and not a social science or current events course.",
    "If Lebron doesn't put the paper deadlines and word counts on the syllabus, pressure him to do it first thing in the semester. He played it by ear this semester and it caught a lot of the students out because the end of 6000 word term paper is squeezed into the last few weeks... #stress. That said, the class is eye opening. If you're anything like me, you won't look at politics, af am persuasive lit, and BLM the same way.",
    "literally no. never. do not waste your time. Everyone should read the reading list!!! But the course is unnecessary. If you have already taken philosophy and political science courses and can deal with Professor Lebron (from experience) then go for it and power through the work I suppose, but that is the single, solitary situation in which I would recommend this course. It forces students to write three papers, including one final 23 page paper without any direction, that are incredibly taxing. The total number of pages written was at least 36, and the maximum Yale College allowance is 25 pages. Ridiculous. The course was at 9:25am, so if you would be making yourself get up then it is also absolutely not worth it. (If you walked in more than 90 seconds late Professor would stop the ENTIRE class and stare directly at you with the most disdain and disrespectful look I have ever experienced. It is incredibly uncomfortable for the person arriving and everyone else in the room, and honestly felt disrespectful. People will sometimes be late, and less than 10 minutes is especially not worth this.)",
    "I would suggest this class to another student if Professor Lebron revised his syllabus to make it more evenly distributed throughout the semester. The discussions and the readings were very interesting, so overall the class was a great learning experience.",
    "I would recommend this class because I believe the reading list should be mandatory. It was difficult, but learning about these authors was worth it. The topics are so relevant in a Trump world rife with police brutality, mass incarceration and encoded racism. It is important to understand historical context and the genealogy of black thought in regard to the issue of racism in America."
