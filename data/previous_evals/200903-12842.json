    "The studio was relatively well coordinated. The premise of the studio demanded load bearing masonry construction and the integration of below grade parking garage. These unusual constraints for a studio exercise were treated with disdain by my peers, however I felt it was an intriguing idea. Landscape and environmental issues took a back seat in this studio.",
    "The studio was a very challenging and instructive Learning exp\u00e9rience. But I think I learned the most from the discussions with my fellow studio mates than the instructors. It was a true challenge to have to sit down as a studio, late nights, and share all the new information we would find and really try to understand this new language we were confronted to.Both instructors of course seemed completely unaware of how schizophrenic, and to say it simply, whacky, the entire studio was. We were made to follow a pseudo-medieval looking masterplan, designing a classical Library \u0096who knows in what histories that d\u00e9finition of \u00ab classical \u00bb was based in- and a \u00ab vernacular \u00bb building while dealing with two instructors with entirely distinct notions of \u00ab classical \u00bb, and dealing with interventions by people concerned by entirely different issues such as the future of Washington DC\u0092s urban fabric or the Library typology."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "shorten the initial exercises.",
    "The most valuable aspects of the studio were the pinups with Leon and the juries. Understandably, Leon\u0092s wealth of knowledge was tremendous. His sense of humor and unique approach to classicism allowed for entertaining discussions. He also compiled engaging critics for our juries.",
    "There were too many pin-ups, which were a waste of time, and the intrusion of critics such as David Schwartz, actually put a lot of people off track. Additional exercises were also quite useless. This is a studio where there is a lot of material to catch up on, from basic drawing conventions to a multitude of precedents (the precedents that were actually chosen for the students could have been much better chosen), to structural issues, so jumping into the project immediately would have been much more useful.",
    "I found the most rewarding aspect of this studio to be the individual desk-crits with Leon. His personal attention to us as individuals was wonderful and rare for a visiting professor.I found the least rewarding aspect of the course to be the days when Leon would lecture to us by showing sketches.",
    "The most valuable aspect of this course were the mid and final reviews, as they brought other, often more practical opinions to the discussion. I also found David Schwarz's visit very valuable for the same reason. The least valuable aspect were the small exercises that involved \"correcting\" an ugly design or object. I felt the manipulation of our precedent studies was a better way to understand ideas of proportion and the grotesque. While I found the precedent studies valuable, especially the creation of the lexicon, I also feel that the precedent studies should have included buildings that were of the same program as our studio project (libraries).",
    "The precedent study was useful to learn a certain architectural vocabulary but it took too much of the semester (almost six weeks). I do not feel like we had enough time left to design the two buildings that were required and present them with a high level of resolution."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this studio was the opportunity to engage the foundational documents of the discipline in a design capacity. It is one thing to read Palladio\u0092s Four Books or to study the work of Soane, but it is a whole other exercise the draw, model and create using Palladio and Soane. This was a refreshing semester that should be required of all new students to architecture.",
    "Both instructors were very interesting people to be acquainted with, but once again, inadequate teachers, but that is only an endemic problem to almost all studios at YSoA. There was a specific problem where I believe George Knight had a very high tendency for micro-managing and was rarely able to look at the bigger picture or trust students with their overall schemes.",
    "The studio overall was very strong in how Leon and George introduced the materials and laid out the schedule for the semester. I found the amount of time spent on precedence research was excessive and the fact that we had to present that research at our midterm was not only a waste of time (and money to print all of the drawings are such large and rediculous scales) but also prevented us from discussing other ideas that we could then use for our final project. Every studio does precedence research and that should be evident by the work generated by the class and shouldn't need to be presented during a midterm or final jury.",
    "Initially, the most exciting aspect of the studio for me was that we were designing a public library. But unfortunately, very little time was spent discussing the library program, or any real programmatic issues. I understand that the studio was not about that, however, the project was on a real site, with a real program. We should have at least looked at some library precedents before starting our projects. I think the studio was good at addressing more formal and urban issues. But architecture is more than just how the building looks.",
    "The greatest weakness is the high costs associated with printing and the often unjustified work demands. The demands for presentations and pinups were often very expensive, without adding value to the presentation, and often were not thought through in terms of scale and context. The idea for production for production sake and cost for cost sake are not a responsible way to manage student time and resources. The time could be spent on learning through lectures or discussions or readings.",
    "The critic and the assistant for this studio had no interest in a conversation on the nature of the language we were asked to use in a contemporary context. George Knight had very little knowledge of the theoretical aspects of classicism and on their impact on other styles. He was not open to any type of conceptual talk and was only interested in the blind application of classical rules."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to begin learning the language of Classical architecture. I believe I still have a lot to learn, however I have gained an incredible experience. I am very appreciative of this opportunity. I now have a much deeper appreciation and understanding of the parts, proportion and movements within the classical language.",
    "My expectations for the studio were to gain a more insightful approach to urbanism and planning from Leon. While I don't feel those expectations were met, I feel that I received a very intense and perhaps unexpected education in how buildings can relate to a site and the environment they are in. As a result, I really enjoyed the semester and feel I learned a lot from Leon.",
    "I did not know what to expect, but I was hopeful that Leon would be flexible in his interpretation of traditional architecture. Unfortunately, I often felt my design voice was stifled by Leon's ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Leon\u0092s strengths were his wealth of knowledge and his liberal approach to classicism. His weakness was his lack of communication to the studio. His visits were infrequent and we had no way to contact him between visits.George\u0092s strengths were close grasp of the specific parts of traditional building and his close relationship with the studio. He was always around for formal studio meetings and informal support sessions. His weakness was his lack of contextual nuance with classical language. He had a much higher preference for suburban\/rural New England vernaculars which did not work in an urban environment like DC.",
    "Leon is an incredible talent. While I do not share his views on architecture and urbanism, I greatly appreciate his conviction towards them and enjoyed all of my time with him. Leon's greatest weekness is perhaps also his strength. His thoughts on modernism and contemporary architecture are very much in conflict with my own but I appreciated him standing up for what he believes in.George is a great assistant teacher. He is very reachable and is always present on studio days. I find George's main weakness to be his lack of inspiring the class. There isn't a lot of excitement from George and often times the class can feel as if he is asking us to produce things that don't matter instead of inspiring us to create new and exciting ways of creating things. While it might be nice for an office to all produce drawings and models that look the same, the studio should be run in a way that allows for each student to create their own identity and means of expression.",
    "I think one of the greatest weakness of both Leon and George was that they would not allow for much exploration in the studio. I understand the studio was about teaching students about classical architecture, but this is our last year! The teachers should be aware that at this point students want to explore their own design voice. Many of us were willing to take Leon's ideas and expand them so that they fit our own agenda. Unfortunately, that was not really possible. The teachers should have been able to help students define their own interests, instead of requesting each student to solve the problems in a similar fashion (i.e. the dome here, the tower there, the parking entrance this, etc.).",
    "the studio was mired in confusion from the start. we studied precedents of classical architecture, but none of an actual library which was our program. leon had a specific idea of what we should do but as students we weren't sure what that was. george on the other hand had his own ideas of what our projects should be. the whole experience felt like a missed opportunity to me. also, i found that leon was not really willing to engage with the students but instead keep us at a distance and wouldn't discuss important questions with us like \"why are we doing classical architecture?\""
