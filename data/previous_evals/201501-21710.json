    "Solid chem lab course. Lots of colorful products! Make sure you understand the experiments though; the reports can take a while to write if you're unclear on your results or what they mean. Not a course for slackers, but not unreasonable. I didn't take it WR, but I think they only had a couple extra assignments to do. Maybe don't take it if you don't need a chem lab, but if you do, this is a pretty good one and corresponds well with CHEM 252 lecture.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the instructor, Dr. Parr. He is very committed to helping students learn - he is patient, and is willing to spend a lot of time answering questions one-on-one and explaining concepts. Work-wise, this course is usually relaxed, with the majority of the work coming in the reports (which may take quite a bit of time; I felt a bit of pressure when writing these). Dr. Parr stresses the development of scientific writing skills and the reports are to be written in journal article-style (and so the standards are a bit different). While the reports may take quite a bit of effort, they are graded fairly, with a focus on improvement in the writing rather than immediate perfection. I would recommend this course to someone interested in the material and also for someone who would like to work on such writing skills.",
    "This is a good lab course - much less stressful than the orgo lab sequence. The reports are long, but since you have two weeks to write each one it's definitely possible not to do it all at the last minute. Dr. Parr is very helpful and friendly, so get on his good side early on and your life will be much easier. Labs usually don't take the full four hours, which is nice. The lecture on Friday afternoons is a pain to go to, but it's not bad to sit through. If you need an advanced lab credit, take this one!",
    "This is a lab class with around 4 lab reports that will take a bit of time (5 hours or so) and a 2500 word paper if you take this with the writing credit (which you totally should do if you need a writing credit). The labs are great, although some can be a bit long, and the reports are not that bad, although you will certainly be challenged. You can always ask for and receive copious amounts of help from Parr, who makes the topics much easier to understand. If you need a general chemistry lab, I would totally take this class. It's dope, like actually.",
    "CHEM 251L is a really good lab course that actually teaches you how to write in a scientific manner. Dr. Parr is amazing and really helpful. You can email him and he will answer any question and he will even read over drafts if you give him a couple of days in advance. Make use of him as a resource.",
    "This is the perfect writing credit! Professor Parr is very helpful and the material isn't too challenging. At the end of the course, you will have learned a lot. It is also a really good advanced lab and I would definitely recommend it to every chem major! This lab works well with Chem 252 as the material overlaps a lot. It will be better to take the lab and the course during the same semester."
