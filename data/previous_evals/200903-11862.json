    "Take it if you want to learn Persian. You will learn Persian. But be warned: enrolling in Fereshteh's course is something like getting on to a roller coaster. She will berate you furiously if you don't meet her expectations, learn the names of your friends and family members and ask about them all the time, and sometimes cackle wildly for what seems like no reason at all. A great experience but not for the weak-willed.",
    "I would recommend the class to those who want to learn Persian. Fereshteh-khanom really pushes all of her students to do their best, and you will learn a lot in three months. You have homework everyday and over the breaks, and while it doesn't take too long, it sometimes is frustrating. She really emphasizes attendance, so if you are prone to sleeping in ever so often she may end up hating you.",
    "Farsi is a beautiful, and more importantly, easy language. If you can put your ego aside to tolerate berating from the teacher, this is the language for you. You will really be shocked by how much you know at the end of the semester. It's a lot of work for a language course, I hear, but nothing compared to Arabic! Start with this one if you're interested in both. As much as I hate the absurdly early hour every day, it's nice to be up and about and our class has really bonded.",
    "It's a pretty good class, but has a lot of organizational issues. There was no real textbook, just a disorganized course packet, which is a big obstacle as far as learning Persian, but you still come out knowing a good bit. It's not that hard, but there is daily homework."
