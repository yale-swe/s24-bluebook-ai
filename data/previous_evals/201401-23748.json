    "I really enjoyed Wendell's class this semester. She is amazingly knowledgeable on the subject and makes the learning environment a nice safe place to explore not only projections, but theatre making as a whole. We were able to express our designs in a multitude of ways using whatever tools felt most comfortable to us yet challenging us to diversify our design toolbox.",
    "I like the relaxed format of the class, and I love Wendell. She could perhaps have a clearer lesson plan. Or maybe it just needs to be communicated to us more clearly. Instead of looking for videos aimlessly, maybe the class can be more organized. Also the TA plays a very important role in the class. I hope we can make sure that there continues to be a dedicated TA assigned for the class who can help organize the house lights and presentations, and technical requirements. Having the whole class to wait for someone to find an adapter is annoying.",
    "I'm actually not entirely sure what I learnt in projections class this semester. The two classes that stand out in my mind are (1) the cameras and lighting class with Erik Pearson, and (2) the projections surface class with Wendall where we experimented with both theatrical and non-theatrical surfaces and how they interacted with projections. I would have very much liked to circle back around to where we started at the beginning of last semester where we were asked to storyboard projections for Heidi Chronicles. At the end of the day, I personally am very interested in the possibility of having the skills to be a professional projections designer, and it would have been useful to talk about video and motion graphics in the context of a show.",
    "I wish we could do some actual projection design for the different type of theatre( play, opera, musical, dance). Maybe for the second term of first year, after students get a sense of story telling and learn a bit software from digital imagery course. we could have two weeks one play(musical\/opera) project. we could open to all kinds of ways to present ideas. They could do storyboard to illustrate projection image. They could do a scale model to show where the projection surface could be and how the space relate to the 2D image. We could also use the theatre stage to coordinate the image with the moving performers. At the end of term, we could divide students into group. and each group should finish one major project.The whole piece would be around 15 minutes, it could be performance in front of the class with the projection image. it could also be a installation piece with sound only. If the students want to design set, costume and lighting for it, they are welcome to do so.",
    "I had a hard time doing my \"I paid attention\" project for Visual storytelling because every thought I came up with about the exciting things I learned on Thursdays seemed to come from Projection Design. Everything was presented in little digestible portions. I would have liked more Wendall this year but enjoyed hearing her talking about all of her work and when to use and when to refrain from using projections. Daryl needs to figure out what he's going to teach us or just call the class off. There was a lot of silence on days with him as the substitute. Camera class with Erik was very useful. The day about projection surfaces was also quite useful. The music video project was super-fun.",
    "There should be more time given to the class and to critique. Possibly more assignments."
