   "comments": [
    "It was a wonderful language class. I would suggest it to anyone who wants to become proficient in Hebrew.",
    "Yes, I love the language.",
    "Great class, learned a lot, but sometimes felt unbalanced. At times, we learned a great deal of grammar too quickly, at times a normal pace. Same with homework: generally a lot, but sometimes unpredictably overwhelming. Still, one should take it.",
    "A wonderful experience - lots of work, no doubt, but Ayala is a sweetheart and learning a language in a class with a single-digit number of students is great. Grammar work is sometimes assigned without much explanation, but I appreciate that we get through so much material as a result of having to learn some things on our own time.",
    "As a wonderful course that I would highly recommend"
