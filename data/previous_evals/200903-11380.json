   "comments": [
    "If you are considering this class you probably know what its about anyway. There are some prompts in the beginning, but they are very general and flexible. For at least half of the class you work on a project of your own design.",
    "This is an amazing but very rigorous class, both technically and conceptually; take it only if you are serious about painting a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend Painting Studio 1 with George. He is present and engaged in the class and will likely have a great TA.",
    "Speaking as a non-art major, this class was demanding but extremely rewarding. Compared to other art classes I've taken at Yale (including Robert Reed's painting class), I think I put the most time and effort into this course, in and out of class. the other students in the class were very talented artists which really pushed me to challenge myself. Also, the instructors held me to the same level which was challenging but helpful. This class is in many ways an independent work course, but there was more specific direction at the beginning which I appreciated because it got me started in the right way. While there was less direction later in the semester in terms of assignments, I also found there was less indication of expectations from George which was sometimes a little frustrating. There was also a nice mix of visiting other studios and going to talks by visiting artists. I would recommend the class if you're willing to work hard and put in a lot of hours outside of class.",
    "I would recommend this class but not with George Rush. With this professor the class ends up being more frustrating than productive because of the confusing critiques and combative relationship he has with his students. If you want to paint and you want to have freedom though, this is the only class to take. Don't take this class if you are looking for help improving your technique or learning how to use oil paints, the class is very conceptually focused.",
    "George can be a difficult during the creative process and hardto communicate with. He is, however, a good critic."
