    "GREAT. definitely take this class if you're interested! it's a lot of work, but it can be rather zen-like. you just have to plan out how much time you'll need for each project and be prepared to mess up and start over a lot.",
    "This is a really great and fun class. It is a comprehensive introduction to the methods of silkscreen printing. The crits are kind of technical at first, because you are learning what you can do with silkscreen, but then the projects get broader and people get more creative. I liked the project prompts-as well as everyone's really interesting responses to the prompts. The printmaking mindset takes a while to get used to, especially if you're not a habitual printmaker and aren't used to process as a part of image-making, but Marie eases you into it well. The final project was also a lot of fun!",
    "This class takes time like all other art classes, but it is very rewarding. It's cool because you learn a lot of technical skills that would be hard to learn on your own, but on the other hand, a lot of the projects really depend on how well you can manage the silkscreen process itself, and not the aesthetics - be prepared to be frustrated when many technical things go wrong, and expect to spend a lot of hours outside of class in the print shop!",
    "you learn and make projects using different silkscreen techniques.",
    "This is a solid introduction to the process of screen printing. We covered many aspects, learned several ways to approach various issues with screen printing, and were encouraged to use screen printing thoughtfully--why printing over drawing or painting? Why screen printing over some other kind of printing? I felt that by the time the final project came around I had come around to screen printing and now feel that it is useful to me in my personal work. The workload doesn't have to be heavy--but I found that the more I got myself to actually go to the shop, the more I got out of the class and the projects."
