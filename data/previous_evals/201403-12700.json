    "*I am a non-engineer: Please keep that in mind when reading. This course is a lot of work. 8-10 hours a week at the beginning, probably a bit more near the end. That said, it's also a course that has been a perfect capstone to my time at Yale, a course that taught me a ton of useful lessons about how building things actually works, and a course that I will remember fondly long after I graduate. You'll bond with your team, even if (like me) you aren't in a great position to contribute to building things. Frankly, it's worth keeping the rest of your schedule light to devote maximum energy to this class -- the extra work you put in here could literally save lives. But if you can take it, and you have the time, absolutely do.",
    "This was hands down the best course I have taken at Yale. It was also the most time consuming by far, but that was because the experience was very much one where you get as much out as you put in. Joe, Jean,all the TAs, CEID staff, and various SEAS mentors were as equally invested as the students, and pushed us to make the awesome product they knew we were capable of. I learned an incredible amount, through both the design process and the in-class lectures, about mechanical design, intellectual property, and entrepreneurship. One of the biggest take aways for me in this course was becoming aware of the possibility of pursuing similar projects--there are so many resources and people willing to help if you have an idea you are passionate about. If you love to design and are willing to let a class take over your life, APPLY. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, but you should probably take it when you are taking 4 courses (not 5+) because it is incredibly demanding. Also, if you have no technical skills at all, I wouldn't recommend this class because you really won't get very much out of it if you can't contribute to the team in a meaningful way. If you don't have any technical skills up front, then be prepared to learn!",
    "By far the best class I've taken at Yale. If you are at all considering it, TAKE THIS CLASS. not only do you get to work on awesome projects that can really help people, you also get to do cool stuff like go for a tour of the hospital operating rooms and hear from all sorts of people about medical devices. This class is a lot of work, but it's worth it, as you're not just doing problem sets or writing essays; you're actually working on building a real medical device that can help improve people's lives, so the work is all very enjoyable, to the point where it doesn't really feel like you're working on a class, but are instead just doing it because you want to.",
    "TAKE IT!!! If you get in, be smart about it and structure the rest of your schedule to allow MENG 404 to take priority. This is an amazing chance to collaborate with peers and physicians to learn about the engineering process within Medical Technologies.",
    "MENG 404 was the most rewarding engineering course I have taken. Aside from all the technical skills you will inevitably develop, you take away from this class first-hand knowledge of the design and product development process and relevant tools. Be aware that there is a lot of writing and a lot of work required to develop a device to the state that it can be put into first round trials\/testing. However, there is a ton of support and there are entire teams of people to help you. You certainly learn a lot about medical devices and the professor are fantastic and truly committed to the students in this class. Definitely recommend applying for this class but be aware this is a huge time commitment.",
    "I feel incredibly lucky to have had the chance to take this class. It is such a unique opportunity to be provided with mentors, tools, money, a connection between the Engineering and Medical schools, all with no expectation of forfeiting intellectual property rights to the university. Lectures are extremely interesting and cover a very broad range of aspects of the medical device world, with guest speakers large-scale industrial manufacturers, a visit from an FDA agent, to a lessen on entrepreneurship from start-up founders. This class swallows your life especially around final presentation time, but is such a rewarding experience. Would take this again and again if I could.",
    "Here's your chance to actually do something. Take this class if you want to learn about medical devices and the design process that goes into making great prototypes. The teaching staff and course material is inspiring.",
    "MENG 404 is easily the best class I have taken in my three years at Yale so far. I would highly recommend it, but you have to be willing to put in the time and effort to enjoy it. This course is an enormous time commitment, but entirely worth it if you commit- you will learn so much and have this huge sense of accomplishment at the end of the term.",
    "In this class, you will discover the bottomless pit of problems that is the healthcare space, and learn how easy it can be to make the world a better place through engineering (and a good bit of effort). This class is a whirlwind -- you will probably spend more time on this class than any other, but you will leave it feeling INCREDIBLY proud of what you've learned and what you've made. The teaching staff are incredibly passionate about you and your project's success, and you will find yourself deeply motivated to make the best output product possible. If you're technical, you'll probably learn more technical stuff, but if you don't know much about healthcare, you will be blown away by the world of people waiting for you to solve problems that will meaningfully improve the human condition.",
    "404 was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. There were so many opportunities to interact with experts in the field and develop a better understanding of how medical devices are developed. The prototyping component of the course was invaluable in terms of learning to use Solidworks, the machine shop, and the printers. I've never felt so motivated with classwork as with the development of the device or so supported as with Joe and Jean as professors.",
    "If you can get in, take it. Easily one of my top three favorite classes at Yale. I loved learning about the medical device industry, but more importantly, I felt like I benefitted enormously from the design portion of the course. Working with a team to create a medical device -- an actual, tangible device -- in only 15 weeks is a practical learning experience unlike almost any other opportunity at Yale. Be aware that the class is a very significant time commitment, especially in the final few weeks of the semester. Don't take it unless you're able to put in the time that you'll want\/need to in order to make your project happen."
