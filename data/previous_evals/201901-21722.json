    "I learned about Iconicity, Materiality, branding, and how groups interact with their sacreds and profanes.",
    "Greater understanding of iconicity and its role in shaping our sense of meaning.",
    "I learned so much from this course. I gained a much deeper understanding of well known sociologists' theories and how they can be applied to real life. The material from this course is applicable to all aspects of life, and after this course you'll second guess everything around you!",
    "All about icons from a sociological view didnt realize how powerful they were",
    "I went into the course having no idea what aesthetics was and being very confused about the first 1-2 readings. I came out of the course with a much better sense of aesthetics as a field of study, and much more literary awareness (syllabus includes Marx, Benjamin, and other big\/interesting names I had never read before). The course developed my ability to give a cultural critique and think critically about icons in culture and materialism.",
    "I learned how to read material objects sociologically and think about the iconic consciousness of the world around us."

    "This was my favorite class that I've taken at Yale. It's a lot of work in terms of reading, and the texts are certainly not easy, but it's so rewarding and relevant.",
    "I would have been interested in hearing more about the final projects my classmates were working onmaybe future iterations of the course could incorporate a presentation on the last day of class, or something like that.",
    "Very interesting and intellectually demanding. A little intimidating for those without much theoretical background and are on the shy side.",
    "Weakness contemporary philosophy was majority men\/white men Strength good material first half",
    "Alexander was a really interesting guy, after a few weeks I started to realize that he was actually low key famous in the field of semiotics\/sociology. He was pretty funny too (in a dry way), and wasn't afraid to blatantly roast people (myself included). Another person taking the course with me gave the course the superlative of \"Biggest Roasts.\" And not only did he roast students, but also authors, which was fun...he also roasted (pun intended) the poor Cathedral de Notre Dame (\/tear) and its architecture. Dicky, the TA, was also great! Some weeks had way too much assigned reading, which was a huge bummer (I'm looking at you Dicky!). It made it difficult to really get a hold on all the assigned material for those particular weeks. Most weeks, however, were fine, and the reading was very doable for a once-a-week class. The papers were fine, but I think the second prompts were less interesting than the first prompts.",
    "Weaknesses included communication between teaching staff and students."

    "ABsoluley. This was my favorite course I've taken at Yale thusfar. If you have the opportunity to take this course, do. The texts are great, and Jeffrey Alexander is a God amongst men.",
    "An interesting course with a quirky, learned professor. Lots of dense theory in the first few weeks, so be prepared for that.",
    "Yes! Lots of reading and writing, but definitely worth it for how interesting the material is.",
    "Yes if you like conversations about materialism and consciousness",
    "Would definitely recommend this course! If you're a STEM person like me, I recommend taking it to finally read big names like Marx and Walter Benjamin, as well as learn about the ideologies of other big names. It's also really interesting because it gives useful tools to analyze and critique society.",
    "Yes really interesting!"
