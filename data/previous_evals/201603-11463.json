   "comments": [
    "Learned some good experimental techniques, and how to read through dense lab handouts.",
    "I learned very little in this lab. The only tangible skill I developed might be how to LaTeX lab reports (this is neither taught nor required, but the beauty of LaTeX made the drudgery more bearable).",
    "I learned how to set up and conduct experiments on my own in a timely and efficient manner. I also learned a lot on how to write effective lab reports.",
    "This class helped teach general lab skills and solidify the error analysis skills developed in 205. The class involved more interesting topics that required more time to understand. The course definitely provided me a better grasp of some new and old topics by forcing me to spend more time understanding them to write and execute the labs.",
    "I learned how to do lab work relatively independently, collect and analyze large amounts of data, and above all, write scientifically. While the department (and all of the science departments, really) could have provided an course on academic writing with a focus on scientific writing, this lab course provided the context in which to practice writing intelligently and concisely about data and theory, as opposed to 205, which for the most part had been the attempt to fulfill a page requirement.",
    "This course offered more practice in lab techniques - taking data, determining uncertainties, following procedures, etc, along with familiarizing with physical concepts quickly before experiments and synthesizing data into lab reports afterwards.",
    "I was able to actually put what I learned into practice in a variety of physics experiments.",
    "I got a hands-on survey introduction to a number of advanced concepts in physics (e.g., the Meissner effect - I got to experience it and understand it at a basic level, but definitely not in any detail). The most important thing this course offered me was interaction with the physics resources (I am speaking primarily of the accelerator).",
    "PHYS 206L taught me many of the physical principles and experimental methods that explain and investigate natural phenomena of our world. Just a few of the experiments in which I learned were that of superconducting materials and the understanding of their critical temperature as well as their electromagnetically repulsive nature, that of the the logic\/integrated circuit with input-output computations that used simple yes and no conditions to derive a multitude of functions inherent in all electronic devices, those of the electron diffraction and charge-to-mass ratio which revealed the electron-wave qualities and the electrostatic\/classical force balance within a magnetic field as governed by their respective theories and equations, as well as that of the Van de Graff accelerator, leading into the study of nuclear interactions between accelerated particles and a foil target, from the scattering angle dependence and impact parameter to the energy conditions set forth by their collisions, resulting in a series of nuclear reactions only visible by means of counter electronics. The course was dense with available and learnable skills, namely the usage of equipment and exposure to important tools such as the liquid nitrogen in the superconducting lab, the Van de Graff accelerator in the nuclear reactions lab, and much much more. Beyond the lab itself, the course helped me develop the skills needed to work with a partner and construct a scientific report. Collaboration with the balance of work and appreciation of learning together was a weekly emphasis. The lab reports required sensible content and reasonable structure. I learned to work with my partner and write comfortably about our conducted experiments, learning the methods, materials, results, and discussion sections of the report, and the careful integration of diagrams to fully demonstrate the significance of our work.",
    "As an extension of 205L, this lab class helped reinforce what I had learned in previous physics classes, and allowed me to apply what I had learned to other labs. Furthermore, the lab allowed me to recreate experiments which provide the basis for the topics of study in theory.",
    "I learned how to write a good five-page lab report, and I also learned about several other common laboratory techniques which I had been introduced to in Physics 205L."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course has huge variabliity in labs and TA's. Some TAs knew what was happening in the lab, some were just like \"sorry, never read that one\". Some of the labs (D1, D2, D3) were hugely technical and required backgrounds in electronics not taught in any physics lecture sequence. Overall, I have a lot of repsect for what it was trying to do, but it left some students floundering at times.",
    "This class has some enormous issues. First of all: circuitry. I took both Baltay's intensive introductory physics sequence (260-261), as well as Electromagnetism (430) with Iachello. In neither of these courses did I learn anything practical about circuits (OKMaxwell's equations give you everything you need to know in theory, but is that knowledge alone sufficient to build a transistor?). So, why does a lab for the physics major cover circuitry so heavily, when majors never learn about circuitry? I can say confidently that spending three hours in the lab with an insufficient lab handout did not bridge this gap in knowledge. Either circuits should be covered more in the major, or this lab should be fundamentally altered. This issue of insufficient preparation applies more generally to many of the lab topics. I often did not understand the math or physics pertinent to a given lab. The lab handouts do not provide enough information to learn this essential information. And because this is only a half-credit class, who is going to put in the time outside of lab to properly learn the theory? (As a side note, the lab handouts are not digestible and would be much more useful if rewritten in bullet-points as opposed to muddled prose.) Finally, the lab structure provided inadequate help when it was (always) needed. The TA was generally the only person in the lab room and often did not know the answers to our questions. Professor Irons was extremely helpful, but often not available. Professor Urry had absolutely no involvement in the lab.",
    "This lab does allow for a lot of freedom, however many of the lab guides are misleading or confusing. Some labs didn't work at all, like the transistor lab, or didn't provide the proper information needed to fully analyze the data, like the nuclear reactions lab.",
    "The strengths are it teaches you a lot. You are left to learn independently but often had to wait for Professor Irons or the TA to give you a briefing, which would be nice to have before entering the lab so that you could digest the contents of the lab ahead of time.",
    "I met almost no faculty members in the course of this lab class, and the few I did meet and learn from are not listed in this evaluation. While the point of the class is to teach self-sufficiency, and there wasn't really any conduit by which to interact with the professors for more than fifteen minutes at any time, perhaps the \"bye-weeks\" of the semester could be replaced with lectures or some other method by which to interact with the professors and discuss future lab work, or the current fields of experimental physics.",
    "The strength was that lab wasn't rushed, and many were interesting. A weakness was that I hadn't had a good introduction to electronics or circuits, and neither had anyone else I spoke with. I think an electronics for physics majors course (or at least guidance in an appropriate engineering course as a prerequisite) would be helpful.",
    "Straightforward - the selection of experiments was great and a lot of them were very interesting. Although TA was occasionally trumped by questions, instructors (especially Stephen Irons) almost always quickly handled experimental issues.",
    "Loads of fun labs and we were able to choose which ones we performed. Definitely one of my more time consuming courses, given the weekly write ups, but nonetheless it was increasingly engaging and enjoyable. One of the best moments was working with the Van de Graaf particle accelerator.",
    "I loved the choice we had in which experiments we did.",
    "Physical Measurement II allowed me to choose the experiments in which I was interested. This is a strength that enlightens the student to study more of what s\/he wants or needs. There is also much to choose from, and it gives the student a wide variety of physics to consider to study. My lab partner and I, for example, found ourselves focused on the studies of the electron, charges, and electromagnetic theories with experiments on electron diffraction, electron charge-to-mass ratio, and nuclear reactions and collisions. Our options however were limited to classical mechanics, light polarization, x-ray diffraction, and many other experimental studies. With every one of our labs I was able to practice observation and application of mathematical relations. More significantly however, was the writing and collaboration I upheld throughout the semester. Lab reports trained our communication of experimental methods and results toward the Teaching Fellow, not to mention our understanding of the framework and important physical concepts. Learning to work with ones partner from the very start led into necessary skills, from being able to partition the experiment, if needed, to providing knowledge and explanations at tough sections of the experiment, especially if partners were individually on two separate levels of understanding. These skills are applicable in many life scenarios, making its emphasis in PHYS 206L a great strength. Lastly, a significant aspect of the physical measurement courses, especially 206L, is the opportunity to use state-of-the-art equipment that physics students would otherwise not be able to use. Yales undergraduate Van de Graff accelerator comes to mind as the hallmark for this type of strength of PHYS 206L, but the electron diffraction apparatus and e\/m apparatus are additional examples of why the class is powerful for student exposure to the physics-laboratory. The weaknesses in this course are few but clear. Not every lab was available to the student despite its selection at the beginning of the semester. This resulted in my choosing of a less diverse series of lab experiments. Additionally, some lab manuals were out-of-date or not applicable to the given equipment. I would notice some of the directions given by the manual to be unclear or not applicable because of the lack of literature with appropriate experimental\/theoretical values and\/or the materials that were available for the experiment. Though we could still complete the experiments some were less complete due to these issues.",
    "This course serves well as an extension of theoretical physics knowledge, and is good at providing a variety of experiments to perform. Therefore, while the class provides a challenge, it's justified through the application to the theory in class. However, the class is a bit intense for a lab class, with five to seven page lab reports due weekly.",
    "The course was generally good. The labs were usually interesting, and writing a lab report every week helped me to become more comfortable with scientific writing. A few lab handouts, however, were very poorly written and need substantial revision. Lab D1 (Transistors) was so long that no group we talked with was able to complete more than half of it in three hours, and several of the circuit diagrams provided did not work. The second week of lab J3 (Nuclear Scattering) was also poorly written; in particular, it was almost impossible to find the information necessary to calculate the energy loss of the reactions products through the Beryllium target."

   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. However, choose your labs carefully. C1 Digital logic is easy. D1, D2, D3 very hard. Rutherford scattering hard but rewarding, not impossible. Fourier analysis easy. Choose a mix.",
    "I would not recommend this course, unless significant changes are made to the teaching structure and course content (c.f. \"strengths and weaknesses\"). If you do have to take it, be sure to talk with those who already took it to figure out which labs should and shouldn't be done.",
    "Its a lab course. I felt that it was a bit more work than 205 but the experiments were more interesting and we got the freedom to work on our own. Choose your lab partner wisely and you will have a good semester. The lab reports aren't too bad if you don't wait to do them. Overall, if you need to take this, its not too bad, but if you want to take it for fun, be prepared to put in a decent amount of work.",
    "If you're in this course you most likely have to take it. Although it requires a lot of time and lab reports can be tedious, you learn a lot and it is definitely worth the time. By the time you're done you definitely have a better understanding of the topics you work on. You also get to pick whatever topics you want which is nice.",
    "This is the first \"real\" lab course in the physics department; any lower-numbered lab course teaches almost nothing compared to this one. This may be a strange indicator of how effective this course is, but unlike 205, I could tell friends what I was doing in my lab course (using a particle accelerator, replicating famous watershed experiments like Millikan's Oil Drop and Rutherford's Gold Foil) and feel very proud of being a physics major; on the other hand, pre-med students taking some 100-level lab course would complain to me about having to play with pendulums and masses on springs for three hours, and learn nothing new. In short, choose this class over the others, because it alone is worth the work and can accurately be called \"lab.\"",
    "If you have to take PHYS 206L for the major, it really isn't that bad. There are some pretty fun experiments (definitely sign up for superconductivity (super cool), electron diffraction (easy), x-ray diffraction (short and easy), and polarization of light).",
    "I'm pretty sure no student takes physics lab for fun. That said, 206L is a step up from 205L, and the suite of experiments is much more impressive and much more interesting. Along with that, lab reports are a step up too - a lot more work and higher quality expectations than 205L.",
    "Anyone in engineering or physics should take this. It's fun and we got actual experiments.",
    "This course makes you excited about physics. You get to do so many COOL experiments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. One can find the benefits of this course, developing the capability to write lab reports, learning to work with a lab partner, finding the exposure to Yale physics equipment, enough reason for taking this course. To the student taking physics, chemistry, or biology courses, PHYS 206L provides a very technical side to experimentation and a close analysis of learned course concepts. For example, X-ray diffraction was an experiment frequently discussed in BIOL 101 to explain the discovery of the DNA structure as well as protein structures in general. Diffraction analysis however is better understood experimentally through the PHYS 206L course and graph data illustrating the wave diffraction between crystal-oriented particles. Various other PHYS 206L labs relate chemistry and physics course topics involving experimental discoveries with even more frequency. A student may truly appreciate the scientific discoveries discussed in these classes through the experiments found in Physical Measurement II.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who needs to take it for a requirement, but has a steady inclination towards physics. I think that it requires more work than desired for a lab, especially since taking 166 would be much easier and would likely result in a better grade.",
    "Take it if you have to. I haven't taken 165\/166 so I can't compare, but I really didn't think this was bad at all. It's only 9 labs, but the writeups are kinds of a pain. START EARLY.",
    "This course is required for most physics majors, and it was fairly enjoyable. I would recommend it. Other students should be aware, however, that the workload is definitely equivalent to a full-credit course"
