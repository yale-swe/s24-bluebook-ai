    "Understand field theory and learn how to solve polynomials using radicals.",
    "This was probably the most sophisticated math class I have taken thus far. While anyone to reach it is no doubt very comfortable with proof, 350 still took some care to make sure the class remained accessible to those with less proof experience. This class did not. The material is critical algebraic material, and inherently fascinating.",
    "Learnt about fields and field extensions, and how to work with them.",
    "Tons! Fantastic course",
    "I expanded on my knowledge from MATH 350 by learning more abstract algebra concepts; in this case, Galois theory, the study of field extensions. I learned a lot about how field extensions work, their connection to groups, and applications to solving polynomials.",
    "I learned a lot about Galois Theory and fields; in particular, I feel confident with field extensions and their Galois groups.",
    "I learned much more about Galois theory and was able to apply many of the ideas I had first studied in Abstract Algebra to a new subject. I also improved in my proof-writing.",
    "Fundamentals of Galois theory. How to think about all sorts of fields; where they come from and how they work."

    "The classes are interesting. Miki is amazing.",
    "This class was much more organized than most math classes I have taken. The material was structured in a very logical way, and developed along interesting lines. Miki does a fantastic job motivating the material. One downside of this class, like most others in the math department, is the lack of external lecture notes. While this does encourage attendance, it also compounded with the fact that we did not follow any textbook. If there was some material that was poorly understood, be it a proof or a theorem statement, it was difficult to know what references might help (the primary textbook, Stewart, was largely useless. We covered material in a much more sophisticated way than the textbook, when we covered the same material at all). The problem sets were interesting and well-structured; of a reasonable difficulty.",
    "It would be nice to have a reference for some of the material (like the stuff of separability). I also wasn't sure what style of questions would be on the first midterm; it would have been helpful to have a practice midterm.",
    "We learn a lot about field extensions and cover the topic pretty thoroughly, which is great. Homework is not too long and set at an appropriate level, though perhaps the variety of problems is not as great as it could be.",
    "The biggest strength is definitely professor havlickova. It doesn't take much to make galois theory interesting, but it takes a ton to make it so clear and understandable and illuminating!",
    "I absolutely loved this course; it provided a great, thorough look into Galois theory and taught me a lot. The only slight problem I have is that the last week or two of the class felt a little bit jumpy and not as smooth as the rest, but that's understandable since it was just covering odds and ends. I'm not sure if there's a good way to do that more smoothly.",
    "This course had very difficult assignments, especially the midterms. In general, it was a great math course.",
    "This is a great class covering interesting content, and Miki is a great teacher! She clearly cares about doing the best she can to teach her students.",
    "I thought Galois theory was an excellent course. I enjoyed it and have no real suggestions for improvement.",
    "Lectures were engaging, textbook and psets and tests were all good. At times it can seem unmanageable, but you get through it. Course curriculum and its execution have no weaknesses.",
    "I would really have appreciated some more concrete guidance preparing for the exams. I studied a lot from my notes but more than once felt caught off guard by the difficulty of the specific problems posed--some kind of direct practice that gives an idea of the nature of the problems would have been very helpful."

    "Yes. All math major needs to take it anyway.",
    "Most math majors (and all pursuing pure math) will take this class after 350. Do so. The two classes together form a wonderful two-term introduction to Algebra, and both are historically brilliantly taught. This is a decently challenging class, but if you made it through 350, you should not have too much trouble. The class will demand a higher level of comprehension and move more quickly, but is somewhat less work-intensive than 350. Miki does a fantastic job motivating the reasons for going in each direction we do. One piece of advice: you will do things at a much higher level of sophistication and generality than Stewart, even if you roughly follow its outline. I heavily recommend that in the second half of the semester, you look to the relevant chapters in Dummit and Foote: the end-of-term material is fairly well-represented there. Even if a few proofs are different, DF is your best reference for checking statements of theorems or reminding yourself whether something is true. Expect midterms and finals much like those from 350: primarily computation and application of theorems, with little in the way of actual proof expectations.",
    "A very good class, I learned a lot about field theory Miki is a really great and dedicated professor. She is very organized and efficient.",
    "This is definitely a step up from 350. Take it if you're interested (it's cool material) but really try to let go of the idea of \"good grades\"",
    "Galois Theory is a beautiful branch of mathematics that all undergraduate math majors should have exposure to. Definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "This is a great course. It's incredibly difficult. Exams in particular are really hard. But it's worth it, even if your end-of-semester grades say otherwise.",
    "Yes! Take any class with miki, especially galois.",
    "I would highly recommend MATH 370 to any student interested in advanced pure math, particularly those who enjoyed MATH 350. Galois theory is very interesting, Miki is a phenomenal teacher, and the course is highly enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to any math major having finished and enjoyed Abstract Algebra.",
    "Galois Theory is a great class that I'd definitely recommend. That said, grading can be tough, so I'd recommend starting it credit\/D.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Galois theory is a beautiful subject, Stewart is a great textbook, and Miki is a wonderful lecturer. If you're up for the challenge, dive right in.",
    "Yes, this is a really fun course and Miki teaches it well. It is very difficult; you should be good at math and have some algebra experience to even consider taking this class. If that applies, you should definitely take 370. Learn a lot about fields and their relation to groups.",
    "The material is really fun, beautiful and interesting. Miki is a fantastic and very clear lecturer. The class is hard and there is not a lot of room to mess up, but overall I recommend it.",
    "As long as Miki teaches it, this course is a must-take for any math major (or non-math major who's taken a course in algebra). The clarity and organization in each lecture is amazing. For instance, every example she gives has a purpose: usually, they are designed to illustrate a subtle point that would go over most people's heads at first glance, but is actually crucial to understanding the bigger picture. Of course, Miki makes sure we understand exactly why she took the five minutes out of her busy 70-minute lesson plan to teach us this specific insight. Because her schedule is so tight, Miki starts every class PRECISELY at 11:35. After all, if she didn't, we'd never get through all the material she planned to teach us. Honestly, I'd recommend taking this class even if the material weren't that interesting, just to see what good lecturing should look like. Of course, Galois Theory is also a fascinating subject and worth studying on its own right. Basically, it takes a lot of the concepts you learn in 350 (not modules though, thank god) and combines them to create a beautiful correspondence between the language of groups and the language of fields, which has a lot of interesting applications in very old problems in mathematics like constructibility and solving for roots of polynomials. Don't take my word for it, though--Miki's explanation is better."
