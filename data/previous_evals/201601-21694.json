   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this class! My section was a bit large, which was annoying, but not the class's fault, more of an administrative problem that there weren't enough sections. It's not an easy class--lots of readings and essays, definitely more rigorous than 125, probably on the tougher side of any humanities class that you might choose to take. I would probably only do if you are English major, or really like poetry. Prof. Richards was great too, very nice and helpful. Professor Richards, the only female (?) teacher of this course the semester I was taking it, somewhat saved the class from being just veneration of the classics. Perhaps itwas the students in my class, but we took a critical and analytic approach to the classics. It improved my writing skills, made me a better close-reader, and overall made me appreciate poetry more.",
    "If you have to take English 126, take it with Professor Richards. She's the best--she's funny, smart, understanding, and critical of the canon without disrespecting its importance.",
    "If you have to take this class or even want to take this class, you have to do it with Jill Richards. She adds a women, gender, and sexuality focus to that definitely made reading an almost all white and male canon so much better. She is thoughtful and really responsive to students. I can't say enough about her. I would note that she is really busy, and a bit hard to get in contact with over email. Outside of that, this course was definitely a highlight for me this semester. I would recommend this to other students given my specific experience, but not that this course might be different depending on who it's taught by.",
    "Professor Richards certainly has the best syllabus of any 126 professor out there. She's also really brilliant and always willing to talk about your essays outside of class. She is a gem in the department. Make sure you have a good class though; I felt that ours was a little big and it made class discussions kind of awkward (sometimes we just went around in a circle because people were overeager to talk).",
    "Yes, take this class! ENGL 126 is the typical second-half of the prerequisites for the English major. I had an incredible class thanks in large part to Professor Richards, who made every class worthwhile. As I previously mentioned, the reading can varyPope was kind of upsetting, whereas Aphra Behn, Langston Hughes, and Gertrude Stein were awesomebut with the right group of students (that our class was fortunate enough to have), and an amazing professor (which we were also lucky enough to have), class will always be engaging, even if the syllabus sometimes isnt. You will grow as a reader, writer, and thinker (even though that sounds really clich, I promise its true)!",
    "This course is a survey of English Poets from Milton to Elliot and at face value it's pretty dull. However, taking it will Jill Richards is the best decision you could possibly make.",
    "Take it with Prof. Richards.",
    "Material- A wide range of Poetry including Milton, Behn, Pope, Swift, Montagu, Wordsworth, Wheately, T.S. Eliot, and Stein major works. Pretty much just a discussion of broad topics about each text. Grades- Subjective, as is every English class. I found the grading on this class to be especially harsh. Multiple people associated with the English department who read my essays thought they deserved much better than they received. Professor- Professor Richards is kind, but does not provide much to the class. She runs a round table discussion, but rarely adds much to the discussion other than affirming some students points here or there. I think that she should take a more active role in helping to provide new interpretations\/insights. I probably would not choose this professor again.",
    "It's a good class, but don't take it if you don't wanna be an English major. That being said, don't let this class (or 125) dissuade you from the major. Both are really interesting courses that are definitely worthwhile. Do take it with Prof. Richards, if you can. In fact, if she isn't teaching it this semester, I might even wait to take the class until she is. Her class is the only one that challenges the exclusivity of the canon and exposes students to diverse writers.",
    "I would summarize this class\/course sequence as the English major's equivalent to Directed Studies. (To be clear, this is not a compliment.) I wouldn't recommend this course in general to anyone, because nobody needs to read that many dead white men and nothing else in a row. But if you must take this course because you want to be an English major, I wholeheartedly recommend taking it with Professor Richards."
