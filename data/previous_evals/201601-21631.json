   "comments": [
    "This is a great course! Very intense and takes effort, but it repays you by greatly improving fluency. Be prepared to spend lots of time studying though. Teachers are super enthusiastic.",
    "JAPN 120 is required for the completion of the first year of Japanese, and everybody who is still interested in studying Japanese should definitely take it. It's a great class, just like the one before, and it's actually a bit more fun because now you can say a lot more things.",
    "Like L1, L2 is a lot of work each day. But, if you've done L1 already, it's just a continuation of the trend. The vocabulary gets a bit more difficult, but the grammar is not monumentally more difficult. The class is a little difficult to ask questions in, because students are uncomfortable asking in english and do no not have the Japanese ability to express their question fully comprehensibly. I felt a little weird asking questions in this class, because I wanted to ask a very nuanced and specific question but did not know how to ask it in Japanese.",
    "Yes! I will definitely recommend the class to another student. All the senseis are so responsible. The pace is a little bit fast. But if you want to improve your Japanese as soon as possible, this is the best class.",
    "If you even mildly interested in taking a new language, this is the course for you. My favorite of the year.",
    "I 100% recommend the course if you're remotely interested in Japanese. You'll fall in love with all the teachers' quirks and personality. They make class so fun even at 9:25am. They're the reasons why I chose Japanese on the first day of school first semester. It's a lot of work, but if you're willing to invest time into the experience and learning, you'll walk away with so much."
