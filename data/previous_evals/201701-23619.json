    "Todd is a great instructor! He explains concepts clearly and is always available for your questions and even extra time outside of class. I've enjoyed this course very much!",
    "I really enjoyed the course overall. I think the group work meant students did not engage with the material as much as they could have though. Most groups had an obvious freeloader, and the work was pretty easily spread out, so I felt disincentivized to do as much external research as I would have otherwise. The straight lectures were surprisingly useful and engaging. Overall, I'd like a more prodding though. There was little to no reason to read for the class, as the discussions did not seem to build on them all that much. Despite these qualms, it was one of my favorite courses.",
    "Todd Cout is amazing. This class was very conceptually stimulating and applicable to other coursework. It's a very practical class.",
    "8-12: I loved this course!! I thought Todd is an excellent and engaging instructor, who is not content with seeing things as black or white but rather engaging and accepting the complex realities of the world. In this case, corporate sustainability, that means accepting that it is murky and there are no clear good answers. I enjoyed that he was very relaxed and engaging, very accommodating and responsive to students. I also enjoyed the group projects and the individual project. I think this is an excellent course for anyone interested in corporate sustaianbility. I am frankly shocked about the poor reviews that previous students gave this course--a reason why I almost did not take it. I am so glad I did, it might have been my favorite course this semester--it made me want to engage with corporate sustainability, even as someone initially rather skeptical about working with the private sector."

    "The cases",
    "I wanted courses that were practical and this course definitely fits the bill. I like how the frameworks and tools are so relevant and up-to-date. For me especially coming from a developing country, this course exposed me to a whole new suite of standards which I highly appreciated.",
    "First half of the class was good - going over good metrics, standards, etc. Todd is great one on one. I liked the personal solution assignment.",
    "Todd has an incredible wealth of knowledge, and gives practical, useful feedback. In what can be considered by some to be a dry subject, he finds a way to make it interesting!",
    "The in-class assignments that we worked on in groups.",
    "Tangible practical assignments that force one to practice what we are learning in class. I also liked the green light sessions. I'd never expereinced one before.",
    "Todd's teaching, his presentations of how things are not black or white. I also really enjoyed the group projects and the individual project. I especially liked the conceptual focus on metrics and indicators throughout the semester.",
    "I was hesitant to take the class given previous years' comments, but Todd has improved the class a great deal. Todd is excellent in explaining the concepts using diagrams and real world examples. He has a lot of experience in the corporate sustainability & sustainable finance world, and is up to date with what's happening in this field, so has many valuable insights to share."

   "comments": [
    "the individual assignment presentations",
    "Maybe could use a bit more background on CSR for those from non-business\/management backgrounds (ie. FES students)",
    "The assignments can be tough as an FESer without the SOM core. There's a steep learning curve and the lectures do not prepare you and are so different from the assignments. Also Todd should release a grading rubric for the assignments because his grading is really arbitrary and he will take off points for things he didn't clearly ask for. The assignment prompts should be clearer too.",
    "Clearer expectations and LESS flexibility with the deliverables would have enhanced my learning in this class. I thought there was too much leeway, and as someone who unfortunately tends to do the bare minimum, would have benefitted from more lectures and fewer wishy-washy exercises or group work.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot and found this class to be very valuable. The areas that I would suggest improving are the assignment descriptions and Professor Cort's handwriting, which was really hard to read! The assignments seemed unclear as to what exactly was expected and on the final assignment my group was graded down for neglecting to include something that was not part of the assignment. The assignments required a lot of research outside of the class and it would have been more effective if Professor Cort taught the subjects that were then assigned, such as information on the insurance industry, on the types of investing, or on topics related to the NS assignment.",
    "I liked all of it, including the guest lecturers. Perhaps a bit later in the day for timing of the class would be my only suggestion.",
    "the major improvement I would suggest would be to reorganize the due dates of the group projects so as to make it less heavy on the latter part of the semester.",
    "I know Todd has reduced the amount of student group discussion, but I feel that these need to be reduced even further or restructured to make them more valuable. The conservation finance GreenLight session for example didn't help us learn much about conservation finance at all. Discussion what real conservation finance cases would have been more useful. Also it's good to always keep the group discussion short, not let it be the entire class otherwise students have the tendency to chitchat and not focus on the given topic. I understand that for every assignment there is no right answer and it's all about the rationale, but it would be great if Todd can give us more discussion time on the different \"rationales\" or approaches that companies\/people have taken to solve the metrics\/indicators challenge in corporate sustainability. More examples of approaches that have worked well or haven't would be useful."

I felt this course was distinctively practical compared to similar courses I took at F&ES. The business case emphasis was a key defining factor.",

He has made major improvements and really cares about his students and is very responsive. The course is pretty chill (little mandatory reading), and the projects are very interesting!!",
    "Don't listen to those who say this course is about how to do GRI reporting. It's much broader than that and will help you understand important concepts in corporate sustainability management in general, not just reporting. We actually just mentioned GRI briefly and did not go in depth into it, as you can download the whole GRI set of reports and learn on your own. A must-take for those interested in business & the environment."
