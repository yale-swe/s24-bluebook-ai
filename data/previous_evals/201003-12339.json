    "This is a fun but informative course. If you don't have any background in music but are interested in learning to play an instrument or singing, definitely take this. You don't need any prior knowledge of music to begin with. But be sure you practice ear training regularly.",
    "Take it if you really want to learn music THEORY",
    "Music Department 110 deepens your appreciation of music and prepares you for more advanced theory study. It teaches you how to read music and begin analyzing music. There is a little bit of ear-training and composition. I would recommend Music 101. Professor Thorburn teaches the material well.",
    "This class gives you a good introduction to the basics of Music Theory. It wasn't too difficult for me since I've done performance music for a couple of years, but I would imagine it goes at quite a fast pace otherwise. It teaches you about all the basics of music, and by the end, you get to write a song which doesn't sound all that bad."
