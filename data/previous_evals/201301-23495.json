   "comments": [
    "Good WR credit - two 8-10 page papers or one 16-20 pager (I chose the latter option). No final\/midterm if you do it that way, which is nice because it means you pretty much don't have to go to lecture\/do readings (although they help for section obviously) because your grade rests entirely on the papers and section stuff. But mostly the writing.",
    "I'm so glad a took it for the writing credit, because I sometimes found the political theory stuff hard to follow and would not have been able to explain that on an exam....",
    "Stay away from it. You kind find MUCH better poli sci classes at Yale.",
    "This is a good class, especially if you are looking for a WR credit. Learning about a lot of different social movements and how they succeeded and failed was interesting and changed my perspective on organizing and how politics can work.If you take the class, I recommend you take it for a WR credit. Even if you don't need the WR credit, I would have preferred the writing option (two ten page papers or one twenty page paper) over the non writing option (midterm and final). The workload also includes reading, reading responses, and a short final reflection paper, but none of those is a big deal or very time consuming.",
    "Yes. Take it if you're interested in community organizing, revolutions, and social movements.",
    "Probably not.",
    "I would only recommend this class if it has the Writing Track option. The content is very disorganised and poorly interrelated, so I only learned about the topic that I choose to write my paper on. It is almost unnecessary to go to lecture and do the readings.",
    "I think the class has the potential to be great, but it is lacking a lot of organization.",
    "This class is a survey class of \"injustices\" in the world. If the professor clarifies the writing assignments, I would recommend the WR track. It's more feasible than the non-writing track. As always, shop it first.",
    "A general overview of different ways in which people organize to contest injustice (injustice in terms of racial, ethnic, gender, labor, etc. inequalities)",
    "I took it writing and it wasn't much work. No exams made the writing section a little quiet since there is literally no incentive to do the readings. We had a lot of freedom on the papers which was awesome. Lectures were interesting - covers many \"injustices\" so there should be something you care about. There were some cool guest speakers.",
    "Yes! Take it if you find the material interesting! There are times when the material can feel dense, but Professor Wood is great and an expert in the subject. There were interesting guest speakers and many opportunities to interact during class.",
    "learn a lot about the history and sociology of revolutionary movements. would not recommend- lectures and readings were tedious",
    "Not sure if one should take this class. The topics are very interesting, and the workload is not too heavy (DEFINITELY take the WR section and shop TAs). However, the course was a bit disorganized, perhaps because it is fairly new, and Prof. Wood would often just read off of her powerpoints, which weren't very clear and concise. Many people don't go to lecture, which is a waste since Prof. Wood knows so much and has a lot of direct experience in the field. However, Prof. Wood needs to find a way to make her lectures more engaging. Also, if you take WR, be prepared for very loose paper topics (as in \"anything related to contesting injustice\"). But two 8-10 page papers, two 500-word reading responses, and a final 3-page reflection is not bad at all.",
    "Great foundation for something wanting to get a foundation in social movement theory as well as a poli sci perspective on collective action problems. Watch some movies, do some short but foundational readings, take a couple straightforward exams, and learn from a fantastic professor in Elisabeth Wood. If you've taken courses on social movements before, some of it might be review, but you still get a broad thematic survey on different types of contemporary social movements (for example, I'm really into studying environmental movements but learned more about union organizing, human rights activism, etc.) Highly recommended.",
    "I was pretty bored the entire semester, my section was terrible, and overall the course was unorganized (though it may just be because it was its first semester).",
    "The class is learning about interpreting thought process of people who engage in social movements. Many case studies as well as theories regarding social movements are discussed. Workload is not too bad. I would recommend the class to students who are interested in advocacy and activism.",
    "Contesting Injustice is a very interesting course, and I enjoyed the lectures I attended. However, as someone on the writing track, I realized my grade depended entirely on the papers I wrote (for which there was arguably too much freedom to select any topic I wanted), which meant that there was little incentive to go to lecture or do any of the readings.",
    "An easy intro course for those not on the writing track, this course mixed theory of social movements with concrete examples. If you're interested in the subject and need a fifth class, this class is a good choice.",
    "I would recommend this course- I feel I got a lot out of it. It is a great overview of issues of political and social justice and social movements that contest injustice, from the local level to the global level. There is also a theoretical aspect to the course as you will learn various theories behind social movement emergence and success. There is a good amount of reading each week for section, however I found the readings very interesting. Also section with Erin Pineda was great- I highly recommend taking section with her.",
    "This course leads you on a fascinating tour of diverse collective initiatives to \"contest injustices\" in different areas of the globe. In addition to covering classic social movement examples, such as the Civil Rights Movement and anti-Apartheid movement, at the start of the course, Professor Wood leads you to discover other forms of collective action in American communities and abroad. Although the readings and essential lessons of the course cover a substantial amount of theory (including some game theory and behavioral theories about collective action), the course is also composed of rich case studies. Chances are that there will be a injustice or political theme that interests you at some point during the semester.Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in social action and\/or political action involved civil society. This course isn't as much about philosophies of resistance (e.g. Thoreau, Gandhi, etc) or the historical evolution of resistance methods; it's more concentrated on details of how people manage to mobilize and act collectively against a variety of injustices from the 1970s through today. However, if you decide to take the Writing Track, you'll have the opportunity to explore movement ideologies and philosophies in your research.",
    "I think since it's the first year this class was implemented, it had a few things to sort out. However, it has potential and once the kinks are worked out can be a great course with engaging material and an interesting professor.",
    "I took it for the writing section, so for that reason, it was a good class. Otherwise, I didn't love the class but would recommend it for anyone looking for an extra poli sci class in their schedule."
