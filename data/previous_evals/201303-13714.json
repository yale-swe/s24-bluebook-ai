    "Very informative course. Well organized.",
    "Excellent course! It's structured very well, the homeworks are relevant, the exams are fair, and most importantly, I feel like I've learned a lot in this class. In fact, I often go around telling friends and family what I've learned in this class...",
    "This class covered an extraordinary amount of information in just a few short months. The lectures were interesting and thorough and the assignments were not overly labor intensive. The readings selected were interesting, up to date and very relevant.",
    "I really enjoyed learning much about nutrition as it relates to chronic disease. It was definitely an eye-opener to the importance and fascinating world of nutrition. The course provides much background of nutritional epidemiology to reinforce the concepts we learn in lecture. I do suggest adding more social and behavioral aspects in the field of nutrition as they are equally important in combating chronic diseases.",
    "Great course, extremely informative. I will take the information I learned in this course with me throughout my public health career, but also throughout my own life.",
    "Great class, so much information, I learned a lot, great lectures - at times felt like an overwhelming amount of information. It was very individual nutrient based, and I was hoping for a greater focus on diet in general. However, it was a great course to learn a lot about evaluating current research, trials, etc. I learned so much, but felt like I had to skim through some topics and didn't absorb everything because I just didn't have the ability to do that.",
    "This course requires a lot of work. The homework is in depth and only receiving 1 or 2 points for credit makes it seem not rewarded enough. The study guides are definitely helpful for the tests.",
    "I really liked the structure of the course and the order in which the topics were presented. Lecture was always interesting. However, sometimes the discussion section did not flow smoothly. Though the homework questions were often thought-provoking and useful, they were not always conducive to discussion.",
    "Great class really interesting and informative",
    "strengths: well-timed and well-prepared lecturesweaknesses: lots of info, long lectures",
    "A great course! This is a well-taught course that will give you lots of information and leave you feeling like you took a lot away from it at the end of the semester. It's also super important information, for your own life and for your public health career. Susan Mayne is also an expert in the field, and is a down to earth, great professor.",
    "Good for maintaining basic epi skills in 2nd year",
    "Strengths: Overall a wonderful course that was very well-organized. You end up learning so much about nutrition, which relates to nearly every disease or public health problem. The discussion section was a useful way to help clarify the topics presented from lecture while also giving us the opportunity to discuss other related topicsWeaknesses: Oftentimes there is so much material to go over that some of the lectures seem a bit rushed, and there ends up being no time for questionsImprovements: Perhaps try to make lectures a little more interactive and engaging",
    "Great course! Really hit all of the topics in the field and I felt like I learned so much information in the semester! I loved the discussion sections! The only improvement I would make would be to have more of a discussion about the nutritional assessment we each did.",
    "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bcThis course was excellent. We thoroughly covered many important chronic diseases related to nutrition, and then touched on other relevant topics towards the end. I think a strength of this course is that we were given some background in nutrition-\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0091related science (e.g. definition of trans fats, caloric value of macronutrients), rather than focusing only on disease statistics or symptoms. A weakness is that we did not spend much time talking about the complex etiology of the conditions we discussed, and I think this class would benefit from a more nuanced consideration of the various factors that interact to cause disease. For example, we did not talk about why racial disparities exist for many conditions, such as obesity, and how these differences in outcome may be addressed.",
    "This was an excellent class that I believe offers information that everyone should learn. The instructor is a very good lecturer and is very good at explaining the material of the course, and discussion sections were fun and informative. The course itself provided a good overview of nutrition and how nutrition can impact disease incidence, morbidity, and mortality.",
    "Strengths-the professor is really knowledgeable and up-to-date in regards to the subject matter. Lectures are very interesting and the slides complement the lecture nicely.Weaknesses-the professor spends most time on the lecture and does not encourage students' participation aside from students' questions.Room for improvement-Homework should be more clear. Sometimes these assignments were not clear about what they were asking and needed clarifications from the TA.",
    "The course did a good job of balancing epidemiological research, the scientific basis for the claims, and the policies relating to nutrition and health. It was a great course.",
    "This an excellent course. Its content is very comprehensive and useful. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any weakness."

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Great lecturer. Very engaging and interesting to listen to.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is an excellent instructor. She knows the material better than the back of her hand, she speaks clearly and coherently and she's a wealth of knowledge!One thing: during lectures, I often felt like I was sitting in a conference is attending a lunch seminar. Something about the way Dr. Mayne lectures feels a little distant, as if each lecture she's speaking to an audience that she doesn't know. This isnt to say that she didn't make an effort to know her students, but that was nonetheless the feeling of the classroom. All of that said, she's an excellent lecturer and I'm very happy I was able to take her course while at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0It was a great experience to learn from such an expert in the field!",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0The instructor definitely knew how to present and discuss the material, and she was always willing to meet with students after class as well as during office hours. No weaknesses come to mind.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is clearly an expert in the field and is extremely valuable to the students. She compliments her lectures with anecdotes about her experience sitting on panels or reviewing ongoing research studies. She made students feel like they were learning from someone extremely knowledgeable on the topics she was presenting.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Wonderful lecturer. I'm amazed at how she effortlessly went through nearly 100 slides per lecture, perfectly timed, and very clear\/graceful. Because lectures were so perfectly timed, extra questions from students did seem to interrupt this timing and we've had to speed through some slides to make up for that. But overall, Susan is wonderful, so knowledgable. I could tell that she was biased against supplements overall though, which is fair given the evidence she presents - but I'm curious at how much this perspective affected the lectures. But tobe fair, I'm reconsidering taking the supplements I do because of the course.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Very knowledgable and likable",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Her teaching is very clear and thorough. She always stays on topic and is able to cover a large amount of material within one class period. She is also always willing to answer questions in class. The only issue I had was that the powerpoint slides were sometimes unclear. That made it difficult to study for the exams, especially considering that the exams required a lot of memorization.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Really knowleagable",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Maybe: good lecturer, great resource",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Susan Mayne is a great person and a great professor! She may seem intimidating at first because she is super successful, but once you get to know her, she is really sweet, intelligent, and caring. Her lectures were always super interesting and I felt like I came out of each class having learned a lot. She offers reviews the class before the exams, which are really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Expert.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is obviously an expert in this field and is so knowledgeable about a wide array of nutrition-related topics. I may be biased since I have always been interested in nutrition, but she has a way of getting her students interested and excited about the topics she presents. She is always willing to clarify topics that are confusing or don't make sense to her students, which I greatly appreciate. Perhaps the only weakness, as mentioned above, is that she sometimes goes through the material too fast leaving little time for students to absorb the material or ask questions.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Great! Fantastic lecturer - gives a great perspective on the field. So interesting to hear about her experiences with the topics we cover and to have her perspective on the issues.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0The instructor of this course was great. She was clearly extremely knowledgable about the subject, she patiently and thoroughly answered questions, and she had very well put together lectures. One minor complaint about her teaching style is that she would lecture for almost two hours straight, with no break or discussion with the class (unless someone asked a question). This practice would sometimes make it hard to stay engaged with the material for the entire class period. I would recommend that the instructor add some kind of stretch break in the middle of class, and\/or pose questions to the class throughout the lecture to foster class participation.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne was a great lecturer and was very knowledgeable about the material of the course. She always included very current literature in her lectures, so all the information she presented was very up-to-date. She also was very helpful to students who needed further clarification about certain aspects of the material or who were simply interested in discussing aspects of nutrition and disease in more depth.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Amazing! Complete mastery of the subject and shares it in an interesting way.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Professor Mayne was great- very knowledgable and able to convey the information to students. She did a great job of choosing the papers and studies we focused on. Every lecture was very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0She is an awesome instructor. She showed a great knowledge of the course content and her teaching abilities were remarkable."

    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary is also very well qualified to be a TA for this course. Mary is a bit shy and soft spoken, and I think she should work on being a little more assertive during section, as she would command more attention by doing so. Mary is also very passionate about the material and is extremely helpful in trying to make students understand the material.",

I appreciated the way that she graded the homework and sometimes wrote in comments. There were times when it was difficult for her to keep the discussion going during the discussion section, but often I think that was due to the content of the questions.",

    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary is intelligent and experienced in the field, came to section prepared, returned work promptly, and is a kind and helpful soul.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary was really nice and a good TA. She was shy in the beginning of the course, but improved throughout the semester. I would recommend not relying on Prof. Mayne for help - we know you know your stuff! I think she would also get nervous and skip over things on the slides. Her slides were super super helpful for review and studying before the exams. She was also helpful during office hours. I would just say confidence is the biggest thing to improve upon in order to make the discussions better.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Good job",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Such a sweet and knowledgeable person about nutrition, and completely willing to help clarify confusing topics for the students. All of her discussion slides are so helpful when it comes to reviewing material from the previous lecture and preparing for the midterm and final exam. However I do wish the discussion section was a bit more engaging.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Great! I thought the review slides were really helpful in keeping up with course material. Discussion sections were really interesting and well organized.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0The TF was clearly knowledgeable and patient and well-\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0091prepared for class. My one complaint about her is that she was so soft-\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0091spoken (which I can relate to) that she was sometimes hard to hear and would come across as unconfident. However, on the positive side, her synopses of the lectures were very helpful (though we did rush through these in section) and I used them to study for the tests.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary was a great TA who was very helpful in providing additional information on the course, discussing dietary patterns, and providing feedback on our written responses\/homework. She always offered very useful feedback on responses that was great when trying to understand some of the more complex studies that we read about in class.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Great! Always gave feedback on our homework, answered emails promptly and was always available to students. It was obvious that she took a lot of time to make the discussion sections as best as possible. Very thorough.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary did a great job of always being there when students needed her. Her previous experience also made her a great addition to the class- she always had insightful commentary in section.",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary was an excellent TA. She was very knowledgable and did a great job of including everyone in section discussions. She gave great feedback on our homework assignments as well. My only suggestion would be that she be slightly less timid during discussion- she definitely knows the material and should show her confidence in explaining it!",
    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0She is an excellent TA. She was very concerned with the students learning process and was always happy to help us. Besides the discussion sections she leaded, it would be great if she could have the opportunity to present a complete lecture by her own."

    "This course is extremely interesting in terms of content and will teach you things you can apply to your every day eating habits. The tests are hard though and heavily weighted.",
    "It is very interesting and gives a thorough overview of topics that relate nutrition to chronic disease. Exams are challenging, largely because there is a large amount of material covered in each class period. I would recommend this course, but only to students who are very interested in nutrition.",
    "good intro to nutrition, esp. if you're interested in cancer",
    "Excellent course!! Knowledgeable and successful professor who is down to earth. Interesting lecture every class and the feeling that you came away with a lot of knowledge from the class overall. Not too much of a time commitment every week for homework, but the exams do require a lot of time to study for since you'll need a lot of memorization.",
    "Good course, fair grading",
    "Yes I highly recommend this course, and not just for those interested in nutrition. Although it is A LOT of information, you are guaranteed to learn, even about things most would never even consider to be related to nutrition.",
    "Great summary of nutritional epi related to chronic disease, especially cancer. Covers a lot of the core material in the field. Really interesting and solid course. Highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this course to any graduate student interested in nutrition and health, and most medical or public health students. I think it's very important for people in health-\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0091 related fields to understand how influential diet can be on people's health, and I think this class does a good job at getting this point across. To summarize this course, I would tell a fellow student that it provides a general background in nutrition science, and focuses on the interaction between people's health and diet. We discussed etiology, symptoms, outcomes, population statistics, potential solutions, and current issues in nutrition and health.",
    "I had no nutrition background whatsoever so some topics were challenging for me. However, I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in nutrition, eating disorders, obesity, etc. The instructor is so well informed and such a respected figure in this field that it was a true privilege to be a student in her class. Definitely recommend it!",
    "If you have an interest in nutrition and how it relates to health, I would definitely recommend taking this class. The professor is great, the material is interesting, and the work for the course is completely reasonable.",
    "This is a very comprehensive and useful course for future nutritional epidemiologists and other public health professionals. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students."
