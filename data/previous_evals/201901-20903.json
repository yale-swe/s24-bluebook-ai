    "Although the class was well organized and seminars were led with precision and enthusiasm, class experience was often hindered by negligent resources on behalf of the school as room equipment for display never worked properly and even our final presentations were cancelled because the british center never reserved time for our class as promised. It is unacceptable, especially for a class that meets once a week, for the school to be so careless in its treatment of a seminar like this.",
    "It was listed under film and media studies but we ultimately watched one feature length film and maybe one or two short films. It was largely just an art history course, which is fine, but also seemed like a waste of a good subject and good reading materials. Whats more, essentially none of the readings were accessible and we spent the majority of the class every session just trying to get the class to understand one essay, instead of talking about themes and works productively and in a manner that reflected the class' interests and desires."
