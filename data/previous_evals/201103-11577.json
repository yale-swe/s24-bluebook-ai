    "Unbelievable class. Best class I have taken at Yale, and I'm not an econ major. So worth it.",
    "Take this course. The workload is alright and not much knowledge of econ is required. This is one of the signature courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat. It is a ton of work, but absolutely worth it. I would take it every semester if I could.",
    "Recommend Cr\/D - it gets much harder after the midterm and there are weekly psets!",
    "Broad introduction to game theory. I'd recommend anyone to take it, even if not for major requirements, you cover a lot of logic and reasoning skills that seem to be lacking in most of society.",
    "Take it if you have time and room in your schedule. You';ll come out learning some pretty interesting concepts but nothing that will change your life! P-sets are long and hard and if you care about your grades, just take it CR\/D",
    "Polak's extremely engaging and clearly loves teaching the subject. The games we played in class were fun and, more importantly, really useful and interesting examples of what we were using. The problem sets can be long and sometimes tough, but \u0097 I can't stress this enough \u0097 go to office hours. The TAs are a fantastic resource and will walk you through every problem, step by step, until you understand exactly how to do them. I went to Cihan's office hours and I always left with every question done correctly and to completion. (I went to others and had similar experiences, too.) The class doesn't require a ton of math, and although an econ background helps, it's not impossible to get by without it. (Unfortunately, the second half of the class is more econ-focused than the first, which I didn't like as much.)",
    "yeah, it's a fun class.",
    "Econ 159 is a great class even for non-majors. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "Great Class. Probably one of the best in the econ department. Material can be tough and problem sets challenging, but its worth it. Taking it credit D would make the class very enjoyable because the curve is so easy and it would just make your life a lot easier.",
    "This is a class about teaching you new ways to think about real-world problems. This is a problem-solving class much more than an Economics class. I wasn't so much expecting this, but it was pretty good nonetheless. I think I would recommend this class, but it wasn't my favorite class, and come exam-time it gets extremely stressful.",
    "This is a great course--easily the best lectures I've had at Yale so far. The midterm was way too long though, and I made one critical mistake and that tanked my grade, forcing me to take the whole course credit\/d. I wish that the midterm carried a little less weight so that you could still recover from a slip-up. Prof. Polak is a great instructor. He prepares every aspect of his lectures, includes games, draws \"audience\" participation and even has witty closing statements.",
    "take it if you've got good qr skills - otherwise take it cr\/d if you're just interested in the topic.",
    "Ben Polak's lectures are unmissable. you'll learn a lot and you'll be entertained. problem sets take a while but are doable. midterm and final are fair although game theory is a challenging area since it requires far more logical thinking as compared to memorization. TAKE THIS CLASS even if you aren't an econ major, but maybe credit d b\/c it is not a gut",
    "This course is a Yale institution. It's reputation is great, and it lives up to it. (Also, lectures from 2007 are on Yale Open Courses, which makes it pretty easy to study for exams).",
    "It's a great course; you cover interesting material. A must-take for any major. It'd be a little daunting to take it for a grade, so definitely do it CR\/D.",
    "Pretty interesting course, although I felt the problem sets were too complex for the information learned in lecture. Then again, maybe I should have gone to section or done the reading but.... lazy college senior. This class ended up being more difficult than I expected (in a tedious way), but I do feel that I've learned a new way to think about ... everything ... and that's priceless.",
    "If you are good at economics, you will probably do good in this course and you should take it, because its really cool. But if you are not so good at economics in general, this will be challenging but rewarding. It's not for everyone, however.",
    "Great course. Take it.",
    "Take it! If you are worried about the grade take it for credit but take this course!",
    "This class is a must, and Polak is one of the absolute best professors at Yale. interesting and applicable material, entertaining lectures. Final is kind of hard tho, but on the upside, much of your success in this course is dependent on your innate reasoning abilities and this is helped by curving to 40% of students getting an A or A-",
    "Yes, this class is awesome. Ben Polak is an amazing lecturer. He has a great sense of humor and a great accent. He makes the interesting subject matter even more interesting. A lot of the problem sets and exams are more based on logic questions than specific game theory questions.",
    "Maybe I'm crazy, but I think this is an excellent course for Hu\/So majors who are looking to fulfill their QR credit. Is it easy? No. But it's a course that will have a marked effect on the way you perceive the world. Game Theory is not just a field of study; it is a world perspective that will help you to evaluate situations and make logical arguments that strip away poor guesswork and shoddy reasoning.Also, the homework is pretty fun--I'll do puzzles for problem sets any day!",
    "Definitely take this class! It is awesome. The problem sets can be incredibly difficult, and the exams are fairly difficult as well, but it is definitely worth it. You really learn a lot and get to play games along the way.",
    "I would recommend highly Econ 159. I had a great time in lecture and although the tests were challenging there was not an insane amount of work. A must-take class",
    "Best class in my Yale career. So happy to have taken it. The most thought-provoking and exciting econ class. 10 out of 10 WOW!",
    "Prepare for a really easy first half of the course and a brutal second half. But good class overall, although I'd say it's a bit overrated.",
    "Yes, although it's very very difficult. I'm an economics major and I thought it was really hard, so expect to be challenged. That said, it has really changed the way I viewed the world and is probably one of the best classes (instructive-wise) I've taken at Yale. Polak is wonderful -- he cares about his students and gives some of the best lectures in the world. Take it credit\/d if you can",
    "Great course, I prefer Game Theory very much over the other introductory Economics courses, and it's actually surprisingly easy--especially with Professor Polak, who makes it extremely clear what you need to know.",
    "This is a great class. If you are an Econ major, take it for a grade. If you are not, take it CDF. The class gets much more difficult after the midterm, and the material -- which is very good and taught fantastically by Polak -- is much more interesting when you aren't stressing about your grade.",
    "Definitely take it. One of the best classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it. It's low-stress, and interesting. I think topics like information unraveling, evolutionary stability, etc. change the way you approach some everyday scenarios.",
    "Ya, take it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's the right amount of challenging, the problem sets are interesting rather than a bother, and the lectures are always something to look forward to.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. A fantastic way to quantify strategic thinking. Lots of interesting thought experiments. Fantastic TAs and amazing, well rehearsed lectures full of games and strategy. TAKE IT, especially if you like thinking strategically. Just a note against the artsy people- this course reduces decisions in the world to onedimensional payoffs... butit teaches you how to think about each in an interesting way. The material is challenging but rewarding. Definitely take it, it'll blow your mind each class.",
    "As a non-econ person, taking this class Cr\/D was the best choice I made. Though it's a difficult course, it's very worthwhile taking. Great lectures, but difficult exams.",
    "Cool class, great lecture, take it",
    "Game Theory presents a new way of thinking, which I think is an attractive concept for most people at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Ben Polak is both entertaining and enlightening, and you'll learn some really interesting ideas. You play games in almost every class, and even when you don't, it's still easy to enjoy the lecture. This class even made Cournot interesting! Problem sets can be a little tricky, but aren't too bad as long as you commit to going to Office Hours. I thought the midterm and final were difficult, but honestly, no matter what grade I get, I am SO glad I took this class.",
    "Interesting way of thinking that'll teach you to solve problems in a very logical and applicable way. But way way too many hours spent on homework. It is much more work than you'd expect. The class seems fun and cool and then the homework gives these absurdly difficult and arbitrary questions. Instead of making kids suffer, he should cover the hard examples in class, so we know how to attack the problem, and then ask similar problems in homework. This way, not only would we feel way less deceived, but we would actually learn how to solve difficult game theory problems.",
    "Game Theory is the study of strategic situation. The class and exams revolve around applying concepts taught in class to the study of various games. If you like learning about games and thinking about strategy, take this class. The problem sets aren't too hard if you pay attention in lecture, and office hours are great help if you get stuck on a problem. Ben is a great lecturer and is really good at keeping things interesting. There are a couple of boring \"gotta get through the concepts\" kinda lectures, but those are far and few between. The midterm is not too bad, and the final was really hard, but both exams are fun to take if you like analyzing games. I fully recommend this class. It's one of the few classes I really enjoyed doing the work for.",
    "Absolutely. Very fun class.",
    "It's a great class, not too much math. It's definitely doable and very interesting.",
    "I would recommend taking if you are interested in business or ecomonics",
    "Take it. If you have a basic logic or math background, you'll love this course. It's basically logical thinking as applied to a whole variety of situations. The class, although example filled, won't teach you how to win chess or any other game, but it will teach you how to think caraefully about competitive situations arising out of business and everyday life.Prof Polak gives life to the material and makes the class enjoyable, psets not too bad either (if you went to lecture). Bottom line: Take it! IMHO one of the Yale greats",
    "You learn a lot, but its real-life application (outside of whoa, suddenly understanding how to beat Minesweeper) is hard to grasp, despite all the \"real-life\" examples from class.Great if you're an econ major; I can't speak from any otherperspective. If you were someone who got a B+ in Math 118 or below, you're gonna be confused on a lot of the math and you're going to be copying it from a friend.",
    "awesome class. the prof is phenomenal - very funny and engaging. definitely take it.",
    "Take it, even though you can take it online. You get so much more out of it by actually doing the problem sets and interacting with Polak during lecture.",
    "Great class, although Polak definitely contributes to that so if someone else ends up teaching it next year make sure they're just as good. Lots of cool concepts with practical application.",
    "One of the gems of the econ department. Lectures were well-planned and organized. Psets and exams usually hard but not excessively so. Game theory is a bunch of incredibly powerful concepts that are only just beginning to have an impact on the way we think about decision-making in a variety of fields - definitely worth learning about, even for non-majors. Also, Professor Polak is one of the best lecturers at Yale.",
    "I recommend it, the course is interesting and helps improve analytical abilities.",
    "GREAT CLASS. MY FAVORITE ONE I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. You gotta take this class because it is really interesting and eye-opening. Game Theory is useful in life.",
    "I would recommend Game Theory to pretty much anyone. It teaches some very applicable, interesting material.",
    "Definitely take this course. Polak is the most engaging professor I've had at Yale and the material is really fun. Good for econ majors and non-majors alike.",
    "Game Theory is a really engaging and worthwhile course. It has clear practical applications regardless of your field although it is very econ biased. With effort even non-math people will get it, but if you aren't excited about thinking in an ordered, quantitative manner, it will be frustrating when it comes time to do the homeworks. For people who are quantitatively minded, it may feel slow at times but Polak is entertaining enough and most of the problems interesting enough to still make it worth your while.",
    "Tread carefully. Econ students will probably love this course. Others need to be forewarned of it and need to think about why they are actually interested in learning game theory. You probably want to start this Credit-D. My own problems with game theory are twofold and are really just differences in schools of thought: (1) I find the manner of reasoning in game theory to be valid but at times overblown in its application to real-life decisions and human decision making and (2) applying principles in game theory to problems (including these problem sets) is very difficult if you do not see particularly the pattern or information that the question's designer believes is the most important part (discounting other possible ways of interpretation).",
    "I have recommended this class to every person who has asked me about it, regardless of major. It's a perfect way to get a handle on critical and logical thinking, even if you're not into math or economics.",
    "Awesome class if you like thinking strategically or are just interested in problem solving. If you are quantitative and\/or logical, you will thrive in this class and it will make you view the world differently. If you are not quantitative and\/or logical, it still might be worth taking (although cr\/d might be a better bet) just to appreciate polak's witty lectures as well as the values of logical, model-based analysis.The problem sets for this class are interesting and not super hard but not easy either. Lectures aren't too hard to follow and good notes are available at the online yale course which he follows pretty closely most of the time.Tests aren't too bad if you do and understand the problem sets just don't expect to be able to memorize stuff and do well on the tests. It's all problem-solving except a few true falses to see if you pay attention in class",
    "Game Theory is a pretty cool course. It is the kind of course which really teaches you to think in new ways, rather than just teaches you material. I find myself mentioning game theory concepts in conversations outside of class. It's hard (certainly for a humanities major) and I would have saved myself a lot of stress if I had taken it credit\/D, but I would recommend it strongly.",
    "Amazing class. I came into this class with the expectation that it was going to be really hard, it wasn't. The way its set up, the first 2\/3 of the class is very easy. All the stuff you learn is very intuitive and the problem sets do not take more than maybe 2 hours. The last third was pretty tricky so you will probably have to put some work in then but even then the problem sets are short and the TAs are very helpful",
    "Game Theory was sometimes (especially towards the end) hard for me to wrap my head around. It introduces some interesting ways of thinking that can be applied to real life- most of the games involve situations from real life that are simply watered-down to their game theory components. I had a group that I did the problem sets with every week, which helped a lot, and Polak encourages this. I was barely able to finish some problem sets, and I started them all the night before they were due. If you take this class it's a good idea to start earlier than I did. It's basically one problem set a week (3-5 problems each with many sub problems), a midterm (classtime) and a final (3 hours long). If I could do it again I'd also look over my graded problem sets more carefully, and go to my T.F. about questions. If you're looking for a bit of a challenge in solving word problems on steroids, and you need to fulfill a QR or SO I recommend this class.",
    "Take this class. One of the most interesting Economics classes out there. Not sure if its being taught again next year though.",
    "Great class, take it for a grade if you feel comfortable and take advantage of the material on open yale.",
    "Econ 159 is a fascinating course. It starts out seeming not too difficult, but don't be fooled because the problem sets become tricky quickly. Regardless, you should absolutely take this course because the material is interesting and Ben Polak is fantastic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The concepts learned in this class apply to real world situations. Lectures are interesting because Polak is awesome.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in business or politics, or even if you just want a challenging class, this is a good choice.",
    "Definitely take it! It's one of the best lecture courses that I've taken at Yale. Professor Polak is an engaging lecturer and really makes the material interesting. If you're at all interested in game theory, this is the class to take--you'll learn a lot and be sufficiently challenged, but it's not an impossible class. All in all, the best game theory course offered at Yale (there are ones in Political Science and Mathematical Game Theory, as well).",
    "It's a great class. You won't be a master of game theory, but that said I now have a strong grasp of the basics of the strategic analysis of games, and have come away with a greater understanding of how to think methodically about certain problems. Ben Polak is great and hilarious, problem sets are challenging but not terrible. And, it's the perfect course to take Credit\/D, because then you can enjoy the work without feeling pressured to get everything right perfectly.",
    "Definitely! Polak is very clear in explaining concepts and is pretty humorous. While there is a slight overlap with intro microeconomics (some econ models were used), most of the content is fresh and usually demonstrates a counter-intuitive way of actually making right decisions. If you're into accents, his Brittish accents makes the lectures much more interesting. The only fault is that the lectures are pretty similar to the ones online. The plus side is that the notes online matches about 90% of his lectures so it's very useful when you miss class. Problem sets are exactly the same as the ones in 2007, but there are no solutions given for them, so be prepared to talk to TAs\/Professors\/other students if you actually want to know the correct answers. Overall, super helpful in daily life (I personally love to learn about decision making). Take it even if you aren't an econ major!",
    "Lecture consists of Polak demonstrating a game theory approach to various classic situations. He basically explains a very simple theory then does a lot of examples to demonstrate the nuances.",
    "Absolutely!!! This class is phenomenal! I am a second semester senior, and it is the best class I have taken at Yale. The course will certainly challenge you, but it is fun, interesting, and entertaining. Polack is the best professor I have had at Yale.",
    "Interesting material, reasonable workload especially if you take it CR\/D",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone consider taking it. It is certainly not an easy class though so definitely expect to put in the amount of work required for the problem sets and attend lectures. If you like thinking through problems logically then this the class for you. The math isn't too hard and most of the problems, while sometimes challenging, are relatively fun and interesting to work on. Polak is also an excellent professor. Some of the TAs are also extremely helpful.",
    "I would highly recommend Econ 159. Professor Polak is amazing and the course teaches you a lot about real-world applications of economics in oligopoly models. Some of it is a bit math-y so if that isn't your style, don't take it. Also, the final exam is pretty hard, and so are the problem sets. But you can always get help on PSETS in office hours. Shop it at the very least-- it's worth looking into!",
    "Professor Polak is an excellent instructor with a great sense of humor.",
    "A great course, but maybe not the best choice for someone just looking to fill a quantitative reasoning requirement.",
    "Certainly a great course! It isn't a gut, but is very fair, and you will come out feeling like you learned something. Worth your time.",
    "I'd recommend it even if you don't like Econ. It's really awesome.",
    "This class is very challenging but very rewarding. I'd recommend it to any Yale student, not just Econ majors--the problems and examples are relevant to so many different fields, not at all just economics. Professor Polak is a great lecturer; he's funny and smart and he brings the material to life with in-class examples. This class certainly isn't easy--the weekly problem sets are very challenging and will make you think, but they are definitely worth struggling through.",
    "Its a really good course. Very fun and engaging. It isn't a lot of work but that doesn't necessarily mean that work that you do is easy. Once you can think the game theory way you should be good though. I wish I had more time on the midterm but the final wasn't too bad.",
    "Take the course, whether you are an econ major or just taking the course to fulfill your social studies requirement, take the course.",
    "Best class at Yale. Take it. Absolutely nothing to critique.",
    "take it!",
    "Very very interesting course with lots of applications. Excellent (and hilarious) lecturer who is good at communicating difficult subject matter. We played games during class and he made the lecture very interactive. The problem sets can be quite tricky (definitely go to office hours), and the midterm and final especially were quite difficult. I think I personally didn't always like the style of teaching\/learning that doesn't have a set method or one correct answer- a lot of backward induction, guess and check, intuitive thinking. Definitely take! Credit\/D unless you want to use it towards your major.",
    "An interesting course that's really slow-paced.The entire course is available on Open Yale Courses, so you can easily get a good grade without going to lecture at all. Professor Polak is a good lecturer, and if you do go, make sure you sit in the first 2 or 3 rows; you'll be a part of the games that are played in class and be able to see his small chalkboard writing.The problem sets are a lot of work. The material is also kind of slow, especially if you've taken Intro Micro. I can summarize the entire course to you in half an hour and you wouldn't be missing out on much.To summarize, take this course if:1. You haven't taken Intro Micro and want to learn good, interesting quantitative reasoning material.2. You don't want to go to class, but still want a course that's not ridiculously easy.3. You're interested in high-level Game Theory; but consider skipping this class and just learning from the notes on OYC along the way.Don't take this course if:1. You remember the Game Theory from Intro Micro that well.2. You don't like doing heavy logic-based problem sets that consume significant amounts of time.",
    "Some people say that you absolutely have to take this course. I would definitely recommend this course, but I wouldn't say it's one of those absolute must courses at Yale. The lectures were fun. Professor Polak is funny and great at explaining the material. And I definitely feel like I got a lot out of the class. But if you've taken other economics courses before, then you've probably covered a bunch of the topics in this course already, so it won't be entirely new. That being said, it makes you think in a new way - both in terms of solving problems and approaching real-life issues. So it's a great course, but don't go into it thinking it will be the greatest class you've ever taken.",
    "Yes! A fantastic course, even if you're not an econ major. The material is really interesting, but get much harder after the midterm. Problem sets are tough, but the actual workload isn't too bad and the exams are fair (he gives you plenty of previous examples). Polak is a natural lecturer-- his pace and mode of presentation were spot-on. He obviously has a very good handle on the material and how to teach it effectively, and seemed in-tune with the class, despite it's size.",
    "good class to take cred\/d",
    "Believe the hype--one of the best classes I've taken here. Masterfully put together, fascinating material.",
    "I definitely recommend it. When it comes down to it, it is basically a course of cause and effect and putting yourself in others shoes.",
    "This is a really fantastic econ classes that majors and non-majors will enjoy. You don't really need to go to class or do the reading to do well (mainly because lectures are available online) - but you should! Polak is really engaging and dynamic.The class doesn't really require a lot of memorization or studying - instead, a lot of it comes down to your ability to tackle challenging problems using methods taught in the course and learned in problem sets. It can be a decent amount of work (with the problem sets), but it's manageable. Take it!",
    "Game Theory is a really enjoyable class cover extremely worthwhile material. Ben Polak is a great lecturer and infuses each lecture with humor and the opportunity to play the games being discussed. The problem sets are challenging, but great to work on with friends. Game Theory seems applicable to almost any field (econ, international relations, political science, history, biology...)",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! And this comes from a non-Econ major. At first some people find the games a little simple and unrealistic in their assumptions, but as we move into more \"real world\" problems the games are highly relevant and will teach you to think about the world in a totally different way.",
    "This is a wonderful class to take, regardless of a student's background in Economics. The lecturer was fantastic, and assumed no prior experience. The lectures themselves generally each focused on an individual game, and there was a great amount of interaction between the lecturer and the students. The problem sets could be a bit difficult at times, but the in-class midterm and final were fairly reasonable.",
    "Great course. Learned a ton, even though I didn't expect to since I thought Micro Theory covered a lot of it already. Lectures are straightforward and easy to understand, but the problem sets and exams are anything but and where I think the true learning takes place. But since it is \"game\" theory, I had a lot of fun solving the problem sets and studying for exams, which is something that I can rarely say. The course is perfect. TAKE IT!",
    "Awesome class. Careful not to get behind after the midterm. Make sure you do a lot of practice problems before the final (do some just before the final as well, to get you in the mode of solving these type of problems). It can be easy to make a stupid mistake or overlook something (like a sunk cost or the difference between a dominant strategy and a best response), so be careful.",
    "Polak is great, lectures are dynamic, and the information is pretty cool. Really good class to take credit\/D (i.e., you can't actually get a D, so it's relaxing and you do learn something).",
    "Very interesting and well organized course. The lectures are actually interesting and fun to attend, the problem sets are relatively challenging but engaging and instructive, and the exams are fair. There is not a lot of studying involved for the exams - you're really tested on your brainteaser\/problem solving skills, which you either have or don't. Overall, highly recommended.",
    "Yes take it! However, note that this is not a gut and it can get a little challenging at times. You should go to office hours for the psets because the TAs REALLY help you out.",
    "It is a fun class and it teaches you how to think in a different way. Even If you are not an Econ major, it is worth taking.",
    "Fun course.",
    "Yes. 100%. It is a spectacular class! Definitely worth taking even if you are not an Econ major or not that interested in Social Sciences. It makes your understanding of daily human interactions in a much greater depth.",
    "Prof. Polak is a very engaging instructor. He makes Game theory accessible to students, and his tests aren\u0092t incredibly hard, unless he says so. The material in this class was hard, and one needs to practice to master this. Take this course if you are an Econ\/PoliSc major and need it for your requirement. If not, you\u0092d probably be better off just learning from the online lectures.",
    "Its a great course and a must-take, but at the same time, it is quite challenging. Getting an A in the class is very difficult, and despite paying attention and doing all the problem sets, and understanding most of the concepts, even an A- is a bit of a stretch.",
    "An incredible class, requires very little math or econ background, everything needed for this class is taught in lecture.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. I am not an Econ major, and I took it for a grade. I would not recommend doing this, as you may do poorly on the final exam. But, great class, though I do not actually know its relevance in real life.",
    "An introduction to game theory which centers mostly on discussions of Nash Equilibria. Sometimes, it feels like more of a logic course, emphasizing boundary conditions and such. You should take it but know that it wont be an easy A.",
    "Yes, definitely! This class is important for your life, regardless of your majors\/interests. If you are not an econ major, it's probably a good idea to take it Cr\/D\/F."
