    "As of now, this course introduces you to the concepts of Multivariable Calculus in a very thorough manner, without much real-life application. From what I hear, ENAS 151 teaches about the same concepts with examples of how you could actually use them in the real world. I feel like I learned a great deal in this course, but I'd have to take another course to put these skills to good use.",
    "yes. but 230 seems to be better for the student who doens't like memorize formulas",
    "Math120 is a nice class, although it is not really the one for you if you like theoretical math. Professor Ip is really really really good take the class with him if you get the chance to.",
    "You must be willing to study--you can't learn everything just by doing the homework. If you can do that, you'll be fine",
    "The exams will make you want to rip the packet of paper to shreds. But the workload isn't bad.",
    "Even if you already have some exposure to multivariable calculus, you should take this course. It's not particularly demanding, and if you take it with Ivan Ip, you won't get that confused by new material. If you study thoroughly for exams and ask questions, you can do well in this course. Also, the final was much more difficult than the practice exams or midterms, so make sure to study well!Do what you can to take this class with Professor Ip; he really made it much easier to succeed.",
    "Yes, highly recommended",
    "It is a challenging course. If students just need a quantitative credit, it might not be worth it. Personally, I don't regret taking it, even though I didn't do so well in the class. Its a fun class when you understand the math.",
    "Not the most interesting class, but also not very difficult until after fall break. I'd take it if it were a requirement for a major, but I'm sure there are more interesting QR classes. Be warned that it does get radically more difficult after fall break, in the last 1\/3 of the class.",
    "I would probably recommend Math 120 04 to another student because I think the subject matter is really interesting and was presented in a relatively thorough way. However, sometimes it felt too much like memorizing theorems with less understanding than I would have liked.",
    "Mathematics 120 04 is a small section of the entire math 120 class taught by Ivan Ip. Math 120 covers everything you need for multivariable calculus with some, but not too many, proofs, and not very much practical application. The exams are difficult, particularly the final exam, but this section and the review sessions can prepare you well for the course. Homework consists of problem sets due every week, but they are not overly difficult. I would recommend this section to another student because the classes are clear and well-presented and all needed material is covered in some form.",
    "Good course if you're at all interested in math and took calculus in high school. Try to get Ivan!! (I hear Michael Frame is good too? But I don't know if the hassle of trying to get into one of his classes is worth it. Ivan is awesome.)",
    "Only really necessary if you want physics",
    "Math 120 can be challenging if you don't keep up. Problem sets do help reinforce concepts, but extra problems should be done to really reinforce them. Take Math 120 with Ivan Ip! He was a great professor.",
    "Math 120 is a nice continuation of AP BC Calculus--the first few weeks have a little review, and then from there you take off. It's a pretty fast-paced course but managable work-wise (one problem set a week).",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If not, don't take it.",
    "For those who want to continue their study of math after high school calculus, either as part of a major requirement or because you like math, I would suggest taking math 120. However, it is CRUCIAL that you get a good TA\/teacher or the experience will be less-than-enjoyable. Use shopping period to get a feel for a few teachers, and get to the math sign-ups EARLY (even before sign-ups open) so you can try and get a spot in the good teachers' sections. Also, don't be immediately discouraged by grad students with strong accents - some of them turn out to be good teachers.Also, I would definitely suggest taking this class right after taking another calculus class (or right after high school). There is no review of previous topics in calculus, so it is important you remember enough to understand the material (need to know calculus I stuff, but don't fret if you don't remember sequences\/series from calculus II).The problem sets are quite doable, though I would suggest checking over answers with classmates because most mistakes you make aresilly and it is important to have a high homework grade to buffer the difficult tests. Also it is important to do all the practice tests before every test because the tests are difficult, especially the final.Basically, this is your standard calculus class. Not particularly exciting, but it is a good class if you like math and have a good teacher."
