   "comments": [
    "A greater understanding and appreciation for the complex history, theories, and methods behind the discipline that I was lacking in previous art history courses. I also felt I improved my writing and reading strategies, especially for more complex texts.",
    "This class is amazing. The readings and discussions that Profs. James and Bravo facilitate make you look at art and visual culture in a completely new (and useful, and academically rigorous) way. The course basically provides a toolkit for engaging with art using a variety of methods. Rather than focus on the history of the history of art, the course stresses how different art historical methods are brought to bear on art in the present day. This class was completely eye-opening for me, as it provided insight into how art historians do their research. The course is writing-heavy, but so is the field of art history in general. Profs. James and Bravo provide useful feedback on both your writing style and the way to write about art analysis specifically. You learn so much, its amazing.",
    "Strong grounding in different ways of doing art history. Familiarity with a range of important names and methods. The frequency of assignments helped me efficiently translate readings into responses and summarize often complex concepts. I developed confidence in giving presentations over the course of the class. I feel like this was an endurance class with a lot of work and a large range and volume of material. I was forced to develop versatility and change gears every week, which was a positive intellectual challenge.",
    "How to write critical art papers with better use of transitions and flow. How to talk more critically about works of art rather than from just a visual analysis standpoint. Learned of which critical methods interest me the most."

   "comments": [
    "This class is so good!!!",
    "Strengths: rigorous readings. Fantastic and important primary sources. Clear outcomes\/goals for many assignments. Challenging opportunities for presentations. Constant encouragement to synthesize and summarize material. Masterfully organized to focus each week on the highlights of each topic. Weaknesses: I'm not sure that the four weekly responses added much to my understanding of the material. It felt like some exercises (especially reading responses) focused on regurgitating material.",
    "Both professors are wonderful!! I learned an invaluable amount about both the material and the technical skills necessary for the art history major.",
    "Well organized syllabus, however, the organization and explanation about reading papers, YUAG papers, and YUAG presentations could have been better. A complete list of all the critical methods with their definitions would have been very useful to refer to throughout the semester. Some less abstract critical readings would have been very refreshing and much more balanced. Strength was consistent great discussion and participation of entire class.",
    "A fantastic crash course in seminal art history and theory. You really learn to write about art and art history. However, I found there to be too many student-led discussions. I understand that it gave each student to engage with readings and their peers differently, but certain weeks discussion was needlessly slow."

    "This class is essential for anyone wishing to learn how to make sense of art in a rigorous way. It's required for art history majors, but it should be on the list of anyone with a solid prior knowledge of art history and a desire to learn (a lot) more.",
    "For majors, this class is obviously mandatory and obviously a lot of work, but it's a great experience to be able to sit down with other majors and go through all these important readings and methods. Def take it with Prof. James and Prof. Bravo if they ever teach it again! We were lucky to get both of them, who were both amazing to work with.",
    "Yes, if that student has a serious interest in learning the crucial aspects of art history. This course had a challenging workload, but the nature of the course meant that each week we got to read and discuss highlights of the literature from each \"critical approach.\" The weekly presentations and visits to the YUAG were fun and prevented the course from feeling monotonous or boring. I now have a wider base of knowledge than before, and will be very glad to know the information this class taught me in other art history courses. This class gives us the \"must-know\" highlights from the history of art history, which is necessary as an art history major. Also, since we move so quickly between topics, we read the best of each approach, and most of the readings are truly fascinating and challenging.",
    "Yes. Good class and required of the major. Readings were a little too abstract for my taste and more often than not it was hard to see the relation to the various critical methods. I would have preferred to have been actively engaged with more analysis of actual works rather than art criticism. I was turned off from the field a bit after reading some of the analysis of the art historical critical methods because it was too abstract and I found that critics came to conclusions that were too far-fetched; consequently this class has caused me to potentially reconsider my double major."
