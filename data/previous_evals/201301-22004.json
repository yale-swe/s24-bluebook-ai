    "I would recommend it, but there's a lot less guidance and in-class practice of the concepts that you learn than there was in L1 and L2, so it makes it feel like the material is moving VERY quickly. It's tough but still worth taking!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - it teaches you some essential fundamentals of the Hebrew language and syntax, and you come out of it with a much more solid base of understanding of how all the different components of the language work together. It is a really worthwhile class, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not confident in their fundamentals before taking an L5 course. I honestly wish there were a Hebrew 150 that kept going in the exact same format before the L5 level (a Hebrew L4.5 perhaps).",
    "Fun class--can be kind of a lot of homework sometimes, but Ayala is wonderful and the content is enjoyable."
