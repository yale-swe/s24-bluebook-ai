   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend it. The material is super interesting, and the class is pretty easy.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are interested in medicine\/public health. It's fairly soft in terms of theory and math.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes, take this class. The material is pretty interesting stuff. The work is reasonable, although this is in no way a gut (like 3 problem sets, two presentations, a final project that requires some work and weekly readings). Professor Sindelar is great, although she sometimes just spends the whole class lecturing when discussion would be more fun. But I'd take it again.",
    "This class is definitely what you make of it. You'll get out as much as you put in so take it if you're willing to put in some work. Don't underestimate the amount of work the final paper is. It's pretty short but it's the main assignment in the class so you have to work really hard at it.",
    "Fantastic class. Material is very interesting and Professor Sindelar is great. Very reasonable workload too.",
    "absolutely recommend if you are actually interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in public health, addiction and economics. It provides a unique and excellent opportunity to learn about a variety of topics in the field from an expert, and also allows for the opportunity to innovate and propose policy through a research project. It is an excellent course enhanced by its status as an economics\/public health seminar."
