   "comments": [
    "great overview of culture and in depth base for the language. Definitely would recommend this course to someone",
    "Your language skills will continue to improve a lot after SPAN 110, and you will be learning a lot of grammar and vocab. I would recommend it to another student who is either looking to fulfill the distributional requirements or somebody who is really interested in learning Spanish.",
    "Spanish 120 is a great course in preparing students to become more proficient and confident Spanish speakers and writers. I strongly recommend taking the course with Jennifer Darrell because she is an amazing instructor that will go above and beyond in helping you to grasp the course material.",
    "Spanish is probably the most useful language for people who want to work in the United States. Take this course, and take it with Jennifer if you can stomach the early start time.",
    "It's an excellent course!",
    "take this course if you know the preterite and the imperfect tenses. In the course, we learn the future, commands, and most of the perfect tenses. If you are worried about your oral skills, you will probably be able to learn most of it during the semester just by going to office hours once a week - it really helps.",
    "This is a beginning Spanish course that meets every day and requires a great deal of patience and discipline. I feel it is necessary to have had some experience with the language before taking the course."
