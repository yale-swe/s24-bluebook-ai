   "comments": [
    "Kind of a disaster but Igami was so nice and knowledgeable.",
    "Don't take this course. It's easy, if that's your thing, but massively uninteresting. I didn't learn anything.",
    "Take the course. Interesting to learn about innovation in an age of startups and Silicon Valley culture.",
    "Definitely take this class. Workload is very manageable and the material itself is interesting. 2 homeworks, 2 presentations which don't take up too much time and 1 midterm. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Great econ senior seminar, would definitely take.",
    "Fairly good take it!",
    "It's alright. After the midterm every class is presentations, which can get pretty damn boring.",
    "Decent Course. A nice senior lecture. Didn't learn that much new topic matter.",
    "A good course if you're interested in the intersection between business\/innovation and (micro-)economics. Not much work and no final exam!",
    "Pretty low key senior seminar. Expect to be engaged, not so much after midterms, but not absolutely love this class",
    "If you're looking for a mildly interesting senior econ credit go for it. It's not going to shake your world views but its worth the time if you can manage it.",
    "This is a great chill senior seminar. Ours actually ended up turning into a lecture because it was so oversubscribed. The focus was on process innovation, including from the 1980's and 1990's rather than the modern tech industry, but many people focused on tech startups\/3D printing for their final projects. The assignments are graded pretty rigorously, but are manageable. The entire second half of the class was student final presentations, so for sure take this class if you want a laid back senior spring.",
    "I would recommend Econ 410 as a good second semester course for a senior. It moves at a comfortable pace and is especially interesting in the first half of the semester. The second half involved mostly student presentations and was less exciting and informative.",
    "Pretty easy course about an interesting topic. You won't learn that much, however, but you won't have to work hard, so it depends on what kind of experience you're going for senior year."
