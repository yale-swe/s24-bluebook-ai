    "This class is amazingly useful, but a ton of work. Great for anyone who wants to do science or is working on a thesis.",
    "This was the best thing I ever did for finishing my thesis. I think all interest areas (water, forests, carbon, etc) should be required to have these pseudo-lab-groups of peer support, critique, etc.",
    "10 - this course was extremely valuable. It helped me learn how to go beyond my summer master's work to then analyze, present, and write about my research in a way for others to understand and appreciate. A class like this one would help anyone who has done a summer field study and needs guidance on the \"what next\" part of actually getting it ready for publication.",
    "This class was for students to continue working on their thesis research and presentation skills. It was certainly useful, although students (myself included) had difficulty honoring deadlines which led to a certain lax attitude that was counterproductive.",
    "Excellent course for science students interested in a variety of topics related to analyzing and publishing data."

    "Guidance through the publication and presentation processes.",
    "Repeatedly presenting your work in a progressive manner; progressive submission of parts of your thesis; peer review.",
    "Support of peers and advisor",
    "The opportunity this class gave me to get the feedback on my research from Prof Ashton, Elaine Hooper, and all of the other students. The questions they ask in class are questions that I need to be able to answer in my work. The class was a fun, friendly, and non-judging environment for me to present my thesis work and get the feedback needed to improve it.",
    "Preparation for thesis analysis.",
    "The feedback we all received on our research, presentation skills and writeups was really invaluable.",
    "It created a \"lab\" environment for those masters students interesting in sharing ideas and projects. Excellent opportunity to peer review scientific inquiries."

   "comments": [
    "We presented progress on our work too many times, and could have used more sessions to just do the work - I wouldn't have minded fewer scheduled meetings with more time to get the work done. A structured workshop with the stats professors would have been very helpful. I also think deadlines should be much more strictly enforced, and that that should be made very clear upfront. I say that with tongue firmly in cheek, since I often overran deadlines (I'm so sorry!)",
    "Once some students got farther behind on their assignments, their role in the class seemed to be cut out or diminished. If some students are not as far as others, the professor should not keep telling the whole class that. In that case i would recommend the professor have those people present no matter what and on whatever level they are ready for so that the class can continue to give them help and feedback.",
    "its a year long course, so maybe the second semester should be more structured to force the work out of students- mixing it up between student presentations and workshops on publishing, statistics, etc would be nice (started to happen informally but could be built upon). Student presentations in general could have been tighter (shorter, less rambling) to help the course run more smoothly."

It kept me from overenrolling in spring '10 because the Analysis of Silvicultural Problems course occupied some course credits, and kept things in perspective. I also just adore Mark Ashton and think he's a fantastic advisor.",

    "Don't miss it, and don't take a full courseload while you are trying to also obtain a science degree. Give yourself credit, and time, to get your science done right. If you're getting the science degree, that should be what you came here for, right?",
    "Even if you cannot go as fast as Prof. Ashton wants, turn something in. What I did, was even when I did not have all my data finished, I did analysis on part of the data and wrote my sections on that part. I got the important feedback I needed and later was able to just make minor changes as I added the full data into the analysis. I think others started going downhill in their progress, grades, and Prof's approval when they stopped turning in assignments. Even if you are not done, turn in what you can. There is no way that everyone can help you if you do not give them something.",
