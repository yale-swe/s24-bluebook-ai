    "If you like the CEID and want to spend most of your waking hours there, take this course. Yale does not have very many good design courses at the moment, but you'll learn a lot in MENG 489. Most importantly, the teaching staff (like Glenn, Nick, and Kevin) are amazing resources who will take the time to walk through problems with you and help you realize what all of your available options might be. You may not enjoy the course, but you will grow a lot as an engineer by the end of it.",
    "You probably have to take it, so just thank the lord you're not taking it with Aaron Dollar.",
    "This class could have been really interesting, but it was undermined by trying to do too much in one class. It would work better as a class focused on projects or focused on reports. There were weekly 10+ pg team reports that took too much time away from the projects. The deadline for the first prototype should have been way sooner. Most of the projects get thrown together in the last two weeks. Take away some of the reports (half of which don't move the design forward at all) and more time would get spent on the projects. While the project themselves turned out to be pretty cool, certain projects were definitely harder to complete than others, and some of the teaching staff had unrealistic expectations. If you can, avoid taking this class with Dollar (didn't seem to care about the class) and don't take with another project class. Its a lot of work, especially 2 weeks before the project is due",
    "You don't have a choice, so I'll just try and offer some tips for making the class a little less stressful. First off, if Professor Dollar is teaching again, protest and get the department to have another professor teach. If that doesn't work, and even if it does, start early and work hard. It's a stressful class but the end results can be satisfying. Regardless, make use of the support staff, because I am confident no one's project would have worked without the help of Glenn, Nick, and Kevin. All great people to talk with and all incredibly knowledgable and helpful.",
    "The class provides a very real engineering experiment although some of the teaching staff definitely make things harder than they need to be and having a team that belittles you can of course be frustrating. So much depends on how your team dynamic is and mine was very poor.",
    "It's just as it's advertised - a group senior design project. But then, instead of just working on the project, you have a bunch of other assignments every week. On top of that, because it's a group project, you have to spend a bunch of time managing group dynamics. And then you realize you have to build many iterations. And unlike PSETs which you can save time by being clever and figuring out the problems, building things just take a lot of time. And then you get your assignments back and realize that the staff expects you to also turn in impeccable reports. You decide you have to cut your losses somewhere and save time here and there to make sure you have enough time for other classes, extracurriculars, friends, and life in general. But when there are team evaluations, other group members might rate you low, and so you just put more time into it not only because of team member evaluation, but also because you don't want to let them down. In short MENG 489 is a big time suck. But anything worthwhile in life requires a lot of time right?",
    "It's a lot of work but very satisfying at the end of the term to have a working final prototype. We got access to a lot of different resources, from priority using the laser cutter and 3d printers, to a lot of machine shop time. Learned a lot about the entire design process, although the reports, especially in the beginning of the semester, were tedious and seemed a bit excessive.",
    "If you're looking at this class, then you already know what it is. The class is fun, but it's a huge amount of work, especially if you end up needing to do multiple iterations of your prototype. That said, it's a good taste of real-world engineering, and will tie together a lot of what you've learned in past classes. It is VERY heavy on reports, especially in the first half, and it can seem like all you're doing for the first bit is writing, but once you start to build stuff, it becomes way more fun (and way more time-consuming). Overall, try to pick a project that will lend itself well to the class: anything where you have a constrictive size or weight requirement will be more difficult, and projects that have easy to measure outcomes and plenty of flexibility in the possible designs is a better choice, rather than something that sounds sexy. A more boring project that you can easily do analysis and experimentation on will let you do much better in the course than a project that may seem cooler, but be more difficult. Because the focus of the class is pretty heavy on the process, picking a project that lends itself well to the design process, and that won't be difficult to build several iterations of, is key. Also, start building your prototypes early; although the class will seem like it's mostly reports, and your first \"prototype\" probably won't be due until the end of October, you should start building physical prototypes as soon as you can. This may take more time earlier in the course, but will prevent the incredibly frustrating late nights later on. Although there are only 2 \"mandated\" levels of prototype (first prototype and detailed design), you will probably want to build at least three versions, especially if your project is difficult to model in CAD and you have to put it together to see whether or not it's working. Overall, if you can avoid it, take 404 instead of 489, even if you aren't interested in medical devices; 404 is a much better class, even though it's not as rigorous, and Joe and Jean are much more dedicated to the success of the projects than the 489 teaching staff seemed to be.",
    "Usually a great class when taught by Dean Wilczynksi. This year the projects did not really fit the course well. Also MechE's should all have to take a project class before this class. Senior capstone should not be an intro to what working on a project looks like, it should be an opportunity to take skills from past projects and apply them (technical, time management, etc). Groups\/ workload can become imbalanced.",
    "Hopefully Dollar isn't teaching it, otherwise a decently good class. You can take it with 404 - it's just a lot of work.",
    "This class was terrible and was the epitome of the failures of Yale Engineering for me. If you are not ABET MechE, don't take this course unless it changes in the near future. If you are ABET MechE, let me ask you why and hopefully you still have time to consider other options. If you are so determined on engineering, I applaud you. However, take time to assess what you like about engineering, what are your post-graduation goals, and what you are looking to gain from a ABET education at Yale. In my opinion, an ABET MechE degree at Yale is not the best way to obtain a lot of goals. You are probably better off doing a BS-12 with a double major or taking the courses that are actually in your areas of interest. You definitely would benefit more from engineering extracurriculars and internship experiences than class experiences. (In class, you won't learn anything practical until 3 years in and you will learn from professors who care more about research than teaching.) If you want to go into industry, do several internships. If you want to go to graduate school, do research. If you want to go into consulting, a double major in economics is just as impressive. I unfortunately could not admit that ABET at Yale was not worth it until far too late. Save yourself the (4-year long) headache and reconsider.",
    "If not ABET probably would not take it to avoid extra stress. If ABET, make sure to do as much practical and tangible work as possible before prototype presentation.",
    "If you are an ABET ME major, you simply have to take this class. If you are a non-ABET ME major and thinking about going into industry, I would highly recommend this class. Be prepared for a very high work load. This course was definitely a love-hate relationship. On one hand, I worked on a really exciting project that all of my teammates want to continue, but I also have a number of complaints. I think the fact that all of my teammates want to continue working on this project attests to the quality of the course. You will definitely learn a lot and learn how to work under high stress situations. In addition, I can see myself using a lot of techniques we learned in this course. One of my complaints about 489 is that the disparity in experience level between students is quite high. I think SEAS is partially at fault for this by rejecting ME students from courses such as 404 in order to have more diverse students in the course. However, there are still tons of ways to get involved in projects. For instance, there are great student organizations on campus that are incredibly easy to get involved with. The teaching staff should also leverage CEID resources to publicize 489. The selection of projects was quite small and I do not think the projects were as well vetted as they were in 404. More publicity can help reach out to a larger client base to choose more suitable projects. In addition, the teaching staff should have a good idea what a project will involve and should not force projects to fit into a certain mold. Often, I felt as if we had to contort our project in order to meet report requirements. Overall, I would recommend this course. Just be willing to put in the time.",
    "A lot of this class depends on the group you get and that's out of your control so good luck. Definitely don't take this unless you have to (i.e. you're ABET). Dollar is a douchebag, can't do much about that. The deliverables are annoying and generally unhelpful. Get them done early. The average score for deliverables is like an 85 or something and you'll invariably get 2 points off for formatting. every. single. time. Good luck and godspeed, it's going to be a hell of a semester for you.",
    "Look, you're only taking this class if you have to. The couple of people I know who weren't ABET seniors would've dropped this is it hadn't left their team in a lurch. Prototype early and well.",
    "It was a mess, and everyone agreed on that. I had heard rumors that this is somewhat tradition in MechE, but hopefully they'll get it right eventually. Focus on your project, and don't be afraid to begin prototyping before the syllabus requires you too. My team had three prototypes by the end, despite only requiring two, and I deeply regret that we hadn't produced the first one a couple weeks earlier than we did. Also buy a cot, because you'll be living in the CEID at the end of the semester."
