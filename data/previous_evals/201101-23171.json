    "It's a great class that gives you time to appreciate the Beatles and Dylan more and Tomlinson stresses elements of their music that make one appreciate all of music more. At the same time, it is very music heavy and sometimes too structured. I think incorporating more of the 60s and maybe the work of artists that the Beatles and Dylan were responding too and contemporary with could take this class to the next level were most expected it to be. Nevertheless a good class.",
    "This course rocks! I loved both Bob Dylan and the Beatles coming in and I still learned SO much. I had no musical background and I felt perfectly comfortable in the lectures. The books are really fun to read and the music is, in my opinion, some of the best out there. Professor Tomlinson is also amazing - he is smart, funny, approachable and nice. The three papers are also interesting and not a big deal. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This was a great class, and I would absolutely recommend it if you are interested in going pretty deeply into this music. The papers are on great topics, though coming up with original things to say because of the discussions in class and the extremely comprehensive text for the class. It was three relatively short papers and some reading and listening, so not too much work.",
    "This was a really good class about very interesting material. You should definitely take it if you are able to get in. The workload is pretty light and most of the work is pretty enjoyable anyway. While the class itself does not have great class discussions and could have been more engaging, it is still about very interesting subject matter so it is quite enjoyable.",
    "We had three papers, lots of reading, and learning to listen. Tomlinson is fabulous, not to mention brilliant. Not that you'd know it. Not the best use of class credit if you're looking for intensive humanities, but a fun and cool course.",
    "He did a good job at pointing out subtleties in the music that I would not have heard. But focused too much on the musical intricacies than the broader themes and implications of the music.",
    "Not quite as chilled as it sounds. Not a ton of necessary work although is worht doing if you plan on getting anything out of the class. I would recommend but not very highly.",
    "Loved the reading and listening assignments. Even though it says no prior musical experience required, I felt as if the Professor expected us to have some musical abilities going into the class. He did little to explain the basic musical terms and therefore I did not learn much as far as music theory goes.",
    "It is a great class, fun and interesting. Taking it Credit\/D\/Fail made it especially casual, but doing well means doing well on 3 papers. so trying for those three times will get you a good grade. It is not an especially content filled class with lots of revelations, but if you're taking a class like this, you're expectations are it to be fun and laidback, which is what it is.",
    "This is a really interesting, engaging course. I learned a lot about listening to music and about the 1960s in Britain and America. A really fun course that got me interested in modern American history, cultural theory, and media studies. Prof. Tomlinson is a good teacher, although the size of the class (around 20 students ended up getting in though it was capped at 18) made it a bit of a lecture at times.Prof. Tomlinson knows so much about music (and would just sit down at the piano and start playing a Beatles song, figuring a few chords out as he went) and he lived through the sixties. It was really interesting to hear what he had to say, and he also made an effort to have us all jump in with our own insights and thoughts, encouraging us to develop a language for discussing music though some of us were hesitant, having no real musical background. Take this course; it's so much fun, and I really felt like it gave me a foothold into the era.",
    "A fun, interesting freshman seminar. You get to listen to music and read interesting biographies of The Beatles and Dylan for homework. There are only three short papers throughout the semester. I would take it again.",
    "As an avid lover of The Beatles and music of the '60s, I would definitely recommend this course to any music fan. You get to read interesting books and listen to some amazing music each week. I didn't know much about Dylan before this class and I am now a huge fan of his music. This was my favorite class this semester. Try to get into this course via the lottery, but even if that doesn't work, just keep showing up and you should get in. I wish I could take this class again.",
    "SUCH AN AMAZING COURSE. Definitely try to take it if you can, but it's really hard to get into. Professor Tomlinson is absolutely awesome--so fun, ridiculously knowledgeable, really helpful and understanding. The class is not that hard--really interesting readings that you actually want to do, listening to the Beatles and Bob Dylan as homework, and 3 papers that are really interesting to write. You discuss Bob Dylan and the Beatles from many different standpoints: the history of America and Britain in the 1960s and how it affected and was affected by Bob Dylan and the Beatles, the history of the artists themselves and their biographical trajectories, and really in depth analysis of their music, both with and without the technical jargon. You don't need to have a musical background to be in the class and Tomlinson is really good at explaining as we analyze. However if you do have a musical background, it can be even more interesting. This class was really fantastic. So fun and so interesting and I love knowing so much about it all now.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's probably better if you have some previous musical knowledge, since that's a lot of what's discussed.",
    "I would recommend anyone who is interested in pop songwriting, the 60s, Dylan or the Beatles to take this class. If you are expecting this class to deal with the era's history this is probably not the class you should take as the main focus is the extensive analysis of the albums and songs, and relatively brief discussions about the social context. But in general, this is probably one of the most interesting and fun classes you can take at Yale.",
    "This is a course about the music and history of the Beatles (with a bit of the same for Bob Dylan). You read biographies and chronicles of the artists' careers during the '60s, and in class you explore individual songs or albums in great depth. There's a strong emphasis on harmony, but you don't need any music theory background to follow. I couldn't help but feel, however, that this seminar was just too large. With twenty odd people sitting in a vast, vacuous circle, it seemed like the questions that Prof. Tomlinson threw out were reading check questions. It had a high school classroom sort of feel. Where we could have been discussing, at length, what these songs actually mean and why they're so great (everyone has strong opinions on the Beatles), I felt like when we raised our hands to speak (this is another issue with such a large seminar), we were merely being humored before having to move on. 1) Make the seminar smaller so that the discussion will be more of a discussion. OR make this a lecture course (I feel like an enormous number of people would enroll) with sections - less time doing reading checks, more time on the music\/history. 2) Just eliminate the Dylan aspect of this course - I don't feel like I learned nearly as much about Dylan as I did about the Beatles. The '60s were such a small portion of his body of work anyway. We frankly needed more time to talk about the Beatles, and everyone knew it. It was obvious that Prof. Tomlinson was not as interested in the Dylan, and we followed suit.",
    "If you're lucky enough to get in, take it. If you don't get in, you're missing something fun, but not life-changing."
