    "If you've taken one of the intro physics sequences (preferably 200\/201 or 260\/261) or otherwise have a comparable physics background, and you've taken the first term of lab (205), you should definitely take 206 if you have a half-credit to spare at any point in time. The workload is small - 4 hours in lab plus 2-6 hours per week to write lab reports; the labs are (mostly) interesting - and you can pick the labs that interest you most; and you'll get a very valuable hands-on perspective on the equipment and techniques used by experimentalists. I strongly recommend this class.",
    "Probably a little better than 205 but still not much fun.",
    "206L is more chill than 205. In 206 you get to do much cooler experiments, and they actually work(!), vs. in 205 where you just sit there hopelessly in front of circuits that don't work. We did labs in superconductivity, particle accelerator experiments, etc. Just make sure you get a good partner and you should be fine. Lab reports aren't too bad, maybe 3-4 hours per week tops. We also made liquid nitrogen ice cream after one of our experiments!",
    "I really recommend this course, if you want to get your hands on x-rays, particle accelerators, quantum levitation and other amazing experiments.Some labs are written better than others. I do not recommend to choose the DC power supplies.",
    "I doubt you're even considering this course if you don't need it, but 206 lab, assuming you don't get a terrible TA, is actually great. The experiments are interesting and most TAs I've heard of have been chill about lab reports. No final is a plus, and definitely do the superconductivity lab, so much fun!",
    "Take it because it's most likely required. There are lab reports, but they aren't bad. The grading on them is pretty fair, and you actually learn about physics instead of just following instructions like you do in 205L.",
    "If you started with PHYS 205, you're pretty much stuck with this. It is definitely more work than PHYS 205. Instead of in-class lab notes that you only worry about for 4 hours a week, you write weekly full lab reports, which include background, methods, results, and conclusion sections. These took me anywhere between 6 and 12 hours per week. Labs with large data sets take much longer to write up because of all the error prop (!!) you have to do. That being said, the experiments themselves are actually very interesting. I would recommend the following labs: C1, E3, H1, H4. J1 gives so-so data. F1 data is annoying to deal with. J3, the nuclear scattering experiment, is really great - until you have to analyze data. Took forever. Still worth it though. DO NOT do B2, as the data analysis is terrible.",
    "Getting to choose your experiments might mean that you could avoid certain topics or types of experiments, but the lack of much information at the start meant you had to go with your gut feeling. If you plan on taking this class (which I think for most people is for a major rather than by choice), ask someone who's taken it to know what is involved in the experiment write-up. That being said, there's two buffer weeks with no experiments, which is super awesome (since I had to take the Friday slot because of schedule). And some of the experiments were really cool (superconductor where we got to play with liquid nitrogen and watch magnets float). TAs are generally not too strict with grading the experiment write-ups (which is all you need to do. No finals!) Overall, pretty chill class with some really cool experiments.",
    "206 is a lot more fun than 205 because you get to choose your own experiments. The only bad part is that you have to do weekly write-ups -- which, though nothing compared to the length of orgo labs, took a deceivingly long time. The questions the lab handouts posed were often vague and confusing, but if you luck out with a good TA you'll be find.Two more quick things: pick a good partner (perhaps a friend from 205 or your intro physics course), because you'll be stuck with them the entire semester; also, do the accelerator lab! It was awesome and the operator is incredibly nice!",
    "This course is significantly different from Physics 205L. The experiments are mostly related to modern physics, and are therefore much more interesting than those in 205. I'd highly recommend the superconductivity, electron q\/m, and X-ray diffraction labs. Also unlike P205, there are weekly lab reports that can take a substantial amount of time (10-12 hours in some cases), and error analysis is quite important for some of these analyses. Despite this greater workload, though, I would definitely take this course over P205 or P166 if given another chance: the experiments are just so much more interesting.",
    "It's not awful and some of the labs are really cool. But, there is not much guidance for the lab writeups, and even in setting up experiments, so you are kind of on your own during the course.",
    "Fun course! You get to choose all of your experiments and they all work.The lab isn\u0092t linked too closely to the intro physics courses so you can take it whenever.",
    "This course is much better than 205. You get to do independent experiments, but the TAs still help you with problems. Your entire grade depends on the lab reports, but it's not difficult to do well on them. There is no final. Since you get to choose which labs you do, definitely do the digital logic lab."
