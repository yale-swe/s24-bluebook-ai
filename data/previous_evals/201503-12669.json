   "comments": [
    "The reading list is interesting, a combination of philosophy and modern psychology, but the class does not address these readings adequately. They are very superficially covered. The professor does not explain these readings enough. The introduction she gives to the readings remain surface-level, rather than delving deeper.",
    "The unique advantage of this course is that the readings and discussions are cross disciplinary. It is rare to discuss philosophy in the same context as behavioral economics.",
    "Take this class if you want an interesting and varied overview of choice, decision theory, and a bit ethics and the philosophy of free will. Professor Landemore is great, a very smart and open instructor and keen on hearing what her students have to say. All this being said, the multidisciplinary approach felt a little stunting at times, instead of a cohesive attempt to consider an idea or subject from all different perspectives and then synthesize (I just think the \"synthesize\" aspect was kind of left out). Yet, it is a nascent class, and am *sure* it will continue to improve over the next iterations.",
    "Well, don't be deceived by the interesting course material and content. The readings are indeed very fun to go through - by yourself, perhaps, since the lectures hardly value-add or teach you anything at all - unless you want to take this course just for the sake of making yourself read those readings. That being said, we aren't even held to a very high standard of giving robust assessments and insights into the readings. I doubt most people in class even keep up with the readings; we all just come in and speak in an irritably fluffy and abstract way about the content of the session. Also, essays are graded extremely harshly, and we receive little-to-zero guidance on them. She expects our insights to just miraculously emerge, but gives us no help in forming them. It is quite a painful class to sit through for the whole semester. :(",
    "I would recommend definitely recommend this course. It is very reading heavy, and the more reading you do, the more you will get out of it. Most of the readings are quite interesting, so doing at least a couple of the readings for each class is not too bad. The assignments for the class are not very structured, but she is pretty flexible in what you are able to do for them. Having a solid background in philosophy is definitely helpful, but not totally necessary. he class does a good job of tying in a vast range of topics and approaches to decision making. It was fun to see the connections between the works of political scientists, behavioral economists and philosophers.",
    "I would recommend this class to students from all backgrounds.",
    "How We Choose was an amazing class. The readings were all fascinating, the class was discussion-based, and Prof. Landemore was great. Definitely take if you are looking for an interesting perspective on political philosophy, or just an enjoyable philosophy class that draws on more contemporary sources.",
    "Would *highly* recommend if you're interested in philosophy, politics, economics, or why it is that being human is really that cool. Want to learn how you think and why we've evolved to do it the way we have? Take this course."
