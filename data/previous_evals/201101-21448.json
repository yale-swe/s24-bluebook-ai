   "comments": [
    "This class is very difficult, but the curve is pretty good (less good than first semester Biochem). Take this only if you are interested in Biochemistry or need it for your major. Take advantage of discussion sections, meeting with TAs and professors to really understand the information\/pass the class.",
    "Good course. You learn biochem.",
    "MB&B 301 is an awesome class! While this semester is certainly more detail-oriented, the exams are much more focused on experimental strategies and using logic to piece things together. Although many would say that this class is harder than the first semester, this class is an interesting one to take if you're up for looking at problem solving in biology\/biochemistry.",
    "This class was very different from any other science class I have taken. They basically present you some experiment on the test and you have to interpret the results on the spot. I never got used to this, so it was difficult to me since I'm not very research based. But it was definitely a learning experience. Was one of the hardest classes I've taken at Yale. Don't take it unless you're an MB&B major or have to take it.",
    "It was way different from MB&B300, but still useful. The tests were monsters. I didn't really get used to them until the final exam, and I always ran out of time on the midterms (so did a lot of other people). It wasn't one of my favorite courses...",
    "This is a REAL science class. I found the material interesting even though I was not particularly interested in the subject in the beginning. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful but the student needs to take the initiative in seeking help. The problem sets and tests arechallenging and require a lot of thinking. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning about DNA\/RNA who wants a challenge in interpreting experimental data instead of just memorizing stuff.",
    "if you need to fulfill it for a requirement take it, or you can do it credit\/D...otherwise it's very hard",
    "Tough course, but most definitely worth it.",
    "If you are interested in biochemistry, this is a good introductory course, but you need to be prepared to learn the material on your own as lecture does not adequately teach it to you.",
    "This class has difficult tests, lots of crazy pre-meds, and a hard curve. Nevertheless, it'll teach you how to think about research problems in a critical way, which is incredibly valuable if you foresee yourself doing anything even remotely research-related in the future. Lectures are done extremely well, and the class is well organized. A staple of MB&B, and an example for all other science classes at Yale. You will walk away knowing biochemistry.",
    "A difficult but interesting course. Make sure you don't fall behind on the reading! I also would probably not recommend this course unless it was required for your major.",
    "I did not take any biology courses before taking this class and I feel that it did put me at a slight disadvantage. Be prepared to work a little more if you don't have a strong bio background.",
    "The second semester of Biochem is more challenging than the first semester and requires a lot more self-teaching because the material is often breezed through in class. That being said, you do learn a TON by the end of the semester. I would recommend this to any MCDB major instead of the single semester MCDB version of Biochem (if you're an MB&B major, it's required anyway) with the caveat that the first semester is more enjoyable than the second.",
    "I think the general consensus is that this course is harder than the first semester, but that may be because you're required to think and not just memorize. I personally found the material a lot more interesting (gene regulation>>> fat synthesis) and for students who are smart and able to understand the material but don't have tons of time to memorize before the exam, the curve might actually be more generous than in 300.",
    "Too hard. It is very different from 300. It instead of emphasizing biological applications, it is more experiment based; like the psets and tests as you to analyze biochem data. If you like Koelle's class does not mean you will love this class. It is much more MB&B style.",
    "I would recommend this class. You really learn how to think about the data and conclusions from experiments that lead to the current knowledge in the field. It is more a course of synthesizing concepts to apply to new situations instead of just pure memorization. You have a daily discussion question, which encourages peer discussion and then you go over it in class. The professors are good, and they are very enthusiastic and make an effort to clear up any questions during office hours. You will learn a lot. That being said, this class is very difficult-much harder than first semester of biochemistry. The problem sets and exams are very hard, so be prepared to work to do well. Really try to go to section and work together with others on problem sets, as this will solidify your understanding of the material. Good luck.",
    "It's a very different course from the first semester 300 course, and probably for the better. Some things can be more difficult but at least there seems to a lot less memorization involved.",
    "This class felt like drinking from a fire hose at times with the amount of material you're expected to know. You then have to take this knowledge and apply it to the exam questions which are all based on lab data and what conclusions you can draw from them. It is many many times harder than MB&B 300, especially since I felt there was less of a unifying theme throughout the course.For those of you thinking about the lab: the lab is a lot of work on top of this as it covers material from both semesters. Sometimes the material is complementary, but I often felt overwhelmed from spending 30 hours of week (including class time) on biochem.",
    "If you are reading this evaluation, you are probably required to take this course for your major, or already very interested in science. However, even if you are required to take this course, never fear. It\u0092s actually a great class! Although the not all three lecturers are fantastic, the first one, Patrick Sung is great! Also, the material is interesting and the weekly work is not excessive, although you should keep up on the reading and your own studying if you want to do well. Much more than the first semester, this course focuses on biochemistry techniques and analyzing gels, etc. Therefore, if you are interested in the research side of biochemistry, then this is the course for you. It covers a lot about DNA and prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription and translation. I found it very interesting, but if you are taking this course simply to fulfill a pre-med or other science requirement, you may want to think about what sorts of topics you are interested in.",
    "You're taking it because you're an MB&B major. Otherwise, don't bother.",
    "It's harder than MB&B 300. Way harder. But you definitely learn a lot of interesting material, and you will leave this course with a much greater appreciation of biochemical experimentation. If you're up for a challenge and genuinely interested in learning about DNA and RNA, do it - but be prepared to do a lot of work.",
    "I love the fact that this class is less about rote memorization than it is about data analysis and interpretation. However, because of this very fact, biochem majors who have had years of experience working in a biochem lab would be in a much more advantaged position, and tend to do better than those who have never had such experience.",
    "I would describe this course as advanced genetics, but if you didn't like genetics, that doesn't mean you won't like this course. It's definitely one of the toughest I've taken at Yale - it's not only a lot of memorization, but you also need to figure out some tricky questions. I would recommend it, though, because it would be really useful for anyone going into research for biochemistry or biology. (And many of the topics will be relevant if you're pre-med!) It's not a lot of work every week, but don't cram everything into the nights just before the tests.",
    "A great course, well-taught and interesting. The reading is rather dense, but the problem sets and quizzes do a good job of making you think deeply about the material without being overly time-consuming. I would recommend it heartily\/",
    "It's a tough class to come into. I would recommend it, but really not for a grade.",
    "MBB 301 was definitely a challenge, but it stretched my mind. Most of the problem sets\/in-class \"quizzes\"\/exam questions are experiment-based questions, and this class does teach you how to interpret data and to design experiments. The professors are great, and they are really approachable. The TAs are also wonderful and helpful.",
    "The class is good. It's hard, and you have to put a lot of work in, but it does pay off. I definitely preferred the first semester in terms of how interesting I found the material, and in how it was taught, but this class is very solid as well.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. It will teach you how to think like a scientist. The exams are tough, but well worth it. You learn A LOT.",
    "The midterm exams were very experiment based, but the final wasn't. That threw me for a loop. Generally, you can't just memorize the material, you have to completely understand it. The sections are very student-question based, so you have to realize what you don't understand pretty early on to get anything out of them. It is a ton of information that is extremely difficult to catch up on if you get behind. That all said, the class is very interesting, and somewhat engaging even though it is a lecture. It requires a lot of time outside of lecture to do well on the exams.",
    "the class takes a lot of work. if you're interested and willing to study, it is worth it. if you dont really need or want to take it i don't know why you would.",
    "Be prepared to give up ALL of your free time and study one of the most intense\/challenging courses at Yale. But, it's a blast and tons of fun to learn!",
    "Great class--exams similar to practice exams. Problem set study groups great for getting to know fellow MBB majors. Professors are AMAZING and really dedicated to undergraduate science.",
    "Its a challenging course, but it will teach you a lot.",
    "MB&B 301 is very, very different from Michael Koelle's MB&B 300. First-semester biochemistry was very conceptually-oriented, and every piece of information you were asked to memorize had some rationale behind it or was justified in some way. Second-semester biochemistry takes the opposite approach, throwing every conceivable detail and bit of information at you, with the assumption that you should know all of it. Also, everything in second-semester biochemistry is presented from an experimental standpoint: more than half of the slides describe experiments or experimental results or data, and most of the problem sets and exam questions present you with diagrams of gels or graphs or other experimental data and ask you a bunch of questions about them. It is definitely helpful if you're familiar with biochemistry lab techniques or if you're taking biochem lab concurrently. MB&B 301 definitely has the potential to be an extremely rewarding and enriching class, but *only* if you can dedicate your life to it for the duration of the semester.",
    "If you're an MCDB major, take the MCDB version. I took biochem through the MB&B department, and am very disappointed to report that I hated a subject I was hoping and expecting to love. Be prepared to work your butt off. Know the experimental procedures, as almost all of the questions on the exams make you first decode an experiment before you can start applying the concepts.",
    "Not the best MBB course I have ever taken. MBB301 has a reputation for being hard, but that's mainly because the material covered is more dense and detailed than in first semester, and the teaching is less inspired than in first semester. The exams are more experiment based. If you do decide to take it, enjoy the 24 page final and not too much shorter midterms.",
    "If you\u0092re reading this, you\u0092ve probably already taken MB&B 300. This course maintains approximately the same level of detail, and the same assignment format: weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final that focuses mostly on the material at the end of the course. The content, of course, is different, with a heavy focus on the roles of nucleic acids in biological processes. Transcription, translation, and RNA processing are covered in significant detail. Most importantly, the lectures for this course contain data from actual experiments, and the professors (especially Prof. Steitz) emphasize understanding of these experiments and their logic. If you\u0092re an MB&B major, you\u0092re required to take this course. Even if you\u0092re not an MB&B major, this course is an excellent overview of nucleic acid biochemistry and of experimental logic.",
    "MBB 301 is a highly intensive, graduate level course that provides an intense overview of research-level biochemistry. The course was very thorough and highly difficult, as it not only required plenty of memorization, but the ability to quickly and accurately interpret publication data. One weakness in the course was that the material was at times too obscure and thus difficult to appreciate. Also, the class was extremely competitive. Definitely the most difficult course that I have taken during my two years at Yale!"
