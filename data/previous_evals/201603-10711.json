    "I learned how to write essays in the caliber that is expected at Yale. At the end of this course, I better understood the relationships between argument and claims and evidence. However, perhaps the most important thing I learned was the research process taken to write a research paper. The difference between a high school and college research paper is stark and I quickly learned that in this course. I feel much better prepared for other writing courses in Yale.",
    "I learned how to write a paper that has a main claim, subclaims, evidence, and clear warrants.",
    "I strengthened my academic writing skills, learned more about how to craft a specific argument that progress and throughout the paper.",
    "I developed the skills to properly format my papers and essays, along with my close reading skills.",
    "I learned how to analyze texts and right sophisticated academic papers at the college level. I learned about the deep historical and cultural significance of chivalry and how it continues to be observed over time through different mediums."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course was very well designed. The discussion were always engaging and the topic (Chivalry, Civility and Power) was always contentious and interesting. There was never a dull moment in the class. I do not have a particular weakness to talk about. Perhaps the only thing would be that there was disparity in who would participate the most in the discussions. Perhaps there could be more encouragement to address this minor issue.",
    "The subject of chivalry was very interesting to me and kept me engaged in the readings and discussions.",
    "I wish the course had talked about the civility and power part of the course title more. Sometimes i felt like we kind of ran chivalry into the mud and needed a new lens to discuss gender issues through time.",
    "The course has an amazing professor who kept me engaged. The subject matter is surprisingly fascinating, the use of different types of media (movies, tv shows) is great. Some of the assignments, essay prompts, were difficult to understand. The readings were all really interesting."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to any other peers. I feel that this was the best course I took in the my first semester at Yale because I was able to gain the most useful skills from it. The intellectual process of writing an essay is one of the best things I developed in this class and I would with that growth on any of my friends or peers. I would warn them however, that this course is challenging, but the reward is great.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It is an interesting class that will also help you improve your writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as it provides fundamental skills on the writing process which will apply to many other courses at Yale.",
    "Even though I am a STEM major, this class was one of my favorites this semester. I learned so much that I could even find myself connecting to the other courses I was taking, including the STEM courses. I got out of this class everything I wanted from a Yale professor and from my Yale experience."
