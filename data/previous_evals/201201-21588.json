    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in syntax. The workload was manageable but you should know that the readings are demanding.",
    "Everyone interested in formal linguistics at Yale should take a class with Bob. He is an amazing teacher, great at explaining really heady concepts, and he is very helpful in office hours; he'll frequently give you an entire mini-lesson if you're interested in something related to the course material that hasn't been covered. In terms of this particular course, it's challenging, but your appreciation of syntax will be much deeper than from Syntax I. If you were frustrated by Syntax I just feeling like a bunch of made-up stuff, give this course a shot; it just might redeem syntax for you. The workload is mostly reading long, dense papers and writing summaries of them. I found this to be the perfect amount of work to actually engage with the material without getting stressed out."
