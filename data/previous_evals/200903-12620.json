   "comments": [
    "A class that delves into deep analysis of certain literature dealing with childhood and reminiscence.",
    "Want to take a class that really makes you think about childhood and memory in new ways? Absolutely take this class!",
    "Throughout Childhood and Memory, you'll have myriad opportunities to delve into what is rich and meaningful in literature, philosophy, and our own minds. Take it.",
    "Yes. Light workload and great books.",
    "Yes! Sussman is a professor you must have before you graduate from Yale! This is a wonderful course with a wonderful reading list. The structure of the class really allowed students to shape it to their own interests!",
    "ABSOLUTELY. You are waisting your time at school if you don't take it.",
    "Yes, take it! If you're the kind of student who is comfortable with a relatively unstructured way of looking at texts, this class is a wonderful adventure.",
    "YES. Such a great class. The reading is all so interesting and you feel enlightened listening to the professor talk about them.",
    "Professor Sussman was absolutely wonderful. It is clear that he knows a lot about a lot of different things, and whenever he got off on a tangent, it always ended up having something to do with another topic in the course. Basically everything that he had to say was fascinating, and I came to his class even when I was sick. He himself is very encouraging, and he got to know basically everyone in the course. He has a great memory for names and interests, and he is very accomodating. He was slighty disorganized at times, but usually it was because of technological difficulties. He is a truly inspiring man. The course itself was great- the reading assortment was extremely varied, and you were bound to like something. This was a FANTASTIC course. Take it!!!",
    "This class is a little bit like literary analysis on acid (a drug reference not totally inapt considering one of the first readings was \"On Hashish\" by Benjamin), and I mean that in the best possible way. While not particularly structured in any formal sense of the word, the lectures and texts do circle nicely around concepts of Childhood and Memory. You will only have to read what you find time to, and essays and their deadlines are very much open to students' own creative direction. Final projects, presented in the last few classes, ranged from creative writing to close textual analysis,musical performances to Lacanian interpretations of economic incentive in bidding games.That said, Professor Sussman is a dynamic lecturer and will have many insightful things to say about whatever interests you. I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who's on the fence.",
    "Brilliant whirlwind tour through some of the best books and most interesting ideas of all time.",
    "This class was the greatest. Professor Sussman is the greatest. He is extraordinarily warm and thoughtful and a genius. You come to lecture, read what you want, and listen to him talk. At some moments you have no idea what he is talking about and at other moments, he is showering you with brilliance. The assignments are beyond flexible. This class was a joy.",
    "Take this class. If you're interested in literary theory, it's a no-brainer. Taking it after LITR 300 is probably best.Henry Sussman is one of the best professors at Yale. His lectures are always fascinating if labyrinthine. Go to his office hours and get to know him. Sussman says he wants you tailor the course to your interests and he means it. This is an extremely self-directed course. The reading list was insane, and the written projects and presentations for this course got me thinking in new ways. I feel like this class is one I'll look back on several years down the road and point to as a big influence. Shop it and make sure you like his lecture style before you leap.",
    "Yes Yes Yes! Every student at Yale needs to take this course! Everyone needs to take this course!",
    "An excellent collection of literature that approaches issues of childhood and memory in fascinating ways.",
    "A smorgasbord of texts for a class that is very unusal (but nicely so). Prof. Sussman is an adventurous and zany spirit, and hearing him speak is always a pleasant experience. Also, this course incorporates itself into a variety of disciplines (literature, cog. sci, philosophy), which means that it is a 'liberal arts' class in the truest sense. Maybe becomes a bit too discombobulated after a while.",
    "Take this class. It will change your perspective on...well, everything. Life. Your childhood. Why you're at Yale in the first place. No matter what you're interested in studying, this will enrich you as a human being. Henry Sussman is a god among mortals. Seriously.",
    "Wonderful course! Professor Sussman is at worst, a bit scattered, and at best, astonishingly elegant --however, always insightful and knowledgeable in terms of the material. Relaxed atmosphere, slightly heavy reading list, but Sussman is pretty understanding when it comes to time restraints.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. Early on I realized I didn't really have to do the reading, but eventually I began to regret that. Most of the stuff we read is fascinating and I am now committed to catching up on everything I didn't get to during the semester. Definitely take it if you're looking to open yourself up to new ideas and modes of thought.",
    "Wonderful course, provided you understand and desire the set-up. Thickly, unusually rich and evocative readings, navigated through with an especially not-to-be-missed professor. This is a course to take purely for kind and brilliant Sussman and the great readings -- it's a twice-weekly ride through his crazy, synapse-skipping articulations -- do not expect to be discussing, yourself. The self-generated, open-ended final project is also a lovely change of pace; a chance to do something of great personal value."
