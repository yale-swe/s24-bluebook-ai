    "I mean, you're not going to jump from L1 to L3 without some help, and this course is cool to get you there.I have a whole new appreciation of Plato and want to read a lot more of him now, which is weird because I didn't think of that at all when starting Greek. I would recommend, if you have a decent group and good professor.",
    "Good\/necessary continuation of Greek 110. Your enjoyment will probably depend on your comfort with the first semester material and your professor.",
    "This is a truly difficult course. However, the experience of translating the Apology as a second semester Greek student was very rewarding.",
    "Ancient Greek 120 is the completion of first year Greek. It covers the final parts of grammar in Hansen and Quinn and then goes headlong into translating Plato's Apology. It was a translation course for the rest of the semester, something that I found to be much better than just grammatical instruction. Chris was an excellent professor as well. I would definitely recommend Greek 120 to another student if they want to learn more Ancient Greek and actually see their work pay off by reading Plato."
