    "Mathematical skills to analytical derive equilibrium for trade models, read papers and solve problem sets",
    "Basic trade theory (Ricardo, Hecksher-Ohlin, Melitz, Eaton-Kortum), and a more GE style approach to trade \/\/ spatial economics.",
    "Theoretical framework of international trade and quantitative spatial anaylsis toolkits",
    "What I enjoyed was that the course gave me analytical tools and not only a list of topics. There were two main sets of tools that I learned: modern trade theory and spatial economics. Within each of them I learned, for instance, the theory and the math used in writing models, solving them and studying its implications and properties. For this purpose, the problem sets were very important: in order to gain analytical knowledge, it is important to get your hands dirty. I also got a sense of the questions being explored in the frontier of the trade literature."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Covers a lot of ground in trade literature, mathematically challenging Weaknesses: Often lost in math, more intuition and big picture explanation of what we are learning may be helpful",
    "This course NEEDS to be better organized. The first part is filled with the instructor's very latest while not obviously important research. Such content is much better suited for seminars rather than the core course of PhD-level international trade. The second part is the so-called spacial economics. The discussion of amenities in a city is interesting but not directly related to what we are supposed to learn in this class. Overall, this class definitely failed to serve as a proper foundation for those who want to conduct trade research in the future.",
    "The course is well organized. More feedbacks for the problem sets are welcome.",
    "A strength of the course was that it gave me analytical tools and not only a list of topics. I appreciated the fact that the lectures and materials familiarized me with methods and tools, allowing me to understand a wide variety of trade and spatial models - and even to write my own models for a particular context. For this purpose, the problem sets were very important: in order to gain analytical knowledge, it is important to get your hands dirty. I believe, however, that Solutions should have been provided for these homeworks - what didn't occur in the second part of the course, but is very useful for the learning process. I enjoyed the extra lectures presented by different professors: they diversified the course and made it richer. I also think that the problem sets and lectures of the Second Part of the course should have been better organized. One way that could help would be to put into context the equations: specially in the problem sets, I think it would be great to describe the economy (household's problem, technology, market structure, ... ) instead of just displaying equilibrium equations while asking questions that involve the whole structure of the economy. I understand that the equilibrium equations were derived at specific sections of the book, but even in these sections it is not always clear what is the general context. I believe that every equilibrium equation should be, at least at one section of the book or of the slides, derived from first principles. Moreover, at questions, the first principles (technology, preferences, market structure, ... ) to which the problem is referring to should always be explicitly mentioned."

    "Yes. A must take for anyone interested in trade and spatial economics.",
    "Absolutely not, if the course stays the same. It's a waste of everybody's time.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in advanced trade. At some point you need to learn the fundamentals of trade theory.",
    "Yes. This is a must for research in trade and space.",
    "Yes, definitely I would. Not only modern spatial\/trade theory is fascinating and features many applications, but this course also teaches analytical tools - which yielded a 'long-run technical improvement' for me: if, instead of analytical tools, we had learned only a list topics, the knowledge of the course would have been depreciating much faster."
