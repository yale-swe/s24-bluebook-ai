    "I developed knowledge of Russian history before 1801.",
    "I learned so incredibly much about Russia and even Finland, Sweden, and Poland. If you really liked Timothy Synder's classes, you will enjoy this class in conjunction with Eastern Europe to 1914."

    "I would be happy if the readings for this course were entirely primary sources. Paul Bushkovitch gives great review of secondary material in his lectures, and the class discussions would be much facilitated by primary source readings, such as some of the fascinating ones we did cover.",
    "This course did a good job of engaging with a wide range of material. Unfortunately this meant that some material was glossed over. However, the material we did focus on was interesting and the course made us engage with the material in instructive ways.",
    "The course could be improved by providing students with more specification as to the format of and content covered by examinations.",
    "I really liked that this was a comparatively small lecture class, making it more of a seminar. Class was divided into two halfs, there was lecture and then reading discussion. Also, Professor Bushkovitch's exams are notoriously straightforward. \"Either you know it or you don't.\""

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who plans to speak about, write about, or do anything apropos of Russia anytime in their life.",
    "Yes, but only if the student has a vigorous interest in Russian history.",
    "I would completely recommend this class to another student. It is easier than Timothy Snyder's classes, but just as interesting and more comprehensible. You will learn a lot and it was a small-ish class. Make sure you speak during class so you actually get something out of the discussions!"
