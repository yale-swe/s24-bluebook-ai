   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this to someone who wants to delve into Psychology past Intro Psych.",
    "I would recommend it because the workload is low and the material is interesting.",
    "Skipped many classes but didnt miss much because all the lectures are online.",
    "No. It is pretty boring and most topics are covered better in other psych classes.",
    "The content is pretty basic but can easily be confused by people because it is sometimes so obvious. A lot of it is probably something mentioned in intro psych but there are enough other interesting concepts discussed as well. From others that have taken it, it seems like you either get it or you don't. You would know by first exam either way. Exams were fair and straight forward. Definitely do the reading, at least before the exams and you will be fine. Papers weren't bad at all. Take it.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in psychology",
    "Yes.",
    "Social psychology is pretty straightforward. It's a simple way to get the List A core course requirement out of the way if you're a psychology major.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The material is interesting and seems straight forward, but the tests are just multiple choice tests asking if you read some sentence in the book that wasn't all that important or discussed in class. There are also two 5 page essays that were slightly more interesting, but the grading seemed arbitrary.",
    "I would take it but not with LaFrance.",
    "I would recommend this class. Workload is managable and the material is interesting.",
    "This is a general course in Social Psychology. The subject matter was very interesting, and I think the course is a very good one to take. The workload is light, and the class is overall a very low-stress course. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class. Manageable workload. Sometimes really boring and too much reading\/lecture overlap.",
    "okay class.",
    "Much of the material covered in the course is already covered in the introductory psychology course, and grading can be harsh at times. I would not recommend taking the course unless necessary."
