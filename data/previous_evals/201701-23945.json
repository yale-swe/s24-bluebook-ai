    "Workload varied - some weeks it seemed like there was very little, other weeks it seemed like there was way too much. Generally speaking it was more evenly distributed than the first semester though.",
    "The workload each week was an appropriate amount. Slightly more frustrating for the movies that were more difficult to watch, e.g. British Steel.",
    "I wish the expectation of length of depth of response was addressed at the semester split. I feel I was more concerned with the length of my responses than I should have been - finding out they were more lengthy than a lost of my peers only toward the end of the semester. I feel I could have saved more time if this had been addressed sooner."

    "Most of the material was easily accessible, especially by classesV2. The professor was always well-prepared for each lecture; he taught it with a clear level of expertise.",
    "Sometimes it was difficult to get access to course materials since not all TD&P students have the same online access to libraries and collections the theater managers do.",
    "The movies this semester were a nice break from the case study reading. It made it manageable.",
    "The organization of this course through the entire year was very clear, moving from one aspect of each function of leadership to the next and the next, and allowing us to integrate the knowledge we had picked up from prior lessons along the way."

    "Martensen teaches like someone who has been teaching this material for many, many years, but with the excitement of someone who is visiting the material for the first time. It's really amazing to watch him work. He makes the lectures exciting and informative at the same time.",
    "I am so glad I was able to take this course with Ed. Having him as a teacher was so valuable, and enhanced the material greatly.",
    "Ed is an incredibly thoughtful instructor. When approached with questions or concerns about his pedagogical methods or tools, he always explains his thinking, and is fairly good about listening to the concerns of his class."

    "I found the subject more challenging this semester. It seemed more important to have taken many other Theatre Management courses in order to understand some of the terminology and context used in this course. Not having taken these courses, I sometimes felt that I was struggling with far more basic concepts, instead of the subjects we were actually discussing.",
    "I constantly find myself using lessons I learned from this course in multiple aspects of my life. In terms of leadership, I suspect it will take experience to adopt these lessons into my career. It was a very worthwhile course to take.",
    "My learning in this course will fundamentally impact the way I behave as a leader. I will carry the lessons with me as I move through the field."

    "I would have thoroughly enjoyed if Martensen had incorporated more feedback from our homework into the lectures.",
    "Thank you for everything, Ed! It was yet another fantastic class and I am sad I can't take another course with you.",
    "I honestly think this would be a fair course to consider a requirement for the TD&P department. Lots of office politics and general interaction with employees and ability to inspire and shape goals...it's all part of this, and it's something our department will need just as much as the theater managers."
