    "No, the teacher give out tons of assignments, but you don't get a lot from that",
    "Complete and total ego death.",
    "This course requires a great deal of its students. This is definitely not an easy class: if you are serious about the work and are willing to put the effort into it, you will learn an enormous amount and your drawing will mature significantly.",
    "This class demanded more work from me than any class I've taken at Yale. If you take it seriously, you'll like it. It can be incredibly frustrating--Robert Reed is not just performing the first two class sessions. That's actually how he will be throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are very confident about who they are as people and as artists. Professor Reed is not everyone's cup of tea. His \"constructive\" criticism has a way of raising people's backs and even bringing some to tears. If you are prepared to endure emotional abuse, however, you will improve your technique and learn not only about art, but what you are capable of achieving.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. It changes the way you view not just art, but every aspect of your life. It is a challenging class but worth it.",
    "Take this class if you are serious about art and willing to be committed. It is not your typical \"art\" class. You will learn so much about not only drawing but also how to look at and think about the world around you, how to be really self-motivated and problem solve. People say that this class is work-intensive, but really it is just how much you're willing to put into it\/how much you want to get out of this class.",
    "Such mixed feelings. I learned so much, and yet I suspect we did not learn as much as previous Reed classes. Professor Reed was ill for part of the semester, and his health affected both his teaching and his mood. I think many of the lessons can be learned without the fear psychology that seemed to run much of the course. And yet...I am still drawing, and think about what we learned constantly, and will take Reed's work ethic with me. Aaron Fowler, the TA, was great.But we could have spent more time drawing--much of class time was spent talking about things we had already talked about..."
