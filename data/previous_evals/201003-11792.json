    "If you're taking this then it's because you're taking Atmospheres. So in that sense, good or not, you're stuck with this lab.The lab is okay--some labs were really cool like the field trip along the Quinnipiac River and the global warming debate, while others amounted to little more than frustrating and exhaustingly endless Excel plotting.It's really cool how Prof. Smith shows up in labs to teach stuff or just to answer questions. He could easily leave it all up to the TAs but instead he goes the extra mile and comes into lab to just talk to the students. By midterm he will know everyone's name, which is awesome.A lot depends on who your TA is and who the other kids in your lab are. While I think all of the TAs were awesome, mine was particularly killa and my lab section was awesome, so we all got pretty tight over the course of the semester, while other sections apparently didn't talk much or meet up outside of class. Don't make your section lame-o like these ones.",
    "Less work than other labs, only 2 hours a week. Each Lab report takes place over a 2 week period. The labs were interesting. Some included a lot of excel work and there's also a final debate on global warming.",
    "This class is a very easy workload to handle, the assignments straightforward and not time consuming - each lab takes two weeks to complete. The labs are fairly interesting, in-depth enough to be enjoyable, but not so complicated that they are impossible to understand. Take this class!",
    "This course is reasonably well put together; that said, I think it should be combined with the regular class and be considered a 1.5 credit class because with only one lab report every two weeks the number of evaluative mechanisms is too small to get a real assessment on your performance. So if make sure you don't make any silly mistakes on your labs because they will end up having a large effect on your grade. Some of the concepts in this lab are too elementary, but it will challenge you by the end. It may also sometimes be difficult to differentiate what you need to know for the lab versus the class because there are some hazy areas of overlap.",
    "This is the easiest lab you will take at Yale. You must take it if you are in the lecture course but this is the only lab i've seen that is actually worth half a credit. Only 2 hours long, usually do the questions in class, and a written final. You go on the roof and look at clouds... is there a question here?",
    "Meterology lab: launch balloons\/make graphs.",
    "TAKE THIS LAB COURSE. Whether or not it's required, it will expand the way that you look at things. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it for a fellow student. Not too difficult and a nice break from typical lecture and lab classes.",
    "You have to take this lab with the course, no choice. I found the lab to be boring and a lot of data analysis\/less hands-on field work. It's not difficult, though.",
    "Its required to take with EVST 201 anyway, and its got an incredibly low workload. Take it.",
    "The lab for this course is good, a little boring but it helps you understand the methods used in environmental science. The workload is higher than 1\/2 a credits worth (as are most labs I hear), but labs are due every other week so you have every other week with no work. Required alongside EVST201",
    "It's not too bad. You have to take it with the course anyway, so have fun.",
    "This lab was manageable and quite interesting at times. It wasn't graded to harshly (watch out for the lab final though), although the labs were often time consuming. If you don't know Excel, I recommend learning it because you'll need it for this lab. Overall though, this lab was a good addition to the general course.",
    "This lab has its ups and downs: highlights include going up to the roof of Kline Geology Lab and taking weather readings, and also taking a field trip travelling along the Quinnipiac and collecting water samples. The lab write-ups aren't bad at all, and you discuss most of the questions you have to respond to during the lab. Excel spreadsheets can get tedious, but if you have a good TA, it'll be fine.",
    "Possibly as much work as the class itself. Work in groups with others.",
    "A great complement to the class! Don't let the fact that the class has this lab keep you from taking it. It's not as intense as chem or bio labs, and you definitely learn as much. Plus, it's a lot of fun because you get to spend time outside and learning useful skills. After this lab you appreciate weather and climate so much more.",
    "This is not a typical lab. It's extremely fun though, and compared to other Yale labs, it's also less work I believe. You have a lab report due every two weeks, and it takes a good half day (6-8 hours) to do each lab report. You need to take the lab in order to take the course. Definitely worth it.",
    "The work can be very tiresome unfortunately.",
    "EVST 202L is required when taking atmospheres, and is a requirement for the environmental studies major. I would not recommend the lab but, because it is required for EVST majors, I would offer the following suggestions: First, get Microsoft Excel on your computer, not numbers, not some open office program, just get Microsoft Excel or you will have a lot of difficulty. Second, learn how to make a basic graph in Excel \u0096 its really not difficult and will save you hours of time when doing the labs. Third, accept the lab as easy and try to appreciate it \u0096 you get to go outside and look at clouds! I think that if you are looking for a practical, fun (at least the first few labs), and not very difficult lab, this is the course for you.",
    "It's the practical form of the lecture class. The experiments are sometimes interesting, but other times tiresome. It heavily uses powerpoint and other graphing materials, which is an important skill to have. The lab, however, is not the highlight of my day.",
    "One of the best labs I've taken. Interesting, practical, and explored a variety of topics. It's very hands-on, with labs like water sampling on the Quinnipiac River and launching a weather balloon. It is also an actual 1\/2 credit lab, with lab reports due only every two weeks.",
    "A decent lab, it's less work than most labs I've taken, though the focus is on learning how to take and interpret atmospheric measurements, which is not always the most exciting thing.",
    "I really enjoyed it! I had a very nice and helpful TA who made the lab quite fun. Sometimes it could be a bit technical and a tad boring, but overall I liked having to do some calculations, learning to use Excel well, and doing hands-on experiments\u0097e.g., launching weather balloons, taking soundings of the Quinnipiac river, holding a global warming debate (even though there was little substantive to actually debate\u0097global warming is happening, and humans are undoubtedly responsible for it!).",
    "In this lab we spent a lot of time answering lab questions so there wasn't much work outside of lab, which was nice. There was one field trip but most of the time was spent just talking. It would have been better if we had been able to do more rather than just answer questions.",
    "The labs are much easier than the regular coursework, and they cover different topics. I cannot really recommend or dissuade you from taking the lab, because it's required with the course. But again, it's not too much work. Just don't worry too much about Excel. Your TA will help you."
