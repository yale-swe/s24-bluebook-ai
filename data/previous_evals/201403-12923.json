    "Yes take it, it's a lot of fun!",
    "As a language, German is not far from English, so it's definitely easier than Asian languages. Elisa taught the course well. The only complaint I have with German is that they don't have scholarships for summer abroad like the Light Scholarship for East Asian Languages.",
    "If you don't know about anything about German, GMAN 110 is good place to start.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. This class was very engaging. You will feel yourself learn a lot without feeling lots of pressure. The final video project might take a lot of time but it is rewarding and fun. There's no final exam.",
    "It feels like a family typical level 1 language course. It is a bit easier as far as they go, and German is as interesting a language as any, so take it if you're interested in learning German.",
    "I loved this class. Elisa is fantastic teacher. The structure of the course really encourages students to take risks and to \"put themselves out there\" to learn the language. Take risks, don't be afraid to speak out, and don't take yourself too seriously. You'll have a great time (provided you do the homework).",
    "Take it super fun",
    "GMAN 110 is a great introduction to German. We covered a wide range of vocabulary (towns, rooms in the house, animals, food, human body, travel, areas of study, hobbies...) and grammar (present and past tenses, prepositions, three out of four cases - Nominativ, Akkusativ and Dativ...). If you are planning on taking a language, you really should consider German. The course is well structured and the language is exciting (and the course will present you an even more attractive culture attached to it!) GRADING We had weekly online assignments (which did not take a lot of time), biweekly quizzes, an email exchange program with German College students, and a final video project (we would write the script, film it and present it to the other students in the class). PS. If possible, take it with Prof. Ronzheimer. She is a great professor and is able to truly engage the students into an extraordinary learning environment. I do not regret choosing her section this semester, and I will certainly take GMAN 120 with her.",
    "Take it! German is a great language!"
