Perhaps examination of more emerging topics in environmental health could be used as an update or replacement.",

    "Discussion took up a lot of course time. I think there could be more lectures on more varied topics, possibly including water quality or implementation. The workload got very heavy towards the end of the semester. At one point there were two papers and a presentation due on the same dayit was a lot of work! More spacing of assignments would be helpful."
