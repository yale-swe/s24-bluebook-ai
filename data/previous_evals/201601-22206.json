    "I would recommend this to a student who has a very profound interest in the topic of frontiers and provinces along with a background in socio-political history and anthropological methodologies.",
    "A highly dynamic and entertaining interdisciplinary course, this class was what I hoped it would be. I would absolutely recommend it, if only for the dynamic between the two professors. The numerous perspectives brought together into one seminar class allowed a much broader understanding of the premodern world. The result was a highly rewarding intellectual experience.",

   "comments": [
    "The course forced me out of my comfort zone to work with both literary and visual sources for my final project. It taught me a lot about war and martial strategies, which I probably never would have learned otherwise! Also, being forced to think outside of my immediate field.. in terms of time period, culture, and nature of the evidence.. can always have a positive effect on future research!",
    "The course enabled me to compare the Roman frontier with those of other civilizations, most notably China. Thus I could more easily pick apart exactly those qualities which differentiated Rome from other empires. Similarly, the class emphasized those aspects of frontier that are common across civilizations, providing a clearer picture of the process by which culture changes and evolves. This perspective will inform the way I think about the classical world going forward."
