    "Probably not. It's a ridiculously easy class, since you essentially never have to show up to lectures because there's no final and you'll enjoy the writing assignments if you like to write at all. But it's mostly just mind-numbingly boring. The lectures I did show up at I completely disengaged from because the prof just drones on and changes PowerPoint slides every now and then. Lectures aren't really about synthesis and analysis, mostly just dull presentation of fact. You have a limited number of classes to take at Yale, most of which are really awesome - it'sjust not worth suffering through to get the SocialSci credit. Take something you'll actually want to show up to and enjoy.",
    "This a very interesting class and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Without hesitation, YES! This a wonderful course, especially if you've never taken another WGSS course before (and even if you never plan to). Most of the readings are interesting, and the lack of exams means you don't have to frantically take notes during lecture and section. Although this class has a reputation for being on the easy side, if you do all the reading on the syllabus, it's not quite a gut. Two highlights: cheese samples from the farm that Prof Trumpler used to own, and the owner of Claire's Corner Copia gives a guest lecture!",
    "It is a course of women's role in the production, preparation, and consumption of food, mainly in the twentieth century US but also with a few lectures of ancient history and international comparisons. The reading list is fabulous, and if you are interested in what Yale can do with WGSS but don't want to get bogged down in feminist theory or feel beat over the head because you do not consider yourself a feminist, this is the class for you.",
    "Super easy class, and relatively interesting. Definitely recommend taking it. Although it's not a complete gut -- you do have to try on the papers, and some TA's are pretty difficult graders. But in terms of workload, there's a very large disconnect between lecture, the reading you do, what you talk about in section, and the actual papers you write... meaning you can pretty much get an A in the class without having to do the reading, or attend lecture.",
    "Take it if you don't mind writing papers. Class is pretty interesting and its not a lot of work.",
    "Really interesting class. Readings were very interesting and not too long. You write 4 short papers.",
    "This is a great fifth class, very low work, and the papers are fun to write. Since you're not responsible for the lecture material, lecture quickly turned into catching-up-on-email-time. The books you read for section are interesting and easy.",
    "This class is relatively easy--four papers that are all on pretty broad topics (write about a food stuff or a women and her relationship to food). Lectures are interesting, but you are never tested on them in any way. There are books assigned each week for section, but they are easy reads.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a fourth or fifth class to round out your schedule.",
    "Pretty chill class, and learn a lot of cool stuff about food that I never would have known!",
    "Relaxed and easy class. Take it for a grade.",
    "This is an overview course that touches on many issues dealing with women and culture, featuring lectures on cookbooks, gender roles, food and art, several guest speakers, and many other topics. It's interesting to see the scope of the class and how many issues were touched upon, but what frustrated me by the end was that the issues were just \"touched,\" we never got to go in depth into anything. Note: some people liked this aspect of the class. I did feel like I was never really challenged, and the students were generally somewhat apathetic, but it was an okay class.",
    "can be applied to a lot of modern day issues",
    "I would recommend this class: It was very interesting and the work-load was not too high.",
    "I would recommend this class as an easy fifth class not only for people who want an easy class but also those genuinely interested in the production, consumption and preparation of food and its role in female lives. Some of the readings are really interesting and the assignments are four five page papers that are fun to write.",
    "I would recommend this class to ANYBODY. It's actually really interesting, Prof. Trumpler makes her talk very clear. The only assignments in the entire term are 4 5-page papers on pretty interesting topics and a few reading assignments for section. I loved this course- I highly recommend it.",
    "Women, Food, and Culture is a lecture class, with two 50-minute lectures a week, one 50-minute section, and four papers spread throughout the year. There is a weekly book (or chapters from books, articles, etc) and the reading generally corresponds to the lecture material, but not exactly, and is discussed in section. The reading is all very interesting and because you\u0092re never tested on it, you can take of it what you will. There are no tests and no final. The grade is made up evenly of the grades from the four papers and the section grade. The four papers are each five pages, the first a paper on the history of any food, the second an analysis of a cookbook written before 1960, the third ananalysis of photos of kitchens and farms from the 19th C., and the last a portrait of any woman, focusing on her relationship to her food. It is low stress and highly interesting, since you can enjoy lectures rather than take furious notes and talk in section about daily relevant ideas and news.",
    "Take it! It's a nice break from typical Yale work overload.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in the topic. The material was thought-provoking and it was presented well. Most of the material fromlecture had no bearing on papers, which were the only things that were graded, so that was a little weird, but I didn't mind (and I attended lecture, though it would be very possible to do well in the class without attending). The writing assignments were a little contrived and simplistic, but they were easy to do well on.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any student interested in getting a different perspective of the role of food, gender, and history as it relates to women and their role in the kitchen. You come out of the class with a different understanding of women and food.",
    "It is a very interesting class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you want a gut worth taking, THIS IS IT.",
    "Yeah, this class is not difficult or time consuming, and you learn about topics and issues in a way that you might not in any other class.",
    "yeah, why not? i really enjoyed writing all the papers and it was fun how prof trumpler had us look at the issues of women and food from all angles. some of the books really sucked, though.",
    "wofocu was a great course. Interesting topics and easy readings for the most part.",
    "GREAT class, definitely take it.",
    "It's a good 5th class if you have a tough schedule. I had low expectations for this class, so I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't impressed either. I don't think I learned too much, but the reading was interesting, and the papers were sort of fun to write.",
    "Yes, take this class for something different than your typical course load. It's just something fun to take.",
    "mostly talk on food\/ingredient history and less of a gendered look on things than expected.",
    "You should take this class if you like learning about food and the experience of women. The lectures are fun and relaxed, the paper assignments aren't difficult and are pretty interesting, and the reading material is ok.",
    "A pretty easy class with interesting lectures and books. Would recommend it for sure.",
    "I thought the course material was very interesting - I really enjoyed the interdisciplinary approach to Women, Food and Culture. I also liked how we had a lot of flexibility in writing our essays - it really allowed me to think about food and culture from various perspectives.",
    "I would recommend it to all students - especially those looking for a good fifth class that may have never taken a WGSS course.",
    "It was a great, fun, interesting class. I would definitely recommend it to others. It is not that much work, and a great class to have in the midst of all your other demanding classes.",
    "Interesting survey course that I wish it could have been structured differently. I wish there were more modern perspective of women, food, and culture throughout the course and just use the anthropological evidence to back up some concepts, instead of dividing the first half for anthropology and the second half as modern aspect. Especially when winter approaches and we cannot visit Yale Farm, while we talk about it in class. However, the class is very interesting and the topics are something everyone can relate to. Topics are also diverse in culture.",
    "WGSS 120 is a great class. It covers some really important and thought-provoking issues, especially in the second half of the semester, and the papers are really unusual and cool, so they were actually fun to do, and it really helps that there are no tests or final, as it meant that lecture was just interesting to listen to, without any pressure. It's important that you get a good TA for this class, and I had Catherine Telford-Keogh, who's kind of insane (in a great way) and made section really fun. Definitely a good option for a fifth class, which is what it was for me.",
    "Yes",
    "Take it only if you're interested in the material, otherwise you won't go to lecture. The four papers may seem daunting but they're really easy to write since it's mostly your opinion. no tests. a great fifth class.",
    "This was a great class! An interesting lecture twice a week, good readings, and great discussion topics covering a wide intersection of interests. While not exactly rigorous, it was nevertheless illuminating. I really enjoyed writing the papers, which were short and engaging.",
    "It is a great course. Not too much pressure. Wonderful writing assignments and the material is fascinating and very relatable to our everyday lives.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in food you will enjoy the readings, get engaged in the papers and have fun in the class. If you are not interested in food and just want a gut, you will not do the readings, slide by on the papers, and pass through the class fairly painlessly. It's a good class from both perspectives.",
    "easy class, not much work. take it",
    "This class allows you to write some interesting, not-too-difficult papers, and the lack of exams gives it a very different feel from other courses. I would recommend this to anyone with a strong writing background and an interest in WGSS and\/or food. However, there is very little motivation to go to lectures.",
    "Women Food and Culture, the name represents pretty much what the course is about. I would recommend this course. Highly interesting reading materials and stimulating essay assignments.",
    "its a very fun class and you dont have to take tests! its all papers which is really great. just do the readings and go to discussion, you'll be fine. the lectures and discussion sometimes do not really overlap that much but since there are no tests that isn't a problem.maria is a very good lecturer! very passionate about what she does, and it shows in her presentations. just pay attention to the important parts.my TA caitlin was really fun and wanted to make discussion interesting. she would ask us to turn in weekly reading responses to that she could plan discussion in a way that would engage us. she's nice and also hilarious! sometimes we get to hear funny stories of her life :)",
    "This class is interesting, particularly the readings. If you take this class, do the readings, because you will get a lot out of them. The class is not incredibly difficult because it isn't necessary to go to lecture because there is no final, but the TFs do grade the papers roughly, so this is a good fifth class, but don't slack off if you take it.",
    "LOVED LOVED LOVED this class. The lectures were the best part -- they are inspiring and insightful and deeply connected to things we do in everyday life -- eat, drink, and spend. Learning about food really made me wish there was a cooking assignment so we could eat in class too.",
    "I would recommend it. Classes are not mandatory and the papers are very easy to write.",
    "I would take it as a fun course to learn about things that you never thought you would.",
    "This was a good class overall. It was very interesting in class, and it was nice just to sit back and absorb the interesting material without having to worry about remembering every little detail (because there was no midterm or final). The four papers were on interesting topics and weren't too time-consuming to write.",
    "I would summarize it as a fair course with a fair workload and interesting subject matter. i would recommend this class especially if you are not intending to use it for your major and need a distributional requirement.",
    "This was a very interesting class and subject matter. The title definitely does the class justice. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who is really interested in learning about food and women.",
    "Awesome. Take it. Yes.",
    "The lectures, section, and papers are not at all related, so you basically never have to go to lecture if you don't want to. You don't really have to do the reading either, I got by in section just by looking over book reviews online for 10 minutes. This class is pretty much just 4 5-page papers if you want to treat it that way."
