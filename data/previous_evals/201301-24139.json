    "What a fantastic course! Not only was this class fascinating week after week, the insights of the students along with Professor Chauncey and Professor Gregg made this a favorite class this semester. You won't regret taking this class, if anything you'll regret missing out.",
    "Lots of reading for a class with a 2.5 hour film screening, but most readings end up being pretty interesting. Take if you can handle a lot of WGSS-minded, SUPER politically correct people having discussions about hot topics in gay film. Tread with caution if you don't have a really personal connection to the issues, because most people do.",
    "Definitely take it if you get the chance! An excellent seminar--my favorite of my Yale career so far. Readings and viewings are very interesting, and the quality of discussion in the class is good; lots of people have creative, intelligent things to say. It is a little more work than average, but it's highly, highly worth it, and the final paper (on any topic you like) was the one paper throughout my entire time at Yale that I felt most invested in. The class is competitive to get into, but don't worry if you're not a WGSS or Film Studies major; I'm not either, and I still got in, so just have a compelling reason for why you want to take the course.",
    "Yeah of course! These are some amazing films that anyone should watch and spend time analyzing closely. There are even some really rare prints you probably won't otherwise ever get to see. Gregg and Chauncey are a lovely pair. A lot of freedom on the final paper.",
    "This is an excellent, challenging seminar that charts the history of LGBTQ representation and cultural visibility by anchoring that history in the study of films. Readings cover a broad range of material and perspectives, shedding light on each week's topic or period through the lenses of history, film studies, gender studies, and primary sources. As a film studies major who entered the course with very little experience in WGSS or LGBTQ studies, and little knowledge of gay history, I found that the class did a good job of making the material accessible to students coming from very different backgrounds, and although I occasionally felt out of my league when the conversation turned to sophisticated topics in gender studies, I never felt truly lost or overwhelmed. Professors Gregg and Chauncey are both wonderful, and taking a class with both of them together is an opportunity you shouldn't pass up.",
    "Take it if you can and you like old movies and gay people.",
    "This is an awesome class. There's not really anything about affect, so this is kind of a history of cinema course, and is really fantastic. There are mandatory weekly screenings, a bit too much reading (that, frustratingly, it wasn't always worth doing), weekly discussion questions, a short midterm paper, and a long final paper. This is a challenging but great class. Gregg\/Chauncey are EXACTLY the dream team you'd hope they'd be. Class discusion is not particularly well-moderated so only a few people generally speak (though you may think that's a good thing). A cool course overall, and one I'd recommend."
