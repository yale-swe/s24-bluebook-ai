    "Terrific Course! take it if you like Spanish!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if like spanish and are interested in health or medicine. It is not extremely in depth, so you get more of a broad overview of many important topics, but it never ceases to be interesting and fun. The weekly assignments take little time out of your night, and the project is a fun experience and chance to improve you speaking skills.",
    "This is a good class for keeping up with your Spanish skills. Not so intense you're overwhelmed and not so chill that it's a complete gut, it strikes a good balance overall. Really recommend. And Carreras is really great, too.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "Profesor Carreras is a truly incredible professor. She cares SO much about her students and is willing to put in the extra effort to help them learn. She made learning medical Spanish extremely accessible and easy to do. Even though the class met at 9AM each day, I was eager to go because Professor Carreras made the class so enjoyable and informative! Take this class if you can get in. You'll learn a lot and you'll have a lot of fun doing it. Also, the grading is pretty generous.",
    "Great class. You learn about the human anatomy and various common illnesses like diabetes, and the course packet helps you long after the class.",
    "Great class, definitely take it. you'll learn tons of new medical related vocabulary and will just have a ton of fun each class. best Spanish class at Yale",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Great class to take especially if you want to keep up with your Spanish in a fun and exciting way!",
    "Introduces you to medical terminology. Warning: There are 2 written assignments each week, and grading does get more severe for mistakes as the semester progresses.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "Medical Spanish is a great way to learn both medicine and Spanish in a relaxed setting. Profesora Carreras finds a way to make class discussions very low pressure and fun.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class because you will pick up new vocabulary and have a fun time.",
    "Medical Spanish was a great course, especially, but not exclusively, for those interested in pursuing a medical profession. I feel the progress I made in L2-L4 in terms of language proficiency was continued, particularly orally, and also that I was exposed to a lot of interesting content. Assignments were structured in a clear way and Profesora Carreras was always available to help and support when needed.",
    "This course is pretty good. It will teach you a decent amount of medical Spanish vocab if you actually do the readings. However, if you are looking for an intensive way to improve your Spanish, this is not the class your are looking for. Mercedes is great and very sweet, but she will not push your level of Spanish further than it already is.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in medicine. You'll have a relatively easy time getting practice with the new terminology.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Overall great course. Minimal work, very fun. It's at 9am, but it's worth it.",
    "Spanish for Medical Professions is a perfect class for someone who wants a relaxed but interesting introduction to medical spanish, or needs to fulfill a language requirement. It was an extremely reasonable workload- a page-long paragraph reading response for each class, based off of an average of about 5 pages of reading, a oral group presentation on a topic Prof Carerras assigns, and then a final 5-10 page research paper on a topic of your choice. The subject matter is definitely interesting, and the professor is very enthusiastic, so it's interesting whether or not you're actually planning on entering a medical profession (and definitely not necessary to be premed or have any medical experience to be in the class). Although the class had only around 20 students, it was structured not really as a discussion- all the desks faced forward, not in a circle, and professor would ask us questions directly instead of students talking to each other- so, while I felt that my writing improved, my speaking and listening comprehension definitely did not improve substantially. If you're hoping to truly improve your spanish skills or learn a ton, I wouldn't recommend this class, but if you're looking for a relaxed 5th class or to fulfill a language requirement in a non-stressful way, this is an excellent choice."
