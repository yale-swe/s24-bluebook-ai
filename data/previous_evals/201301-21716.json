   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class if you are very interested in learning physics. Shankar is great!",
    "This is a great course! It's the perfect refresher on electricity and magnetism, and goes deeper into the subject than the intro courses. The bit of statistical mechanics we learned will probably he helpful for 420 as well.",
    "402 is very similar to 401 in format, although I think covers much more material. I think Professor Shankar is better at teaching mechanics (401), though. I wouldn't take this class unless you are required too. The class covers too many topics and seems rushed.",
    "Speaking as a non-physics major taking this class, and having not seen any E&M for 3-4 years (since my senior year in high school), I found the pace of the class a little overwhelming since we covered almost all of the Griffiths E&M textbook in about 2\/3 of a semester (the first third was stat mech), covering electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics, and quite a bit of relativistic electrodynamics in quite a bit of depth (at least in my opinion). To me, at least, this course was much harder and less enjoyable than 401. However, the midterm and the final were pretty fair, and you do end up learning a lot in a manner that is much better than how it is taught in the 200-level physics classes. I would recommend this class over any 200-level physics class.",
    "Fundamental material backpacking off PHYS 201. Textbook is very clear for all the material it covers (everything apart from the Thermo at the start of the course).",
    "If you need to take this course, you know it. It's a pretty interesting class, and we covered a lot of ground in one semester. Definitely worth taking. The only reservation I have is that we didn't have a textbook for the very first and very last things that we did (statistical mechanics and relativistic electrodynamics), though Shankar did put up a long pdf of the notes for statmech.",
    "It's tough, but Shankar will get you through it-- he's incredible, and you should definitely take this if you're interested in more advanced physics, majoring or not.",
    "If you've already done 401, you should probably go ahead and do 402 unless you've definitely decided against majoring in physics. The two courses are separate but Shankardoes assume you remember a fair amount from 401. I almost waited another year to do it and I'm glad I did it now.",
    "I spent a whole year with my favorite physics professor, my favorite group of physics pals, and my favorite TAs. So glad I took this course. Take it!",
    "Yes, this is a great course. I recommend it over the 410 sequence just for Shankar's lecturing ability.",
    "Good course but also pretty hard.",
    "If you're gonna do it, do it with Shankar, no doubt.",
    "Yes. I had originally planned not to take it since I was not going to be a physics major, but I switched last minute and am really happy that I did have to take it after all. I wasn't thrilled with 401 since, though it was quite challenging, it covered topics that, with the exception of relativity, were pretty boring and tedious in my opinion especially since most of it was polishing things we had learned in intro courses. 402 concepts were (Stat Mech and E&M) had much stronger connections to the underlying math theory, and therefore have an elegance that 401 concepts lacked. If this kind of thing turns you on and 401 was just okay for you, then consider 402. The workload was exactly the same in my opinion. Stat Mech though difficult was a really fun probability exercise and Shankar does a really good job talking about E&M in a non-conventional way.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester - Shankar brings concepts together really well, and Griffiths is a great textbook. Stat Mech at the beginning is a struggle but once that begins to make sense and you get past that, the rest is alright. Much more math than in 401, but the same amount of work overall.",
    "It's absolutely worth taking physics with Professor Shankar. Highly recommended. However, don't be afraid to reach out for extra help; it's not a terribly graded course, but it's easy to fall behind without realizing it's happening."
