    "Yes great class, lot of work though.",
    "Take this course, no questions asked. It is so worth it -- you will leave with a lot of work that you are proud if you have put a lot of time and energy into it. Be prepared to spend quite a bit of time in the darkroom. The people who spent the most time there usually had the best work. In your class, there will be a smaller core of people who take their work very seriously; this is good, because it will push you to do your work better. Take this course -- it is a little expensive, especially upfront in the beginning, but it is ultimately worth it for the skills you learn, the work you produce, the friends you make through this class and the professor, who is absolutely amazing.",
    "Yes! If you're passionate about this and have the time and $, do it. It was well, well worth it, a great experience. I have no regret spending the money or time though I was strapped at times for both.",
    "Take it Cr\/D\/F if you don't want to deal with 35 rolls of film. That's A LOT, understand this.Take it for a grade if you really want to practice so much that you get great photos by the end.",
    "absolutely! extremely enjoyable, which is not to say there isn't a ton of work (especially if you care about the class). very eye opening.",
    "Take this class! it's a great photo class, even if you've had some photo before. The darkroom is so much fun and more interesting than digital. It takes a lot of time but it's so much fun that you'll want to do work for this class",
    "It is a lot of work but if you have everrrr been interested in photography, this is def the class for you.",
    "Yes! Take it with Lisa \u0097 she really helps you get the techniques down and figure out what to photograph. But it really is a lot of darkroom time.",
    "Informative, fun class. Very practical, but expect to put in a lot of work, especially when meeting the shooting requirements.",
    "A great introduction to basic techniques. i would recommend this class to anyone interested in darkroom technology."
