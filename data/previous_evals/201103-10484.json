    "Yes",
    "I think my summary would be represented pretty well in the above answers. I would recommend the seminar to anyone interested in the French 19th century; I believe it would be engaging and productive for both those whose main interests lie elsewhere and for people who've already worked a good while on these themes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "An excellent overview of literature from the time period.",
    "As I said before, the scope of the course is not diminished by its time period. However, where other courses might let the discussion wander from the beginning of the century to the end, this one did indeed stay in the last third of the 19th to (maybe) the 1910s. For a student interested in the 19th century, this didn't pose a problem, but it might be a problem for students looking to get a good feel of 19th century French literature overall.That being said, the teaching method of the professor is not something to be missed. I would recommed this course to anyone who is considering teaching or who enjoys literature.",
    "This course is excellent for students interested in reading and discussing French texts from the Naturalism and Decadence movements, such as those by Zola, Maupassant, and Huysmans."

   "comments": [
    "A period many of whose texts were already very familiar to me became, in this seminar, much more complexly legible as a single stretch of space and time; in this sense, it's been helpful in placing old& new texts into a productive discourse.",
    "This course is as much about getting to know the field as it is about fin de siecle litarature. Very interesting for my research, since it was, essentially, an interdisciplinary course, that eventually inspired me to look for solutions to literary problems outside of the discipline of literature.",
    "This course exposed me to some of the most important literary and artistic movements in French literature while helping me to develop a more culturally and historically sensitive approach to my academic writing."
