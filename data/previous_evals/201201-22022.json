    "Take it!",
    "Very fun introductory course for those interested in painting.",
    "you paint once a week in studio the other day you critique. you also get to go to museums around campus. it is good for all levels. I had never painted in my life before. it is amazing how much you'll improve",
    "I would recommend this art course for any student in any major that has a genuine interest in developing their painting skills. This course was a great introduction to painting mostly because the TA and Professor were so accomodating to each students different skill set and skill level. We moved a pretty quick pace and as with most art classes you get out of the class what you put into it.",
    "A nice, relaxing two hours to paint: great for a fifth class. It was more work than I imagined, with around 1-2 paintings for homework per week, which took up a lot of time. If you get behind, Anna is extremely accommodating; all the work have to be present in your final portfolio for grading. I wished there was more critique so that I could improve even more in my painting skill than before. The final project was fun to work on, and I thoroughly enjoyed paintings in a serene classroom environment- what a different part of Yale to enjoy.....",
    "Highly recommend. If you can get in, take it.",
    "It's a pretty good class. It's less work than basic drawing, but it was also a bit less enjoyable. Painting can be very frustrating.",
    "DEFINITELY take this, with Anna Betbeze if you can. There is a bit of work, but at the same time it's enjoyable and you can see your art improving as there year goes on.",
    "yes, it is so much fun and everyone gets better at painting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great intro painting class that will both push you to explore while simultaneously teaching you valuable basic skills.",
    "Take this. About two hours of work outside class per week, a wonderful break from other types of class, and you actually learn a great deal about color\/painting\/etc."
