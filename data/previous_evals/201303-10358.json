    "This class will divide its time evenly covering the intellectual history of the Islamic tradition, covering the theological and philosophical doctrine of that defined this tradition. It covers from the pre-history of Islam up until the present day, focusing on major writers and theorists from this tradition. I took this class more or less on a whim of academic curiosity and i would recommend this for anyone interested in the study of Islam, Philosophy, or the intellectual history of an unfamiliar culture.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to know more about theology, religious questions, and the development of Islamic theology and thought.",
    "Recommend it but by no means is it an easy class.",
    "If you are looking for an overview of the development of Islamic thought, take this course. Thoroughly look at the syllabus. It will give you more insight into Islam today, but that is not at all the focus of the course. You don't look at it its manifestations in society, or even contemporary Islam until the last week. That said, you will be introduced to many major figures in Islamic thought and concepts that would probably help you understand Islam if you were to learn about it in another course, or elsewhere. If you're interested in learning about the theology, take it. It really is a course on Islamic philosophy and theology, as the title says.It can be a lot of work, but you don't have to do all of the reading. If you can do it, it is pretty rewarding. The way the class is structured, 70% of your grade is determined between the final paper (which is very flexible) and the final. The midterm was harder than the final, but only worth 15%.Griffel's lectures were great, and the TAs were an incredible asset. They were both so immersed in Islam as scholars and Muslims that they provided a fascinating vantage point. Sections were almost as good as the class itself, and in some ways, better.",
    "This was an excellent course. Obviously Islamic theology and philosophy is really cool material in and of itself. Professor Griffel made it even better. Really a great lecturer.",
    "Summary: difficult, fast-paced, fascinating, hard to get the big picture, no idea what grade I got, will have a big impact on my lifeThis was easily my hardest class, and I'm a senior Philosophy major who almost double-majored in Religious Studies. It is very much an overview, and it's structured chronologically in terms of thinkers rather than philosophical\/theological debates. I found it frustrating that we didn't do philosophy proper, as in looking at arguments to reconstruct, critique, or construct something different; it was much more a history of philosophy and theology class. As long as you can explain the interaction of some thinkers and what's at stake in a systematic theology, you're golden (and, in fact, it's probably more than you need to know). You'll often get more biography of a thinker in lecture than is really necessary, but knowing history of the Muslim world is really cool.You have about 100 pages of usually quite dense reading to do each week, though you don't have to do all of it to get by... Griffel should cut it down if he wants people to actually do it all, but I doubt he will. (My TF said Germans are super on-top-of-it and thus expect others to be as well...) Section is helpful. I felt pretty directionless writing my final paper, even though I went to office hours twice, and it was still rewarding to write, but I wish I had a much clearer idea of what was expected of me.I found it somewhat hard to zoom out to get the big picture of how the thinkers interacted. This class also isn't about what Muslims today believe or practice, which makes sense, but I also was hoping to more of an idea of that from the class. On the bright side, probably a little over a third of the class was Muslim, so there are plenty of people with whom to discuss the religion. Of my courses this semester, the material I learned in this one will definitely stick with me the longest and will have a significant impact on my ability to understand people of beliefs different from mine and engage in spiritual conversations with people from Muslim backgrounds, for which I am grateful.",
    "The class mostly consisted of lectures, weekly reading, a midterm, a final and a final paper.I definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about different Muslim theological schools of thought. It was super interesting and Prof. Griffel is a great lecturer!",
    "YES absolutely!"
