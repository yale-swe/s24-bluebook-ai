    "I gained a greater biochemical understanding of many cellular processes, such as transcription and translation. Each lecture was jam-packed with information ranging from landmark experiments to fun anecdotes.",
    "Given the large amount of information we were taught, I had to learn to focus on the most important parts as learning everything seemed like an impossible task.",
    "I feel really, really, good about the mastery of nucleotide biochemistry that this course provides. If you're an MB&B kind of person, you'll love it! Much more interesting then Biochem I, IMO.",
    "I developed a very deep and extensive knowledge about the intricacies of biochemistry. From memorizing key details of reaction pathways to learning more about how to think like a scientist, this class has truly solidified my interest to pursue the MB&B major.",
    "Good knowledge of how to think like a biochemist.",
    "Deeper understanding of the roles of nucleic acids in living organisms; ability to interpret experimental data and come to conclusions",
    "Learned about experimental techniques in biochemsitry and learned about the biochemistry of nucleic acids.",
    "I learned how to memorize a very large volume of information.",
    "I learned so much not only about DNA replication, transcription and translation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, but also how to think scientifically and analyze data! Super helpful skills to gain for someone who wants to go into science!",
    "Structure and functions of nucleic acids, mainly focusing on prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription and translation systems. This class is built upon the fundamental experiments of molecular biology, and focus on how did the scientists figure out the genetic code, the function of different parts of the ribosome etc. We also talked about DNA repair, as well as a slight glimpse of development and immunology.",
    "This course definitely gave me a greater appreciation for a wide range of topics in biochemistry. The focus on experiments was also very helpful in considering my own research methods. I personally found the material in this class to be very interesting, and I think I got a lot out of it because of that.",
    "I learned more about reading biochemistry data and applying knowledge in an experimental setting than in previous classes.",
    "I learned a vast amount of factual knowledge about molecular biology, and I to some degree developed skills in interpreting experiments and thinking about ways to approach biological problems.",
    "Knowledge of DNA and RNA molecular biology and biochemistry. History of the field (landmark experiments) and some experimental techniques",
    "Experimental design and understanding",
    "Molecular mechanisms behind DNA replication, transcription and translation as well as associated laboratory techniques",
    "I learned a great amount about biochemistry in this course, much more than the first term, and appreciate the skills gained in order to pursue further career goals related to this course.",
    "Understanding of biochemical experimental techniques Knowledge of biochemical details of nucleic acids and fundamental biological processes A better grasp on data analysis and interpretation",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Felt like we were being talked at instead of taught -- professors told us info that could have been condensed into readings but never really taught how to solve the problems (group problems, homework problems, exam problems). For someone who's never worked in a biology lab, a lot of the lab techniques that seem \"obvious\" to be applied to solve a problem were complete surprises.",
    "Strengths: -Interesting material -Exam questions were interesting (although some were a little evil) Weaknesses: -Some of the lectures ran over -Study guides made it seem like the exams had a lot of memorization involved, but exams were usually more methods-focused",
    "The professors instructing this course are phenomenal and comprehensively knowledgable in their fields. There was an incredible amount of information required to be learned that the main purpose behind each lecture was often obscure.",
    "I didn't always feel like the exams were the best reflection of my grip on the material; I would feel super solid, and then not do particularly well on the exams. I got better at studying for them as the semester went on, but they always felt kind of obscure. Sometime, in the paragraph explaining an exam question, I couldn't tell whether the information being given was new, or a recap of something that was supposed to sound familiar from class.",
    "One of the course's definite strengths is the interaction between students and faculty\/TA's. Class lectures were very interactive, as professors would often call upon students for answers to difficult questions. Also, TA's were very available and helpful during section discussion. One weakness may be the large amount of information covered, but this might be necessary to facilitate proper learning of the subject.",
    "Strengths: Professors are seriously impressive. Weaknesses: Way too much material per lecture. It's a bit disrespectful to other instructors to end every class 5-10 minutes late and expect students to learn the remaining material in the lecture.",
    "The course actively encouraged interpretation of scientific data, which is a valuable skill for those that do research However, the material was presented very quickly and with differing levels of clarity based on the professor giving the lecture that day",
    "This course is absolutely unreasonable in its emphasis on term memorization and small, ultimately unimportant details. Unlike Biochem I, where I felt like I learned a lot and will retain the overarching concepts, I didn't feel like I got much useful information out of this class. I was very disappointed. The exams are also overly difficult.",
    "Really interesting lectures and fascinating material! Enjoyed the psets. Reviewing the psets and quizzes was very helpful in preparation for exams. Having review questions distributed during section was very helpful.",
    "I won't sugarcoat it, this course was the absolute worst I've taken at Yale. To start, every lecture had a ridiculous amount of information in it, so much so that the professors often didn't finish on time. Most of this information was purely memorization based on not useful at all from a \"how will this help me be a scientist in the future?\" perspective. This significantly detracted from my ability to learn the actual biochemical concepts behind what was happening. Why, for example, are we required to memorize the names of every transcription\/translation factor (IF1, IF2, IF3, TF-tu, insert 100 more names and three letter acronyms)? Wouldn't it have been much more productive to not test the names of enzymes and instead test the students conceptual grasp of why they're important? Everyone was lost within the first 15 minutes of class, and once that happens it's extremely hard to engage and understand what's going on with the material. Additionally, the presentation of this massive amount of information seemed very ineffectively organized. There's a VERY noticeable tendency to jump right into explaining an experiment or a process without giving any inkling as to where it's going. It leaves students trying to follow the steps of an unfamiliar process with no idea what the endpoint is supposed to be, which makes the steps meaningless. The only way to understand what's happening is to wait until the result of the experiment is explained at the very end, and then go back on your own time so you can actually figure out why it was set up the way it was. This is an inefficient use of time. Finally, every test (midterms and finals) just felt like a total crapshoot (pardon my french). The first midterm is a great example. The entire first page was X-ray diffraction. This entire section of the test was based off the CAPTION of one figure on one slide\/page of the textbook. On the other end of the spectrum, you could spend hours memorizing the names and functions of every factor involved in translation, which the slides specifically tell you you must do, and then get one true or false question on the final about one of those factors. This doesn't facilitate learning or fairly test students understanding of the material. This class was the worst I've ever taken, and it's a shame because this is supposed to be the flagship MB&B class. I honestly wouldn't recommend the class or even the MB&B major to anyone based on my experience this semester.",
    "This class is perfect.",
    "I think it is a very good class, and the professors were very clear in their lectures. I'd have liked it if there are more practice questions and tests before the exams to help us practice. The daily quizzes that are graded on completion forces you to go to class (but there is no reason not to anyway). I think the class is very well structured in terms of what was covered. I'd have liked it if the slides were printed in color, because there are a lot of structural biology pictures and they can't really be seen in black and white.",
    "This course is very interesting and very well taught; I think that all of the professors did an excellent job. The layout of the lectures flows very logically from one class to the next, and the exams always felt very fair and representative of the lectures. There was an incredibly large amount of material in this course, but I dont think that that is a particularly bad thing.",
    "Strengths: Application and experiment based problems, lots of office hours with professors and TAs Weaknesses: Inordinate and unnecessary volume amount of material",
    "MB&B 301 was generally a very well-taught and interesting class. Even though it was enormously difficult, I appreciated the passion and experience that the professors brought to the class and the high expectations that they had of their students. I sometimes felt that the class focused slightly too much on learning a vast array of facts rather than facilitating a deep chemical understanding of biology - I wonder if focusing on slightly fewer proteins with more depth of understanding might help students take away more of a biochemical understanding rather than simply long lists of facts. I also felt that the professors put too much text on their slides, to the point that they could stand totally on their own and act as a sort of textbook, and I did not feel that this facilitated learning in the classroom.",
    "The course covered a lot of very interesting material, which I really enjoyed. The problem sets were good practice for the exams and were a manageable amount of work. It was really cool to learn about topics from the person who discovered them- for example, Joan Steitz's lecture on snRNPs. However I think the course could be improved by covering slightly less material in the later lectures and having greater detail- for example, the cancer lecture would have been more interesting if we had covered 2 or 3 proto oncogene\/tumor suppressors and discussed them in detail. The testing format of the class was also frustrating, as it felt like studying the lectures didn't help much with the exams, but was it was still necessary to do so in great detail in order to have the backround knowledge and vocabulary to answer the exam questions. Overall however, this was a great class and I learned a lot.",
    "The slides are so densely packed with info, should be spread out more (like Sung's slides) Also what needs to be memorized should be better highlighted from the other cool complex details, because of the sheer volume of info in the course Better practice material, more practice problems with answers. Office hours spread at different times of day\/week, my class schedule conflicted with nearly all of the times, and they were often same day\/time with different people",
    "Far too much content, but it was interesting.",
    "There is a lot of information, and it was very stressful studying\/knowing what to study. There wasn't a lot of advice on how to study and sometimes the tests did not seem to reflect what was learned, since it felt like there were some questions that could not be studied for.",
    "I see no weaknesses of this course, as material was presented very clearly and effectively by all lecturers.",
    "Strength(s): breadth and depth of material covered - it's so much to learn but if you engage with the material you learn so much some parts of the teaching were executed well to facilitate student learning Weaknesses: Assuming that all students in the class can make the logic jumps\/knowledge jumps that are required of us is rather difficult. Most students come into this course after having taken only organic chemistry (which isn't that helpful to understand the material of this course) and intro biology sequence. All of the experimental interpretation material in this course forced students to learn it on their own\/to have had previous lab experience to fill in this knowledge. I think one way the course should seriously consider improving is to slow down the introduction of new material (which will obviously cut down on the quantity of how much a student might learn) in order to better facilitate student learning. The fast-paced nature of the course honestly felt overwhelming to me throughout the semester.",
    "How to improve the course: Delete half of the material and go through what remains at a reasonable pace. This course is a 1500 page novel that needs to be edited down to a coherent 300 page manuscript that does not lose the forest in the trees."

   "comments": [
    "Not very much like MB&B300 -- If you're a chem major taking these as electives, would probably stop after that one. If you're an MB&B major, you're probably stuck with it.",
    "This course whooped my butt. There is a lot of material covered in each class, the curve is pretty tight, and the exams can have pretty challenging questions. I learned a lot, but my GPA will probably not be the same after taking it. Take it if you are willing to put in the time to review regularly and enjoy the biochemical focus or have to for your major.",
    "Great course for those who would like to get into lots of detail about biochemistry and molecular biology. Taught by some of the smartest professors who've made important contributions to the field.",
    "Yes! If you want to be a biochemist, take this class. It's extremely interesting, and will inform a lot of your future studies and interest in the field.",
    "This class was challenging yet rewarding. After having completed hours of studying for the exams, I feel much more well-versed in the subject matter and material. I also feel like my critical thinking skills were honed by this class, as exams would often require me to \"think on my feet,\" something I have not encountered much in a STEM course before.",
    "Honestly, if you're taking this course, it's most likely because you have to take it. The final exam was a mess. Requires an absurd amount of memorization. If you're a chem major, don't take this class as an advanced elective.",
    "The material covered is challenging conceptually, and quite a lot is presented at once. I definitely learned a lot but would not recommend this course to anyone not actively interested in biochemistry and nucleic acis.",
    "Don't take this unless it's a required course. Huge emphasis on memorization of terms and details. Unlike Biochem I, where I felt like I learned a lot and will retain the overarching concepts, I didn't feel like I got much useful information out of this class. I was very disappointed. The exams are also way too difficult. That being said, it's not the worst thing that will ever happen to you.",
    "This is an incredible course! I loved lectures, and the material was very interesting. Reviewing psets and quizzes in preparation for exams was very helpful.",
    "This is the absolute worst class I have ever taken at Yale. Be prepared to be bombarded with a ridiculous amount of material, all of which needs to be memorized to the T, with lackluster explanation or organization. You will learn nothing about biochemical processes that you didn't already know from an intro biology course, except you will have memorized the names of hundreds of assorted proteins associated with them. This class is terrible. Stay away. MB&B majors: I'm sorry. Pre-meds trying for a decent GPA: you might want to lower your med school expectations.",
    "Take this class, if you are interested in biochemistry and genetics. This is your chance to learn from the best biochemists in the world. It's a lot of work (the highest workload class I've ever taken), but you'll come out feeling you really learnt a lot, and know how to think like a scientist. I would suggest taking this class after BIOL 103-104, even though they are not prerequisites, knowing some genetics will be very helpful, since the class is a lot about DNA and RNA.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, although I suspect that the majority of students will be taking this course due to the requirements of their major. This course goes into a lot of detail, but it is quite good at using these to teach larger themes. As a warning, it is important not to fall behind in the material, because there is a very large amount of it.",
    "This class has an unnecessary and inordinate volume of material - doing well or at least trying drains incredible amounts of time. I had hoped the class would be more critical thinking, analytical, or experimental-based but was disappointed that to even have a shot at these conceptual problems a crazy amount of memorization of nitty gritty mechanisms and details was needed as a baseline.",
    "MB&B 301 is an incredibly interesting and very challenging tour of molecular biology, partly because of the huge amount of memorization that you have to do but mostly because the other students set such an enormously high standard that it is nearly impossible to stand out. Even if you were an A student in 300, do not expect to necessarily do well in this class; the tests are incredibly hard but the averages are very high. I would still highly recommend it, however, for people with a strong interest in biology. Do be warned that, despite its name, it is more of a molecular biology class than a biochemistry one, and even though some protein structures \/ mechanisms are discussed, in general the class feels very much like an intensive biology class rather than like a biochemistry one.",
    "Yes, if you are very interested in biochemistry\/molecular biology! This class is hard and you will need to spend a lot of time studying to understand the material, even if 300 came easy- so if the material interests you, its a fantastic way to learn a lot about how life works, but will be frustrating if you don't love the material.",
    "Hard Class, maybe the hardest one of the MB&B major but interesting if you love experiments. Do not just take for a fun elective after Biochem I, unless you want to keep up with the volumes of memorizing, experimental designing, and difficult material. Helpful professors and TAs are great.",
    "Take it if you have to, don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Unavoidable if you're a MBB major, but otherwise it is a very useful course. I would definitely recommend it if you don't mind putting in a lot of effort and are very interested in learning the molecular mechanisms of some of the most important processes in biology.",
    "Yes--although this course was extremely challenging, it was presented very clearly and had fair expectations for student achievement.",
    "This is one of the most intense courses I've taken to date at Yale. If you want to do very well in this course, be prepared to devote a lot of time to study early and often. Cramming for exams simply doesn't work for this course because you have so much information that is thrown at you, and you have to field all of it. Reading the lectures after each class is immensely helpful in preventing you from falling behind (I didn't do this and regretted it). That being said, this course teaches you so much, and really forces you to begin thinking more like a scientist. It's truly a core course in the major in it's intellectual challenge.",
    "I thought of the following review after being very mad about the final and the course as a whole. I think that previous positive reviews of the course are mainly because you learn a lot, which you do. But one would also learn a lot if they spent 4 months memorizing a textbook. The sheer amount of material in this course is just absurd. The course is like the new Hobbit movies, the editor should have just told Peter Jackson that 3 3-hour movies is just way too long and he should have instead focused on doing one good movie. In the same way, the professors of this course need to significantly pare down the amount of material and focus on the big picture, which is totally lost in memorizing a ton of stuff that has already left my brain after the final. By the way, the final was totally unlike the first two midterms. It was basically just figures from papers without any of the accompanying material that helps you figure out what papers are saying. It was like: \"Here is a vague explanation of what the paper was examining without any references or further resources to help you understand it, please explain the whole conclusion of the paper in 10 minutes. Oh, and how does this relate to a Tasmanian devil? That being said, I do think the professors care and I do want this review to be useful so here are a few suggestions: The last 3 lectures are probably unnecessary. Why break new ground on specialized topics when you can have lectures that review how the large amounts of material fit together. Or even use the extra time to allow you to finish the material during earlier lectures or go through them at a more reasonable pace. The problem sets are worth way too little. They often have many questions and take 2+ hours and are only worth 2 points! The final broke down to 1.4 minutes\/point, that means 2.8 minutes of work that you are being rushed through is counted as the same as a problem set that took 4 hours to think about. How is that a good test of knowledge? There was an extra credit question on the final that took 30 seconds and was worth 150% of a problem set, that is absurd when it is much less representative of your knowledge (it was something Joan Steitz said she didnt even really care about). And I guess I would recommend this course to most students, because most of them have to finish their major haha. Anyway, here is the review that I wrote after the exam. MB&B 301: How Not to Give A Powerpoint This course was excellent, unmatched in explaining new techniques of the field. The course started off with Patrick Sung, who unfortunately actually broke his slides up in understandable ways and only tried to teach a reasonable amount of material for the first five of his eight lectures, which was disappointing. However, I did like his technique of going through the lectures really fast so you get through the material and have time for questions, but nobody can have questions because they have no idea what just went on: brilliant! The course continued with Joan Steitz. The best new technique I learned in this section was to include questions in the slides that you only answer half of the time. Also, Professor Steitz did a good job of putting way too much material on each slide and going super fast through them. Karla Neugebauer expanded on this technique excellently and made slides that should be featured in every \"What not to do during a powerpoint presentation\" workshop. Each slide was about 4 slides worth of material and many were even textbook like, amazing! She also did a great job of going through the first few slides slowly then rushing through the second half to fool the audience. Then she would make the longest exam questions of the things she didn't explain (riboswitches...), a brilliant technique! She also did a great job of just reading right from the slides. Clearly, I understood the material after scanning the material at that pace. Overall, a revolutionary course."
