    "I developed a very basic understanding of Middle Egyptian as a language. I recognize some words by sight and can transliterate maybe 50-60% of the signs I see. However, I lack a true understanding of how the grammar works and cannot fully translate even a simple text without help. I learned how to draw ceramic materials as one would while excavating a site, and understand some of the basic techniques and trends used in Egyptian and Nubian pottery, and can relatively date pieces with help. I learned a lot about Pre-dynastic rock art and iconography, but lack even a cursory understanding of most dynastic history. I actually feel I learned the least about Egyptian history of all the things we covered in the course. I learned much more about archaeology or the language. I also learned how to provide citations with footnotes and used chicago style for the first time.",

    "Professor Darnell is very knowledgeable, and the opportunity to look at Pre-dynastic pottery and actually hold it was incredible, but that's really as much as I enjoyed about the class. If all the cross listings weren't indication enough, this class completely lacks focus. I learned more about Egyptian History in the two days that I spend writing my research paper than I did in the entirety of the course. He teaches it like we have a much stronger base knowledge than we do, and would often ask incredibly specific, unrelated questions and then express surprise that we didn't know the answer. One time he was flabbergasted that we didn't know Lebanon was known as an exporter of Cedar during the Old Kingdom. Another time he assumed we would know the Mayan name for a spear thrower, or the Roman weapon made with wood and untempered steel. The readers were completely unrelated to class and useless. Everyone lost interest as the class quickly devolved into unrelated tangents into obscure bits of history. Darnell should never teach freshman, and he should not be allowed to attempt to teach several millennia of Egyptian history, along with ceramic analysis and hieroglyphs.",
    "A slightly increased level of organization\/adherence to the syllabus might be useful."

    "I absolutely would not recommend this course to another student. There is no denying the Darnell is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject (egyptology is literally all he does), but he does NOT know how to teach a freshman course. The class lacked direction. He wanted to cover too much material, but even if the class had been more focused from the outset (i.e. he hadn't spent so much time on ceramic analysis and hieroglyphs) he still wouldn't have managed to cover just the amount of history he tried to get through. Everyone class is at least 70% tangents into obscure bits of history. Ankhtifi is simply not relevant if you don't first cover the conditions of Egypt during the time that he lived. Instead of covering themes, he covered specific people and incidents without tying it into the broader narrative. He essentially tried to teach what should have been a broad survey course like he was teaching several separate topical courses. I came out not feeling like I had really gained any real understanding of Egyptian society. It was not fulfilling in the slightest, and Darnell is pretty frustrating. The only really pros to the course are the jokes about Darnell's affair\/about his mistress's appearance, apparently he has a Cleopatra thing, and that it's an incredibly easy writing credit.",
    "Definitely!"
