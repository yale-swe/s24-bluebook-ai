   "comments": [
    "From this course, I developed an understanding of evolutionary psychology from an evolutionary perspective, a philosophy perspective, and a cognitive mechanism perspective. This course also did a really great job of explaining the nuances behind commonly used terms in the field of morality. As someone who came into the class with little background in cognitive science, I found the readings and discussion to be very approachable and meaningful.",
    "Better insight into how contemporary Cognitive Science studies are run.",
    "I learned a lot about evolution, a good bit about morality, and developed skills in reading cognitive science\/psych papers.",
    "really interesting to be taking a class that was a mix of STEM and humanities - we read STEM-y articles but also included discussion on the intrinsic humanities component of morality. Learned a lot about the human mindset and evolution.",
    "You learn to think about morality through the lens of cognitive science, surveying its many approaches - experimentation, evolutionary theory, model building etc. You then get to apply this thinking to the specific phenomenon under the study of CGSC of morality.",
    "In general, I felt as though this class really developed my critical thinking skills, because it involved a lot of close analysis of studies we read, as well as critical responses to the arguments in different articles we compared. The course also helped me gain a broader understanding of different theories of evolution and morality, so that when we discussed more specific papers in the semester, I was equipped with the knowledge to do so."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More structured approach to these two nebulous topics: evolution and morality",
    "I appreciated opportunities for feedback throughout the course and the ability to take part in choosing the particular topics we would cover in the second half of the semester. I emerged with a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of human cognition behind 'morality' and a better understanding of the forces of evolution behind morality. However, the structure of the course with Part A and B reading responses created some perverse incentives that led class discussions to become a Q&A forum with each person trying to get their questions answered so that they had something to write about in their update portion. Altering this structure may lead to richer and more flexible in-class discussions.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was the sheer intelligence of the professor leading it. Professor Sheskin did a brilliant job of explaining both the concepts being discussed and the arguments being put forth by the students, making the discussion we had much more meaningful than it would have been in his absence. The biggest weakness of the class was probably the class size. Having such a large class (15 -20, not actually that large) made it difficult for everyone to engage in the discussion as well as if the class was 5 or 6 people.",
    "Strengths: great papers, Mark is a fantastic teacher, final project was a fun exercise, discussions were interesting Weaknesses: I'm not sure how much of the actual results of the papers I'll retain. I wonder if it might've made sense to lecture a bit more on the main gists of the papers, and then have discussions. But maybe not.",
    "Professor Sheskin is a great teacher, who cares deeply about his students and facilitates interesting class discussions. Readings are a bit long, but the papers and reading responses are fair",
    "The structure of the reading responses was great for ensuring sustained engagement with personal questions and thoughts on the readings. I also really appreciated the introductions Mark wrote for each week's assignments. The discussions were often hard to get going, but it seemed more a product of the group dynamic than Mark's leadership, as he was encouraging and friendly. It's hard to pinpoint reasons as to why this seminar experience felt more unfamiliar and awkward than intimate and exciting--perhaps the slightly large size had to do with it, or maybe because this particular group of people had less interest in coming together off the table. In any case, I don't feel like I got much out of this class in terms of engaging with my peers. This class seems to be geared towards people who have had decent exposure to the psych canon so in the future it would maybe be best to be more firm about that as a requirement from the start if the class will keep its current form. Because most of us seemed less knowledgeable on famous studies or concepts, I noticed that often our questions\/comments would be directed at Mark instead of at each other, which in itself hindered more lively discussion.",
    "Perhaps it's just the nature of trying to host a STEM course in a seminar environment, or it was the setting of the very long table (making students feel very physically distant from each other and the prof), but it was hard to keep discussion going at times. Sometimes it felt more like it could've been a really good lecture course",
    "Due dates for weekly assignments is kind of Random, Monday at 2:30. Sunday at Midnight would have made it better for me personally to get in in on time.",
    "A strength of the course is the topic and Professor Sheskin. A weakness of the course would be occasional disorganization of the seminar discussions. People jump from criticizing theory to criticizing methodology, points get raised and do not get addressed. Stronger involvement in the discussions by Professor Sheskin could address this problem."

    "Take this course as a 5th credit\/ Credit\/D",
    "Ok seminar. Prof Sheskin is very kind and knowledgeable, but is not a great discussion leader. Discussions became more of a Q&A at times. However, he is keen upon improving so this may be better in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding morality on a deeper level. This class does a great job of explaining what is without bias into what ought to and ought not to be. Professor Sheskin's ability to lead a discussion deeply into a topic, with nuance and without bias was a really cool experience to be a part of.",
    "If you're interested in a comprehensive view of morality from the perspective of Cognitive Science, take this course. Sometime's the discussion felt exhausted, though most of the time the interesting material and Dr. Sheskin's insights helped carry things along.",
    "Yes absolutely. I learned a lot about both evolution and morality (though probably more about the former), and how to read cognitive science\/psych papers. Mark is awesome--super knowledgeable but also approachable, leads discussions well, and gives great, constructive feedback. Students also get to give input on what topics are covered, so second half or so of syllabus is flexible.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Sheskin is a great teacher, who cares deeply about his students and facilitates interesting class discussions. Readings are a bit long, but the papers and reading responses are fair",
    "The course content was interesting, but the seminar-style could be difficult to maintain at times. Take it if you're interested in the content provided on the syllabus.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, it encourages you to think about the world and human behavior in new ways"
