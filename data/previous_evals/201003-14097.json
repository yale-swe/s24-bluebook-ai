   "comments": [
    "This class is kind of like English 120, but with shorter papers, and in Spanish. Very relaxed, workshop-style course- regular writing assignments, but never anything overwhelming (until the final 10-page research paper). I also felt like my speaking improved more in this class than it did in Advanced Conversational (which was minimally useful).",
    "Spanish 244 is great practice for your Spanish writing skills, and will help you brush up your grammar, though you should already have learned advanced grammar before taking the course. You will get to write and edit number of short and long pieces, most of which will also include a peer edit, which is a very useful process because you will learn to identify your own mistakes by reading others' papers. The classes themselves were relaxed, and there was a range of skill levels in the class, but that didn't seem to become a problem.",
    "First, I highly recommend you take Advanced Spanish Grammar BEFORE taking this class. I jumped straight into Spanish Writing and ended up having to correct my bad habits and teach myself grammar rules along the way. It was feasible but not very pleasant at the time. But if you have taking Spanish grammar, this class will help develop your writing immensely and by the end it will be absolutely possible to write the final 8-10 page research paper in Spanish. Margherita Tortora is an amazing teacher as well as a lovely individual. She is more than willing to work with you to iron out kinks in your papers or to go over your most common mistakes while writing. A very helpful class overall.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it if you want to improve your writing skills in Spanish. It really helps.",
    "A writing workshop seminar in Spanish. Especially useful if you can put in enough time to have a good draft when you do peer editing.",
    "I wouldn't take it if you want to seriously improve your spanish, but if you want to experience different ways of writing in spanish it's a good class."
