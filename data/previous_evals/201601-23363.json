    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim is very open to meeting outside of class to discuss course content or assignments. I found meeting with Tim outside of class helped me better digest and understand the material. Tim is a very thoughtful discussion leader and does a great job of relating the current topic of discussion to previous course content and current events.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Very good discussion leader\/facilitator and explainer of complex concepts.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim is an excellent teaching assistant. Actually, Tim is just an excellent teacher, who compares favorably to many of the full \"professors\" I've worked with at FES in terms of his commitment to student learning.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim excels at making incredibly complex topics accessible to the whole class, and does so in a way that is not patronizing nor overly specific. He makes ideas relatable to all of the students, and guides the learning process to facilitate independent discover of new ideas.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim is a fantastic facilitator and I thoroughly enjoyed his role in the class.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Timothy was by far the best TA I have ever had. Has exceptional grasp of the course content, delivers it in a way that allows students to come to the conclusions themselves, and is overall an excellent teacher",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim is far and away the best teaching assistant I've had at FES; he is unbelievably dedicated to and passionate about the material covered in this course and takes students' education very seriously. He is accessible and always willing to help talk through concepts."

    "As with other courses co-taught by Susan and Tim, FES 831 was excellent by comparison to other offerings at FES. While the course certainly has its weaknesses, a particularly important one being some differences in philosophy of knowledge and pedagogy between Susan and Tim, the experience was none-the-less tremendously valuable. It is clear that both teachers care a great deal about student learning, both in terms of mastering concrete skills and development as thinkers and natural resource practitioners. Their success in creating a classroom experience and community where rich and multifaceted learning can take place is a credit to FES and, more importantly, to their own hard work.",
    "The above questions don't really capture the value of this course. The readings were great, the discussion was great, the instructors were great. But what we were able to do and talk about in that space was unique. No other course in F&ES really let's you do what we were able to in this course. We (instructors and students alike) were exploring and trying to understand how to be in the world. It sounds out there but that's what's missing in most classes. Most courses claim to give you 'tools' or 'knowledge' that will somehow help you do things, and yet students leave the course feeling that it somehow fell flat or didn't fulfill expectations. No other course helps you explore how things are in the world and how you can or should be about it.",
    "This course is valuable in general to all students studying at F&ES and should be made a core course",
    "Everyone at FES should take this class, and everyone should know that it's worth it to stick it out after the first session, even if the material seems esoteric. It will change the way you think about environmental management in a powerful and effective way."

    "Field trip as application of readings\/discussions",
    "The material is very interesting, and very important. The field trip was a great learning experience, and solidified the material very well.",
    "This course led me to completely new ways of thinking about and understanding how we talk about nature, knowledge and people, and the real consequences of how we understand those concepts. The readings were very thought-provoking and while at times a bit dense, it was great to have the group meeting time every week to talk through the material together and piece together our interpretations of the readings. The field trip to Jackson, Wyoming over spring break was a meaningful (and fun) way to start seeing what we had been discussing in class out in the 'real world.'",
    "Castree book and heuristic concepts. Good group exercises that allowed us to apply the theories to cases and discuss in class.",
    "Susan and Tim clearly thought carefully about how to encourage a rich rapport between students in small groups and the classroom. Their success in this regard made for the most engaging interactions I have had with my peers--who are the main reason I chose to attend this institution--as part of a class.",
    "Curated readings and group work in which we discussed the topics covered for the week. Having time to discuss and process new concepts out of class proved to be incredibly valuable to the learning process. Working through dense material and then being guided to understanding by the peers, professor, and TA made this class one of the most impact that I have taken in my time at FES.",
    "It's a real travesty that almost no level of education really hints at the philosophical roots of where knowledge and understanding and our version of education came from. One of the biggest takeaways for me in this course is being able to begin to understand how knowledge came to be what it is now - and the consequences of it.",
    "The field trip was integral to understanding the course material, and should be both mandatory and fully funded by FES. The course was truly interdisciplinary, not multidisciplinary. If you're unsure of the difference, take the course. Tim and Susan created a classroom environment that was mutually respectful, that valued vulernability, that made space for difference and difficult conversations, and that did so in a way that accelerated our learning both as individuals and as a group. Tim should be invited to lead sessions on this work with other FES faculty.",
    "Changing the way I think about people, policy and nature",
    "Tim's dedication to the subject matter, Susan's depth of experience, and the opportunity to apply and see in practice the concepts discussed in class during the spring Jackson field trip."

   "comments": [
    "The reading load was very heavy. >100 pages\/week\/person at the beginning is too much to be digested and understood. I think the readings could have been spread out more throughout the semester. After the field trip, reading levels went down to more normal amounts. I also think the group journals are less effective than the individual journals as a learning process.",
    "It would have been helpful to have the final assignment assigned earlier in the semester in order to give it the full attention it deserved.",
    "A little more clarity earlier on for the final assignment. It would also be good to try to work on the final case for a little longer with groups. It was very rushed to get the group portion of the final project done. My analysis and group time could have been much stronger if my team mates and I had more time to work through the case in stages. Perhaps start the case earlier on and have groups do some of the analysis in phases leading up to final presentation.",
    "Susan and Tim are both strong teachers, and generally work well together. However, there are noticeable differences in the way the each approaches teaching, and the course at times seemed caught between Susan's focus on introducing complex systems and frameworks for assessing human interactions and Tim's focus on learning through direct interaction. A better give-and-take or other system for determining the overarching pedagogy behind the course would improve the classroom element considerably.",
    "More concise introduction to the philosophical underpinnings of pragmatism",
    "More individual journal response exercises would be helpful (either in lieu of or in addition to the group journal responses that were required each week)."

My focus on conservation policy and the social context which undergirds it centers around the ability to understand broad trends and themes guiding different stakeholder communities in the field, and developing the skills in facilitating dialogue to help them come together around points of common interest. This course provided a very high quality opportunity to approach this work theoretically through readings and classroom discussions, and on-the-ground during a remarkable spring break field trip.",
    "This course is the only one at FES that tries to uncover and address the conditioning factors that drive FES (and environmental work further afield) -- the truth claims, or assumptions, that we all work under (typically unquestioningly). It provides a skill set that is very much focused on individual effectiveness and on mutual respect for different environmental beliefs and perspectives.",

    "See above",
    "The skills, approaches, and overall awareness of self and others that is cultivated in the classroom and outside of class based on shared concepts is without question one of the most powerful tools I will be able to take with me post FES. This class shifted the way I view the world and will give me a tremendous advantage over my peers when it comes to assessing a situations and deciding what and how to go about working toward solutions.",
    "Susan Clark's excellent reputation among students",
    "This was not my first course with Tim & Susan, and I took it because I already knew how transformative their classes are for students who are seeking more than a party-line environmental education in grad school. They create a space for students to think critically about problems encountered in environmental management beyond biophysical drivers - Susan and Tim help students get at the underlying drivers that create the challenges in environmental management that everyone at FES is hoping to solve."

    "The group work was overall advantageous to the learning process. It was great to learn from each other. I felt I was looked up to as an expert on this material, and I definitely wasn't. This put some undue pressure on me to know more than I could. It would have been more beneficial for my group to have all Susan alumni in it so we could grow and learn more from a base line understanding of pragmatism, etc.",
    "The group work was a very helpful forum for talking through and trying to understand all of the readings. I looked forward to our group's weekly meetings.",
    "Group discussions were great but challenging. I learned a lot from my group. I had a little trouble overcoming different levels of commitment between group members. We could have done even more with the group, but hard to get everyone to have the same buy-in to use the time well.",
    "My discussion group was a hugely valuable learning experience. The only meaningful drawback to the small group system is that it creates small units within the class that have a shared rapport and familiarity with the content that set them apart from eachother. I wonder whether outside time spent as an entire class in addition to small groups might help create a similar quality of relationship and dialogue between all students in the course. The field trip to an extent served as proof of concept for this idea.",
    "Pros: Shared perspectives of diverse learners and varied experience Cons: different levels of engagement and care about the topics leads to an imbalance of effort and shared workload.",
    "The regular group work with the same group was absolutely essential to the transformative experience that was this course. It was hands-down the best group work experience I have had. The guiding questions from Susan and Tim helped guide our group discussions and helped me understand the nuances of negotiating different epistemologies and biases. Excellent!!"

Susan and Tim have a wealth of knowledge and experience that they are very willing to share.",

It is going to be different than other classes at FES and may not seem \"useful\" at first glance. I assure it is if you take it seriously.",
