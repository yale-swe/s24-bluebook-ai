   "comments": [
    "Very interesting, thorough, and scientific.",
    "- great subject material- end of term expectations should have been more clearly stated at the beginning-in class experiment should have been split to allow more individual time-->and for us to really understand what was going on",
    "Overall the course covered a diverse range of interesting topics. There seemed to be a lot of \"busy work\" assignments. Goals and objectives were not always clear\/defined.",
    "The greatest advantage of the class is the responsiveness of the instructors to the students. The class was very interesting and the instructors did an excellent job in familiarizing us with a variety of vectors and the way research is conducted in this field.A weakness of the class was that sometimes assignments were posted late and some weeks we had to do an assignment for each class.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot, particularly the opportunity to be a part of a real, ongoing research project. Generally the class felt somewhat disorganized, however. It seemed like, particularly in the second half of the class, that we didn't really have many lectures. Lots of class time was spent either in lab, or doing discussion. I enjoyed both aspects of the class, but it seemed like those activities might be better suited for a discussion component of the main class. Perhaps it would be better if the class were designed with both lecture and discussion sections. That way we could have classroom time and time for lab\/discussion without either one eating too much into the other.Also, while I enjoyed writing the final paper and thought it was an interesting exercise, it seemed somewhat overkill to couple it with a final exam (particularly with the two being due within a week of each other). Maybe if the paper were due earlier, or were considered the final that would work better.Finally, in terms of subject matter, it felt that we really only focused on a few vectors. Mainly we looked at sand flies, kissing bugs, mosquitoes, tsetse, and ticks. It would have been nice to cover other vectors, such as fleas, lice, bats, or rats. Also, some discussion of ecology would have been useful.",
    "The course was really interesting and informative. However, it was slightly disorganized, emphasizing only certain disease vectors over others. Additionally, the expectations of the students in the course was a little unclear. The time spent in the tsetse lab was an invaluable learning experience.",
    "Strengths: interesting subject matter, high teacher\/student ratio, lots of opportunities to ask questions and provide feedback. Interesting laboratory component, although making it optional might be a good idea, due to differences in student backgrounds and interests.Weaknesses: not nearly enough time to do most primary lit reviews -- poor organization of assignments\/deadlines. In the future, *please* post articles more than a few days prior to discussion due-dates, and make the lab manuscript write-up criteria\/results available *much* earlier. The work-load was way too heavy at the end of the semester, and a bit light early in the semester. Also, I'd like to see a bit more on practical applications of material (insecticide lectures, olfaction lectures were great -- more of this type of thing, such as how traps worked or how control efforts are actually applied in the field) and less molecular biology (we spent a really long time going over antimicrobial peptides, etc.). Also, perhaps substitute the tick lecture with more on Chagas, onchocerciasis, filariasis vectors and control, etc.",
    "This was a great class! I really learned a lot about vector biology, and I liked that there was a lab component to the course. One thing that I would have appreciated is more of a discussion about the controversy surrounding mosquito transgenesis\/ paratransgenesis as disease control strategies. Also, I personally thought that there were too many guest lectures. Some of the most informative and interesting lectures that we had were given by Drs. Aksoy and Weiss. I would also say that some of the papers assigned (specifically the pop gen papers) were a little too difficult for our level.",
    "I enjoyed the course, particularly the lab component."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would highly recommend it. The teachers are so great! I am also sure that they will work out the course kinks encountered this semester.",
    "The course is one of the best courses in the program. It is a great combination of background knowledge and current research in the field. It was very innovative and interactive. The lab component was great because it gave the opportunity to students that did not have previous lab experience to see how basic molecular methods work. Overall, I believe that we all gained a deeper understanding of how research is conducted and applied in public health.",
    "This course looks at a number of insect disease vectors and the role of their physiology and genetics in transmission of disease-causing agents. In particular, the class integrates a small lab component and work with Dr. Aksoy's tsetse fly laboratory. Work load is moderate, with written paper reviews, classroom discussions, midterm\/final exams, and a final paper.",
    "I'd recommend the course if they are very interested in molecular biology and arthropod-borne disease. If their interest is more on a basic\/applied level, probably not. We didn't learn too many vector control skills or even some basic vector biology, but learned a lot about molecular biology of vectors (particularly tsetse).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student with an interest in vector biology. It is a great introductory course, providing both basic information on insect physiology and modern research topics\/ approaches to vector control",
    "I'd recommend the course, especially if the student is interested in vector biology and environmental\/ecological issues."
