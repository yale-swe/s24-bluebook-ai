    "It is a very good course to learn Spanish.",
    "This is a great start to learning the Spanish language. The homework and tests are manageable even though we covered material at a relatively fast pace. When asked what my favorite class this past semester was, I always responded with \"Spanish.\"",
    "Absolutely take this class. Fun and worth it if you put in the time and effort.",
    "A great L1 course. All classes are conducted in Spanish, which at first seems crazy but is actually not bad & is very helpful in learning the language. Expect homework nearly every night, never too extensive. Quizzes are good measure of how one is doing in the class & cover the lessons well",
    "Spanish 110 is an excellent introduction to learning both the language itself and to finding an appreciation for both the language and the culture.",
    "If you want to learn spanish quickly, Spanish 110 is a great way to do so! However, be prepared for a lot of work. You have a good amount of homework every night and the tests are pretty hard so don't treat this course lightly.",
    "I would recommend it. It's immersive and focuses on getting students speaking the language. If you want to learn Spanish, there's no better way than this class.",
    "Yes I would, having done several language courses in the past this is by far and away the best I have come across. It makes excellent use of technology by using the VHL Central system. The only significant complaint I have to make is about the cost of materials, which were excessive."
