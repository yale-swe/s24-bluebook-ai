    "Great, great, great substitute for Math 120 - from what I've heard about 120, this course is eons better, mainly because it's taught so well. I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "YES, WITHOUT A DOUBT! If you need a multivariable class for whatever reason, take ENAS 151 with Professor Grober. This advocacy is purely a result of Grober, by far my best professor this semester. I am not a math major, and while I am interested, math is not my favorite subject, but Grober made this my favorite class. We go over the material thoroughly--the professor is careful to explain the origin of almost all the formulas and concepts, so we can derive them without memorizing--and although the concepts are challenging, I always felt that the grades reflected the amount of effort I put in, so it was very rewarding (and I knew when I had to study more). Grober is clearly passionate about this subject and what he does, and this enthusiasm definitely helped me learn concepts that I had struggled with in high school--such as Taylor Series--easily. His daily \"Science in the News\" were extremely interesting, too, both showing us real-world implications of what we were learning AND adding some fun and humor to the class. TAKE IT!",
    "If you want to learn multivariable calculus. This is the class to take. End of story.",
    "I recommend this course highly for all students interested in taking multivariable calc. The workload is small, and the exams are easy. Despite this, the concepts are cemented (in my opinion) more thoroughly than in corresponding math courses.",
    "While this class has a fair amount of homework, it is far superior to Math 120, as the teacher is fantastic and the same material is covered. I highly recommend this class.",
    "It's a good class, especially if you're considering doing anything engineering-related, or even if you're not. It's definitely a competitive set because of the engineering title, so be prepared to work for it, or find yourself below the curve. I mean, it's a math class, what more can I say? You get mostly what you expect. Overall, I would recommend it for people interested in math.",
    "I would recommend that the student take the Math Department's equivalent course, MATH 120.",
    "Yes if he or she has a solid foundation in Calculus and knows how to study for the tests. He or she should not underestimate the class and its tests.",
    "If you are wondering whether to take math or not because you are worried about the difficulty and don't want to deal with doing proofs, then take this class. Definitely recommend taking this class BEFORE you attempt to do physics 181.",
    "Highly recommended. Great class, fair, possibly good teacher. straightforward.",
    "TAKE IT, it was a great class, I learned so much!!",
    "Definitely take this course. Professor Grober is amazing, and the subject material is actually pretty interesting. My suitemate took math 120 from someone who wasn't Michael Frame and absolutely hated it. If you're looking for an easy math credit, this isn't it, but if you're looking for an engaging and clear explanation of multivariable calculus, go for it.",
    "ENAS 151 was a great class that inspired me to keep taking math and learning about how it relates with the world. It was honestly a great class.",
    "If you need to take multivariable calculus or fulfill any quantitative reasoning requirement (assuming you have already taken single-variable calculus), definitely take this class!!! Do not take MATH 120. Don't let the title \"for engineers\" scare you, there is nothing about engineering or science in this class. The only thing \"engineering\" about this class is that we do not do any proofs and the professor explains the physical meaning of all the concepts so you understand them much better than the kids in 120. The professor (who teaches the only section of this class, i.e. no bad TF's) is absolutely excellent. He is friendly, enthusiastic, and explains things well. You will definitely gain a more thorough (yet practical) understanding of the world around you after taking this class.",
    "Definitely. Professor Grober is awesome - he not only teaches well, but he also makes the material interesting. The workload is manageable and the tests are reasonable. Overall it is a great course to take.",
    "I highly recommend ENAS 151. I learned a ton and felt a lot better about math (after a dismal experience with MATH115). The problem sets force you to keep up with the class. Make sure you keep going to class towards the end. It really helps.",
    "A good math class that will show you how it it useful. It's better than the theoretical stuff, because then you can see how it's actually important. I would recommend taking this class if you want to be an engineer.",
    "Take it in place of Math120 for sure!",
    "I recommend ENAS 151 over Math 120 because it's more interesting and the tests are less theoretical. The professor is also fun and good at teaching.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "This course, out of all of the classes or studies I have taken has changed my life most profoundly. Professor Grober is a man of keen insight and uncommon skill in teaching. His questions, his mode of instruction, the very logical processes that underpin his lessons, all guide you to coming to a greater understanding of mathematics not only in regards to its applications but an understanding of mathematics as a representation of nature and the universe. Every single day in his class was a pleasure. His engaging attitude, his jovial humour, and his sincere admiration of the beauty of math made it impossible for me to feel anything but awe at the subject material being taught. The most insightful part of this class, though, was that it invited future speculation and, like all good teaching, provoked more questions than it answered. Quite simply, if it didn't blow your mind, you weren't trying hard enough.I Highly Recommend this class.",
    "great class, take it with physics 180 200 or chemistry, i got a 4 on the BC exam and got a 70% on the placement test but I thought the class was fine. grober is absolutely amazing, book isn't half bad either. just make sure you study a fair bit and do practice problems for the in class tests, i did prettyp poorly on them for some reason. take the class!! its awesome!! (way better than math 120, trust me).",
    "ENAS 151 is the Engineering Department's version of Multivariable Calculus, and I would recommend you take this instead of Math 120 because you get a great professor rather than chance getting a TA who may or may not be as good as you might want in a class that is as abstract as Multivariable Class. If you want to continue calculus, take this course.",
    "Course starts easy, moves, fast, gets hard, and I wish we'd spend more time on the material at the end. Grober has interesting \"Science in the News\" discussions at the start of each lecture, but doesn't always explain things in a way that makes sense when you look at the textbook problems. He maintains you do not have to memorize anything for this class as long as you understand \/ can derive it, but your milleage may vary.Absolutely cannot be accused of only teaching to the test, the test material always strectched beyond what we had covered in class\/ the textbook. Make sure you understand how to do all of the psets, and why, don't just let yourself be fed answers by the TA's.",
    "ENAS 151 goes very quickly and you learn a lot. If you work hard, by the end of the semester you will have learned a lot. There is quite a bit of homework, but all of the questions are from a text book and they are not complicated as long as you read the chapters. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who wants an understanding of multi-variable calculus.",
    "ENAS151 is a great class to learn multivariable calculus in, even if you aren't necessarily going to be an engineer. Professor Grober does a great job explaining the material and making it applicable, and answers individual questions. He makes a 9 am class manageable by starting it with \"science in the news.\" I have taken a multivariable calculus class before, but took the class to solidify my understanding of the material (I didn't feel confident or comfortable), and this class really helped me. It wasn't too much work, and the help sessions are great if you're stuck on one or two homework problems.",
    "This is an excellent course that I highly recommend to prospective students. Rather than simply memorize formulas, it encourages an intuitive yet deep understanding of the material. While the problem sets are rather extensive (don't start them the night before!), they are helpful in learning the methods. The exams are very fair, and involve an application of the methods mixed with critical thinking. This is a great way to learn multivariable calculus.",
    "This is the appropriate next step after BC Calc, and you should definitely take it if you want to go into engineering. Grober is great; his \"Science in the news\" at the beginning of every class is fantastic. You will need to read the textbook (which is actually really good). Grober keeps it fast paced and exciting. From what I here, the teaching is much better in this class than in Math 120.",
    "ENAS 151 is a challenging but very useful class. Sometimes when you are in the middle of a topic, you can't see why you are doing it or how it will be useful, but looking back on the course, I feel like I have a applicable, strong, working knowledge of multivariable calculus. I feel like the course has done a good job of showing me the connection between mathematical ideas and their physical\/ scientific applications. I would definitely recommend.",
    "If you are looking to learn multivariable calculus, take this class (rather than MATH120)! I don't have anything against MATH120, but from what I have heard, ENAS151 is much more enjoyable. This class is great, Professor Grober is amazing, and you'll have a lot of fun! Some of the problem sets can be tough, but they are definitely manageable, and there are plenty of opportunities to go for help if you're unclear about something. I'd definitely recommend this class, even if you're not looking to major in engineering.",
    "ENAS is the same course as MATH 120 but with a better professor and more applicable theories. The problems sets tended to be longer and more intensive, but they were achievable and rewarding when coupled with regular attendance to lectures. I would strongly recommend the class to a friend.",
    "Yes I would. The course revived my interest in math and its application in the real world.",
    "Excellent class to become familiar with the calculus of multiple variables. I would highly recommend this class to others as an alternative to Math 120 as it is more applications based and relevant for engineering majors.",
    "If you are an engineering major, definitely take this course as instead of 120.",
    "It's a good way to learn multivariable calculus; that you can understand the professor is a major benefit. Understand, though, that the problems sets are much longer and more time-consuming than Math 120 problems sets, 9:00 lectures are not necessarily productive uses of your time (or attended) if you aren't inclined to wake up early, and that the majority of the kids in the class are selfishly retaking it after already learning the material in high school, so the curve is skewed for those who have not. Moreover, the tests emphasize proving and showing concepts much more than the problem sets do, and to an extent it is incongruous with the stated purpose of the the class (i.e. be application based rather than proof or theory based). Assess the above factors and decide for yourself if it's worth taking; I'd say yes if you can't get a good section of Math 120, and no if you can.",
    "ENAS151 introduces the basics of multivariable calculus. Professor Grober makes the topic interesting. Many of the students have had some of the material before, and I am not sure whether I would have been able to pick up the concepts easily without having some outside knowledge. Science inthe News at the beginning of each class is also interesting.",
    "Definitely take ENAS 151 over MATH 120 if you really want to understand multi. Prof. Grober emphasizes what the concepts actually mean; many of my MATH 120 friends never actually understood what they were doing. Unlike many of my classmates, though, I had never taken multi, which meant I spent a lot of time reading on my own. The tests were somewhat challenging in a good way, mostly because they required you to understand the concepts, rather than being exactly like the homework problems. The problems sets were manageable.",
    "It is a solid class that covers the basics of multi variable calculus and several of its applications. it covers a lot of material but if you have to time to commit it is not too hard to keep up.",
    "Take it! You finally learn how to calculate interesting, applicable things. WAY BETTER THAN MATH 120, HANDS DOWN is the general consensus. I really enjoyed it, and even though I don't consider myself a \"math person,\" am really tempted to continue taking calculus.",
    "I would recommend it over Math 120.",
    "This class proved challenging for my freshman math course. However this was probably more a matter of me being misplaced in math than the course being terribly difficult. I would recommend it to someone who is actually interested about math, because the professor was very passionate about the subject.",
    "It is an excellent class that really makes you feel fulfilled in the end. If you love math, but love the practical applications of math even more, this is the class to take. I recommend it.",
    "yes, especially if the student is looking at engineering\/applied sciences",
    "A great class. If you're deciding between Math 120 and ENAS 151, take ENAS 151! You won't regret it!",
    "good intro to multivariable, take it if you're wondering if you'll be going into the sciences. better than math 120 i've heard, but only if you're actually going to go to class (even though it's at 9 am, it's worth it...usually). the workload and exams are really not that bad although the curve is almost nonexistent.",
    "It's a bigger Math 120 with a good lecturer. If you don't get the best Math 120 professor, it's probably better to take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend ENAS 151. I enjoyed it very much.",
    "This class is fun and the tests are easy - meaning that if you are good at math you should have no problems in getting an A.The homework load can get annoying (really long), but taking ENAS 151 is worth it, because the grading of the tests is very generous.",
    "ENAS151 is a great alternative to the MATH120 program, regardless of whether you would like to pursue engineering&applied sciences. The content is taught in a logical order, and is always linked to real-life applications, which often increases its understandability.",
    "I think it is definitely worth it if you want to pursue math for whatever reason. From what I've heard about 120, this is a better choice if you don't mind a tough curve and slightly more concepts.",
    "I recommend ENAS 151 if you like math and need to take math. From what I hear, this class is INFINITELY better than MATH 120 so if you need multivariable calc, take ENAS 151. It is made difficult because there are lots of over-eager freshmen who take the class very seriously, unless you're REALLY on top of stuff don't assume you can pull to the top and score an A. That said, I found the material fascinating and while I can't say I aced the class, I think it was a very worthwhile experience.",
    "I would recommend this class, but definitely try to stay ahead and go to the sections because it will help with your homework grade",
    "For anyone who is not absolutely brilliant at math, this course may come as a shock at first. There will be lectures and problem sets that will challenge and frustrate you beyond what a lesser math course may otherwise do. But if you follow adamantly in your readings (something I should've done better), seek out help when necessary, and strive to see on Professor Grober's level, you well find that this course is an incredible one. For those of you who are brilliant at math, this is the perfect course for you.",
    "If you are deciding between ENAS 151 and Math 120, TAKE ENAS 151. The Professor is great, the \"sections\" aren't required, and material is very concrete. There are multiple TA's and you can go to any of their office hours or help sessions, and Professor Grober is also decently available. Don't be scared off by the early morning time--it's worth it.",
    "Yea!!! Don't take Math 120. Take this class. Even if you are not en engineering major. It is so much better.",
    "Take it over 120 if you can. I took 115 first semester freshman year and waited until first semester freshman year to take this class and it was worth it. The topics are covered in a better order and more focus is on the concepts behind the math rather than lengthy and ultimately useless proofs. Made me feel confident in my math abilities. Doing the homework takes a bit of time, but is ultimately rewarding."
