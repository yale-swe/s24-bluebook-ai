    "Just another DS Section, with some incomprehensible Hegel and Kant reading thrown in to keep things fresh and fun. Are you sure you don't want to drop? If you're positive DS is for you, Professor Sattler is a good section leader. She knows what she's doing and expects some rigorous papers, but you shouldn't feel *too* intimidated. You might see the class get stuck and bogged down by certain ideas and\/or people: do your best to keep the discussion moving.",
    "DS is not for everyone. I didn't love it, but that is probably at least partially because I didn't have time to do all of the reading. I think the more time and effort you invest in DS, the more you love it. I very often felt as though too much was expected of me, or as though I should be working harder, but DS might not have been the right choice for me. I would highly recommend seeing what you think of it during shopping period, and keeping an open mind. Don't be afraid of dropping after first semester, either.That said, a lot of people adore DS. Try to talk to as many different people who've done it as possible to get a sense of whether or not it's the right program for you.",
    "DS philosophy is a great survey\/introductory philosophy course, and even though philosophers like Kant and Hegel are really difficult to grasp, the course helps us understand their most important ideas, giving us a stepstone for further philosophy pursuits.",
    "I thought this course was very well taught by a professor who clearly loved the material and the Directed Studies program.It was far more difficult than the first semester philosophy course in terms of understanding the material.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and found it well-taught and fascinating.",
    "I would still recommend this class, because it's part of Directed Studies, which I fully support. It's crazy and wonderful to see how everything connects (especially in the second semester) and to see all these concepts in your everyday life. It's a lot of reading, yep, but you can do it! Or at least figure out which readings are absolutely essential.",
    "I think it's a great choice. DS is the best academic experience an undergraduate freshmen could hope to get.",
    "DS Philosophy in the spring term's curriculum is rigorous and at times difficult, but worth the effort. You will emerge with a healthy understanding of some of the most essential modern philosophical thought.",
    "YES DS is great",
    "Absolutely yes. The course covers really interesting philosophers, all of whose work you'd benefit immensely from being familiar with."
