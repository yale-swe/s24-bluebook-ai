   "comments": [
    "Almost all of the lectures were not very useful, and I could have learned the material if they had simply printed out their slides and gave them to us to read. The only lecture that I thought was really useful was Prof. Greco's lecture on how to give a scientific presentation. I thought this class was a pretty big waste of time, but I did think that the instructors were trying hard to make the class interesting. I just thought that first year grad students were not the correct audience for many of the lectures. For example, I thought that the four-lecture series on how to write a manuscript was more geared towards students from high school or early undergraduates who had never written scientifically before. There were many quick group writing assignments, which we would then peer edit. This setup was not very useful because feedback on an assignment that you wrote with three other people in five minutes cannot really be applied to improve your own writing. I also wanted the examples to be actual examples from biological writing, since that is the type of writing that is relevant to all of our interests and careers.",
    "Too much time wasted in some really boring topics",
    "weakness - lectures on how to write a paper were a little drawn out even though the lecturer was good; wasn't very applicable to our current position in grad school",
    "The instructors are great. They are knowledgeable, and they have good presentation skills to make the class interesting. Sometimes the pace is slow (such as the four paper writing classes). Sometimes we hear a lot of information that we already know (such as the how to do presentation class), and other times we are given information that we will not use until years later (such as the paper writing class)",
    "First classes were very interesting and engaging. The classes related to paper writing were too many. I don't think we need that much information on those topics right now and will probably have to learn it again on the future anyways. I don't think the mock rotation talks were that useful because we still practice with our labs and friends, and get same or better feedback.",
    "I think it would have been useful to write a grant application, even a practice one, during this course.",
    "The writing sessions were much too long- the useful info was always in the first half hour, and the examples were excessive. Dr. Greco's and Dr. Colon-Ramos' lectures were really inspiring and useful.",
    "The classes on how to make a presentation and the mock presentations were very helpful.",
    "Many of the topics\/lectures provided no additional knowledge, and were not useful."
