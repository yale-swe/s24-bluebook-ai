    "I liked the matlab problem sets; too many second year classes didn't actually teach us how to actually implement and solve the models we discussed, so actually learning how to solve the trade models was a nice change. The referee report assignment was also useful to get practice writing those, and a good complement to the more quantitative assignments in the other parts. Very cool getting to learn about frontier research directly from the people doing that work, and the lectures were engaging throughout. I would, however, say that I thought we spent a bit too much time on each paper--going into such detail is useful for people who directly want to work in a given area, but for everyone else, it would be nice to get more breadth. Overall, though, discussing CDP, Dix-Carneiro (2014) etc. with the authors is a unique opportunity we have here at Yale, so they definitely should be kept on the syllabus and given attention. Also was good to go over the Melitz model in Lorenzo's part. I wish, however, that we hadn't been given more problem sets so late in the semester when many of us were already overwhelmed with exams of various types."
