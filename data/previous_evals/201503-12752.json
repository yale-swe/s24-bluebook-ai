    "Yes, Hebrew is a great language and really fun with the TFs (even if Hebrew does require a bunch out outside work i.e. Hebrew tables, events, and mandatory section). The TFs are fun and friendly and I would say that if you're thinking about taking Hebrew, you should do it. Also if you've taken L1 and L2 you might as well finish off you requirement with L3.",
    "This course is very similar to Hebrew 120 with Dina, so if you enjoyed that class you will enjoy this class. The only difference is that it meets twice a week rather than 5 times a week, and that you will talk about slightly more complicated (yet more interesting) themes such as the kibbutz.",
    "Hebrew 130 is a great way to learn Modern Hebrew, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who is interested in improving their Hebrew specifically. For someone who is just interested in learning an off-beat language, I might look elsewhere."
