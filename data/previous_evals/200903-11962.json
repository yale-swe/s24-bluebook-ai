   "comments": [
    "Very similar to 218, but a little more difficult. Not a bad way to spend your Monday and Wednesday mornings- though starting at 9:20 is a little painful. Sarita is great, though. She always makes class fun and non-stressful.",
    "Dictation, figured bass. Literally, that's it. And you have to take it as a music major. Just do it.",
    "Great course! It really improved my ability to listen to music and hear\/identify\/notate intervals. It even improved my ear for composition in music theory (210). There is really no homework for the main course, but the piano lab (learning to realize basso continuo) took a few hours of practice a week for me. So long as you put in the effort, it's pretty much a breeze. Overall, highly recommended.",
    "Fun, easy half-credit with a brilliant and warm teacher. I wish I could take this every semester of Yale.",
    "Music 219 is a good class if you want to work on your ear. If you already have a good ear, and you're not a music major, it's definitely not worth it as a 9:20 class, but it is good at what it does. Like nearly everything else in the music department, it is limited by its conception of Western Classical music as the only music worth being studied, but Sarita is awesome.",
    "This is a terrific class if you want to be a better musician. It's a fair bit harder than 218, so it can seem a little scary at the start, but by the end you'll have learned so much you'll be quite comfortable again. The dictations are longer, more chromatic, and more consistently multi-part, so they are harder - it's not just you. And you'll be so glad once you can handle them! The keyboard lab is exactly what it was in 218 - you just pick up where you left off. Sarita was wonderfully helpful, taking time after class to discuss my progress with me and modifying our course plan in light of suggestions we made. Jian was as pleasant and encouraging as ever. If you only have a passing interest in music, this may be a bit much for you, but if you're serious, it's a necessity. I use this stuff every day!"
