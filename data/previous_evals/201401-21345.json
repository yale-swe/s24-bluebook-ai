    "A good survey of innovation. The first half of the semester looks at the modeling of innovation while the second half involves student presentations of various innovation examples and research. This results in a class that is broad but may not go into the depth that some students would prefer. Prof. Igami really cares about his students, and his enthusiasm came across in class every day.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. Workload is very manageable. Content is pretty interesting. The final project ended up being a fun and rewarding experience. Professor Igami is extremely nice.",
    "Professor Igami is very nice and laid-back, but didn't feel like I learned a whole lot out of this class. The class itself was fun, but less intellectually stimulating. A super chill Econ class that's perfect for seniors!",
    "Yes! Great course, not too much work and really interesting!",
    "YES! Not much work.",
    "Study of the economics of innovation",
    "Sure. It's an okay senior seminar. But look out for smaller classes! They'll probably be more engaging.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend it...",
    "The course is heavier with work in the beginning and then feels like nothing for a while. I would definitely recommend it though I suggest really finding a topic you're passionate about for personal research. Igami gives you a lot of freedom, so if you're looking for a super structured course don't look here.",
    "Take this or you are a fool",
    "I would summarize it as a weak collection of econ papers that you can read on your own.",
    "I fully recommend this course because it changed my of looking at the world. My final project was a great learning experience."
