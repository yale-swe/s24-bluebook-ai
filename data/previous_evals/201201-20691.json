   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a great class to get an overview of the body's systems on a molecular level.",
    "Yes, Its a good summary of the cell biology and pathology in different organ systems and their related diseases.",
    "This class is an interesting mix of cell biology and histology that not only discusses mechanisms of individual cells, but shows how real cells look and function in biological contexts.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to another student. The weekly assignments were time consuming though.",
    "I recommend this course to you if you want to explore the world of disease related histology.",
    "I would recommend it because you learn a lot from lecture, but the class does not require a large time input (allows for more research time).",
    "I enjoyed the course and learned a lot about histology as well.",
    "An overview of histology and pathology of diseases of various systems in the body. I would recommend the course to others. Gained valuable knowledge from lectures, but majority from the histology lab. Would place more emphasis on structuring the lab and leaving more time for it as it is very important.",
    "great class, gives you important histology information that you need to know without stressing you out.would definitely recommend",
    "I enjoyed it a lot!",
    "I would recommend CBIO 604 01 to a student who wants to have an overview of some of the hot topic of the current research",
    "Yes, I will recommend it to a fellow student",
    "For graduate student in biology, this is a very useful to get a broad view of system biology, which knowledge might be lacking due to our mainly focus on molecular biology study.",
    "The course is an introduction to histology coupled with a broad overview of the biological systems of the body, as well as the clinical application of such knowledge (e.g. disease treatment). I would recommend this class to students who (a) have no taken a histology course and\/or (b) would like a course that covers many topics in biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who did not have a strong background in cell biology in undergrad.",
    "Histology analysis and general overview of the organ systems under both normal and disease states. The course provided an overview of many different organ systems.Yes, I would recommend this to a student in the biological sciences because it can introduce them to new structure and function of organ systems that would otherwise not be seen.",
    "it's a chill class where you learn a lot."

   "comments": [
    "",
    "It helped me build a background in system cell biology , so some of the discussions on certain organ systems was relevant.",
    "This course allowed be to put a real picture on cells, instead of the cartoon model that I'm used to dealing with. However, at this point this course did not do much to contribute to my dissertation\/research other that contribute to my background knowledge.",
    "This course helped me to gain an overall \"big picture\" for my research and what else is going on in the scientific community. It made my research seem relevant in a biological system.",
    "It helps me to gain much more information about different disease, and of course the histology.",
    "I learned about histology and about cell biology.",
    "Better understanding of histology and systems cell biology.",
    "Definitely deepened my knowledge in my field of vascular biology and the cardiovascular system (several lectures). Found histology very useful for my research interests and interpreting sections\/slides.",
    "provides histology and overall systems review that is important for biomedical engineers as background understanding.does not contribute to my dissertation, however, because my project is engineering focused (though may eventually provide biology background)",
    "I still don't know how the course will contribute for my dissertation, but for sure I learned some very interesting things thanks to this class",
    "By combining both systematic knowledge and some cutting-edge advances in the area, it help me get a more comprehensive perspective of system biology.",
    "My take on the course is that it was never meant to be \"deep\", but rather was always intentioned to be a \"shallow\" course by covering a variety of topics in brief. In that regard, the course was a success, and it introduced me to several subjects that I had little or no previous experience with.",
    "This course has taught me to think about biology and model organism from a wholistic perspective, considering not only the individual pathways, but how all these pathways function together in an organism. This is important to keep in mind as I do my dissertaiton research",
    "This course helped inproviding a general understanding of many of the basic organ systems in the body and how they function during both normal and disease states. Thus, I was introduced to systems that I would not otherwise have been introduced to. Overall, this did not contribute significantly to my dissertation research other than general knowledge.",
    "it gave me a broad overview of different organ systems and the pathology"
