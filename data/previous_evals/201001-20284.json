    "really interesting books providing great introduction to american religious history - i would recommend it to all americanists",
    "Religious Studies 705 01 is an introduction to the content and methodologies of the study of American religious history. Spanning the country's history from the Puritans to media celebrities, the course brings together multiple strands of American religious history in order to tell a more complex narrative about religion in America while acknowledging such a narrative's tenuous stability. The course introduces students to multiple disciplinary orientations in telling such narratives, including history, religious studies, and cultural studies while evaluating such approaches for their strengths and weaknesses. The content of American religious history is important to this course, but perhaps more important is developing an awareness for how to put such a course together, how to integrate outside presenters into class discussions, and how to introduce \"interventions\" into a story in progress. Overall, this course exposes students to a variety communities and religious individuals that both challenge and affirm traditional readings of American Religious History.",
    "Absolutely. Exceptionally educational.",
    "This class is indispensable for anyone interested in pursuing American religious history; were not it restricted to those students whose interests necessarily dovetail with the content, I enthusiastically recommend it to any one wiling to work hard and be intellectually rewarded in amount exceeding that hard work. As it stands, this class should be compulsory for anyone working in the relevant field.",
    "Highly recommend this course; outstanding introduction to the field of American Religious History; course readings were insightful and provocative and at appropriate difficulty level. Themes covered were very diverse.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student. I learned, precisely because the course was so challenging and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for the diligent student.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "The class is a general overview of important topics in American religious history through the examination of a series of typically narrowly focused books. I would highly recommend the class to anyone interested in writing about religion or simply thinking about it as a force that leads to significant historical changes. The work load is neither too light nor overwhelming, and the class discussions improved each week, becoming perhaps the best I have been a part of at Yale. The professors each do an excellent job in bringing out all students' voices and focusing on specific issues raised by the books.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in American religion, and in particular the range of approaches to studying it. The mix of students in the course offers a nice range of opinions and varied background expertise. The course encouraged and rewards active participation. The emphasis on the readings is heavily Christian - Catholic and in particular evangelical Protestant."

    "i've now read a broader range of books in the field, which will help me better orient my research",
    "This course nuanced my understanding of American Religious history and the ways in which stories about it have been told. The course alerted me to how importance is determined when studying religion in America while highlighting unfamiliar religious communities and their stories about themselves. Professors Lofton and Stout did a very good job of foregrounding teaching and the challenges awaiting us in the academy concerning pedagogy and American religion. The course contributed a great deal to my future dissertation and current research on American religious culture of the late 1970s by way of the reading list and my own research project for the course. This course was one of the best I have taken in my graduate career thus far because it combined seamlessly discussions of content, methodology, and professional development.",
    "It provided me with exposure to key works in Am. Rel. History, something that I will constantly use going forward.",
    "I arrived thinking I had command over the relevant literature in the field; I left having a greater knowledge of historiography than I could have possibly imagined.",
    "Very helpful to current future research! Great introduction to various aspects of ARH -helped to narrow my fields of interest while providing broad base of knowledge.",
    "The course was invaluable in preparing me for further work in the area of religious studies.",
    "This course has encouraged me to deal critically with religion in at least one chapter of my dissertation. I am more fully aware of the deep personal investments people have in religious studies, and I am more knowledgeable of the important historiography on my subject, better preparing me to write on religion. Finally, the course has led me to think more about why and how I write what I do, and to consider different ways to deal with sources and methods in writing history.",
    "This course offered a useful foundation in the study of American religion, including its methodology. At least some of the books will certainly help define my research and research questions going forward."
