   "comments": [
    "For the first time as a chemistry major, you really get into the theory behind how things happen and how they are built. From the circuit lab to the NMR lab, all of them really do teach you on a basic level about how things work. There is a good amount of work (the grace days are gifts at the end of the semester, don't blow them in the beginning), but it's an incredibly rewarding class.",
    "A lot of work for not much glory. Plan ahead. Don't expect to get out of lab early. In fact, you'll probably have to stay late. Say goodbye to October and Thanksgiving breaks.",
    "I would say that I learned a lot about physical chemistry experiments but it was also an incredible amount of work. I would recommend this lab to another student if they are willing to spend a lot of time on the lab reports.",
    "It's true what you've heard about pchem lab -- prepare to drown in enormous amounts of data, stay in lab until 5:15 every week, and write 40-page lab reports (which you need to start at LEAST a week early if you want to turn them in on time and do a good job). However, this is also one of the best-taught classes in the chemistry department, and you will learn so much: not only about chemistry but also about instrumentation, electronics, engineering, and even statistics. Vaccaro is good, the TAs are great, and the expectations are clear, so it's not particularly difficult to do well (just time-consuming). A final note: I waited until the year after I took pchem to take this, but I'd recommend taking both at the same time, since the material will probably make more sense, and the lab and lecture seem to compliment each other well.",
    "Pretty good class, but the workload is no joke. I definitely think I grew from it, and I am so happy that I took a softer workload in my other courses, or this course might have been unbearable. The final is also not a joke. The weekly seminar is helpful with understanding. Prof. Vaccaro explains things very well.",
    "I imagine you're planning to take this course because it's a requirement for your major. In spite of the horror stories you've probably heard, I actually really enjoyed CHEM 330L. It's a lot of work. Even if you space it out and don't procrastinate, you will spend entire weekends and significant portions of October break and Thanksgiving break working on lab reports. But once you've resigned yourself to that, the course is actually pretty fun, and you learn a lot about the fundamental principles of chemistry. Like, a lot a lot. There are five pre-lab quizzes, two fulllab reports, three partial lab write-ups, and a final exam. Each of the reports is capped at 15 double spaced pages of actual writing, but tables and figures will bring the page count near 40. The comprehensive final exam is written for 2.5 hours, but if you've been engaging with the material and mostly understanding what you've been doing, you won't have to study too much and it's not that painful. Don't be scared of CHEM 330L. Don't procrastinate, and you'll be fine. You might even enjoy it.",
    "Obviously, only take this if you're a chem major. This course will almost kill you. You will survive, but just barely.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It is a lot of work. But I certainly wouldn't consider it reason enough not to be a Chemistry major, if anyone is struggling over that decision.",
    "It's hard. There's a lot of work, but you'll survive. I will insist that you don'tprocrastinate, but in reality you probably will, simply by being extremely busy Yale students. Try to analyze your data as soon as possible after finishing an experiment if you can. Like, get dinner after lab and then look over your data that night. That would help greatly.Ultimately, best of luck! Once you finish (and you will!), you can say that you survived one of the hardest classes offered at Yale!",
    "Physical Chemistry Lab was the most demanding course I have taken at Yale thus far. The course's strengths are that it is a broad course covering topics ranging from basic electronics to bomb calorimetry. The spectrum of topics and range of concepts covered in one semester is truly astounding. Students will leave with a new knowledge of how to write comprehensive lab reports and do painstakingly accurate error calculations. The weaknesses in this course is it is planned horribly. The course starts off with one lab report after 1 month of school. Then it crams 2 large lab reports back to back in the middle of the semester during midterm season, and puts the final two lab reports in the last two weeks of the semester during finals season. This course is intended for the student who plans ahead, but inherently never does.",
    "It's a lot of work, but very very rewarding. Start your reports at least a week early, ideally more.",
    "If the format of this lab does not change from the Fall 2013 format, the amount of work required will dramatically decrease your happiness during the semester. The lab reports can make you fill very desperate and lonely.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to. You will hate your life and fall into a hole of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Taking this class is like walking into hell and gladly accepting the consequences of such an experience. To those who have to take it, welcome to academic oblivion and adios to your soul. This is not an exaggeration whatsoever.",
    "This is the toughest course I've ever taken in Yale. Unluckily, it's required for all Chemistry majors. Make sure you start working early on, unlike other lab courses, it's not possible to finish the reports in one night. Be ready to spend a lot of time for this course. There are 5 lab reports in total, along with a written final.",
    "Where does one even begin to describe Physical Chemistry Lab? It pretty much ruined my fall semester. The lab reports were terrible, the material boring, and the labs themselves were long and tedious. We were doing some labs which had been perfected a hundred years ago (boiling stuff? are you for real?), and I wish there was more emphasis on newer techniques or experiments which would be more helpful. This class pretty much made me hate chemistry with a burning passion.But if you're taking the class, you probably already know all of that. It's gonna suck, you're not going to be proud of the reports you turn in, and you're going to hate everything every time a lab report is due. Don't get your hopes up, it's gonna be a long semester.",
    "This course is needed for the chemistry major, and I would suggest that only those students take it. It is a hard course and a rewarding course, but the more interesting material is covered in the PChem lectures.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone, and sincerely mean it. As a student who really enjoys chemistry, this experience was extremely aggravating, disappointing, a huge huge waste of time for the most part, and made me doubt why I should even spend my time at Yale majoring in chemistry. If you have to take this course for one semester because you're a major, pick the semester that you are ok having the least amount of time to do anything else and are ok with having a really sad life. The instructor of this class does not seem to understand that Yale is not just pchem lab but an incredible, rich experience with lots of cool classes and activities and talks and people you should be spending your time with-- you will start to lose out on some of these things when you take this class unfortunately. If you want to be working on lab reports all of fall and thanksgiving break, take this class! This is all because you spend so so many hours working on reports which involve huge amounts of tediousness and time typing up equations and sample calculations, entering stuff into excel, making a ton of graphs and doing error analysis on a crapload of things when you clearly know how to do it if you do it just a few times, etc. And it's not just that, but you have to take into account all the time you spend trying to figure out what to do in the first place, correcting mistakes in huge excel sheets, getting units wrong, etc. and then it takes forever. (I did fine on them and still feel crappy about the whole experience). Idon't even feel like I learned much because I spent so much time figuring out how to complete a nice lab report and by the end didn't care at all about learning the material itself. I could get through the lab report knowing a limited amount and wanted to sleep. Made probably around 200 pages of lab report and didn't feel all too productive in terms of what I'd gained out of them. The course structure is really not enjoyable or conducive to the most effective learning. The labs we did in this class were pretty dull and felt pretty ancient... in one of them we watched water and cyclohexane boil and read a thermometer. In another, we had to manually measure the temperature increase as we burned something (and it was ridiculous we didn't have the temperature probe just hooked to a computer...). These seemingly simple tasks took forever somehow and even required us to stay after the 4 hr lab period occasionally. We couldn't use other peoples' data if we messed up, so one time a machine broke and some kids in my section had to do everything over in a makeup session after the last class. The list of stupid experiences goes on and on. I will say that the lab lecture is taught pretty well, but most of the material from the lecture wasn't used in writing lab reports, which was definitely the largest part of this class. I hope this class improves, but otherwise I'd recommend you stay away.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. If you do take it, be sure to take it during a semester when you have a lighter schedule. Even after reading all of the evaluations and hearing all the horror stories, I still feel I underestimated the amount of work that is required of you in this class. It is ridiculous, and you will be miserable. Especially if you, like myself, make the mistake of taking this class alongside four other classes, two of which were chem classes. Also, do NOT procrastinate.",
    "It is a very difficult class, and a lot of work is necessary to do well. Everyone says you can't procrastinate and succeed, and that is true. Grading definitely seems arbitrary at times. Only take it if you have to."
