    "I had always thought of Africa in association with the slave trade in the past. Now I know that the slave trade was present in Africa, but there were many other aspects of life in the kingdoms and empires that I had never known about before. I learned so much about African societies and interactions with Europeans that I wouldn't have known otherwise",
    "I learned a tremendous amount a about africa that i previously did not know a time all.",
    "A great survey of the impact of the slave trade on African societies across regions and time periods.",
    "I learned a lot about the state of different African regions along the coast between the 16th and 20th century. The course emphasizes on what was happening IN Africa, before, during and after the atlantic slave trade. Very informative. Interesting readings. Good class!",
    "Much african history i wouldn't have studied anywhere. REally gives a deeper understanding of slavery in general and the Trans in particular",
    "I learnt how to write essays properly and retain information."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was great- the only thing was Professor Harms put a ton of information on the slides and it was impossible to write all of it down. He also just read off the slides.",
    "The course was easy to understand and not particularly demanding. I would say that the slave narratives essay portion was the weakest part, as it didn't enhance my understanding of the material.",
    "Fantastic!",
    "Very good class, no weaknesses I can think of. I love the content and the way the lectures are set up"

   "comments": [
    "Yes- the material was fascinating and the workload was manageable.",
    "good class. the readings aren't entirely necessary for the midterm or final but you will need to do some of them for the paper. need to attend lecture because he does not post all the slides (although he basically just reads from them at a fast pace).",
    "Definitely. You will learn a lot and the readings are interesting.",
    "Yes! Take it to learn more about Africa before the slave trade. The history that people learn about Africa always seems to start after colonization or the slave trade but this class shows how diverse and intricate the political systems were along the coast from sierra leone down to Angola.",
    "Take it, where else will you learn such things? Take it to understand the workings of the slave trade especially on the african continent",
    "I would certainly recommend this course! I came into it hardly knowing anything about the history of the regions we studied. I really liked how the course emphasizes the differences among the various slave trading regions and doesn't just group it all into one big \"history of Africa\". Instead, you'll learn about the history of Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Kongo, Angola, etc. This is really one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, it is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale"
