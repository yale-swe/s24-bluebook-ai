   "comments": [
    "This is a good class. Unlike L2, which focuses on speeches, historical accounts, and short readings upon finishing the textbook, this class focuses on two longer works of Latin prose. I usually found the political speeches and histories more interesting, but this class definitely did a lot to improve my translation skills with more complicated Latin.",
    "Good class, the texts are interesting and Tom was a great instructor.",
    "Latin 131 focuses almost entirely on translating and understanding the two texts: book one of Apuleius' Metamorphoses (prose) and book one of Ovid's Metamorphoses (poetry). Homework and class time is spent almost exclusively on translating and going over the reading. You are expected to understand most basic elements of grammar and little time is spent going over such things expect as they appear in the text. Grading, at least in my section, was relatively kind. Overall, the classes isn't exactly inspiring, but it's a good introduction to reading prose\/poetry, and I definitely learned a lot.",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot, but if you're thinking about taking L3 Latin, you're going to have to anyways, so just do it, lol. Requirements are requirements.",
    "A good interesting mid level course for latin",
    "Terrific introduction to Latin Prose with humorous readings that you will want to do! Great classmates and taught by a superb department. This is a class you will always want to do the homework for and show up to. (See all above comments for extended responses)"
