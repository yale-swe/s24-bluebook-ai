    "If you want to learn Spanish then I would definitely recommend you take this course. Some of the students will have multiple years of Spanish experience and will be taking this class as a gut, but don't let them intimidate you. When you look back at your language skills from the start of the semester to its end, you'll be surprised with how much you have learned!",
    "If you want a wondeful intro Spanish class, this is definitely the one to take.",
    "I would say that SPAN 120 is a wonderful class instructed by wonderful and passionate professors! The workload is fairly large and the class is fast-paced, but it is effective at training students in the Spanish language and the professors make the class interesting and fun as well.",
    "Absolutely take Spanish 120, but be prepared for a LOT of work!!! Your Spanish will improve immensely over the semester, however you really get out what you put in.",
    "The next level of the Spanish program with a focus on verb tenses and forms. I would recommend this section of Spanish 120 to other students because of its great professor.",
    "Awesome class that quickly elevates your language skills as it builds up a lot of the cornerstones of the Spanish grammar. Very intense though (1.5 credits), as everyday you have homework in many different books\/ websites and it is easy to freak out or forget about them. Takes a lot of time. A tutor would help greatly.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. The class is very rewarding and your language skills will improve tremendously throughout the semester. You learn a lot about the culture of Spain and Latin American countries.",
    "Great language course. Really really really awesome. Juliana might come off as a bit intimidating or eccentric at first, but she is actually one of the best professors I have had at Yale. She cares so much about her students and does everything she can to help her students succeed and learn the language. I so strongly recommend taking this course with her!",
    "This course is very worthwhile for students seeking to learn Spanish and to expand their cultural horizons; it's very rewarding - you leave with tangible new skills!"
