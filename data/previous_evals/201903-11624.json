It would have been tremendously helpful to me, both professionally and emotionally, to have a course in the first year devoted to moving along a research project. This course helped me feel like I might actually have a chance at being successful at this career.",

    "This is a required course for second-year P.h.D. students in political science.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. Jacob and Bryan were great. Both of them seemed committed to making this class a place where students felt supported and nurtured. I felt, for the first time since starting the program, like I was in a class where my work mattered and was viewed as important. My experience is that the Ph.D. program feels very isolating, both professionally and socially, and I don't get the sense that the department, as a collective entity, really notices me, or my work, or cares much that I exist (it might be that the department cares very much, I just don't feel that that is communicated to me). This class made me feel like the department did care, and that it would be noticed if I were to not show up to class. I really appreciated that. The class was also very inspiring to me on a professional level, and I feel renewed energy to try to be successful in an academic career.",
    "Yes. If you want, you don't have to put in much effort to the \"course\" while still putting in serious time into your own workand get feedback from other students (and profs)."
