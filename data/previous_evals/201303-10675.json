   "comments": [
    "Lots of fun, great way to improve early music singing, sightsinging, or learn an early instrument.",
    "A lot of fun -- great way to gain exposure to a variety of early music experiences! You will learn a lot in a relaxed setting.",
    "If you like to sing (specifically more choral or renaissance stuff) and are remotely comfortable sight-reading, this class is really a high point of the week.",
    "Yes, the class is very rewarding on different levels.",
    "Collegium is super fun, and has something for everyone. If you want to sit back and just come to class, then you can do that, but if you want to branch out and learn a new instrument, Grant is really helpful with that. Don't expect to go super deep into any specific stylistic points since it usually takes all of the time just to get the music together, but even if you are serious about early music, then gaining experience performing it is very valuable.",
    "A great course where you will learn from a really brilliant musician. If you have previous knowledge of early music, you'll have an easier time with the music, but all it really takes is some sort of musical ability and definitely the ability to read music. Sometimes disorganized and hard to tell what the actual expectations are.",
    "If you are interested in early music, this is a really fun gut class. There is only a perfunctory attempt at academics; mainly you show up, sight-read, rehearse, talk some about early music, and perform twice a semester. The quality of playing and singing is variable, which can be frustrating, but I would say the class is definitely still worth it - especially with so many people playing period instruments!",
    "Take it if you're interested jn the period. It's annoying when randos take the class because musical quality decreases. Check it out and see if you would be able to tolerate rehearsals if the people seem bad during shopping period. Basically a guaranteed A. It's cool that you get to play renaissance instruments!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. You get to work on amazing early music and learn about it in a relaxed atmosphere.",
    "Sight-singing for fun and education! Would definitely recommend this.",
    "This class is pretty much an early music ensemble that rehearses once (sometimes twice) a week. There are some short (very interesting) lectures and discussions in class, rather like you would find in any specialized ensemble, like, say, the Yale Russian Chorus.I highly recommend this class \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0it's a ton of fun. If you play an instrument, you might be able to play an early version of it in the ensemble, which is awesome. I plan on repeating this class (for credit!) every semester from now till I graduate.",
    "The musical wolf pack is only as strong as its weakest member; depends if the other people are duds. But generally, take it if Grant is teaching, and spend as much time in a small ensemble setting with him as possible. If you don't already love early music, Grant's enthusiasm will wake you up to its charm! Also great sight-singing practice.",
    "Definitely recommended for anyone interested in a little theory and lots of practice of early music. Little to no work besides learning music. Grant Herreid is an incredible musician, teacher and conductor and his excitement about whatever we are doing is contagious. One thing to know is that being able to sight sing is extremely helpful and makes the class more fun as there is a lot of last minute, fast music learning.",
    "A great introduction to Yale's Early Music scene."
