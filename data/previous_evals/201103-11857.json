    "Toward the very beginning, Glenn asked us who in the class had taken neuroscience classes before. Nearly everyone raised their hands - everyone here already knows what they're doing, so you have to study really hard on top of all of the studying you already have to do just to keep up with them. There are no curves but he'll drop your lowest grade. This is all about rote memorization along with regurgitation of facts on difficult and often confusing exams. You will take five exams (several completely ambiguous multiple choice, matching, true and false, and an essay) and a final (100 multiple choice). Make no mistake, although this is a neuroscience class in the psychology department, it is made up of a nearly nonexistent amount of conceptual psych sorts of things. It's all biology so be ready for that if you really insist on enrolling. I saw past reviews about how poor this class is, and I did not put much faith into them. They were right though.",
    "Straightforward class. 5 tests (MC, T\/F, short answer, essay questions) and a final. Material is very detailed, but gives you a comprehensive look at all the workings of the brain at the chemical, anatomical, and behavioral level. Great class if you like biology (you have to learn receptors, brain pathways, neurotransmitter actions, etc.) but also gives psyc majors a look at the biological bases of behaviors like learning, addiction, eating, etc. You watch 4 films that are extremely helpful in understanding the material at hand.",
    "sure-- esp psych neuroscience majors",
    "If you have little biology background, or are not good at memorizing lots of information, this class can be very difficult, especially if you are in it with a lot of students who have neuroscience background.",
    "It's a manageable course, but the 6 exams may be a bit painful if you don't put in time to study. There's a lot of memorization involved, but the lectures are extremely helpful and the final is actually a bit easier than the other 5 exams. I think its a great course if you want to learn about the brain mechanisms and effects of certain substances on the brain.",
    "You learn about how the brain functions (Action Potentials, Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems, how the brain interacts with the different systems - visual, auditory, motor, somatosensory, sexual development in the brain, long term potentiation, memory, body regulation systems, drugs, diseases, stress). If you're interested in the brain, take this course. Tests require a lot of studying, definitely study with a friend, you will do so much better on the tests. A lot of material, but it's straightforward, so it's not super difficult. Just lots of memorization. I loved this class.",
    "Fundamentals of Neuroscience is exactly what it promises. If the topic is interesting to you, you'll love it. If not, you'll be bored. Some bio background is definitely helpful but you'd be fine without it. Very cool how it all comes together when you're studying for the final-- it all connects and you feel like you have a really solid grasp on how the brain works.",
    "Great introductory neuroscience class. There is a lot of information covered, so be prepared to put those memorization skills to use!",
    "I would but with a forewarning that the material is not a psychology class, it is a biology class.",
    "The lecture is not very interesting, because he just uses the slides. But the material's manageable if you stay on top of it. Not the easiest List B class by far, though.",
    "Sheer regurgitation, as (perhaps) it should be. The material is generally interesting and presented logically. If you take the course, you will gain a basic (mechanical, decidedly not philosophical) understanding of the workings of the nervous system. I have only two complaints:1. Since the tests follow the lectures so closely, there is little incentive to read the textbook. That said, the textbook often does explain the material somewhat more clearly than do the lectures, taking the time to give greater context.2. Professor Schafe lectures dynamically when speaking about his own area of research, but tends to read off the slides during other parts of the course. This is the sort of thing that I guess could be improved with rehearsal.I would recommend the course for anyone who needs to take it (duh), but would direct more humanities-oriented students to investigate Yale's softer neuro offerings.",
    "Sure, do it! It'll give you a good introduction to neuroscience and the coursework is definitely manageable as well as interesting. Plus, I think it's a required course for the Psych Neuro track (this or the spring-term equivalent?). If you just keep on top of your work, you'll definitely do well. No worries about scary curves.",
    "It's a broad overview of neuroscience in animal and human models. It is very very information heavy. Interesting information, though, so if you are interested in learning more about how the brain functions from a heavily science-y perspective, you'll love it. But you have to be willing to commit a lot of information to memory to do well in the class. I would recommend the class to a Psych major or someone otherwise interested in the subject matter. Prof. Schafe is very straightforward and clear.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to neuroscience. Not a gut class -- there are easier ways to get your science credits. Good for psych majors, though. There were 5 exams throughout the semester (one every 2-4 lectures), so you feel like you're constantly studying for neuroscience, but that means there's never too much material on one individual test and the tests themselves are pretty straightforward and easy to do well on if you've put the time in studying. It also means that no one individual test is worth too much in your final grade, nor is the final. The final was hard in that there's so much material, but luckily it was multiple choice (only took about 45 minutes to complete) and only worth 20% for us. A review session before the final (like the ones held before the individual tests) would have been helpful. You have to go to lecture in order to do well on the class, but you don't have to do any of the reading,which is nice. You watch a few interesting movies, too.",
    "1) Be prepared to have an exam every two weeks. But while you are constantly studying for this class, you would also be glad the material is broken down into so many smaller, much more manageable parts (studying for the cumulative final will kick your ass, though, but at least it\u00b4s multiple choice).2) I think every psych studentshould take this class. It gives you a good background or basic knowledge, at least, on neuroscience and how the brain works.3) Don\u00b4t be scared off by the professor saying that a bio\/science background is important-- everything can be learned via rote memorization, and it\u00b4s not difficult to understand. It\u00b4s just a lot of material.",
    "I liked this class. There is a lot of material to learn for each test, but the fact that there are 6 tests makes the amount of memorization manageable. All you have to do is study the lecture slides and you will be fine for the tests. The lectures can be kind of boring, but that is because some of the information is pretty technical. At the end I felt like I had a much better understanding of the brain and what we know about it.",
    "It's a very straightforward course, with lots of memorization involved. There are 6 exams and so you get tested every couple of lectures, which makes the material a lot more manageable (yet still formidable), but yet I still found that I didn't have as much time as I needed to study for each one. It takes up more time than you think. It isn't a very exciting course, but you do \"learn\" a lot, so I would recommend taking it if you're interested in the material itself and if you have time. The teacher isn't teaching this course next year but it's not a loss or a gain since he just goes over his powerpoint slides and doesn't do much else.",
    "Yes, take this class, especially if you are good at just rote memorization. JUST GO TO THE LECTURES. In the beginning, I would read the textbook along with lectures, but later found that everything we were tested on came from Professor Schafe's slides rather than the book. This realization was actually for the worse, because the textbook is very informative, SUPER interesting, and well-written. There are 5 midterms, which seem tedious, and they are...but if you just learn all the information on the powerpoints then they're cake. That means knowing which brain region innervates whichever other regions and knowing what effects drugs have on each of the processes. The tests aren't curved, and they reminded me of any typical exam I would take in HS. Also, for the final, a quick review of notes and extensive review of past exams will probably be the best way to prepare. If you're good at memorizing and have even the slightest interest in neuro then this class is perfect.",
    "great course in terms of the material. If you like psychology I would definitely recommend taking it. I thought the topics were really fun and I always enjoyed going to class. but the problem is you always have to be in class even if you are very sick because you need to fill in the blanks in each of the power points not to mention that means that it is very hard to focus on the actual lecture because you are trying to write what goes in the blank. also be prepared to have a test every 2 weeks it takes time and you need to be on top of it. overall even with all that said I liked it and that in itself say a lot",
    "A fairly in-depth introduction to Neuroscience and the various areas itencompasses, from neuroanatomy to sensory systems to psychopharmacology. You cover a wide range of material and all of it in pretty meticulous detail, so you have to put in the time to memorize all of it because the tests ask pretty detailed questions. It's very interesting though, especially the movies, and even though it does require some extra time you definitely come away with a good foundation for future neuroscience classes."
