   "comments": [
    "You'll learn about concepts from stranger incivility all the way up to mass incarceration. Some of the material is about the U.S., and some is about England. A bunch of the readings are fairly theoretical, so being a very data-inclined empirical type of person, I wasn't particularly thrilled with those assignments, but it wasn't all like that. We did learn about things that had good studies to back them up, as well. Prof Smith is really nice, pretty flexible and lets you turn in drafts of papers for him to edit, which is really helpful. Take it if you like the subject matter.",
    "This is a good course for those interested in learning half ideology, half facts of how the criminal justice is run. There is not as much emphasis on law as one might expect. The tests are rather easy. The readings are usually not boring.",
    "very interesting course and topics. Very reading intensive, but the readings are interesting. I would definitely recommend this course",
    "Yes I would because it was a nice small, laid back seminar that still had sensible work requirement that was manageable.",
    "I would not recommend the course. I think students who are interested in crime and criminal justice should take it if they want to gain some understanding of how the criminal justice system works, but that is it.",
    "Great survey class. I was looking more for sociology and social control, but I think this class is geared more towards those interested in criminal justice. That said, there's still a lot I learned about social control and every day behavior. I was a fan of the way class was structured (the unfortunate need for lectures were disposed of with haste and students shared some of the responsibility in giving them), the grading and the assignments. Interesting readings!..though I didn't get to do as many as I'd have liked.Smith is a wonderful man, very supportive and knows his stuff. Funny, at times. I liked his willingness to give feedback on rough drafts of the papers, though a \"this is excellent\" on the rough draft did not translate to an A in the end.",
    "It is an incredible, though fairly challenging, course that teaches you about very interesting and relevant topics you never think about much, such as what the police really do or how the prison system developed.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who thinks they might be interested in sociology or law for sure, as well as to anyone who wants to take a course that will teach them how to do research and write a good research paper.",
    "Yes i would recommend the course. It is a great way to dip your feet into sociology and the term paper allows you to explore your own interests.",
    "Socy 41 examines the motivations for people to order themselves and how they do it. Theories of multiple intellectuals regarding the organization of society are read and analyzed. I would recommend this to a student who doesn't mind reading and is interested in aspects of law enforcement and people's motivations.",
    "It is an interesting course though it can get boring if you aren't particularly interested in criminal justice. The readings are manageable and exams too. The papers require more work.",
    "Sociology 041 01 is a great course for a freshman. It was really intriguing and you learn a lot about the world around you. This is a lot of reading but you go over it in class so it is comprehendible. I would highly recommend this class!"
