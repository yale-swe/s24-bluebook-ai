    "The fundamentals taught in this course were helpful to my ability to approach future, more complex problems.",
    "Learning about tools such as EPI Suite, Alternatives assessment, IRIS, TR I etc.",
    "I learned about the Principles of Green Chemistry\/Engineering and the need to design for end-of-life and for products to not persist in the environment.",
    "I learned the chemistry concepts underpinning industrial ecology. I am now more aware of the alternatives, substitutes and compromises that businesses have to make to find the right green chemistry and engineering solution.",
    "We covered a number of important chemical properties that are integral for assessing how \"green\" a product is, but believe that we rushed through the content too quickly, so I'm not confident that I learned too much",
    "Basic grounding in period table and other chemistry fundamentals. Understanding of toxicity and hazard, how these are tested for and how society becomes exposed. Great walkthrough of the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering.",
    "Effective and efficient tools to assess the potential impact of different chemicals in the environment as well as an enhanced understanding of core principles of chemistry.",

    "Learn many concepts and tools to evaluate the chemicals",
    "The topic covered are better than I expected.",
    "They aligned pretty closely with my expectations.",
    "I did not feel like the class was well structured. While the topics covered were important I do not think I took away anything significant beyond relying on chemists to be better at designing chemicals. This course was not designed for students who were more interested in big picture issues.",
    "It aligned with what I hoped the class would teach me. I was expecting a more technical focus, but this class catered to my basic background of chemistry.",
    "Not too well - this is a required class for my track, and I felt under-equipped to take this class.",
    "The content of the class exceeded my expectation in that it focused on practical chemistry and how to apply those skills\/resources in evaluating current status quo processes. The class could have gone deeper on these topics at times, however.",
    "They aligned very well with my expectations"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Application of many tools and green chemistry principles Guest speakers gave many inspiring ideas on the practice of green chemistry",
    "This class taught us about a lot of essential concepts that I have never thought of before. Maybe it can be improved by facilitating the use of these new concepts.",
    "The in-class activities were helpful but occasionally took away from my understanding of the basic course materials.",
    "I believe either the course should be full on a chemistry course that focuses on chemical design OR a course that provides basic knowledge on the topic of green chemistry and how this applies to industrial ecologists in training.",
    "The group component could count for a less significant portion of the grade, given that our individual work took up the first half of the semester. I would have liked more assignments engaging what we learned in the second half.",
    "The class could be improved by eliminating the final project, and instead rolling out the chemistry at a slower pace. That, and the readings were totally disconnected from what was covered in class. I'd prepare for a discussion on recycling or plastic biodegradability and we'd have a class on KOW values or ecotoxisity. It seemed like the instructors tried to pack too much in too quickly.",
    "Sometimes it seemed that this course was caught between two groups of students with two different knowledge bases. It moved very quickly for students without a large chemistry background, who might have wanted a deeper dive into reactions, molecular behavior etc. Those with more in-depth backgrounds might have found this part of the class to move slow.",
    "Strengths: The course was clearly laid out and taught readily accessible concepts and tools which students then applied in simple ways. The material is relevant and interesting to a wide range of environmental topics and concepts. Paul and Julie were high energy and readily accessible to students. Weaknesses: Students who did not understand concepts slowed the class considerably. I would expect these students to spend more time outside of class, either in office hours or doing reading, learning these concepts. There were many classes when the same basic principles would be presented for the first 30 minutes in order to ensure everyone was up to speed. Greater onus should be placed on the students to use the time and resources available to them outside of class. Improvement: Push students to do more work outside of lectures. I would have liked to go deeper on some topics, such as the differences between bioavailable toxic and bioavailable non-toxic substances, than we did. Choose an indepth case study to explore in the last half (post midterm) of class to discuss the design and engineering aspects of society in greater detail.",
    "I think the content was great, and absolutely necessary for any future sustainability manager. Don't let anyone in IE not take this course - performing the alternatives assessment was the best part. I felt like my team still did not really understand the science behind what they were reading for the assessment, which was a little concerning. Perhaps the expectations were not high enough earlier in the course that would force them to learn it better. I would expect a future sustainability manager to be able to read an alternatives assessment to compare two products in the future.",
    "The course was very interactive and the speakers brought in were very helpful in shedding light on how green Chemistry & Engineering is being applied in the real world"

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn basic concepts and practice of green chemistry, you should take this course.",

    "I hope that you enjoy chemistry and learning outside of class ;)",
    "This class is likely one of the most broadly applicable classes available at FES. It focuses on the movement of harmful chemicals into people\/the environment so if that is not of interest then do not take the class. The chemistry and equations are very simple and accessible, especially since Paul & Julie are so willing to spend time talking through them after class.",
