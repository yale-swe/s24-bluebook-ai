    "I am so glad I took directed reading. It was really amazing to be able to explore a topic that was of interest to me, work one on one with a professor, and apply the economic methods that I had learned while at Yale.",
    "This has been the most wonderful experience of my Yale career! I learned so much about development economics, especially about the relationship between women's empowerment, economic development, and gender norms. I also learned a lot about foreign aid. I have grown in my ability to decipher and critic econ papers.",
    "I was gained a theoretical foundation in the Permanent Income Hypothesis (and Bewley models), Wage Search Theory, and Contract theory, while also reading and presenting on between 7 - 10 papers. Being able to critically evaluate the quality of ideas and papers in dialogue with a professor was extremely helpful.",
    "How to read economics papers and analyze them"

   "comments": [
    "I thought for an independent study course it was very well formatted.",
    "Doing the directed reading was a really great decision for me! I think it enhanced the knowledge I have been getting from my economics degree. The strength is that you get to work one on one with a professor and learn about any area of economics that interests you! The freedom and flexibility is wonderful and allowed me to learn so much!",
    "The flexibility of the course was excellent, and it allowed each meeting to be fruitful. Perhaps it might be helpful to have more examples of the structures that previous independent studies have had, but I also think that people who might want to take the course should have some idea of what they want out of it before they take it.",
    "Great opportunity to dive deeply into one area of economics, highly recommend!"

    "If you are interested in doing research on a certain topic in a slightly less structured format than the senior essay, this class is for you. I learned so much from working one on one with a professor and applying the skills I had learned as an economics major.",
    "Absolutely! everyone should do a directed reading with a professor before graduating!",
    "I actually ended up spending a significant amount of time in preparing material for my meetings with my professor, and that was mostly a function of the relationship we developed and being excited to talk about the material. I was highly recommend it, but certainly you get out what you put in -- the Professor likely won't have time to read the papers in-depth beforehand, and they certainly shouldn't be the ones guiding the conversation, so be prepared to put in time to whatever project you undertake.",
    "Yes!"
