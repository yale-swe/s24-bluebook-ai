   "comments": [
    "Learn about decision-making, push yourself to extend the articles. Definitely would recommend it, I learned a ton.",
    "Best course at Yale. If you want to learn about choice from two of the smartest professors at Yale, this is it. Grading might be rough.",
    "Yes.",
    "I really enjoyedthis course, even though the three hour seminars can get long sometimes. I'm a undergraduate, a junior majoring in Cognitive Science and Economics. My focus is decision making, which is why I chose to take this class, and it definitely deepened my understanding of the field, not only as a consumer of research, but also as a producer of research. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable, and every week out of the three papers that we read, our professors have co-authored at least 1-2. It's a great chance to talk to the minds behind the research. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the field and really wants to get to the bottom of it, but not to someone who just has some passing interest\/curiosity. The work load is pretty significant, because you really have to do all of the readings, and very carefully too, or else you really can't participate or take advantage of the seminars (and it would be obvious, since you have to do postings on the classesv2 forum), and every week I spend about 10 hours prepping for the seminar. But when you look back, wow you learned a lot!",
    "Absolutely take this course if you can get in. Both Nathan and Ravi are amazing professors and experts in their fields, and they run the seminar very well. You should know that this is very much a RESEARCH course with a bent towards marketing and consumer behavior. You will learn topics that span all disciplines of behavioral decision theory, but the focus is still upon these sectors of it. That said, if this sounds vaguely interesting to you, you will definitely enjoy this course.",
    "Great class if you're interested in bdm. Definitely recommend.",
    "Behavioral Decision Making I is a review of various topics in the psychology of how decisions are made in reality and the systematic biases that sometimes underlie these mechanisms. The amount of reading is not overwhelming, but you have to have read it closely and be prepared to discuss and contribute. I would recommend this course to a student interested in a comprehensive, research-based look at what drives our decisions.",
    "A great course for really digging in to the theory underpinning behavioral decision making. Not appropriate for people without a strong background on the phenomena."

   "comments": [
    "Great foundational papers",
    "I hope that the research proposal I wrote will serve as the framework for my senior thesis. It gave me further understanding to why we think and act the way we do.",
    "I'm a junior at the college majoring in cognitive science and economics, focusing on decision making. So this is really the core of my field, and very essential to my course of study. As a junior, I don't need to do my senior thesis yet, but I'm glad I took it now because it would be a bit late if I were a senior. This sets a great foundation for any future studies\/research that I am looking to do. I actually learned so much from this class it's unbelievable when I look back. So so important.",
    "Good overview of a lot of bdm research. Could be useful to give students not in the field more information on what the gaps were."
