   "comments": [
    "A lot of review of 120 in terms of grammar, a good class to continue expanding vocab and speaking fluency. Overall enjoyable.",
    "If you want a laid-back, fun language class with an amazing professor, take it. It's really enjoyable and you don't even mind (that much) having class 5 days\/week.",
    "Port 130: a little grammar review, some interesting readings, a few less interesting readings (the assigned book of leituras is...not great), and a lot of speaking and writing practice. If you want to keep up your Portuguese, take it.Selma Vital is excellent, so be sure to try to get into hersection. She brings a lot of interesting subjects to discuss\/debate in class, and she really cares about her students.",
    "Yes, definitely a great class to take, you learn a lot about culture and music of Brazil.",
    "Selma is probably the kindest professor I've had at Yale, and I was really impressed by how well she was able to do in her first year here. It also helped that her accent is much easier to understand than some of the other professors in the department, I think that made me more confident in speaking in class. I definitely feel like I've improved my listening and speaking ability in Portuguese this semester, even more so than my first two semesters taking Portuguese. The reason for this is almost certainly that the class was set up so that we would have tons of opportunities to converse either in small groups or as a whole class, and I think that worked well. The problem with this class was that the grammar was a complete afterthought in Selma's section, which made the tests kind of pointless. Overall though, L3 is easier than L1 and L2, which is nice.",
    "Definitely! L3 Portuguese is where it starts getting more interesting because everyone is much more able to actually express themselves so you can have real conversations rather than just practice talking about the weather.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the language.",
    "Yes, very pleasant class and your spoken and written Portuguese will improve a lot.",
    "After the grammar-heavy L1-L2 sequence, L3 is significantly more content-based. You will spend more time discussing social issues in Portuguese-speaking countries, and sharpening skills through newspaper articles, films, Rede Globo shorts and even the occasional viral video. Selma is an incredibly thoughtful professor!"
