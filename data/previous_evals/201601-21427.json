    "If you are considering taking this, you probably dont have a choice but you do have a choice in which section you take. Lets put it this way: if you are in the math econ section you will have less work to do (1 day of presentation) than if you were in the pure math section (3 days of presentations). But if you really care about pure math, you should take the pure math section b\/c you will be bored out of your mind in the other one.",
    "This is a laid-back class. Students take turns delivering lectures (split up across 2-3 sessions) and reviewing each other's work. You have to produce lecture notes, as well as written remarks for your classmates. No homework, no exams.",
    "This course is great. Definitely learned a lot about many different topics in math. I can guarantee you this one has much better content than the Econ version of the class.",
    "This course is required if you do not write a thesis. The pure math section only has 8 people this year and each of us got to present for about 3 lectures on topics related to groups, categories or representation theory. Professor Frenkel is very helpful in suggesting the references for our topics and we had to write lecture notes as well as remarks on other peoples notes. I enjoyed giving the lectures a lot, although I might have enjoyed the course more if the topics are not restricted to group theory. It is very much like a regular math course, but with other students as lecturers and no real homework on the material covered."
