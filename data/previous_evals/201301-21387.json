    "Definitely would recommend the course for any graduate students interested in formal modelling, game theory, or even those interested more generally in gaining a basic understanding of these practices as they apply to political science. The course is interesting and comprehensive.",
    "This is a class on game theory for political scientists. It was challenging, but accessible. Every students interested in formal modeling should take it.",

    "At the beginning of the semester my research was heading towards including game theoretical concepts in adaptive systems but in the middle of the semester I came across a topic which I fell in love with and will be my dissertation topic. But, nonetheless the topics covered in the class were very useful for me personally.",
    "This course gave me access to the large and growing literature in political science using formal models. It made me want to learn more. There is a fair chance that Iwill use formal modeling in my dissertation.",
    "It's an essential course, part of the game theory, formal modeling sequence"
