    "This class is a good option for the Global Affairs research methods credit. It wasn't amazing, but I don't think many of the RM classes are. Basically Professor Doss brings in a different person doing research in Africa each week. That person talks about their research and you ask them questions for the entire 2 hours. It can get a little boring but some of the researchers are cool and you come away with a broad understanding of what kind of research is happening in Africa and how its being conducted.",
    "Format- weekly readings assigned by guest lecturer, submission of questions on readings to classesV2, two shorter essays, research proposal (long and short versions) I'd say this is a decent option for people looking to fulfill a research methods requirement (i.e. Global Affairs majors). Learning about the library resources\/databases was particularly helpful for me. Workload is very manageable, Professor Doss is great, but sometimes the classes can get a bit boring if you are not interested in the guest lecturer's topic that day.",
    "AFST 401 is a course that gives you the chance to hear the research and stories of various Yale professors in the African Studies department. The course gives you the opportunity to ask questions about how they reached their research topic and their story of how they conducted their research. I would recommend the course to another student, as it has the potential to help many who are hoping to conduct research in the near future.",
