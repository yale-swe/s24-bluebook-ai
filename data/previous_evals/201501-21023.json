   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course to another student, because it is really helpful.",
    "The class is an overview of the techniques used to analyze genomic datasets. I would highly recommend the class. Instead of merely sitting through lectures, the problem sets give you an opportunity to work with real data and learn a critical skill set.",
    "I would highly recommend this course",
    "The class is designed to get biologists functional in genomics. Lectures cover the ideas behind genomics and are taught by a variety of different professors, all of which were good. The problem sets and TF sessions provide useful, functional knowledge of bioinformatic tools. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has used a command line and knows what a for loop is. The class did teach basic programming and how to interface with a remote cluster, but it was easier coming in with some background. I would also recommend this class to junior or senior undergrads who plan to go to graduate school.",
    "Yes I will recommend this course to my friend. It is informative and helpful",
    "GENE 760 is a great class to introduce you to the computational tools related to genomics and transcriptomics. It gives you the initial confidence to use these for more complicated projects, but is a stepping stone and introduction only. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone considering starting transcriptomic or genomic work, particularly if they do not have a strong computational background.",
    "This course is highly intensive but very rewarding, and lays the necessary framework to begin working with genome-scale datasets. Coding, R, and\/or genomic dataset experience is massively beneficial to the accessibility of the course, but not absolutely necessary.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students who are interested in genomics and bioinformatics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in genomics.",
    "I do already recommend to all.",
    "The class provides an introduction to the basics of programming and how to apply those skills to genomics problems. I would recommend the course to a fellow student because it allowed me to feel comfortable with programming and teaching myself new skills once the class had ended.",
    "Difficult course, but TAs are extremely helpful. I would recommend it because it is a great opportunity to learn how to process those types of datasets.",
    "Incredibly helpful and useful. I would definitely recommend it as you learn skills that will be important for genetics research. It is challenging in a good way",
    "Absolutely essential course for any genetics student."

   "comments": [
    "It taught us how to analyze next generation deep sequencing dataset, which is essential to many projects.",
    "I came into this course with very minimal computing experience. I quickly learned the basics of working in a Unix environment, as well as basic python coding, and how to work with large genomics data sets. These are all essential skills for successfully completing my dissertation research.",
    "Most useful class I have taken, by far",
    "This course allowed me to decide which direction I wanted to take my PhD",
    "Sure. After taking this course, I can handle NGS data and include it in my dessertation",
    "This class without a doubt deepened and strengthened my understanding of genomics. My computational skills were enhanced through taking this class and will be very useful to my dissertation and research. This course also introduced me to other students who are doing similar work to me, which may be useful when moving forward when I run into stumbling blocks in my own research.",
    "This was my first major experience in R, python script, and any form of genome-scale dataset manipulation. After taking this class, I feel that I would be able to analyze (in a limited way) lab data regarding my own or other projects.",
    "It provides a lot of hands-on experiences on bioinformatics analysis pipeline. This course does broaden my horizons on how to use bioinformatics tools to analyze biological and clinical questions.",
    "I knew little about genomics, and now I know a lot. I needed to know a lot.",
    "The course not only introduced me to coding, which I had never done before, but also to genomic analysis tools that I can use in the future in my research.",
    "During this course, I learned the basics of programming in Python and working on the cluser, which will help me work with large datasets. I also learned how to use various tools to analyze my datasets. With this course, I could potentially incorporate genomic experiments into my research.",
    "Excellent overview of all common computational techniques. Problem sets and TA-lead discussions were invaluable. Directly augmented my own abilities for eventual thesis work."
