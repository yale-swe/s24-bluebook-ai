   "comments": [
    "Learned some gnarly things about convex analysis, subdifferential calculus, proximal methods, subgradient methods, gradient methods and a teeny-tiny bit on accelerated and momentum methods as well. Learned a lot of linear algebra in the process -- the matrix norm stuff in particular was quite dense but it allowed us to get a deeper understanding of things like LASSO.",
    "An overview of the theory of convex optimization, including more mathematical concepts such as existence, uniqueness, and why certain algorithms converge to an optimal solution. We also covered algorithms and their run time, and delved deeply into how they actually work. We covered interesting topics such as subgradient methods and optimization of convex matrix functions as well.",
    "This course teaches the essentials of modern optimization. It expects little formal familiarity with the subject, however a number of things are prerequisite to fruitful learning: Proficiency in at least one programming language, a strong background in linear algebra, an essential understanding of multivariable calculus (particularly differential), and an area of application to which to bring optimization techniques to bear. It is helpful to have some specialty in which you are applying the tools of the course. Furthermore, any experience with algorithms would also help. The course itself is solidly theoretical, with some discussion of applications and implementations. But largely its spirit is: Here are the ideas, you put them to use. The course begins by explaining what optimization techniques seek to do: Solve some minimization (maximization) problem, possibly subject to constraints. The course focuses on convex optimization, when the objectives, bounds, and underlying sets are convex. We discussed convex analysis and mathematical background. (e.g. Duality and optimality). The course then developed various approaches to solving these problems: least squares, the gradient method, Newton's method, interior point methods, sub-gradient methods, linear programming, KKT, and semidefinite programming.",
    "I learned about many different optimization techniques for solving convex optimization problems, such as gradient descent, subgradient descent, interior point methods, and more.",
    "a lot of optimization algorithms and their underlying theory, optimality conditions, lots of linear algebra",
    "I learned various optimization algorithms, as well as various methods of proving convergence guarantees for these algorithms.",
    "I learned various algorithms for convex optimization.",
    "the theoretical underpinnings behind various optimization techniques, though not necessarily the applications. The problem sets exercised linear algebra and a bit of analysis. I'd recommend a prospective student to read the syllabus closely.",
    "Various optimization techniques.",
    "A better mathematical understanding of convex optimization techniques.",
    "Convex optimization. Some topics include: convex sets\/functions, algorithms (gradient descent, steepest descent, Newton's method), constrained optimization (LP, duality), subgradients and subgradient methods, semidefinite programming."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Sekhar! Probably one of the best lecturers I have had in my time at Yale. Incredibly witty, personable and encourages people to ask as many questions as they can in class. He goes really fast, and at times his handwriting becomes incomprehensible but for the most part, he is incredibly effective in building intuition where required.",
    "Strengths: Professor is amazing, and the material is very clearly laid out in the textbook and lecture. Problem sets are difficult but really drill in concepts. The lack of exams feels strange since it's difficult to internalize knowledge without them, but the final project is extremely rewarding and freeing, especially if you work with the professor closely. Weaknesses: As someone who has never taken an algorithms course, some concepts such as runtime were hazy to me, and it seemed like much of that knowledge was assumed or at least deemed not worthy of too much attention, although I was curious about it",
    "The course was flexible, and the professor was amenable to either adding more or less proofs in accordance with the interests of students. However, I do think more examples and fewer proofs would be a welcome change. I would also like to have studied more variants of the algorithms than we dealt with. (Particularly, studying some of the algorithms we discussed, like the gradient method, in greater detail and depth, rather than moving on to other topics.) It is a vast subject, and I think that the lack of multiple courses in the area also poses a pedagogical challenge.",
    "Strengths: covered a lot of material, good textbook options, and fair psets. Weaknesses: sometimes we went too fast and it was very unclear if anyone knew what was happening.",
    "Sekhar's lectures were the strength of the course. He explained concepts clearly and cares deeply about making sure students understand the concepts. I will say he did move a bit fast on some days, and he could have included more examples of applications of the algorithms, but overall it was a very well-taught class.",
    "Super clear lectures and helpful psets. Material can be boring.",
    "The course did a good job of providing us the tools required for the understanding of optimization proofs. The variety of algorithms covered was quite broad, with both gradient methods and subgradient methods being covered. On the other hand, I would have loved to see some of the more popular algorithms used today explored in greater detail. Algorithms such as ADAM or Adadelta are popular optimization algorithms that we didn't really cover in class. We covered only basic optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, newton's method, conjugate gradient, and some of the subgradient methods like proximal point algorithm.",
    "Strengths Weekly problem sets are wonderful - they are challenging and make sure that I am well caught up with the material. Weaknesses I wish there was a more structured milestone setup for the final paper. Although this was mainly due to my own poor planning, I found myself rushing through the final paper in the last month. If there was a more organized way to consult with the instructor every so often, I think it would have been more helpful.",
    "strengths --- lectures were very thorough; problem sets illustrated important insights; final project has potential to put the material into practice weaknesses --- I would have liked to see more applications of the material (and perhaps slightly fewer topics); there were a few problem sets that involved coding --- I would have liked more preparation with the coding questions (either as prerequisites or simpler questions on previous problem sets); perhaps the project proposal can be due earlier (before the middle of the term), with a first draft due (after midterm) before the final project due.",
    "Lectures are fabulous. Psets could be harder.",
    "I thought the course covered a lot of material and is particularly helpful with a strong math background. I think it could be improved by incorporating project check-ins or more specific guidelines as to what the deliverables should look like.",
    "Strengths: Went over a lot of interesting material and we got to explore a lot through our project report. Weaknesses: lectures were fast and hard to follow and sometimes, the homework was not always connected to the lecture material. The lecture material was very abstract, but that made it hard to apply the material to solve problems."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, please take this if you're interested in the nuts and bolts of why optimization routines work well! It will give you a good BS-meter for when people claim to have found the next best \"deep learning\" thing.",
    "Yes but I would recommend taking it after real analysis or stochastic processes. Otherwise, some lectures and material become hard to follow",
    "Yes, but as the professor says, only if you have a strong reason. I do believe one of those reasons can be a strong curiosity towards the subject, which I definitely had. I also believe it will be extremely useful, as almost anything can be viewed as an optimization problem. It is difficult, but for those who enjoy math, I think it's a really great course on understanding the theory of optimization, and a good departure from the ultra pure theoretical maths that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Depends. The professor is genuinely excellent and really makes the course. He's super available and helpful after class and responsive and engaging during class. That said, one should have a good reason to take the class. The material is fairly hard and the problem sets quite difficult and occasionally time-consuming. Without a strong reason to take the course the material can quickly become too abstract and difficult to understand. If one has a good reason to take the course (e.g. you want to understand optimization techniques for a thesis project), then this is a great choice. If not, perhaps consider another option.",
    "Yes, if a student has a clear area of application and is interested in understanding the basis for modern optimization theory. It is important that students understand the course is wide-ranging by design: Only take it if you need to be exposed to different approaches. If you just need the answer to one optimization problem, it isn't worth tracking through all of them. If you anticipate having to actively interact with different varieties of optimization problems, then this is the course for you.",
    "This is a good math elective. The final project at the end is way better than an exam because you actually get to work on something interesting to you. The psets are manageable and help you learn the material. Also Sekhar is a good teacher and a nice guy who makes class enjoyable. My only advice that you actually have a project in mind when you take the class. It's way more interesting to listen to the methods when they might apply to you.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in using optimization for their research, or who have had some experience with it in the past. The material is very theoretical so it helps a lot to have a compelling reason to take it. Overall the material is fascinating and well-taught, and the final project is a great way to learn more about a specific topic.",
    "Yes, but only if you truly need to know about optimization in your career, so what Sekhar said in the beginning. It'd definitely not of those I just want to stretch my brain classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to a S&DS major who wants to learn more about the optimization techniques used ubiquitously in machine learning. Anybody who is interested in the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning should learn about optimization techniques, as they are much of what makes machine learning possible.",
    "Definitely only if they know what they want to do for the final paper.",
    "To a student who has a project in mind that involves optimization, and who has time and experience to put the algorithms into practice. I took the course more interested in the analysis than in the algorithms, and I wish I had known how much of the course material is devoted towards algorithms. I have a suspicion I will recognize how useful these topics are in the future.",
    "Strongly recommend.",
    "If you are willing in to put in the time for this course then I would recommend.",
    "Yes, optimization is an interesting topic with a wide variety of applications. That being said, this course is a lot of work, and you need to be able to dedicate a lot of time to it in order to gain an understanding of the material, so I would take this course when you have a lighter course load otherwise."
