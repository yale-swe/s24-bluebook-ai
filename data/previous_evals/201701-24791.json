    "This course taught about the aesthetic culture that Japan's samurai valued so greatly throughout their existence.",
    "Awesome thematic overview of all things samurai, from the important texts to every genre of art including material culture and fine arts. An important look into aesthetics outside of the western cannon and even alternative to mainstream Japanese art. A great way to understand the intersection of social structures and visual culture."

    "YES. The material is so interesting, the class is small, and the professor is amazing. Professor Yiengpruksawan is an expert in this field, but she is also an amazing person. She is extremely caring and interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is a wonderful way to think about something you might not be used to and to gain some interesting insight to think about your own personal philosophy as well.",
    "Excellent class to take senior year, whether or not you're an art history major. An understanding of some Japanese history might be helpful in getting more out of the lectures but is not at all required. Two fun papers and a presentation make up your grade."
