    "Yes absolutely even if you are not thinking about film studies. Screenwriting is just fun!",
    "Marc is an interesting character who can be off putting to some on a first impression. I think he does this to lighten the class size at first. This is the second creative writing class I've taken at Yale, and if there's one thing I've come away from both experiences is that creative writing CANNOT be taught. Creative writing is something you do on your own. This class should be used as a structure to bring writers together. I'm not very self-motivated so I took this class as a way to force myself to write something, and lo and behold, I have a small 10 page screenplay from it which is cool. This class is good for someone who wants to write a screenplay, but is too lazy or unmotivated to do it on one's own. Also, the midterm folder takes a long ass time to do. Get on that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to English majors who have never tried this form. Have a go; you will most likely have a great experience if you really get into it!",
    "Yes, if you can get into the class, definitely take it. Marc will make you want to take intermediate and advanced too! It's not too much work; you have to be willing to write and edit often, but it never feels like a chore when you do.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Mark is the coolest. If you're at all interested in screenwriting, take this course. You have to write a 8-12 page screenplay and turn in a lot of work at the midterm. You will be told that you can't do the midterm portfolio in a night, and you may want to challenge it, and you will hate yourself. It took me approximately 15 continuous hours to do, so start ahead of time. But this class is awesome",
    "This is an introduction to a screenwriting, but it's also an introduction to storytelling and presentation in general. Whether or not you intend on being a screenwriter, you can learn a lot about presentation in this class. Plus, this was the best seminar experience I have had a Yale. I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Absolutely recommended if you're into screenwriting\/film."
