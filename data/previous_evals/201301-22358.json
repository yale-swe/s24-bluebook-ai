    "TAKE IT. If you're reading course reviews for this class right now, you might see one written by a lame sociology grad student complaining about this class' lack of structure and too few quizzes - ignore that. That guy is lame; but Etem Erol isn't. Etem is hands-down the best, chillest, and most interesting professor I've had at Yale. In TKSH 120, you'll learn a lot of important grammar, some vocab, and hear a lot of fascinating anecdotes about Turkish culture - in a comfortable and stress-free environment. Quizzes are few and far between, and learning happens naturally and spontaneously every day. I LITERALLY CAN'T THINK OF ANY WAY THIS CLASS MIGHT BE IMPROVED BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO GREAT AS IS!",
    "Etem Erol is great!!! It's like rosetta stone you just sit in class, laugh, have fun, and somehow magically you have learned Turkish! Take it take it take it.",
    "I would highly recommend it. It is a great class, Etem is an amazing teacher, and you will truly learn the language!",
    "If you're at all interested in Turkish, or need a language, and want to spend a year with one of the funniest professors at Yale, take this class. Just know that whatever you put into it is exactly what you'll get out of it.",
    "Turkish 120 is pretty similar to Turkish 110 in terms of course instruction. Professor Erol is hilarious and very flexible. The class emphasizes grammar.",
    "Turkish 120 is a good class to take if you want to understand how the language works, but maybe not speak it on the street.I would recommend it because it's unconventional and awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Turkish - especially as an extra fifth class or a second fun language. The grammar itself is relatively easy (especially if you've studied other languages before), and the class is VERY laid-back.",
    "great class. more than just a language",
    "Definitely take this class. You will have fun every single day (and learn a lot too). Etem makes the class.",
    "Yes, provided they plan on learning the language or wish to work in a context where it would benefit them."
