   "comments": [
    "I think it was a fun course, but should not be a requirement for the CDE concentration. It seemed more like a survey design course, which is important, but should be an elective. Measurement issues can be put into an epidemiology course and covered there instead of in a separate course, because it felt like the actually measurement lessons were minimal in comparison to the survey stuff.",
    "the questionnaire development part was great and very informative. the measurement issues guest lectures were hard to pick up specifics from. having more assignments like the homeworks and less emphasis on the QD parts would be a much better balance.",
    "I do not think I learned very much. The data analysis portion of our project was a mess.",
    "much work but learned a lot",
    "Great course - really helps you understand how to design a survey, and the issues inherent in such design. However, I think it should be part of another course, not a standalone course.",
    "Strengths - not too much work is required, and Marney is very reasonable about her expectations. She provides VERY TIMELY feedback on all assignments (like, that day) and really encourages you to reach out if you have any questions at all. Weaknesses - so much of our survey construction was based on understanding validity and reliability measures, but we spent like NO TIME on it in lecture. I think everyone was confused a little bit about how to connect the dots. We all got there eventually, but more guidance might be appreciated. Also, the lab session in SPSS was a hot mess. I know it wasn't anyone's fault, but it was really hard to learn this stuff crammed around 1 computer with spotty oversight.",
    "I learned more about questionnaire development.",
    "Strength: - useful for students who want to learn how to develop surveys and for students to be able to evaluate surveys they'll be using surveys in their research Weakness: - although the material learnt is useful, I don't think the class needs to be compulsory",
    "This course was one of the most practical courses I have taken so far at YSPH. I loved having the opportunity to practice questionnaire development and work on a topic that interests me! The speakers were good, but I think it could have been helpful for them to make the connection between their content and the course topic more clear.",
    "Strengths of the course included the guest lectures, in which we learned about the issues with measuring different chronic diseases. The project was also fun and interesting, especially when analyzing the results. Weaknesses include focusing solely on questionnaire development and the homework assignments. I thought the homework assignments weren't very necessary in helping us to understand what we learned in the course, and perhaps more of these concepts could simply be reflected in further lectures (replacing guest lectures) rather than through assignments.",
    "The lectures were great but I can't learn much from the project, which is a little bit off the topic. I wish I can learn more epi knowledge in this class.",
    "Strength: guest lecturers, interesting concepts Weakness: not sure if it has to be a class on its own",
    "This is a great course. It's can be a lot of work, and I had to puzzle some stuff out on my own. Those aren't bad things, though, because I learned a TON.",
    "This course helped me learn about survey development and how difficult it is to create valid and reliable questionnaires. However, I wish more time was spent discussing measurement issues instead of survey development.",
    "This class focused a lot more on the questionnaire development aspect than measurement issues. It felt like this was two courses combined, as our major course assignment was designing and implementing the questionnaire as a group project, but the lectures mostly focused on measurement issues in different areas of chronic disease epi. I felt that learning how to design and analyze results from a questionnaire was extremely useful, and a much needed skill in public health. But I felt I didn't learn much on the measurement issues part. So I would suggest having these as two separate courses instead of combining them.",
    "It would be helpful to go over validity and reliability in more detail.",
    "Though maybe not the most exciting material, it covered important issues relevant to conducting epidemiological research that I know will be essential in my peers and my future careers. I enjoyed the guest lecturers that focused on issues to specific areas of public health research and felt our semester long project was a really helpful why to practice and fully understand the course objectives. I that it was not until the final steps in the project that I fully understood what I was doing. I felt a little lost for the first part of the semester."

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is excellent! I truly have no complaints about her excitement for the material and for public health! She was firmly on the student's side, and didn't push too much about the quality of the work. She just wanted to make sure we understood the learning process...other teachers should be taking notes.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a phenomenal instructor and truly inspires the best from her students.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is by far the most caring, invested, funniest professor I've ever had. I've loved having the opportunity to learn from and be mentored by her. Thank you!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is an excellent instructor and makes sure to provide extensive feedback to her students. I would just say that the content of the course needs work, but Dr. White is a great professor to disseminate the content.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a great instructor as 1 on 1 discussion.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strength: enthusiastic, funny, straightforward Weakness: Sometimes not too much advice on project",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is amazing. Her energy is infectious and inspiring. She's sometimes disorganized (but who isn't?) and gets ahead of herself, but her energy and patience in asking questions makes those pretty much non-issues. She gets so excited on our behalf that it's basically not impossible to get excited too. She gives a shit, and not a lot of people do. It's not possible for me to express how grateful I am to her.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is an enthusiastic instructor and is eager to teach students. She was so helpful and responsive when our group had questions on our project. She would always respond within a matter of a couple hours and was quick to offer solutions when we needed help with our data analysis.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Enthusiastic professor who is always open to conversation and providing helpful feedback for the students.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White was really enthusiastic and encouraging throughout the course, which I believe was essential to teaching this course. She offered a lot of assistance and support with our projects when we were feeling a little stuck. I do think, though, we may have gone through the information about validity and reliability a little quickly at the beginning of the course and I would have liked to have had the the first assignment due a little earlier, as I didn't realize that I didn't understand that material all too well until the middle of the semester."

    "I think this is a great course for students to take to learn the intricacies and complications in creating surveys and addressing complicated constructs. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I would rather have learned about different types of measurement issues than focus on one questionnaire.",
    "yes will recommend",
    "A good course, and you will learn what is involved in designing a survey.",
    "A good course. You learn that a lot more goes into making surveys than you would originally expect...! Nice to have the understanding.",
    "This course is required for CDE and I probably would not have taken it otherwise, but I'm glad I did. Marney is great, the guest lectures on varied topics were also great, and the workload was manageable. Qualitative research\/survey development is not my favorite, but I actually learned a lot of valuable information in the course.",
    "OK-- I did not learn everything I expected to, but overall I did enjoy the class",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course, unless a student was extremely interested in questionnaire development. I would have liked to focus more on the methodological issues of measuring chronic diseases rather than designing scales and surveys; although these are still important concepts, it was not what I was particularly interested in.",
    "Not sure if needed to learn a lot about epidemiology, but overall easygoing class with own survey to create",
    "This is basically a class in learning how little things make a big difference, and I would definitely recommend it to someone else. A) It's interesting. B) It's fun. C) It's important that people know how to do this stuff well. D) Marney is a fucking rockstar.",
    "This course provided an introduction to survey development and measurement issues. I think it was a helpful class, especially if you plan to do research using surveys for data collection.",
    "The course is very helpful in learning about questionnaire design."
