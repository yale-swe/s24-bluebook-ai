    "Absolutely. This is among the best classes I've taken at Yale. A careful, slow reading of the Republic alongside valuable secondary literature is indispensable for any philosophy student. Professor Harte was absolutely terrific. She is always brilliant in class, and in office hours she is incredibly helpful. I always walked out of office hours with half my questions answered, and the other half expanded into much larger, more important areas of future inquiry Professor McCabe was awesome. She was hilarious and super high energy. At the same time her comments were always incisive (often provocatively so). I hope she'll be back at Yale in the future so more students can benefit from her",
    "Take if you're into contemporary analytic approaches to ancient philosophy; otherwise the secondary literature will be extremely not to your taste. The Republic is a weird and wonderful work which never gets boring, so the class of course has substantial independent interest. But nonetheless you have to appreciate a certain mode of reading (i.e., the kind you'd get in a recent issue of Phronesis) to enjoy the class.",
    "This was an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to immerse oneself in the Republic with two wonderful scholars with very different approaches to the work. MM and Verity had a great rapport, and they were not afraid to challenge one another's ideas, which made each class feel like a real clash of minds. Unfortunately, that meant that the class did not always feel like a seminar. Especially in the early part of the semester, I felt there could have been more discussion among the actual seminar participants. We did a particularly woeful job discussing the massive amount of secondary readings assigned each week. Overall, however, this class really showed how much one misses in a work like the Republic when one reads, as is often the case with Plato, small excerpts presented out of context."
