   "comments": [
    "The course is organized very well and sticks to the same format for all classes, but I feel like how much you learn is dependent on the professor you have.",
    "Weaknesses are the exams because it tested more memorization skills rather than French itself. Vocab especially was only memorization and was almost impossible on many exams.",
    "Strengths: Really teaches you a lot and shows you some very relevant aspects of French culture, from books and movies to songs and food. I definitely feel like my French improved a lot and I really enjoyed the content. Weaknesses: Instead of a big test every 2 weeks, I would prefer smaller tests more frequently, or some better method to average them out. The tests were usually pretty tricky and there were a lot of questions that seemed specifically designed to trick us. In contrast to L1 and L2, it also seemed like we were doing a lot of the learning ourselves and simply reviewing or strengthening the concepts in class. There was a considerable amount of daily homework.",
    "I really enjoyed all aspects of the course but sometimes the audio was not very helpful to my learning."

    "If you want to improve your French and feel connected to the culture, yes!",
    "I would, it is fun and engaging and French is very useful"
