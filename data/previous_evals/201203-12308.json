    "Not too much work, but the course itself isn't outstanding.",
    "This course was a frustrating experience, beset with all sorts of issues from the start. The main problem was the utter inability of Professor Allouche to present anything close to a meaningful and analytical understanding of the history of the region. We were instead assailed with hundreds of dates, names and battles, not any of which were ever tied together into a comprehensive narrative.The readings assigned were totally unhelpful in this regard, and a truly curious student would need to read much more material that assigned to take away any coherent picture of the region.Adel Allouche ought not to be teaching this course. I say this not because he doesn't have the requisite facts and details under his belt, but because of his appallingly poor and disinterested attitude towards the discipline. He speaks of major events and ideas in the history of Islam as though they were only background events, sideshows to the really \"important\" things like the dates of the battles and revolutions. He shows an alarmingly negative attitude towards opinions other than his own, poorly substantiated and admittedly subjective views. His lectures are terrifically dull and monotonous, and at no point is a student excited by the pace of events described.",
    "Yes!",
    "The course material is super interesting and important in and of itself; lectures varied from really interesting to pretty dry. It's pretty easy to do only a minimal amount of reading if you pay attention in lecture. I thought all of the assessments were fair."
