    "This is an incredible course that improved my ability to think in a well-reasoned philosophical manner, to evaluate arguments, and to communicate my thoughts clearly, as well as gaining exposure to a wide swath of thought on various issues and topics in philosophy of religion.",
    "I can now both my friends and family by making any religious discussion significantly more complicated. But, like, in a good way.",

    "It is very well-organized and fair. Having the study questions, as well as a question pool for the exam, streamlines studying and enables you to focus in on answering questions that help you engage with the material in a systematic way rather than frantically trying to grasp bits and pieces and hope for the best.",
    "Very well organized.",
    "Really comprehensive. The textbook was great, and the material itself was interesting. The lectures provided interesting supplements or differing views from those in the reading. Section sometimes devolved into intense arguments between a few people, making it difficult to review\/discuss any of the arguments presented in lecture or in the readings.",
    "This course was structured very well. I really enjoyed the lectures and the discussions we had in class. I only wish that we had more time to devote to the material, as 50 minutes never seemed enough."

    "Absolutely! Professor Pittard is an engaging lecturer who clearly knows, and cares about, his subject. It is an extremely fair and well-organized class and you always know what you are being evaluated on. The readings are typically short and generally much more \"readable\" than a great deal of philosophy tends to be. The only unfortunate aspect is that, since it is a survey, there is so much left untapped about each topic, but that is the nature of a survey class, and it does definitely give you insights on these topics and tips you off as to which you might be interested in studying in a more concentrated class.",
    "If you are interested in philosophy or religion or both probably take this. Prof Pittard is a good lecturer.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in the material. This is a unique opportunity to evaluate many religious arguments from a rigorous, academic\/philosophical standpoint, rather than the dogmatic arguments you might usually encounter. Now, when those late-night drunken arguments inevitably turn to the existence of God, you will be well equipped. It has also made me re-evaluate many of my own beliefs, and the basis of other people's religious beliefs. You also get to take the class with Divinity School students, an opportunity that I enjoyed. I think there is a tendency for Yale students to be anti-religious, and this course made me much more appreciative of the philosophical bases for many religious beliefs. Also the workload is fairly light (two 5 page papers, a final exam (with questions given to you ahead of time) and four quizzes about the readings (also with questions given to you ahead of time). Of course, this may not be the case if it's not Pittard teaching the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and engaging."
