    "If you want to apply econometrics to issues of developing countries, than this is for you. And by \"apply\", I mean read different studies, mostly conducted by Nancy. And by \"econometrics\", I mean difference-in-differences. That's it.",
    "Is great if you want some general understanding of how to do reaserch in economics but not be good for who has taken various econometrics classes already",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! There is no final exam during finals period, only 5 problem sets, and non-mandatory section. You learn so much! If you took econometrics II (132 or 136), this class may almost be a gut, since the problem sets heavily rely on Stata. Nancy Qian is one of the most engaging lecturer at Yale. Not only the topics for the class were well chosen, but also she knows how to engage the students during class. She also had a great deal of patience with me when I was waiting for graduate school decisions. Every time I needed advice, she was there to provide extremely valuable suggestions. I have nothing but amazing things to say about Professor Qian. She showed me amazing research on developing economics. More importantly, I got to know a lot about her papers and how much of an amazing researcher she is. I hope I can keep in contact with her in the years to come. I hope the TA is still Meredith Startz. Meredith was a wonderful TA during office hours. She is very knowledgeable and willing to offer students advice about career path. I am glad we crossed paths in this class. Rumor has it that the median grade for the class is a straight A... I don't know if this is actually true but it may be.",
    "This class was a product of Professor Qian. She poured a lot of energy into the course, which surveys a lot of her research and that of her mentors at MIT. The class is not a survey of the features of developing economies. The class is micro-centric, in that you will cover a lot of material about individual households trying to maximize their utility and make ends meet. It is a research-based class. The lectures are almost exclusively devoted to studying papers that measure the effectiveness of development interventions and the unintentional socio-economic consequences of government policies. Almost all of the papers we studied in this class focused on difference-in-difference IV experiment designs. The focus of the class is not on the developing economies or the outcomes of the policy interventions, but on the difference-in-difference models. You will become an expert on difference-in-difference through this class, and the context of developing economies is a secondary learning outcome. The problems sets, which are long, many, and worth 60% of your grade, will require you to replicate the results of the papers studied in the class, and you will become really comfortable with Stata as a result. You will cover most of the material before Spring Break. After the midterm (which is usually the last day of class before the break) the class changes gears and becomes student directed. Groups of 2 students will research a controversial development topic\/policy and papers assessing this topic\/policy (think Child Labor, Corruption, Int'l Aid, etc.) and present this topic as a debate, citing evidence from class lectures, the assigned readings, and other sources. All in all, I enjoyed the class and learned a lot about difference-in-difference, instrumental variables, and 2 stage least squares regression. I highly recommend it, with the caveat that if you are looking for a course that has more of the features of an introductory course in development (macro)economics, you should also look at Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak's lecture \"Doing Business in the Developing World\" in the SOM."
