    "a lot more philosophical than political but good class",
    "A. Unfortunately, this course was not what I hoped it would be. I thought that the concepts would be more applicable, based on the powerpoints that were provided during reading period. However, once reading period ended, so did the powerpoints about real world issues and the class became more about the theory of various current philosophers. If the theory of various philosophers is what you're looking for, take this class. But for me, I found Ethics and International affairs as a class to be misleading because there wasn't much bridging theory with practice.",
    "I would not recommend PHIL 180 01 to another student. It was very frustrating and difficult to follow, and I don't feel like I took much away from it which is really disappointing in a course.",
    "Ethics and International Affairs provides an exceptional environment in which to discuss and learn about the world's major ethical injustices (as well as to discuss realistic and interesting solutions). I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about what it actually takes to make an impact in the world even at an individual level. A substantial amount of reading is required, however the readings are interesting and thought provoking. Professor Pogge is also a leading contributor to the field of international ethics, making the class a pretty amazing opportunity.",
    "Although this is a hard class, I believe Prof. Pogge makes it worth it. It's a great way to think about prejudices, intuitions regarding morality, and how these apply to the world and relevant social issues.",
    "Yes, good intro to political philosophy that doesn't require too much background knowledge. There is a lot of reading that you should keep up with to do well on the exams and be prepared for lecture, but there is very little graded work, especially in comparison with other humanities credits. It is nice to get a humanities rather than a social science credit from the class since it is cross listed, and there are only two fairly short papers (1500 words and 3000 words) one midterm and a final. Overall, its an interesting class, and I would recommend it!",
    "Only take this class if you really like philosophy and abstract ideas.",
    "I would not recommend this class for an intro class. There is a lot of dense reading and no shortcuts to make the class easier. Section helped, but the class was sometimes difficult to follow and a lot of the material was pretty dull.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is a very well-taught, small sized lecture and you will have a lot of chance to approach the professor (which may not always be the case for other lectures at Yale)",
    "Good background, even if you're not instinctively interested in the topic. Hard exams",
    "Really informative intro class. Professor Pogge may not be the most engaging lecturer, but you will learn a lot.",
    "It's a great class but there are a lot of dense readings. It is an amazing opportunity to learn from Professor Pogge, who is one of the scholars who participated in creating the Millennium Development Goals and is heavily involved in real world issues."
