   "comments": [
    "Taking this class was one of the best decisions I made this past year. The quality of the in-class discussions alone made the course worth it.",
    "Yes absolutely. It is a fascinating seminar about a riveting topic. It will increase your interest in French, in film and in literature about the Second World War much more than you think. It also has a very manageable workload. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who speaks\/understands French fluently and wants to watch great films about WWII.",
    "You watch a number of great movies for this class (mostly great movies you almost definitely would not otherwise watch), and you examine a truly interesting subject--the peculiar resonances of the WWII experience in the French collective memory as mediated through film. Alice Kaplan is wonderful: warm, laid-back, funny, knowledgeable. She also occasionally brings chocolates and other goodies (e.g. wine) to screenings. But I would only recommend this class to someone with a deep interest in the subject and someone who speaks, writes, and understands French at a high level. Without interest and fluency, I don't think this class would be very rewarding. Also, our discussions were somewhat more shallow that one might have hoped; especially, we tended to operate either in the mode of historical analysis or in the mode of film analysis, rarely drawing (or even trying to draw) any relations between the two.",
    "GREAT GREAT GREAT class, take it take it take it!Prof. Kaplan is an amazing person and an extremely knowledgeable and humble professor. Her assistant Catherine is also really great and helpful when it comes to preparing presentations and other things. The films you see are straight up amazing although sometimes very sad or even horrifying (one documentary on the concentration camps). I find the topic to be very interesting as it links history to filmography. We also had the chance to go on a field trip to see one of Prof. Kaplan's movie director and exhibit curator friends in New York. That was also great.Best class I took this semester, by far.",
    "One WWII movie per week, some better than others, followed by a fairly loosely bounded discussion of its historical, cinematic, and thematic features."
