    "She is a visiting professor so the class won't be taught again, but DON'T take this class! The readings are very interesting, but Prof. Labidi is kind of all over the place. She's an easy grader and there is only a test and a paper, though, so the workload isn't bad at all. It's just kind of a waste of time. And Professor Labidi calls you out constantly to ask questions or make comments. That being said, she is very, very approachable, cares a lot about her students, and is always offering to meet with students to discuss anything!",

    "Only if you are independently motivated to do the reading and participate in class discussion.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this class to another student. It was so confusing, and not worth two hours of time every week."
