    "Definitely take this course if you want to maintain your Japanese skills. There is no other way you can keep up your Japanese while studying at Yale. Nevertheless, if you want to actually get a lot better and come closer to fluent in the language, you must go to Japan and study there as well.",
    "This class is very similar to the first semester of L5 Japanese, mostly readings. However, I feel that since you should've gotten used to this level of material, it's easier to get more out of the passages than just translation exercises. With great teachers and interesting material, I think that this is a must-take class.",
    "Yes, it's fun and a good way to keep up your Japanese language skills!",
    "If you have taken Japanese up until now, definitely take this class. It is exactly the same as 150, and is really great in developing reading and writing skills. It also focuses more on speaking than 150 did, which was a big improvement. The workload is as large as it has been the previous semesters, but since it only meets 3 times a week and by the end it will become manageable, this should not be a huge issue. Take this class!",
    "yes!"
