   "comments": [
    "I have become better at sight reading.",
    "Improveed Latin beyond basic grammar",
    "Practice in translating Latin prose.",
    "I greatly improved pre-existing Latin skills and improved by speed and confidence in reading.",
    "My Latin skills genuinely improved",
    "I furthered my knowledge of Latin through text and close readings of historical works written by many brilliant writers, orators, historians, philosophers, etc.",
    "This course greatly improved my understanding of Latin grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. I entered this class with only a basic working knowledge of the language and left the course feeling confident enough to tackle nearly any piece of Latin prose. The course also introduced me to a wide array of authors including Sallust, Tacitus, and Livy. Apart from improving my translation abilities, the course also strengthened my work ethic and elevated my writing. Finally, this class acted as a primer on the history of Cicero's consulship and surrounding events.",
    "In this class we read Sallust's Bellum Catilinae. I reviewed some fundamental syntactic and philological concepts that were rusty from high school Latin. And I got to practice preparing lines, learning vocabulary words, and translating on sight. I also learned how to write an analytical paper about a passage of Latin.",
    "I strengthen my ability to translate and gained knowledge of a variety of ancient authors writing techniques.",
    "I improved my latin reading comprehension and grammar skills."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class could really use some improvements. I feel like my own passion of Latin has been the only source of enjoyment out of this class. Potentially, the class will go beyond simply understanding each sentence individually and talk about how the sentences fit together to form cohesive paragraphs.",
    "Class very greatly from the syllabus so it was hard to follow",
    "You get much practice in translation, but there could be more formal grammar review.",
    "One of it's strengths was the teacher and how engaged he clearly was with the material and that spread to the students. The frequent quizzes were also very helpful in making sure that I actually learned the material and studied it throughout the course of the semester and made the final that much easier to prepare for. A weakness was perhaps that the class was so large that it was easy to hide and not participate.",
    "This course is tedious, but that is part of the nature of an intro to prose course. I wish we had a greater opportunity to engage with the material in ways other than translating (essay, etc.).",
    "The smaller class size and commitment and dedication by the Professor were great strengths to this class.",
    "This course is very strong, due in large part to the instruction and hard work of Kyle Khellaf. He thoughtfully crafted a course that not only improved my Latin, but also refined my writing, strengthened my work ethic, and made me excited about the study of the Classics. However, the class did sometimes suffer from a repetitious class schedule. During every meeting, we would work through translations and grammar questions for the entirety of each 50-minute session. I wish that more time was dedicated to seminar discussion as a means of breaking out of this cycle. Often, I found myself wanting to discuss the text itself, instead of just going over vocabulary and syntax. I understand that this is a difficult task, considering the bulk of the course is focussed on grammar and syntax. However, I think the entire class would improve greatly with the addition of a little more time for critical seminar discussion. Also, the larger of the two sections was simply had too many students. I would only be able to contribute a few lines of translations, at most, during these sessions. The large environment was not conducive to my learning. The smaller section, on the other hand, was fantastic and I am very thankful that Kyle hosted the second, smaller section.",
    "This course was lovely because it was interesting and not very difficult. The difficulty lay more in having the discipline to consistently prepare lines and pay attention in class. But given these two conditions were met, the class itself proceeded at a very predictable pace. Exams were very fair and successfully strengthened my philological understanding and analytical chops. I thought we could have done without reading one very dull and poorly-written book (Robert Harris's Conspirata), especially if the only takeaway from the book was that \"historical fiction authors often borrow heavily from certain historical texts and isn't it interesting to find the parallels.\" Perhaps if this class is taught again, a more interesting book could be chosen--for example, anything by Robert Graves or a writer of similar caliber.",
    "The strengths are the good teaching and small class-size which helps with learning. There are no obvious weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Not unless you have to for a language requirement",
    "I thought this class was compelling for someone looking to continue to study Latin, however perhaps not huge greatest course for someone looking for real mastery in translation.",
    "I recommend a this class to someone who does not wish to learn any new latin concepts, but wishes to improved pre-existing skills.",
    "Yeah, it's a great Latin class. Kyle Khellaf is a great teacher",
    "Standard, run-of-the-mill intro to Latin prose course. If you've taken AP Latin in high school, expect more of the same.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, only advising them to make sure they practice their Latin daily if not going into the course with an already solid foundation of the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although the class can be challenging depending on your mastery of Latin, I found the course very rewarding. My Latin greatly improved and I left the course feeling excited about the study of the Classics. Kyle is also a fantastic instructor who really cares about his students.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn intermediate level Latin but may be rusty on some concepts. This class is still taught mostly at a sentential, philological level, so it is very manageable and interesting, and doesn't go too fast. But the material is interesting and challenging enough to demand your attention and to stimulate you.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students wanting to continue taking Latin from high school. It is nicely paced and covers a good amount of grammar review.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in learning Latin this was a great class."
