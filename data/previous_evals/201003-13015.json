   "comments": [
    "Take this class! You will learn so much french, although you should be ready for the heavy workload.",
    "A great class. It was laid out very well, with vocab, grammar and oral in every test. The books were fun and increasingly challenging and the movies were a good supplement. Wynant was great, she helped us alot in talking and our accents. She was always ready for class and came with many different exercises to keep us excited. By the end of the semester, i was always excited to come to class.",
    "Basic overview of everything. Start from the beginning but moves pretty fast.",
    "L3 is either your last stop to fulfill your language requirement (or the first stop on the L3-L4 route), or your middle course on the way to fluency. Either way, you have to take it to get to what you're aiming for. It's not that bad of a course.",
    "In this class you will read French books and watch French movies. It is a French course, and some of the time is dedicated to studying the language itself, but more importantly it is about doing other things in the French language. I would recommend this course. It will help your French and it will most likely increase your appreciation for French as well.",
    "I would suggest the class to a student who's interested in French, with perhaps more speaking experience than I had and a moderate grasp of French grammar. I would suggest the class to someone with a flexible schedule, someone whose other classes didn't require much outside reading and big time commitments.",
    "French 130 is a really interesting class that you meet with your instructor and your peers every day, and just talks freely about the books you've read and the movies you've seen, in French of course. It has offered me great opportunity to practice speaking French as well as good reviews of important grammars. The class is so fun that it doesn't feel intense to meet every day. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A great course overall. Conversational skills will greatly improve, especially if you're coming from the L1-L2 sequence. It has reasonable tests, and you get to read some great books along the way, including L'etranger. You must keep up with the seemingly tedious (but not that long) homework assigned everyday to do well."
