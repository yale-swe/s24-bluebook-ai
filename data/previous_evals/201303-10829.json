   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the course in you are a Japanese learner.",
    "If you have taken Japanese at Yale, this class might seem like a waste afterwards. Although the readings are fun and the teachers are great, I definitely didn't feel like my Japanese improved all that much compared to previous semesters. By itself however, 150 is still a great class and I highly recommend it to incoming freshman or people new to the Japanese department at Yale. It's definitely one of the best language departments here.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to continue learning Japanese. The professors are helpful, the material is interesting and not too intense, and you'll definitely feel a sense of improvement when it's done",
    "Great for improving reading and writing skills because this class focuses on authentic materials written in Japanese. Lots of kanji learning. Speaking isn't not as emphasized as it was in L1- L4 classes, but of course, there is still some speaking practice.",
    "I was placed into this class as a freshman so I can't comment on how it feels coming out of L4, but personally I found the class challenging enough while certainly very manageable. I didn't notice how much my Japanese was improving until the end of the semester, but I definitely learned a ton of kanji and vocab. I took the class at 9am and Ster and Maruyama senseis made it a very enjoyable start to the day."
