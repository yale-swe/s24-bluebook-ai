Of course, I like to teach myself things when possible, so the course format was great for me. I'd imagine other people might feel a little lost by the lack of structure. Also, the inclusion of GEE and QGIS was great, as it gives me more marketable skills, and because ArcGIS won't be a complete monopoly forever (I hope).",

    "Don't be afraid if you haven't taken any programming courses before--the course is flexible and accommodating for a range of students. Project focused, so it's helpful to brainstorm some ideas for projects you might want to pursue earlier in the course rather than later! Dana is always great. Take any\/all of his courses if you are interested in GIS\/mapping\/spatial analysis.",
    "If you would like some exposure to programming, and\/or have a particular interest in GIS programming, this is a very useful course. Although I had very little programming experience coming in, I believe this course could be useful to programmers of all levels as well."
