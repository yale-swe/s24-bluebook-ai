    "DS History& Politics is a really rewarding class. Of all the DS classes you will take, it has the most arduous workload, but you will be pleased you read all the texts. Professor Smith is an excellent DS section leader, and if you are able to get into his section, you are very lucky. He makes history interesting and helps students go beyond the individual texts to make intertextual connections. If you do all the reading, you will be extremely glad you did so. The best advice I can give regarding the DS program is that it takes a specific type of person who really has a passion for the study of Western thought. If you aren't really excited about the program, you are very likely to be miserable in it.",
    "Directed Studies is worth it if the idea of a classical education appeals to you and you're okay with doing a fair bit of writing. I highly recommend it if you fit that bill.",
    "In Prof Smith's class, we had really interesting discussions all the time. The problem was that we talked about what we thought about the text's theses. We never actually went over the arguments themselves. It sometimes felt like we were supposed to be able to pick out the vital excerpts ourselves, and this sometimes got difficult. But again, a really interesting section to go to, all the time.",
    "This was an excellent course in which I learned a lot more than I expected about what it means to be a citizen today. The reading is either heavy on narrative or heavy on thoughts (and sometimes both at the same time) which can either be a blessing or a curse depending on what you prefer. Overall, the History and Political Thought section of DS falls right in between the Literature and Philosophy sections with its alternating emphasis on stories and characters and also larger questions\/author's arguments. To me, it seemed like a watered down in between of the two courses although equally useful.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "A lot of work...only try directed studies if you're sure you can handle it and the people in these classes. The students are hardworking and often seem to have background knowledge so it may be a bit daunting at first but it's really not that bad. Overall I would recommend the course as long as the student is aware of the work it entails.",
    "DS 1st semester was a great introduction to some of the most important HP texts: Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, etc. Readings could be very long and tedious, but usually pretty entertaining. Lectures sometimes were bland--but could have been because of Friday morning time. Smith was a wonderful section leader--great opportunity to have discussions with such a well respected professor in a small, intimate and casual environment."
