   "comments": [
    "How to think critically about the future direction of medicine, and how that future has been shaped by the past; how to evaluate the ways in which fiction can be more indicative of the biomedical truths than research",
    "I learned how to think about past and current perspectives on biomedical futures (and biomedical \"discomforts\") in a really interesting way--through science fiction in the 20th and 21st century.",
    "Interdisciplinary thinking!",
    "This course has taught me how to be comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. It has definitely pushed me to think more creatively and open my mind to a myriad of possibilities. Through looking at science fiction novels, it has taught me to think of possible biomedical futures by looking at the past.",
    "An ability to ask critical and bioethical questions surrounding technological and medical advances. Also an ability to read science fiction through an analytical lens and understand how it relates to biomedical and bioethical questions and advancement. Absolutely FASCINATING course - one of the best I have taken at Yale!",
    "This was without a doubt my favorite class of Yale so far (and I'm in my senior year!) It has taught me to more critically engage with the science fiction material I consume, but done so in a way that ENHANCES my enjoyment of the material, which is rare in my experience.",
    "The class provided many opportunities to think critically about science and technology, especially the notion of progress. The use of science fiction acted as a great foil for reality, and the analytical practice was extremely transferrable. The breadth of the course, in topic and application, was amazing, and the final project allowed for an analysis in depth.",
    "This course really helped me understand the relationship between science fiction and the developing biomedical field. It was really interesting to see how sometimes it's fiction that affects real life and sometimes it's real life that affects fiction. Through this course, I was able to look at the medical sphere through a new light, one that included larger themes of de-extinction, playing god, time travel, etc... It was an incredibly interesting course with even better group discussion. Furthermore, I learned how different types of subjective prose can work with literature and these fundamentally scientific ideas.",
    "I really appreciate how the course treated science fiction as a high literary art form from which we can glean key insights into the fields of biology, technology, and medicine. Before taking the class, I'm not sure I had the same appreciation that I do now to that type of literature. I think one of the most important takeaways that I got from the class is that science isn't always objective and empirical - it is a human enterprise that is subject to human flaws and biases. I think anybody could benefit from taking a critical look at how the future has been perceived by those in the past, because it might inform how we interpret the present and where human society is heading.",
    "I learned how to question the assumptions I had been living by and to challenge these social norms that are taken for granted. I learned to imagine the future and understand how the act of creating the futures we wish to see can help to bring about futures we want to live in. I learned how to connect my everyday and the issues around us with science fiction. I learned how to connect works of fiction into intellectual and scientific debate."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: A fun weekly seminar filled with brilliant people of various academic backgrounds, this class was augmented by Professor Radin's super cool reading selection. I loved the discussion-based aspect of the course; sometimes we'd discuss purely the novel and the readings for that week, but she wasn't afraid to let the discussion just run with whatever topic we were most interested in. We ended up deviating way into left field some days, and talking about our favorite biomedical movies\/what would happen if Black Mirror happened in real life, stuff like that Weaknesses: The class is two hours long, which can sometimes stretch out; it's hard to do all the readings, especially if what we mainly focus on is the novel (different from the readings)",
    "Firstly, I LOVED this class. It underwent an amazing evolution as people in the seminar got comfortable with each other, and Prof. Radin was an AMAZING facilitator of that. She made everyone feel comfortable, posed interesting questions, and was amenable to going on whatever tangent the discussion prompted. A strength was the cohesion of the class, and the comfortable atmosphere I mentioned--it made classes so enjoyable and easy to contribute to. Honestly, the only possible weakness was one inherent to the genre of science fiction as a whole: a relative lack of female-driven\/oriented reading material. It wasn't absent, however--a few assigned books touched on issues of gender, but in general it's an anticipated problem that you'd encounter when reading 20th-century sci-fi. Nicely, this was offset by Radin's acknowledgement and specifically facilitated discussion in seminar--ensuring the discrepancy was as minimalized as reasonable.",
    "This course was excellent, with the caveat that if it were taught by anyone other than Professor Radin it might've been a mess. Professor Radin treated us like mature adults and didn't school us on exactly what she expected from a response. For students that haven't taken very many humanities courses, this could be a bit too *much* freedom. I wasn't always sure through what lens I should examine the texts to be most useful for contributing in seminar. I think some sample prompts could help students respond constructively, but I know that narrow prompts can stifle the kind of interdisciplinary thinking that this class promotes. The coursework was fantastic, both books and their affiliated nonfiction readings. Group work was particularly engaging. I wish there was more of it, particularly in the beginning of the semester.",
    "Its honestly all great!! I wouldnt change a thing. It was such an immersive experience, our class got extremely close and I really felt as though we were going through the enlightening experience together.",
    "The readings are fantastic, but the supplementary ones can get to be a bit tedious and long. The greatest strength of the course is undoubtedly Professor Radin herself. She is one of the most genuinely funny and caring professors I have had the honor of crossing paths with at this university.",
    "The class was very well organized, with clear themes and topics for each week's discussion. The science fiction readings were always interesting, and new to me for the most part, but were complemented well by the non-fiction reading assignments. Prof. Radin led a very interesting discussion, with clear (and innovative) methods and goals for each discussion, while also always engaging with our thoughts as a class and wanting to follow directions that interested us. The final project was another great point, as it provided an opportunity to work through nearly any medium to explore a concept or application from the class in depth.",
    "This course really only has strengths. It's engaging, interesting, fun, and makes students really think outside the box. There was never a day I didn't want to come to class, and to me, that is the biggest indicator of the strength of a class. The material was exciting, and utilized the perfect mix of current and past literature, as well as fiction and non-fiction, to help us understand the lessons and really inspire our own ideas. The only weakness i'd comment on was that I felt that, at points, there was too much reading. On top of a book a week, there were many long articles, and I found it very difficult, with other classes' work, to get through everything thoroughly in a way where I felt prepared to talk about it in class.",
    "The course is strong all around. It is incredibly well organized and well taught. I really loved the end-of-semester \"biomedical futures fair\" where we all got to discuss our final projects. The only suggestion I might have is allot more course time to group discussion because I really enjoyed being able to hear from fellow classmates.",
    "Strengths: Prof Radin - phenomenal, so invested, fantastic seminar leader, the diversity of books read, discussions are varied - sometimes group exercises and creative little projects, weakly reading responses, scope to be creative."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course. It was the highlight of my semester.",
    "YES. A MILLION TIMES, YES. Radin is singular and truly amazing--she reads every weekly response, responds to it in full, and is able to remember\/reference people's previous thoughts and responses in class. Her attention and enthusiasm are infectious, and I absolutely loved her encouragement to expand our creativity when making our final project--it pushed me to a venture I would've been too scared to try otherwise, and it ended up so rewarding and entertaining. I became so close with people in the class, and it was so apparent how close we'd gotten by the end. The reading material is generally well-chosen and I CANNOT recommend this class highly enough. If you can get in, TAKE IT. One of my favorite classes ever.",
    "Yes! This is that \"interdisciplinary education\" that Yale promised in its admissions pamphlets. Professor Radin encourages takes on the readings that aren't necessarily \"history-y\". The coursework is extensive but a lot of fun. So there's that. Block off plenty of time to read each week! The exact amount varies week by week but it is always substantial. Even then, a lot of it is fun science fiction and can feel like a study break more than classwork. Some of the best insights into the readings in classes sounded kind of like \"shower thoughts,\" so letting yourself relax and not overanalyzing the readings in-the-moment is important. On a related note, the weekly reflections are low-key (about a page) but don't expect specific guidance. Professor Radin is enthusiastically interested in YOUR thoughts and feelings, whatever they may be. This is way harder than it sounds. Professor Radin clearly cares a lot about her students, and it shows. She knows each person in the class individually rather than as a collective. You can get away with shrinking into the background, but don't do it. It's not a scary classroom environment. Good luck getting in, though... Take the \"application\" at the beginning of the semester seriously!",
    "ABSOLUTELY!!! This course was by far the best class I've taken at Yale. The weekly novel and discussions were incredible and Professor Radin does an incredible job of engaging everyone and making the class so exciting.",
    "YES!!!!! If you are an HSHM major this is THE seminar to take!!!! Good luck getting in as a non-major but if you have the ability to take it you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD! Prof Radin is beyond fantastic, not only is she brilliant and a clear expert in the material she teaches but she also takes individual stock in every single one of her students. Try and have a sit down with her at some point if you can - she gives the most unbelieveavle academic and life advice :)",
    "Without a doubt. I would take this class again if I could just to see what new materials she comes up with in future semesters. Take it if you get the opportunity.",
    "A must-take. Professor Radin is fabulous. She has such interesting ideas with which she really wants you to engage, on notions of progress and scientific advancement. For example, who benefits from Google's offer to freeze the eggs of female employees? And what would the difference be, culturally as well as professionally, if they offered comprehensive maternity leave instead? The class uses science fiction to get you talking about questions like this, and does a great job of generating earnest discussion. It's a lot of reading, but you will want to do all of it, as it is so interesting.",
    "YES! BEST COURSE I'VE TAKEN AT YALE!!",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone at Yale. The material is fascinating and relevant, especially to all those interested in innovation and automation in medicine (but really, who wouldn't want to take a \"history of the future class\"??? It's so cool!). The readings are fun and thought-provoking, and best of all, Professor Radin is phenomenal. She is invested in each one of her students and always strives to make class a welcoming environment. If you're looking for a wonderful learning experience, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Absolutely! Fantastic class. Even if you're not that into science fiction, as I was, the ideas that are drawn out are so relevant to today and Prof. Radin has an incredible ability to connect some wacky ideas to our present and make them relevant. Overall not a lot of work, but be prepared to read...1 book every week."
