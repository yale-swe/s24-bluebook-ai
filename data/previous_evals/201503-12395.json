    "I cannot recommend this class more highly. Here's my unbelievable tale of what happened: For the first 3 weeks of MATH 350 with Professor Auel, I felt like I was being hazed. We began the class with *absurd* problem sets that were roughly 20 pages of single-spaced typeset math. Seriously, it made the greek life rites of passage here seem like the little schoolboy play that we all know frats really are. Asher eventually cooled his jets and started dividing problems into \"starred problems\" (the ones you have to do) and \"non-starred problems\" (haha). At this point all the wanna-be math majors but really applied math majors had already dropped like flies, and we had a group $G$ of students that was tough as nails (i.e., pretty dank). The cool part was that $G$ was a cyclic group, with generator $AsherAuel$ which means that Asher touched the soul of each and every element $student$ in the group $G$. Next we considered a ring $\\mathfrak{R}$, which has a whole 'nother operation we haven't even talked about. This new binary operation which would really change the game is called \"Noah-plication\", and happens when the generator brings his son to class on the day we get our midterms back. That's right, $AsherAuel$ brings this kid to class and he's super cute, and we start to realize that not only is Asher super chill and good at math, but he's *normal*, which is a critical property of professors that turns out to be rare (a subgroup $P$ of the group of all mathematics professors $\\mathfrak{P}$ is \"normal\" if $P$ can interact with your average person and not get mapped into the group $\\overline{P}$, the group of \"psychopaths\"). Indeed, Asher is a great guy and he guided us through this tough journey that is learning abstract algebra. We accomplished a lot, got put through a lot, and came out as more legit people. Hats off to Asher Auel for a job well done.",
    "My attitude to this class changed all the time: I started the course with cold hostility to this seemingly incomprehensible material, and I finished with the feeling of unconditional love to groups, rings, modules, and all the other cool stuff we did. It is a great class covering a very interesting material that I would definitely recommend to any math, physics, chemistry, or comp-sci major. But prepare to work super hard. It is the hardest class I have taken, and psets often too me 15-20 hours a week. It is not the class for people who want to spend college on frat parties but for those who are genuinely interested in the material and who don't mind feeling miserable every week while doing the pset. Be prepared to suffer a bit, but take it, it is definitely worth it! Especially with Auel who breaks all records of awesomeness.",
    "You should take it, and soon. It's INTRO to abstract algebra. Do this early on in your yale career so you can explore the really cool classes later.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. Professor Auel is a wonderful lecturer, and very helpful and generous at providing help. He's most likely one of, if not the best, professors in the math department. Homework was incredibly long at the beginning, but he recognized that and shortened them. Though I'm not sure how people really measure how many hours homework take, if I had to put a number on it, I would say they took about 5-10 hours depending on the week. The quizzes were mainly true\/false, but they were very rushed (about 10 T\/F in 20 mins at the end of class) because you also had to explain your answer. The midterm to me seemed incredibly rushed (choose 4 out of 5 nontrivial, though not terribly difficult, problems, each having 2 parts, in 50 minutes). I did alright, and no doubt a fair amount of others did perfectly fine as well, but I just think that, pedagogically, a math course should err on having more time for assessments than less. But all in all, great course!",
    "Every math major has to take this class, and it's definitely worth it. The material is pretty interesting, and totally different from analysis; basically you will know if you want to take this class. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who didn't have a strong background in math, because everyone else will know what's going on and you'll be lost. But if you're a math major, take it for sure.",
    "A good math class. Take it.",
    "It is a must have course when you start to learn abstract algebra with no background.",
    "Great course. It was a lot of work, especially at the beginning when the first two problem sets took almost 20 hours each. Then, the workload became slightly more reasonable. Even with that it was a great class, highly recommended.",
    "Lectures are engaging, entertaining, and informative. Problem sets are very long with high difficulty. 350 makes 230 seem like applied math; the material is very abstract. I recommend taking a math class with intermediate abstraction like 235 before jumping into 350 from 231 or 225. Math majors or students interested in theoretical math should absolutely take this class before graduation, but taking it too early is a mistake.",
    "Look, I took this Credit\/D and I'm extremely glad I did because I really don't think I would have done particularly well. That being said, it's not an easy Credit\/D. There is a A LOT of work. I did learn a lot, but at the expense of countless hours of my life. So... just keep that in mind.",
    "This is a wonderful course. Although the material is very abstract and has the potential to be very confusing, Asher does a very good job of explaining it and making things clear. The material is probably the most beautiful stuff I've studied, and I've loved this course. I would highly recommend this course. It is challenging and work intensive, so if you're not prepared to spend hours on it, then don't take it. If you've taken 230\/231, don't be intimidated, it's a similar load.",
    "A lot of material and a lot of work but very rewarding",
    "This class is very difficult. You should know what you are getting into when you take it. Math 350 is definitely a step or two up from Math 230\/201. The problem sets take a long time, the material is relatively simple and understandable however there is so, so, so much material that you learn in this class so everything seems confusing until you really take the time to internalize the theorems and definitions, and even the solutions to the homework problems. That being said we accomplished a ton in that classed and proved a multitude of theorems and got our foot into a major central branch of mathematics. You should only take this class if you consider yourself smart and like mathematics. Asher Auel is a really nice teacher and it was fun to be taught by him.",
    "You will learn algebra. You WILL learn algebra. However, learning algebra comes at a price. That price is 15-20 hours of your week spent on problem sets and studying. Professor Auel is seriously the best. He is a professor who truly cares about his students and the topic he is teaching.",
    "The class was roughly split into three parts, talking about groups, rings and modules respectively. Each part built on the previous part, and it was rewarding to look back at the end of the semester and see how everything ties in together. The class is filled mainly with math majors, with a big group coming in from 230\/231, but there were a couple of upperclassmen as well, mainly math majors who didn't take the 230\/231 track. I took this class coming from an Econ\/Math background, and it was challenging in terms of rigor, but still a rewarding class nevertheless.",
    "A great introduction to Abstract Algebra (Auelgebra) taught by the amazing Professor Auel. I will try, but do not think I can, decouple the professor and the course for you. Material- Fundamentals of group theory through ring theory and module theory, emerging from this class I feel as though I have a much better grasp of the whole of the structure of math. This is what truly excites me. I think there was not a more important course for me to have taken in my mathematics career. Grades- very much a proof-based math class for math majors, lots of fun problems, applications, examples, and lemmas to play with in your copious amounts of spare time. I thought all tests were fair and were generally far more applied than home work. Workload is significant, but if you prioritize this class, it will be well worth it. Professor- lectures great and engaging, fast-paced but always exciting. Very good notional understanding of the motivation behind the math. Extremely clear, open, and giving of his time. Amazing office hours.",
    "A solid introductory evaluation of group theory, ring theory, and a bit of module theory at the end.",
    "Basically a must take (literally so for math majors). The psets are long and challenging (as are the quizzes and exams...) but grading is fair. Pacing is a little wonky, particularly after Thanksgiving break, but the material is fascinating and Prof. Auel is extraordinary.",
    "Take it!",
    "Do it if you love algebra, or not a bad class to credit\/D if you want to understand fundamentals of group theory, but don't care about ring theory that much and have more important things to do",
    "Great course on a fundamental topic in Math. Math majors will tend to love it.",
    "Abstract Algebra is one of my favorite classes so far! It's a very beautiful subject that is thought extremely well. The problem sets are challenging and illuminating, but they do take a somewhat long time to complete, even if you do understand the concept. Everybody who has interest in math should take this class.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you want a serious math undertaking and are willing to put in the requisite work, which is no small task. Great way to get a really great intro to group and ring theory, with a glimpse at modules and beyond.",
    "I have a few different thoughts on this course. On one hand, if you really want to learn algebra, it can be great. The material was well taught, and asher is a wonderful person and an insightful instructor. However, ultimately I could not recommend it due to the sheer amount of work. Each week the problem sets were an adventure and I usually spent a majority of all the work I did all week (between other classes and jobs) working on these problem sets. It is definitely a good way to learn, however, as someone who did not necessarily want to devote that amount of time it was quite a burden. Additionally, it was not really true that the homework made you understand the material better. True, to a certain extent it did, but we could have done 1\/2 as much homework and still learned the material just as well (if not better, since we would have had time to think about it more). Just be aware in taking this class that you are committing your semester to it, and if that is not something you want to do then I would look elsewhere for courses.",
    "It's a wonderful, beautiful course!",
    "If this class is being taught by Professor Auel and you love math, then take it. He's a great professor, and makes the class really interesting. However, be prepared for very difficult material and a lot of work. The PSets got shorter as the semester went on, but it was still at least like 10 hours per week. If the professor isn't very good, keep in mind that the material is very difficult and without a good professor, you may not be able to grasp it on your own.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is very essential.",
    "I absolutely recommend. 1. It's a staple course for mathematics at the undergraduate level. 2. Asher Auel is the best professor in the department by a margin and perhaps in the country.",
    "I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. As you probably know, the material is challenging but also interesting and important. I thought Professor Auels lectures were very clear and engaging, and I found him to be very approachable and good with questions as well. At the beginning of the semester, the workload was definitely excessive, but after the first couple weeks, Professor Auels decision to designate particular problems for grading definitely made the workload more reasonable. Tests (midterm and final) and three quizzes throughout the course were generally reasonable as well. If youre interested in learning abstract algebra, Id recommend it.",
    "Two words. Professor Auel. Thats all you need to know. Hes a gifted Gibbs professor, algebra is his field of specialty, and abstract algebra was his favorite course as an undergraduate. All of this was evident in every single lecture. As a bonus, the course load was reasonable and exams and quizzes were firm but fair. I recommend you take it with him while you can.",
    "A crash course in groups, rings, and modules that really delves deep into all of these topics. Its very interesting and challenging. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in higher level mathematics.",
    "Solid foundational course in abstract algebra. Important to take, and unless you have taken another solid foundational course worth taking even if you are familiar with the material."
