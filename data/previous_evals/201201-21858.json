   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it! Even to non history people.",
    "Definitely take this class! You learn a lot about the road to the French Revolution, you get to read some great plays and speeches and watch good movies, and there's only a midterm, a paper and a final! There's a LOT of reading though. Be prepared.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for an interesting lecture and a pre-industrial credit. The lecture is really easy to listen to and section is painless. There is a lot of reading but the exams are straightforward.",
    "This is an amazing class. Professor Walton is a great lecturer. If you have any interest n history you will not be disappointed in this class. It was not too much work. Some readings are necessary, but definitely not all of them, use your discretion to figure out which is which.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the French Revolution. It's a pretty good course, but if you're not interested in France or European history, it's definitely not for you.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, it is very focused on about 150 years of history and you really see the development of ideas and movements in that time. It is a lot of reading and more work than I expected, but the readings are interesting and Professor Walton is great.",
    "Not really. Its a solid class. There are better history classes out there.If you're really fascinated by the period Go for it by all means.It's not a bad class. I wouldn't tell people NOT to take it but rather, given the strength of the history department, there are better places to go.",
    "Great course to learn about French history. The readings are also very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it. Great class, lot of fun, great lectures.",
    "A solid overview of French history from the Old Regime through the Revolution. Pretty standard history lecture with weekly sections. This is a really cool time in history so you can't go wrong whether you're a history major or not.",
    "Great class if you want to know about early modern Europe. I found this period very relevant to my other classes on American Revolution and Soviet Revolution. This class really taught me a lot.",
    "This class was very interesting in explaining the workings of Old Regime and Pre-revolutionary France, as well as how they contributed to the revolution. Professor Walton is a great lecturer, and while the reading load is heavy at times, it's definitely manageable if you're not taking any other reading-heavy courses. All in all, I would recommend this course to any history buff.",
    "Great history lecture, although I didn't connect as much, personally, with the material on Enlightenment precepts and culture. I wish we'd spent more time on the revolution itself. Lots of reading, but you can skim through the primary texts depending on who your TA is. Tests were straightforward and the professor (who's just great!) gives you a list of possible questions in advance.",
    "Great introduction to Old-Regime France\/ the revolution.Lectures are pretty engaging and easy to follow, and while the workload is a bit higher than some history lectures, the content is on balance more interesting and easy to work through.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. In fact, this class was the best class that I have taken at Yale (I am writing this at the end of sophomore year). If you are even remotely interested in the subject I would recommend that you take it. The syllabus has great readings, and the class does not have too much work.",
    "Yes! Everyone should have some knowledge about the French Revolution, and Professor Walton makes this class very accessible to all majors. He balances history texts with literature, and also does movie screenings (they were pretty good actually). In terms of grades, it's pretty easy to do well in this class if you just mostly keep up with the readings&go to lecture. He distributes study guides for the midterm\/ final that are EXTREMELY helpful and really help to focus your studying. The paper is not bad either (gives a list of topics.)",
    "I would recommend it if the student was very interested because there is a lot of reading involved. It was basically a lecture course devoted to seventeenth and eighteenth century France. I found it very interesting, but I could see someone who was not very into the topic to get bored easily during lecture. The readings are also very interesting, but again if you are simply not interested in the topic, there's not much that this course will do for you. It's a very independently-driven course: you'll get what you put in.",
    "HIST 274 is a general look at the various factors of French culture that led to the French Revolution. It spans from the age of kings through the reign of Napoleon, looking at all the different things that affected society and forced a change. Professor Walton is extremely knowledgeable and I think his passion for the subject makes the class worth taking.",
    "This was a great class, particularly a great one for former DS students interested in this period. It combines a study of culture, sociology, literature, political thought, and history to gain a very nuanced and thorough understanding of this important historical period. Walton's lectures are very informative and entertaining, and beyond the reading (which is significant) there are not many assignments. Take the class - you will learn a lot!"
