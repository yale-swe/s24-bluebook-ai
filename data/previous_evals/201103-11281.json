   "comments": [
    "The expectations need to be managed a little better, which will come as the course evolves and greater upfront organization is possible. Assignments frequently changed and were often not given in their final form until close to the due date\/time.",
    "I was absolutely appalled by the work ethic of the architecture students I was paired up with this semester. For each of the three class projects, I was paired with architecture students who quite frankly, didn't give a shit about the project we were supposed to be working on. I don't know if it was because they were busy with other assignments for classes they valued more, or if they simply didn't care. My partners from the architecture school would not respond to emails, not show up to planned meetings (even though we made them at the architecture school so that they would show up), not include ideas that were discussed previously in the group, and not complete designs until the night before the assignment was due (this was probably the most frustrating aspect because it made the entire group look unprepared and unprofessional). I have worked with students from a variety of other graduate schools on campus and I can honestly say that working with architecture students has been the most disrespectful and aggravating group of students I have ever worked with.The class always felt disorganized. There were several classes where readings would be assigned but then we would not discuss them in class. Time management was a huge problem in this class. If you want students to keep presentations to a certain time limit then abide by that time limit. Some groups would go way over the time limit, which meant that later groups would have to rush or be forced to stay after class in order to give their presentations and get feedback. It would have also been helpful if explicit project guidelines and expectations were sent out earlier to students.",
    "Creating activities which demand more interdisciplinary cooperation as opposed to divisible tasks.",
    "Communication about assignments\/expectations was sometimes a bit tardy, but I didn't mind that we altered the syllabus a bit once we got into the meat of the course. The reason for the change of plan was to get the most out of our final project, which I thought went great."

    "This course was very important to my academic interests. I am glad I took it but I am not sure if I would recommend it to others.",
    "This was an interesting court, but probably more valuable for a future architect or city planner than a policymaker. There were elements that could certainly be useful, but the majority of the work is centered around design and diagrams, which are the purview of architecture students.",
    "I wish to specialize in Urban Design and this course opened a new perspective of combining scientific experimentation in the design process, but I feel we could have learned more about implementation and execution.",

Having class in the Architecture school, working with my teammates on projects that brought us all into their studio was a great crash course in the process and workstyles they operate with. This class represented for me the maximum value of an interdisciplinary masters degree (the MEM, in my case) in terms of challenging my comfort zone and diving into another field for one semester."

   "question_text": "If yes, what were the advantages and disadvantages of the group work?",
   "comments": [
    "Great for students from different schools to work together. The project design does lean too heavily on the architects to production and imaging skills, though.",
    "The group structure of combining architecture students with the others was fantastic. Not only was it essential to producing a quality project, but it offered a window into a discipline I would have otherwise had little real knowledge of in terms of how that type of work is done.",
    "Advantages = working with students who have a knowledge of different tools, and who have very different perspectives - which was so intriguing!Disadvantages = being paired up with architecture students who did not care about assignments and who were not willing to meet F&ES students half way. I felt totally disrespected and helpless because I couldn't actually do the designs myself - I had to just wait until my architecture teammates felt like completing the designs (which in each of the three groups I was in, was the day before\/at the last minute).",
    "Advantages were interacting with other disciplines, disadvantages working around completely different academic schedules and priorities.",
    "Tons of value for the effort put into the group work in this class. We definitely discovered the language barriers and differences in style between scientists and designers, which often felt like a headache, but keeping in mind that this was a large goal of the course kept me sane and I'm glad I took the class.",
    "This course is all about collaboration between scientists and designers. The group work went surprisingly well, given this pairing."

    "Be ready to work heavily with aesthetic design concepts. If you are creative or at all artistically inclined this will be enjoyable.",
    "Do not take this class. It may look good in theory, but it will be the most aggravating and frustrating class because of group work with architecture students who are not committed to the class and who are not team players. The ideas and discussions in the class are incredibly interesting, but not worth the headache and heartbreak from the group projects.",
    "The course reading are useful for the final paper.",
    "Be patient with the special difficulties inherent in trying to collaborate with students from the other schools. Remember to interrupt each other to ask for translations of jargon. Seize the opportunity to visit the other school and get a sense for it."
