   "comments": [
    "Yea, I highly recommend this course to other students. It is excellent.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is planning on doing any sort of computational work. The methods taught in the course may not be the most cutting edge techniques, but the underlying concepts are very useful and applicable at more involved levels of computation.",
    "It is an overview of numerical techniques for solving a number of basic differential equations. The class provides a good framework for how to deal with practical problems of many different types. I would definitely recommend the class, with the caveat that it takes a substantial amount of time outside of class.",
    "Yes, this course will be extremely useful for anyone working with numerical methods. Just the experience of going through the course and trying the homeworks will greatly improve the abilities of the student.",
    "Definitely I will recommend this course to a fellow student. This course is really useful, and can greatly improve your understanding of most commonly used numerical approaches, and can greatly help you to put these methods in practice.",
    "Of course I will recommend this course to my friends. After this semester, I benefited much from this course and what I have learned in class help me a lot in my research.",
    "I would recommend it for the course material and because of how much I learned. I greatly improved my programming skills. However, it is very time consuming and should not be taken if time is an issue.",
    "I would definitely recommend Engineering&Applied Science 748 01 to a fellow student whose work involves applied numerical methods in some extent. The course workload is high, but if hard work and effort are put into the course, one can gain much knowledge from the course. The course covers many useful topics and the instructor is very organized, thorough and clear."

   "comments": [
    "I will do modeling work as my future research. So this course deepens my background about numerical computation methods and is of great help for my later research.",
    "This course helped me most in terms of programming basic problems that can be expanded and applied to my research.",
    "Numerical methods are a daily part of my life as a graduate student. This course is extremely useful for my research.",
    "My research is mainly focused on the numerical simulation of various combustion phenomenons. This course as well as ENAS 747a Applied Numerical Methods I have greatly improved my knowledge of numerical methods, have effectively deepen my knowledge of my discipline, and have effectively contributed to my research.",
    "My future will involve lots of numerical modeling, the basic techniques of which have already been covered in this class, so it contributes much to my research.",
    "Assuming that I will need to program at some point in myresearch, this course was very useful in teaching me the skill set to do so.",
    "Prior to taking Engineering&Applied Science 748 01, I had limited computer programming experience as I had never taken a course that involved extensive computer programming. By taking the course, I had improved my computer programming skills and learned some efficient algorithms and basic theory of some numerical methods. The material I have learned in taking Engineering&Applied Science 748 01 will be very useful in my research."
