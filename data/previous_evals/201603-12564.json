    "A new ability to contextualize Egyptian religion in a larger historical context",
    "I really felt like this course enabled me to see the world from the perspective of people living in a very different time and place.",
    "I came into the course completely ignorant to anything about Egyptian culture. Mostly due to the teaching style of the professor I am exiting with a pretty good basic understanding of the culture and religion of the Egyptians. The class material is interesting but the professor really made the class what it was. Learning about Egyptian religion really helped me to reflect and learn more about my own. Even if one has no ties to Egyptian religion, the class is still very beneficial and interesting.",
    "I knew next to nothing about Egyptian Religion before. Now I know more.",
    "I learned a lot about Ancient Egyptian Religion."

    "Interesting course with manageable workload. Prof. Darnell really wants students to do well.",
    "Material was well organized and lecture was stimulating; the syllabus could have been more thorough in outlining the course materials",
    "I like how the class has the intimacy of a seminar but the structure of a lecture.",
    "Great course, wonderful and enthusiastic professor.",
    "The professor was very approachable with questions and gave avid answers. If there was ever an issue within the class it was quickly solved to everyone's comfortabillty. A weakness was that the course didn't get to cover everything in the syllabus.",
    "Darnell is a super enthusiastic lecturer and knows TONS about the material. Literally took the class just because of how animated he was on the first day. Also, the subject itself is super niche and often bizarre which helps to keep things interesting. One weakness I'd identify is that for me at least, it could be hard to synthesize all the information that was coming at us, especially when JD would go off on a tangent in class and I'd lose track of what time period we were talking about or even what country we were in. To him, it was all basic stuff. I think the class could've benefitted from some \"checking in\" moments to talk about the development of certain themes over time, etc. or just to identify which info was most important to remember. The essays were good for that, in a way. But I was definitely surprised during the midterm when we had to know so much specific information about the readings.",
    "This course was great because it emphasized themes instead of memorizing facts."

    "Yes, if you are a student of history or just interested in egypt",

    "Yes, I would. The class is very engaging and gets the students to really invest in the material. The other students that I talked to in class never dreaded going to class. It is a fun class that is also intellectually challenging.",
    "Yep! Honestly when else are you going to take a class on Ancient Egyptian Religion?? And even if its hard to parse through sometimes, JD just wants you to succeed. If you don't take this class, at least one take one of his others.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material was fascinating, and Professor Darnell is incredible."
