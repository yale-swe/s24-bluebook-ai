    "The Global Affairs Capstone Project is unlike anything you will complete for any other major. You are in fact consulting a real client, creating a solution for a real-world problem. Extremely challenging, yes, but also immensely gratifying project.",
    "Basically the success or failure of a capstone as I understand it is directly related to how much effort the advisor puts in. I encourage next year's class to look more carefully at the advisors and how they plan to structure the course than at the actual subject matter. As someone who did not receive their first or even second choice, I can not stress this enough. Many capstones had absentee advisors who did not plan syllabi or even attend class (they were skyped in). This had a negative effect on the morale of participating students. When the project starts getting tough and you need someone to keep thegroup focused and productive, a good advisor should know how to motivate the team.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student. It was a fantastic experience with group work, travel, and the opportunity to be published. I loved getting to know Professor Graham and my classmates, and I learned so much about cybersecurity, government, and myself. It's great to put on your resume or to talk about at interviews, but it is more than that. It is an experience like no other.",
    "Probably the best class I have taken at Yale. This class was far more than a class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it was an experience. The mission of our class, putting together our final joint paper, presented a challenge unlike any I've faced before. The complexity of the issue demanded that we talk and analyze and debate and investigate and repeat and repeat. I've heard that other capstones were rather mechanical, but this was just the opposite. It required high level strategic thinking and incredible teamwork. Members of the the class poured countless hours into the joint paper because they were incredibly invested in it, even though an hour spent on the joint paper would likely yield a worse payoff in terms of their GPA then an hour spent on another class. And it was totally worth it. We gained experience that will really help us in the real world. I think the entire class is proud of what we eventually accomplished. Professor Graham is awesome. His ideas are always insightful and precise. He did well to allow us to take ownership of the discussion and the project as a whole, while still guiding us to make sure we were moving in the right direction. So happy I ended up in his capstone."
