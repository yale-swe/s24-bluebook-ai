    "Good class to understand the broad differences in approach to thinking about and doing social science.",
    "Yes. Because the readings are great and it's a good space to be thinking about why we are doing what we are doing and how we should be doing it.",
    "Essential introduction to philosophical questions that all political scientists should be aware of.",
    "This is a very good course for anyone who is going to be a social scientist - while I don't think most of us will think of these concepts every day, they are strongly worth knowing as at least baseline knowledge, and may help improve a student's work for the future.",
    "A must take course for social scientists and political philosophers. It bridges the disciplines in a great way. Firstly by having people of the different subfields represented and expressing their opinions about their own research philosophy. Secondly by having interesting readings that present different points of view."

   "comments": [
    "I have a broad frame of reference within which I can place my research interests.",
    "I think it was helpful in two ways. Learning about the history of the discipline and its evolution helps take a more critical and realist stance on the substantive and methodological developments that are happening in the discipline today. Second, the course was of greta practical use for research because it helped determine which problems one should be most concerned about, and how one should approach one's research interests and questions. So my answer to both questions is yes.",
    "It helped me understand and compare a number of approaches to explanation, progress within a field, and causal inference. I'd say that while I won't be writing my thesis on these topics, they are going to influence how I approach my thesis, and how I defend my choices of question and approach to answering the question."
