   "comments": [
    "Take it! You learn some interesting and sobering realities about Latin America during the Cold War. It's not very high stress and is a great gateway into Latin American studies",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot. The seminar does a really great job of engaging with the \"long cold war\" throughout Latin America, starting with an overview of revolution theory before progressing through case studies in Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia. You really get an appreciation for the forces that drove the revolutionary situations of 20th century Latin America, which upon close examination often do not fit the traditional East-West Cold War narrative. Professor Joseph is just the sweetest professor: kind, caring, and he strikes a great balance between letting discussion happen and interjecting with his takes\/views on the topics at hand.",
    "Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Take this course! You will engage with material that you may not have ever seen or thought about before. It's a privilege to learn from Professor Joseph, who truly cares about all the students in his class. Discussions are always lively and the professor does a great job putting together a diverse body of students in the class. Highly recommended!",
    "HIST 372J introduced me to a string of American interventions and actions in Latin America that I had never been exposed to, in part (I came to realise) because of my public school education in the U.S., and in part because, as Prof. Joseph emphasizes throughout the term, historians of the Cold War often tell history from a Western perspective. The course began to correct my ignorance on these matters. The journals are incredibly rewarding, and although there is a lot of reading, it's all great. Read everything and watch all the films!",
    "INCREDIBLE class, incredible readings, Professor Joseph is amazing. An absolute must-take if you can get in!",
    "A true gem, and undoubtedly one of the best History seminars at Yale. HIST372 is why you came to Yale: the professor is the best in his field, and totally dedicated to his small class of students. The class surveys Latin America during the Cold War, and examines revolutionary changes throughout the period. The assigned readings are excellent. Professor Joseph selects the most relevant pieces - from Playboy interviews of Sandinista guerillas to important historical essays on the subjects. However, getting in to this class is nearly impossible so don't get your hopes up. But if you can get in, get pumped because the class will change your life and remind you why Yale College can be so dope.",
    "Generally each week looks at a different case study, centered on a different country or revolutionary movement in Latin America.",
    "I totally recommend it! Everyone should learn more about Latin America, especially during this time period, and Gilbert Joseph is the man to teach you.",
    "This was a phenomenal course taught by a great professor. It is so apparent that Professor Joseph knows and loves teaching this course. He gives each of his students individual attention--and it does not go unnoticed! The material is fascinating and he presents it in a clear and concise way. In many ways, it is a survey course (you cover many different countries and conflicts), but it is also discussion-based so keep that in mind. I'd certainly recommend taking this course or anything else with Professor Joseph.",
    "Definitely! I learned so much about such an interesting region. I really don't think there are enough classes at Yale which focus on Latin America, but this one hits the nail on the head. Sometimes the reading was a lot but it was all so interesting that it was worth it. If you can get in, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Best history class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Interesting look at the intersection of Latin American and Cold War histories! Worth it if you're interested in either or America's interventionism in the mid 20th century. This course is really about what you make out of it you definitely can get a lot out of it if you put a lot into the readings and research for your paper. Good seminar discussions and provoking readings, although structure of each class is a bit challenging since students are asked to do presentations, which often run overtime and eat into discussion time. Take it if you want a great introduction to modern Latin American history with a great professor and great discussions",
    "Great seminar. Good overview of Latin America in the Cold War period through focusing on a number of case studies. Professor Joseph facilitated great discussions and pushed students to develop their ideas."
