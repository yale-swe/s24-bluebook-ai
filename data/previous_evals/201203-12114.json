   "comments": [
    "It's a interesting course for anyone interested in biology. I also think it is doable for people who don't have much of a science background.",
    "I would say take the course if you are interested in the topic, or if you have to.",
    "Most people really disliked this course, but I found it rather enjoyable overall. All of the information is just very USEFUL, if not interesting. The exams are doable if you know your stuff, and you can write your paper on almost anything (I used it as an opportunity to write about something I'd never really thought about, and learned a lot in the process). Section is overall rather useless and very obnoxious, but a necessary evil apparently (if only to do the cemetery lab). You're probably taking this because you have to anyways, but goin with an open mind!",
    "Okay. Take it if you have to. Or are really interested in Ecology. It has more math than you might expect, but it's basically algebra.",
    "E&EB 220 is a manageable course that will provide you with a pretty good foundation in ecological concepts. Grading is quite distributed among two midterms, an 8 to 12-page paper, some shorter assignments, the final, and class participation, which is fair, and the research paper can actually be an enriching experience so long as you give yourself time to actually research for it (as is always the case). I would go so far as to recommend this course to non-science majors looking for a more legitimate science credit that, though requiring work, isn't overwhelming. It should be noted that the final was strikingly different from the midterms in that it was far more qualitative, which reflected the less textbook-based material that came up after the second midterm.",
    "If you're an E&EB\/EVST major you've got to take it, and as far as required courses go, it's not too bad. As everyone always says, it's a little mathy, occasionally dry, and sometimes fun and engaging. There's not too much work, but the second midterm in particular was rough, and the final paper is challenging (but as interesting as you want it to be). Overall, it's a fine course, and you'll learn some good stuff, but it's nothing terribly special.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to for your major. However, this is still a very worthwhile class. It's more mathematics-based than qualitative (especially early in the semester--later in the term, it becomes much more broad). The two-professor format has both positives and negatives; both were good, but it required a bit of a change in approach\/mindset. Also, midterms are fair in terms of difficulty, but are difficult to complete in the time allotted -- you may find yourself rushing to finish the exams.",
    "This class is interesting. There is some math, but it's not very hard. In fact, the math makes what we're learning seem more legit. There are 2 problem sets, 2 exams, a paper, and a final. I'm not an EEB or EVST major, but I enjoyed the class and learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this if people are truly committed to learning about the math and science of ecology rather than just looking at pictures and talking about nature. This is a very theoretical course, based on models that may or may not truly describe the way ecosystems function as a whole. As long as a student understands that, I would say that this is an informative and useful course.",
    "This is a good course. The final was really difficult and unexpected, but I think that's because it's usually a take-home exam. Other than that, good teachers and good information.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The material is interesting, relevant, and even inspiring at times. The professors present the material very clearly, and are very eager to help. The grading is fair and transparent. The syllabus is incredibly organized. This is perhaps the perfect Yale course.",
    "I would recommend it if you must take this class for your major. Otherwise, avoid it.",
    "I would say it was a good class and would recommend it to another student. It wasn't one of my favorite classes, but definitely a good class.",
    "Interesting, informative, not too difficult - recommended if you want to learn about ecology, painless if you need it for the major. Be aware that this is a math-based course.",
    "Great intro to mathematical modeling in ecology. Definitely does expand your perspective on ecological phenomena.",
    "I felt like this class was really important for me, as an E&EB major. I did learn a lot, but I also think such topics could be taught in a much more engaging manner. Of all the E&EB classes I have taken, and loved, this figures in the lower rung. Do not take this unless you have to.",
    "I took this as the first step in (maybe) becoming an E&EB major, for which it is required, although many (perhaps most) are EVST majors. If you are not afraid of relatively simple math (tedious algebra and occasional concepts from calculus, like the relationship between a function and its derivative) then the math that people seem to complain about is not an issue. Profs. Post and Vasseur have different teaching styles, but both are fine. Not much help is given for the paper, which is due just after Thanksgiving with a first draft due sooner. It is unclear what is expected or what makes a good topic; supposedly it must be an original synthesis, but it really seems to be a literature review in which you must attempt to go beyond what you can legitimately say without doing more studies. There also wasn't much help in reviewing for exams (two midterms and a final, which was not take-home as planned), and they were graded harshly. Still, I don't know how else you would get into an E&EB major and as far as I know it's a taste of the department. The professors liberally sprinkle their lectures with examples from their research, which can be interesting.",
    "This course will give you a great foundation in the field and help you to better understand current environmental issues.",
    "I would only recommend this class if a person is really interested in ecology. This class will not be easy and should not be taken lightly.",
    "It was very mathy.If you go in understanding that, you'll be fine.The paper is slightly useless and asks for you to write a paper based on the synthesis of other papers, on something that is \"new.\" Kind of difficult, especially considering that it is assumed that you are researching something that you know little about...I and others found it kind of petty and not all that useful.",
    "Many students take this course because it is required for the EEB or EVST major or more advanced classes within those departments.",
    "General Ecology was a really interesting course, but more math-heavy than I expected going into it. The math is by no means difficult, just be prepared. I would definitely recommend the course for students planning to major in E&EB and for students interested in ecology or environmental science.",
    "I went into this class expecting the worst, and actually it was pretty good! If you're interested in ecology, definitely take the class. The models are pretty easy and at least for me helped elucidate broader ecological concepts. Overall, a great introduction to ecology. The only drawback is the paper, which is universally acknowledged to be a bummer. But I'd still recommend the course.",
    "Stay away. Unless you have to take it, in which case, sucks for you. Post and Vasseur aren't great lecturers. The book is a much clearer resource. Problem sets are annoying. Tests are crammed with questions. Paper has peer review, which will probably be useless unless you actually get someone intelligent\/with time to spare. Derek is a good TA. It's not necessary to read all the supplemental papers, unless you are terribly bored and would like to lull yourself to sleep. Take the class with friends so you'll have someone to laugh with at the profs\/commiserate with over the idiotic assignments.",
    "I expected -- and would have really enjoyed -- far a more qualitative version of this class. Indeed, when we did learn about qualitative ideas (e.g., ecology and climate change, human population growth), I thought this class worked well.But I felt that the torrent of quantitative information was imparted far too quickly and poorly. Often a couple slides would appear with a set of complicated equations representing very unintuitive concepts...but I felt that the professors would simply discuss it for a minute and quickly move on, without taking the time to really help us understand it. I understand that they were trying to teach us as much as possible in the time allotted, but frankly I feel that is a recipe for poor teaching. I admit freely that I should have done readings before class, and that this might have made the professors' explanations clearer. However, the readings themselves were often hard to understand. More problem sets are very necessary, despite the hassle (we only had two), because without psets, the quantitative concepts\/formulas are hard to grasp (at least that was the case for me).That said, both professors seemed genuinely interested and even excited about what they do, which I very much appreciated -- sometimes that is lacking in courses at Yale.",
    "I think that this is an interesting course to take even if you're not an E&EB major...I think that students in many disciplines can benefit. With Profs. Post and Vasseur, the course was absolutely wonderful...and it was one of those courses that I didn't expect to be as awesome as it was.I strongly recommend this course to any student who's interested in the general subject area.",
    "The disappointment I felt with this class was palpable. While I am the first to admit that ecology is not my favorite subject, the instruction in EEB 220 did little to convince me it should be. Was it the blithe examples that were intellectually deadening? Was it the painfully boring sections that did nothing to help the class? Or was it the fact that the essay assignment was tedious and added nothing? Yes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in fact, it was an unholy trinity. The highlights of the class were the modeling and mathematics due to the (relative) rigor with which they were studied. But it baffles me that the rest of the subjects were treated in the shallowest and bluntest ways possible. For example: having to sit through a lecture which tediously listed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifferent types of biomes\u00e2\u0080\u009d almost induced an aneurysm. But perhaps the most infuriating and mind-boggling part of this course were the less-than-useless sections. Half the time the TA didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how the assignment for section was to work. The other half, the discussion was superficial and contributed nothing. When you spend 30+ minutes struggling to set up a mathematica presentation, it ceases to be instruction and starts to be the ritual I used to go through with my grandparents to set up their VCR. On the whole, this course was rarely gripping, often tedious, and reliably dull.",
    "very qualitative, more learning about mathematical models and the discipline of ecology, than learning anything particularly about the ultimate subject matter of ecology (ecosystems) itself. lots of examples about lakes and the microorganisms that reside within them. killer, not very focused research paper at the end of the class, along with 2 midterms, a lab, a problem set and a final exam. wouldn't recommend unless you have to take the class for your major (there are more interesting science credits out there).",
    "I read the evaluations saying not to take the class if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to, and I chose not to trust them. I thought that, because I always liked math, modeling ecological phenomena would be an exciting application, and taking a \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d science class would be a better way to fulfill my science distribution. I still think taking a real science class makes sense, but this was not the one to take. Somehow, despite engaging with an interesting set of questions in a very interesting field, this course failed to fascinate. The studies that Post and Vasseur talk about as examples seem genuinely interesting, but each was treated so briefly thatit was hard to really engage with, and the focus was instead placed on learning how to do simple model calculations and understanding concepts (all of which makes sense for an intro course). Neither professor is a poor lecturer (and I liked having the two switch off), but the lectures certainly did not keep you on the edge of your seat.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad to have written a research paper for a science class (sorting through scientific literature was a worthwhile experience), but the assignment was somewhat strange (make a scientific argument that draws together two ecological concepts, based on data from a number of different studies), and it did not end up being a real chance for intellectual exploration."
