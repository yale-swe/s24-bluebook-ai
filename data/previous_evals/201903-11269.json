   "comments": [
    "The most significant skill I learned in this class was the skill of perseverance. I found this class very challenging and it was often hard to motivate myself when I felt like I could never get a good grasp on the subject. However, this course taught me to take advantage of all my resources (such as office hours and peer tutoring) and through these things I also learned how to more effectively time-manage. My most important takeaways will be my ability to stick with a problem for a long time until I am able to understand it, while recognizing that I will need help from others along the way.",
    "Developed strong foundation in MVC.",
    "I learnt a lot of interesting concepts in math, developed an art of solving and critically thinking, built further understanding in Calculus.",
    "This class will teach you the basics of multi variable functions and the associated calculus, but not without some pain along the way. Although Sudesh has greatly improved the course since becoming lead instructor, it still feels a bit disorganized and lacks good instructors across the board.",
    "Problem solving skills",
    "I gained a solid foundation in multivariable calculus that could be applied to many fields.",
    "I learned many functions of multivariable calculus, whether it be double and triple integrals, or vector functions. There wasn't much conceptual learning that happened, since the course is mostly focused on memorizing a formula and when to use it.",
    "I had had some experience with Multivariable calculus in high school but hadn't really learned much, but this class really taught me multi and I do feel like I have a solid ground in it now!",
    "Multivariable calculus - double and triple integrals, vector fields, theorems",
    "I learned multivariable calculus, including line integrals, vector line integrals, double integrals, surface integrals, flux integrals, and triple integrals.",
    "I developed an understanding of calculus of multiple variables and some of the cool applications to physics and engineering.",
    "Learned multivariable calculus, line integrals.",
    "This course is extremely important and useful to anyone in the physical sciences and engineering. Many of the concepts covered in the first half of the course (multivariable functions, partial derivatives, Lagrange multipliers and optimization, etc.) are applicable to many other fields (most STEM fields, economics, etc.). The second half of the course is more directed at integration in multiple variables and various integrals over curves and surfaces and those subjects are extremely applicable to physics specifically. MATH 120 was especially good (in my section at least) in pushing people to fully understand the concepts that were presented and understanding the edge cases of when you can and cannot apply certain formulas and identities.",
    "Vector and linear integrals over 3D space.",
    "I developed my knowledge of multivariable calculus, and my conceptual understanding of 3d space"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of content covered in this course, which is both good and bad. At the end of this course, it is nice to say that you have fully learned multivariable calculus. However, I am not sure how much I will be able to confirm that statement because of the very fast pace of the course which I felt made it impossible (for me) to fully understand the content. I felt like I was always struggling to keep my head above water because of how we covered several topics in each lecture with no chance to review.",
    "Problem sets are good, but teaching is not consistent among professors.",
    "I think the class was great, with great review sessions and tons of resources to practice from. My only concern was it could have more applications, which would make the class more insightful.",
    "This course could benefit from more professional development for the instructors. It seems as if the majority of them do not know how to teach undergraduates. Also, the peer tutors often seemed unable to help. They would just look at the problem sets rather than explaining the underlying concepts.",
    "Difficult but rewarding course",
    "I personally thought it was a very well-taught math course, but increasing attendance to lectures could be a point of improvement.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is very straight forward. The weakness is that everything happens so quickly and is barely covered. While this is likely a function of being a college math course, it is still something that could be improved on through extra discussion sections where the homework or other material could be reviewed.",
    "Strengths: very streamlined and organized Weaknesses: pretty fast-paced but that's because they have to go through a lot of material",
    "Strengths - taught multivariable calculus in a straightforward manner Weaknesses - not particularly well taught with two exams only (and a final)",
    "I really like math, so I thought the stuff we were learning was interesting. However, I think it would have been a lot more interesting if the course had focused more on delving into the properties of the theorems we learned about. I understand that it's an introduction, but I personally was hoping for a more in-depth course.",
    "My strengths involved vector math my weaknesses were figuring out what theorem needs to be applied in what situation.",
    "I feel like the course went at uneven speeds where sometimes easy material was covered very slowly while difficult material was glossed over.",
    "I think that the course does move very fast if you have not had any experience in multivariable calculus before. There are many times when an underlying explanation of a concept is left unexplained (and a sort-of \"blackbox\" is left as an explanation) and that seems to leave people shaky on those topics specifically. Those may be hard to remedy because of how much content is put into the time allotted but I think that one thing that would help the course would be to move a bit faster in the beginning and slower through the second half of the term.",
    "The course moves very fast and covers an impressive number of concepts and theorems. The final review sessions were extremely helpful. The only weakness is that the problem sets each week are not necessarily explained and are rather long in general.",
    "strengths were the amount of study and practice material provided. the weakness was the volume of material"

   "comments": [
    "Tentatively-yes. If you are very confident in your math ability and have for sure at least taken Calculus BC in high school, you should consider this course. If you have not, stay away from this course for now. Also, make sure you are interested in math before enrolling (by no means do you have to be a math major though). This course greatly challenged me in many ways, but if you will be determined to persevere even when the class flies through content incredibly quickly, you will do a lot better. If you are on the fence, consider the workload of your other courses because this course took up a lot of my time and I often felt emotionally and mentally drained from the demands of this course.",
    "Yes, it is good for developing a strong foundation of the topics.",
    "Yes, as it builds a solid foundation in calculus.",
    "Yes. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "Yes, as it provides a good introduction to the topics it covers.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who needs to take it. The material itself isn't bad, however the fact that 90% of the grade is determined from three tests is definitely unfortunate. But the workload isn't too bad, so it isn't a bad choice of a class.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who enjoy math or if they need it for their major or to take other classes. It was a good class but perhaps not the most interesting or engaging so it may be best to take it if you truly like the subject matter or need it as a requirement.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in this particular subject or need it as a requirement",
    "I would recommend it to another student who likes math and who understands math easily. The topics are covered very quickly, so I found it very important to stay alert during class and make sure I understood everything as I went.",
    "Yes because I think understanding multivariable calculus gives you new perspective on the world.",
    "Its a prerequisite for a lot of majors, so you dont really have a choice. Its not a bad course, but it can be difficult for students with weaker math backgrounds. For people who are worried, I suggest shopping a lower level math course as well.",
    "Only if it is required",
    "I think that if you are trying to major in a physical sciences\/engineering major, this course is very useful and should definitely be taken. Outside of that, I think that if you have an interest in furthering your skills in calculus, problem solving, or just are interested in the subject, the course is a good fit. If you are looking for a gut course or a QR credit that you don't have to work at very much, this course is probably not the best for you.",
    "I would say for those who just want to take it for fun, the material itself has rather limited applicability to majors other than maths\/physics\/engineering.",
    "yes i would. I value the conceptual understanding that i gained in taking the course"
