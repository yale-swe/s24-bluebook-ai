   "comments": [
    "Yes. good class. however, its easy to get behind on reading",
    "Take it! It is a great way to read all of the literary greats. The pace is a little fast, but you can get by without reading some of the books. Workload is totally manageable.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn some classic American literature in interesting contexts.",
    "Great class, definitely take it",
    "It's a lot of reading, but it's really the only way I could force myself to read these books (which I've been wanting to read forever.) Lecture can be dry, section is really dependent upon your TA. Workload is only rough because of the quantity of books you gotta read; papers are super open ended and the exam is only worth 20%. I'd say take it, but mostly for the content of the literature.",
    "Good English lecture class. Great class to take Cr\/D. Section was rough because of a bad TA, so try to shop around. Take it for the reading list.",
    "Great books but weirdly taught without any eye to context - the syllabus was wonderful in terms of the particular readings, but I didn't leave the class with any clear idea as to why one would read \"Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner\" as a group in particular.Terrible lectures - frustratingly basic coverage, lots of slipshod background, and almost no actual interpretation. Felt like a 6th-grade Language Arts class at times. Yes, we realize that there are lots of colors in The Great Gatsby - but you're a world-class scholar, couldn't you give us some kind of interpretation??Lots of nonmajors and taught at a VERY introductory level - English majors should avoid this one. Take it for the reading list maybe, but don't expect anything from your peers or professor.",
    "Great reading list, good lectures, terrible section. If the TF's improve in the future, I would definitely recommend it. Only take this class if you are drawn to the reading and plan to complete it, as that was the most rewarding part of the course.",
    "Really great way of understanding the historical context of these works. I would recommend this class to an english major who is looking to achieve a coherent understanding of american literature of the early 20th century, or even a curios non major who is excited about reading the books and wants some guidance.",
    "Great class. Took this class as a non-english major and really enjoyed it. Great authors, and Wai Chee is da bomb.",
    "Good class on American lit with authors that you should know.",
    "The texts, if you know yourself to like one or all of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner, are well worth your while. Lectures can sometimes be insightful, sometimes less than illuminating. This might be more telling of general sentiment: out of an estimated 80-100 students in this class, lecture attendance to dip down to as low at 30. However, those that do attend lecture are quick to reference Professor Dimock's ideas in section.",
    "Overall, Engl 289 is a good course--it's a great and painless way to fulfill the American literature requirement of the English major. Dimock's lectures are generally interesting and thoughtful; the lectures do have a tendency to run over (this is a problem if you have to get to your next class quickly!). Section was generally laid-back. The readings are great, the reading list is phenomenal. The only issue is finishing all the books, especially if you're in other reading-intensive English classes. Most of the books are 300 pages, but a few others are 400\/500 and it can be a struggle to finish them.",
    "Most of the readings for this class were really really good. Went into it wanting to read Fitzgerald (and kind of liking Hemingway), but Faulkner turned out to be really fantastic too! But be warned: there is a LOT of reading, and most of the people in my section weren't doing most of it. Start it Cr\/D maybe",
    "English 289 includes several works by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner as well as some other relevant and connected readings. The class analyzes each work but also looks at connections between works and authors. You read a book every one or two weeks. It is a lot of reading but definitely worth it.",
    "This course was not good from the lecture perspective, but the reading, of course, was excellent. I don't think I learned much in lecture at all. The arguments advanced in the lecture slides were often not at the crux of the works at all; they more traced a motif through a novel. I did not understand the books in any deeper way because of the lectures. Also, all the lectures were the same exact format. We never once did a close analysis of a passage or anything other than macro-readings of the novels.This is worth taking -- I look back on it pretty fondly already, but lecture was bad. I went to all of them and didn't pay attention much, just because the readings advanced in the slides seemed so trivial and peripheral.",
    "Superb reading list, solid lectures, excellent discussion sections. If you like the authors, absolutely take it.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student looking for an engaging writing course and interested in great American novels. The class goes very deep in the works of Hemingway, Faulkner, and Fitzgerald and taught me a lot about perspective.",
    "Take this as an American Studies class, not an English one. Although you'll do a lot of close reading, it will open your eyes to the period, not necessarily to the text. Professor Dimock's close reading style focuses on aspects like cinematic depiction and mapping, which can be abstruse at first, but if you just accept that it's a lecture and you'll be dissecting the text in section, it can be fun.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to english majors, and non english majors who are willing to read a pretty large stack of books. This is the most interesting lecture class I have taken at Yale.",
    "The reading is amazing and enjoyable. The workload isn't too bad. But the professor is awful and the lectures are weird.",
    "Interesting look into the modern american novel. If not an English major or very interested in that sort of topic, do not take the course expecting it to be easy. Although the assignments are not terribly difficult, they require a large amount of often tedious readings.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are looking to fulfill a writing credit, specifically those who hope to do so with a manageable English course. Though the class necessitated students read multiple texts (a novel per week on average, sometimes more), all of the novels were enjoyable and none were particularly unwieldy. The books are American classics, must-reads. Thus, the course was a great way to educate oneself on American culture and to become more familiar with the work of Hemingway, Faulkner, and Fitzgerald.",
    "This is a great class to take whether you've read all of these authors widely or if you've only ever read The Great Gatsby. Professor Dimock does a great job of unpacking these canonical authors and putting their work into its historical context, forcing you to read these books (many of which you probably read in high school) in a completely different light. It's a bit like AP Lit for college students, in that it's a great class to take if you've never taken an English class before. Plus, Faulkner is AMAZING and you should take it for that alone.",
    "This class is a tough call. The readings are great, and I would really encourage anyone who has even the slightest interest in literature to consider exposing themselves to some of the great american authors. However, I found that the lecture format of this class is a bit boring. Prof. Dimock is obviously brilliant, but throughout the class I found myself wondering exactly what I am supposed to take away from it. It is the same format of lecture every time, with the professor going through a slideshow and discussing the examples she has posted. Every lecture is kind of like a literary analysis paper, and while it is certainly interesting to see what the professor pulls out of the text, it didn't feel there was any skill that was being taught, or something larger to learn from the class. Honestly, if I were you, I would just read the damn books on your own and skip out on this class.",
    "These authors are amazing. Their reputations speak for themselves (and in Faulkner's case, he's even better than his reputation). I think everyone major or nonmajor should take this course to get the essentials of the best\/established American modern prose--some of the best American literature. Be aware though that it does sometimes turn into a lot of reading, as much as 250 pages in a week.",
    "Good class. Take it for the reading list. Not too terribly difficult.",
    "This is a great course that covers novels everyone should read. The overall themes of the course are interesting to discuss and analyze. I would recommend this course to a fellow student, but they should be careful about what TA they choose.",
    "This course was very much outside of my comfort zone, but I was excited about the material. If you're interested in these authors and novels, the class will be worth your time because you'll have the opportunity to discuss the novels, which makes reading these books more worthwhile. Many people apparently didn't find lecture all that necessary. I enjoyed it and found it interesting. Section was always good. Overall, I would recommend the class and am glad I took it.",
    "Yes! If you haven't read these books take it!"
