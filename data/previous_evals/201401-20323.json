    "read a bunch of important texts that are a lot more fascinating than you would expect of something written anywhere between 3000 and 500 years ago. learn how to think about those texts. its really neat to think about a city as an idea built up historically. pretty lowkey in terms of work, just a short interpretive, a midterm, and a final, all very straightforward. the reading can sometimes be a lot but youre focusing on mjaor themes so its pretty easy to get a good idea without doing all of it.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. I think it is a great class for anyone - from students with no prior background knowledge of Roman history to students that knew a lot beforehand. I finished this class feeling challenged and accomplished.",
    "Take this class. Period.",
    "TAKE IT!! Amazing class, even if you don't get to visit Rome in the summer. Beware though. There is a lot of reading and the class may very well likely fall behind the syllabus because there's just so much to talk about!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, as the subject matter is intensely interesting, there's a lot of reading but it's worth it as Professor Jewiss really makes the texts come alive, and is able to really demonstrate the importance of the texts. There are several assignments throughout the course, but for the most part they're creative in addition to testing your real understanding, so they fit the combination of being interesting as well as feeling important, instead of just busy work. There is the added bonus of the possibility of traveling to Rome, which I'm very excited for. Overall, great class, with an amazing teacher, on an extremely interesting subject."
