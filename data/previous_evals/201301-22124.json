   "comments": [
    "Good class, good material to know especially if you're doing empirical work in econ or related fields. Take it credit\/D though - things get rough when you're trying to complete the final project.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount - in two weeks more then everything I learned in 131. It is not an easy course by any means, but you learn a tremendous amount. Also the material is really interesting and useful. If you are planning on writing a thesis, taking any polysci related classes that use statistic papers, or just understanding econometrics, you must take this class. Econ 131 doesn't really teach you anything. This class will give you the capability to read almost any paper using statistics and fully understand it. Also Altonji is one of the most fabulous professors at yale and is not only brilliant but also an incredible teacher. Go to office hours and ask questions!",
    "Although I was very hesitant to take this class, I am now very grateful that I did. This course teaches you many new econometrics techniques and allows you to actually understand economic papers. This being said, be warned that this class is extremely challenging. The material is often complicated, and the problem sets are time consuming. In addition, the end of the semester is a challenge with a both a final and a lengthy final project. The professor is great, and always willing to reexplain the material. Go to office hours early, and come exam time you will be very thankful. So, if you are willing to put in the time you should DEFINITELY take this class! Despite the challenge, you will learn a lot, and feel like you actually got something valuable out of the semester!",
    "Absolutely the most useful econ course I've taken yet, but a little heavy on theory. I would certainly take it again, but be ready to work.",
    "I would recommend the course. A lot of work, definitely challenging, but the amount you get out of it is quite amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class if you are an Economics major and have done the required ECON131. It is hard and you don't NEED to take it but you do learn a lot which is not the case with ECON131 because that class only scratches the surface.",
    "Please take this class! The material is not easy but Prof Altonji teaches it with such clarity that it's be a shame if you don't learn the stuff",
    "I have mixed feelings about ECON 132. Professor Altonji is very knowledgeable about econometrics and really wants his students to learn the material. Unfortunately, he is not very good at teaching the class material. The lectures were not very interesting and the 9 AM time-slot was killer. The workload is very heavy. The problem sets are difficult and time-consuming. The empirical project at the end of the semester was time-consuming and took up most of my reading period, while both the midterm and final exam were difficult. While it may sound like I disliked the class, I do, however, feel like I learned a lot from the class in terms of learning econometrics, using Stata, and reading econometrics papers. Just know what you are getting into ahead of time. It wasn't easy by any means, but it was rewarding and I don't regret it.",
    "Definitely for any Econ major who wants to be able to understand papers in your field.",
    "A good survey of econometric methods and papers - be careful of getting lost in the deep end later in the course. There is a lot of material to learn, but if you manage to develop a big picture view of how each method fits together into a tool kit, it becomes very rewarding and (hopefully) helpful to writing a senior essay.",
    "It was a great class to introduce us to the different methods of econometric analysis and see how researchers do their work. Professor Altonji was a great strength of the class. He walked through a lot of the proofs slowly and made sure that we understood them. In general, the class was really hard, but it was fun. One way I would improve it is to actually use linear algebra to prove things, since that seems to be the normal way to prove a lot of these concepts.",
    "This class is hard. I recommend taking it if you want to do research and\/or feel like a badass. You will have to study outside of class to keep pace with the material. Psets are too long and there isn't enough feedback on them. Prof. Altonji isn't the most exciting lecturer, but he is a very good guy, approachable, and puts work into his lecture slides. Getting to 'metrics by 9am and staying awake through it became a source of pride and self-worth for me. 80% of my time\/effort this semester was allocated to this class.",
    "Definitely take it! The class is a fair amount of work, but worth it if you ever want to be able to read an economics or social sciences paper and understand it this class is a must-take. A lot of the material is technical, but you also discuss some interesting papers in class. And Professor Altonji is great!"
