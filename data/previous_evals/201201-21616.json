   "comments": [
    "YES! Shankar is an amazing professor. If you want to learn physics, learn it from him!",
    "Unlikely that if you're looking at this course you don't need it, but if this happens to be true, then YES, I highly recommend taking this course with Shankar. Workload was reasonable throughout the semester, Shankar teaches everything very well as usual, explains everything very clearly, and is always willing to answer questions. Final was tough, but midterm was not too difficult and homework was fine.",
    "402 is a pretty good class for stat mech and E&M. I enjoyed stat mech much more than the thermo stuff at the end of 401. The tests were reasonable, which was nice. If you're looking to avoid the intensive classes it's not a ton of work and a reasonable step up from the intro classes. Whether or not you enjoy the class is largely based on your interest in the topics; I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone outside of the major.",
    "I would recommend this class, for the interesting nature of the material and the quality of teaching.",
    "Definitely take this over 410 is physics doesn't come as easily to you as to some other people. Also if for nothing else, take it for Shankar, he is amazing! Fair warning however: THE FINAL IS EXTREMELY HARD.",
    "A not completely easy but totally doable class if you give it the time. I definitely learned a lot. Make sure you try all the problems yourself before going to section. That's the best way to make sure you're prepared for the final.",
    "Shankar is the one of the best lecturers ever. Take this if he's teaching it.",
    "Good course. You get to learn a bit of statistical mechanics, too! (in addition to the E&M) The midterm was pretty straightforward but the final was insanely hard! You really really have to know all the fundamental concepts inside-out in order to do well on the final. Problem sets are very reasonable weekly psets. They can be done the night before, but it's recommend that you start at least two nights prior to their due dates. Shankar is a pretty good lecturer, too, and cracks hilarious jokes from time to time.",
    "The course isn't too difficult if you go to the homework help sessions.",
    "Yep!!",
    "Important, second semester of advanced classical mechanics. Integral to a physics major. Difficult, but manageable.",
    "Shankar is a BOSS. He's tremendously dedicated and terrifically funny. He lectures the entire class without any notes, which can be a great thing in terms of fluidity, but he can sometimes get sidetracked. One of the best physics professors!",
    "I would not recommend this class. The material is a mishmash of stat mech, E&M, and some other stuff crammed in (diff eqs, tensors) and it gets very confusing. In other physics classes, I feel like the material builds on itself so you have a chance to achieve better understanding by the end of the semester. In this class, I felt like we just jumped from topic to topic without ever fully understanding it.",
    "A great course! Take it because it will help you really understand the material taught in intro physics.",
    "Second year physics! Shankhar is great, not as good as the online videos necessarily but still a lot of fun. Be wary of the exams, which can be a lot harder than the problem sets, but otherwise a very manageable course, especially if you're not going the intensive major route."
