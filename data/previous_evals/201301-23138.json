    "Boring and at times saccharine, but a good excuse to force yourself to write and get credit.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Stone is wonderful, enthusiastic, and very helpful. The assignments range from fairly standard exercises and prompts to some that are wackier and more out there. The readings tend to be short but excellent. I was exposed to a lot poetry I was not aware of but am glad to have read.",
    "If you've never formally been taught how to write poetry, this is a great place to start.",
    "If you want to take a writing class at Yale, do it. But, make sure you know what you're getting into, meaning make sure you know your professor and what he\/she likes. I loved getting the opportunity to write, but I wasn't a huge fan of a lot of reading we did in this class. Professor Stone tends to assign things that are more modern and experimental, which can be interesting but wasn't very balanced with older\/more classic poetry.",
    "I really liked this class and learned a great deal from it. I will say though that the workshop component was less useful to me than I would have liked. Nobody in my class ever wanted to be particularly critical of anyone else's work, and though this was nice and everything, I felt that we might've done each other a disservice in some way. Overall I really recommend the course though.",
    "Great readings, though not very many (might have actually preferred to have more -- but, that said, it is poetry, so of course the more time you can spend on each poem the better). Workshop experience would definitely vary class to class; Professor Stone did a good job of guiding the discussion, asking questions that opened up space for new commentary rather than questions that constricted the commentary to a certain path."
