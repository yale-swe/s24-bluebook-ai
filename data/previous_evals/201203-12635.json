    "This class was okay. Not horrible, not great. Kobena Mercer seems like a great lecturer, but that's not such a great quality to employ when teaching a seminar. Basically, imagine yourself sitting in a dark, windowless room for two hours while listening to a man lecture as he flips through photographs. Now imagine that these photographs are really profound, and the work around them is super interesting. It's a give\/take situation.As for the workload, it's a pretty chill class. A few papers and one \"seminar presentation of a text\" which is not like in section where you actually summarize the text, maybe give some background, and offer up discussion questions for the group. NOT in this class. You literally give a five minute (or less) summary of the text, and then he moves on. Great if you don't actually like leading a seminar discussion, not so great for the *class discussion* aspect.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. Although the subject material was oftentimes interesting, the nearly two-hour lecture \"seminar\" was difficult to sit through each week.",
    "Yeah, take this class if you want to learn about black photography and to think about photography's relationship to race.",
    "Take it! The material is specific, but the discussions have wide ranging implications, and Professor Mercer is wonderful.",
    "Great class. More like a mini lecture than a seminar though cuz it's not really discussion based but Prof. Kobena is so knowledgeable that you won't mind it. Hard to stay awake some time though because he dims the lights so low."
