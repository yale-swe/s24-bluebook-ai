    "If you take this class and apply yourself then your Spanish will improve dramatically. Profesora Ruano is an excellent teacher, who makes the class dynamic and exciting and really wants you to do well. Whether you are taking it for a requirement or just for fun, this is a great language class.",
    "I would, it was well-structured and helped my Spanish a bunch.",
    "Span 120 04 is a class that you will grow a lot in. I entered the class very insecure about my Spanish skills and left the class feeling like I am on my way to being fluent. I would recommend Span 120 04 to another student because the community it created in my class was enjoyable.",
    "I would strongly encourage anyone interested in Spanish to take this course because it is a fun way to gain knowledge about Latin American culture while expanding Spanish speaking skills."
