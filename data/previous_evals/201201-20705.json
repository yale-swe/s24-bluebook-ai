    "Probably one of the best chemistry courses you will ever take.",
    "Strongly recommend!",
    "Take it. It's interesting, and if you're any good at organic chemistry or even just reading literature and applying strategies, it's not too hard. You learn a lot and the assignments are reasonable.",
    "Great course. I definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It was a very good way to see what is going on the in field today It also gave students a better handle on how to look for information regarding synthesis.",
    "The course was \"a 50,000 foot survey of the field\"! It gave insight into the genesis of retrosynthetic thinking, highlighted notable total syntheses, and touched on what will probably be one of the most lucrative (appropriate word?) area in the field in a few years, whether or not you turn up your nose at DOS. I would recommend the course. It was valuable and worthwhile.",
    "Definitely would recommend it.",

    "I gained a much better grasp on not only what reactions are available for use, but what reactions are most commonly employed in complex molecule synthesis from among the myriad options.",
    "Extremely helpful in providing an overview of useful synthetic reactions. Very useful for the future. Andy was great!",
    "Although I will not directly be working on organic synthesis problems, I think every Chemistry grad student should know this material.",
    "The synthetic methods we learned in the class are endlessly helpful for my research.",
    "It really helped me understand what goes into the planning and execution of syntheses."
