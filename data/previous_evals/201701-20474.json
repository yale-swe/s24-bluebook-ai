    "In this class, I learned about the role of pathogens in the ecosystem as well as in human populations. I learned to extract the most important data in a journal article, and learned about how humans should approach dealing with pathogens.",
    "Evolution and emergence of different types of infectious diseases and the factors that affect evolution. Brought up a wide variety of topics and future issues in public health as well as in molecular biology. Was able to read and understand primary literature that used specific molecular and evolutionary biology techniques and applied them to tangible concerns of infectious diseases.",
    "Overview of how infectious diseases have evolved through history.",
    "I learned a lot about the ecological and evolutionary processes behind disease systems. I really appreciated this focus.",
    "A very fast-paced, surface level introduction to ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.",
    "I learned to think more thoroughly about interactions between different organisms and the environment."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Turner is really nice and is always up for answering questions in class! The TA Stephen is also really wonderful and was really helpful. Good teachers definitely shaped the class. Other strengths: the lectures were very organized. Weaknesses: Sometimes Prof. Turner would say more than what was on his slide (which is fine and expected) but I wouldn't catch it on time and wouldn't remember what he said, and would have trouble remembering exactly what the slide was about. Maybe also if there was a way to include the readings more in assessments? Sometimes it felt like there wasn't a big point in doing the readings because while they were really interesting and fun to read\/discuss, they weren't really tested on. Or we would only have like 5 min to talk about Spillover in class but I'd spend a few hours each week doing the readings.",
    "I think this course was structured very well. Covered a lot of different topics and went into depth in a few by reading primary literature and an enjoyable novel. In addition we were able to choose our own infectious disease to research and write a paper on. This class kept me engaged.",
    "Great intro course to science. Class is easier when you have had biology background.",
    "The final paper was unnecessarily long.",
    "This is a really well designed course. The lectures are interesting, section is actually a valuable supplement to the course, the assessments are very reasonable and manageable, and the paper project is kind of fun. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Didn't like spillover -- would've much preferred a real textbook. sometimes slides weren't helpful because too many pictures and it was unclear the extent we needed to know these specific examples vs. more general concepts. section was boring and did not like the TA's use of the socratic method. Prof. Turner very nice. Liked writing the final paper, but felt that more that 1 person should be allowed to write about a single pathogen (maybe 2 or 3 per pathogen)",
    "The class was super interesting and engaging. I think the course moved really fast so people who have never seen the material before may have a hard time understanding the topics (such as models). Perhaps you could have links to additional resources that explain specific more-difficult topics.",
    "Material is very interesting, but lectures were occasionally a bit dry.",
    "Not too bad, a good look at infectious diseases and how they affect things like agriculture, politics and research. A wide variety of issues are covered, so it's more like a survey than an in depth course.",
    "Professor Turner is a great lecturer!! Please write a textbook! That would be the one thing that would really help my understanding of the material.",
    "The strengths include interesting and relevant papers as well as easy to understand lectures. An improvement would be a greater integration or at least discussion of the book Spillover."

    "I would recommend this class! I love learning about infectious diseases and its effect on the human population (like epidemiology \/ public health) so it was really interesting to me. Readings are very light, and discussion sections are mandatory but helpful. If you're looking for a gut science I'm not really sure that this is it \/ I'm sure there are other more gutty science classes, but I'm not sure because I'm very used to taking heavy STEM classes so this class was a bit on the easier side for me. Overall not a huge commitment and was very interesting.",
    "Great class! The material was very interesting and the workload was light so you could really just enjoy learning the material.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking for an engaging and accessible science credit. As a history major, I thought the concepts were explained in a pretty straightforward way, and Professor Turner and teaching fellow Stephen Gaughran put a lot of resources online to help you review lecture material. I was surprised that most of the class seemed to be E&EB majors and not many non-STEM people looking for a science credit. If you need a science credit take this class!",
    "Yes. Learning about the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases helps bridge the gap between specifics of molecular biology of diseases and the real impacts they have of human health. If you are interested at all in public health or biology, this is a great course. Beyond that I would actually recommend it for someone with these interests to help brainstorm a possible thesis project. The class is well structured and not stressful at all. Professor Turner is great.",
    "Good course but some concepts are harder to grasp as a non science major.",
    "Pretty interesting material with a great professor. Final Paper is really long.",
    "Yes I reccomend this course. It is extremely interesting and a great science class, even without a strong science background.",
    "Absolutely would recommend--really interesting course with a very reasonable workload. Fascinating material but very manageable difficulty and work.",
    "good class if you're interested in infectious diseases and parasitology but not a hard core science person. prof. turner very nice, and not a really heavy workload. writing final paper was interesting.",
    "Really really interesting topics and engaging lectures. Could be a bit fast paced and difficult if you do not have some sort of ecology and evolution background (like from intro bio sequence). I recommend it.",
    "I would. I was also a big fan of the research paper."
