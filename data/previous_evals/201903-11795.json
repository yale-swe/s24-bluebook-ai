   "comments": [
    "The course offers plenty of opportunities to speak the language and become more comfortable with speaking and listening. However, I think the course might benefit from more regular grammatical exercises to ensure that fundamental concepts are fully mastered.",
    "Strengths: Bu Dinny is extremely passionate. We learn the language but also how the language is applied in a traditional context, as well as regional variations and dialects. The overall cultural immersion is in-depth, from arts and music and dance to film and food and fashion to religion and holidays. Weaknesses: Lack of pre-awareness of assignments. Bu has a habit of randomly assigning a big project or work with little forewarning.",
    "it is engaging and taught in a way that encourages fast learning",
    "this class really needs more organization, it was all over the place. also the prof seemed to have clear favorites, which was annoying. too much vocab to learn and annoying tests."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the class offers new challenges but is ultimately a rewarding experience.",
    "yes",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "yes I would, it is enjoyable and engaging",
    "No. This class was so bad next to Paks and much harder too - if you can avoid it, do not take it. Bu was super disorganized and often came to class with no lesson plan. She gave quite a lot of homework and THE DAY BEFORE tests she would post huge vocab lists (approx 10-15 pages, with dozens of new words we had at times never seen before), so we had to cram lots of material really last minute. Also some students were made to feel uncomfortable, because Bu forced shy people to participate in class discussions when they seemed scared or like they didnt know the answer. Moreover I really did feel like hard work (unlike with Pak) was not rewarded, but that a lot more recognition and praise was given to the people who seemed to be Bus favorites (no matter how they behaved or how good they were at indonesian). Some students would laugh or not listen when people made discussion points or did presentations, but this was never properly addressed by Bu despite it creating a bad environment. I think that if Bu put more work and structure into this class, it could be ok but as it is now it was just a very frustrating experience - this semester, it was probably the class I was most worried about and I dreaded going to it every morning. In terms of workload it was quite a big step up from L1 and L2, but also the atmosphere was bad and it often felt like hard work was basically useless. It ruined Indonesian for me and I would not take it again."
