    "The course is really fun -- I highly recommend it. You get close with your class, you learn a lot of business Japanese (how to speak on the phone, how to speak to your boss, etc) with specific set-phrases. You have daily vocab quizzes, and some reading. Not too much workload but you definitely get to practice speaking.",
    "Well worth taking if you're pretty comfortable with conversational\/colloquial Japanese.",
    "Basically the last tier of classes for Japanese at Yale. Hiroe Sensei is a kind, understanding man, and you should take this class if you are looking to improve your Business Japanese and academic Japanese.",
    "This is a fun course, and the seven of us who took it became very close over the course of the semester. Hiroe sensei is a little disorganized but he's also very passionate and reasonable. The course was a combination of keigo practice and discussion of various topics, from history to current affairs. However, grammar is not a focus of this course.",
    "The course is excellent.",
    "It's hard to summarize this class, because the topics and Japanese people we talk to change each semester, and Hiroe-sensei has students generate a list of things we'd like to discuss. What I can say is that the 9:00 time really defines this class. People often show up late (if they don't completely oversleep), and it's rare that anyone really seems ready to give it their all. Hiroe-sensei is incredibly chill, but I also found him to be a bit disorganized. We received floods of unnecessary emails, there was often ambiguity about what our homework was, and last-minute assignment changes were not uncommon. One incident comes to mind where we received an email at 6 AM on a Monday morning, asking us (with no prior warning) to submit Tuesday's homework by noon that day."
