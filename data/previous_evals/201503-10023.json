    "Glen provided great support to the course although he was largely keeping a low profile during the semester. His guidance on the study guide for the final review was invaluable. His presentations on the historical documents at Beinecke was well received and quite enlightening. Perhaps it would be possible in future courses to also allow for Glen's time to include a bit more detailed guidance on the final paper. This paper was very constrained in the sources that could be used (i.e. one fixed chapter in the Oxford textbook plus one other chapter). The area of Christian Worship is vast, and a consideration could be to spend one session with students reviewing areas of interest and potential avenues of exploration for that final paper which may extend beyond the one book as an optional alternative.",
    "Dr. Seager taught us a class in the \"Beinecke room\"at Sterling which was one of my favorites of the semester. His presentation and teaching style was thoughtful, thought-provoking, instructive, and well organized. In short, the class was a treat."
