    "I wasn't super impressed with the quality of the average research presented--I think I'd enjoy this more if we could bring in some more compelling researchers. Some of the material was presented at too low of a level for its audience, and it was kind of frustrating to sit through some of the less-interesting talks knowing that there's such a huge amount of interesting research going on in the world of health care. It'd be great to get a wider variety of guests as well--physician-researchers as well as Ph.D.'s",
