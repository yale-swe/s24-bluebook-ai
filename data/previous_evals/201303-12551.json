   "comments": [
    "English 962 01 is both a study of mass culture and Restoration theater. The Restoration theater aspect (and the mass culture around it) becomes more significant as the course goes on. The Restoration plays are also paired with modern drama so that unexpected resonances can be seen, all informing Prof. Roach's idea that the 18th century is the real start of modern drama. The total throughline of the course gets a bit muddied because there are so many moving parts, although the Restoration does come into sharp focus. Students write papers that draw on the course material but also in large part are shaped around their individual research interests.I would recommend this course to anyone, even those not interested in theater per se! Professor Roach, as I've already said, is an exemplary and creative scholar, and will change the way you think about your own scholarship and its possibilities.",
    "I would definitely recommend the seminar to a fellow student.",
    "\u00e2\u0080\u009cDrama, Performance, and Mass Culture\u00e2\u0080\u009d applied the theoretical preoccupations and practical methodologies of performance studies to the study of Restorationand eighteenth-century stage comedy as genesis of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodern\u00e2\u0080\u009d drama. In this novel pursuit, it joined students from many different programs, disciplines, and areas of expertise in substantive, mutually enlightening colloquy. It also enabled consideration of twentieth-century theory on such topics as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cculture industry\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic sphere\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a new light (Adorno& Horkheimer, Habermas, Barthes, Raymond Williams), free from the texts such theory is most often used to treat. I can imagine scholarship in an extremely wide range of disciplines and on an extremely wide range of subjects being aided by the scholar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughtful consideration of this class\u00e2\u0080\u0099s means and ends. Joe Roach is a formidable intellect, a delightful presence, an all-around inspiration.",
    "Comp Lit 914 is an enjoyable and stimulating class that will probably lead you to a (maybe undiscovered) love for 17-18th century English theater. It will challenge you to make connections between Restoration Theater and more contemporary pieces, and it will expose you to different ways of thinking about literature, performance, and their relationship to \"mass culture.\" I would certainly recommend this course!",
    "This course covers drama from the Restoration era through the 20th century, through the lens of mass culture and consumption. As a result, the variegated subject matter can nicely fit many groups of people. I had a lot of fun in this course and would recommend it to another student.",
    "You have any interest in theater at all, this is a fantastic class. Close reading of the texts plus some theory make this course a must for anyone interested in performance studies."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This helped me better understand Restoration drama, which will likely be something I will teach in theater history surveys. The study of theoretical work and modern dramas will also be helpful when I begin to teach. The course did not contribute to my research per se but did inspire me to be more imaginative and cross-disciplinary in how I do my own work.",
    "I discovered a field I was not aware of prior to the course: Performance Studies! I also found many connections between this interdisciplinary field and the Comparative Literature dissertation research that I am proposing, which aims to combine music and literary studies. This course certainly inspired me to think differently about how we study literature, and I am excited to learn more aboutPerformance Studies in relation not only to theater but also to the novel.",
    "I had a chance to delve into my own interest in the theater and research in the time period that will be very helpful for my future projects.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the field, and though many of the texts are not directly relevant to my work, I was encouraged to write a paper more directly relevant, which I appreciated greatly."
