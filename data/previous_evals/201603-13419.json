   "comments": [
    "This course offered a very different view than most art history courses, structured around themes not times. What I really appreciated is that this class developed my critical thinking skills, and provoked thoughtful discussion, which is very enriching.",
    "I learned visual analysis and research skills, as well as a lot of information about the Renaissance. I particularly enjoyed reading both primary sources and modern theories about the period, and the intellectual framework for studying Art History in the Renaissance provided by the professor was very useful and interesting.",
    "Renaissance bodies teaches student about various artistic themes about the body in early modern europe.",
    "This course was a very enjoyable overview of Renaissance art history. Professor Bass is a fantastic lecturer, and the formatting of the course topic progression and lectures was very well-done. Discussion sections took place at multiple places that I likely would not have visited outside of the course (the Cushing Center, the Beinecke reading rooms, and special request viewing at the YUAG and YCBA). The course's essay assignments helped improve my writing abilities more than I anticipated when I enrolled in the course.",
    "I developed an immense amount of knoweldge about early modern culture and art, including seminal pieces\/artists, theories, philosophies, and general history. I developed reading and comprehension skills as well.",
    "I learned how to conduct in depth visual analysis of pieces of art, while also learning valuable skills in how to communicate my thoughts in a direct and active voice,",
    "This class focused heavily on visual analysis techniques, both in section and lecture. Professor Bass and Christine both allowed for students to feel comfortable speaking about art in section and in lecture. The second paper developed research skills in art history, combining these with visual analysis.",
    "I gained invaluable knowledge about the \"alternative\" history of the Renaissance - the Northern end! At the beginning of the course, I knew nothing but classically-based Italian statuary and oil painting, which is what most survey courses cover. But by the end, I felt like my world had expanded! I learned all about the weird, wild, and unconventional art of Northern Europe in the 14th-18th centuries. Now, I feel like I can look at ~almost~ any piece from that period and place it within a rich, valuable historic tradition.",
    "I learned a great deal about the Renaissance period, specifically regarding the Northern Rebaissance and the history of anatomical representation.",
    "While I am not sure how much I will use visual analysis later on, I did learn a great deal about appreciating and studying art in general. I also liked learning history that went along with it. Throughout the semester I found myself being reminded in other contexts of course topics I had learned here. I think the biggest thing I will take away from the course is an understanding and appreciation of Yale's extensive art resources. I had never been to the art galleries or the medical history library and definitely took them for granted.",
    "I gained so much knowledge not only about the specifics of the paintings I memorized for this class but about themes and traditions, and some tools and methods for critically analyzing art. This class is divided up by subject then part of the body and then finally into a particular tradition. The final project taught fine research skills and perfected methods of critical analysis used in the first paper. Lastly, this paper wonderfully interwove historical knowledge with other forms of knowledge such as critical race theory or gender studies that informed the way the class understood depictions of subaltern bodies. I am now able to not only go into the met and recognize paintings and their historical lineage but also understand the modern implications and uses of similar principles.",
    "I learned how to analyze visual images. I've taken a lot of history and English courses, so I was very familiar with how to read and analyze texts. This course helped me do the same with visual analysis. This is the second art history course I've taken at Yale, but this so, more than the other, really focused on how to read images and make arguments based off of small artistic details. I also learned how to write about art in a compelling way. The biggest insight, however, is that Renaissance art is awesome! Previously I was pretty bored by Renaissance (especially religious) art because it had never been taught to me in such an engaging manner.",
    "This was my first art history course so I learned a lot about how to approach art history as well as information about the particular subject matter.",
    "An amazing introduction into how to write a visual analysis paper and how to think about art academically.",
    "A sense of how classical beauty ideals influenced representations of the body in the renaissance, and how classical ideals evolved and changed alongside a growing understanding of the inner workings of the human body and experimentation in medical anatomy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the only weakness of this course was that it was in the basement- after we got moved from the first week, it was a lo harder to see and hear- being able to see better as we could from the first location would have helped the rest of the semester.",
    "I loved this course and am not sure how it could be improved. The classes were incredibly interesting, the readings were very related to the week's material and never excessive, and the assignments good and well-explained. Sections were also helpful and fun; we looked at original prints and books conserved in the Beinecke and Medical History Library, among others, and the objects we studied were fascinating.",
    "The course was very well organized and extremely fun. The themes of each week were appropriate and interesting. The material was accessible to all majors. I don't have much criticism as I thought the course was great. While going to collections was fun and informative for the most part, it might be helpful to have a little more balance between discussion sections on the reading and lecture material.",
    "This class is the epitome of a lecture class that often feels like a seminar. Professor Bass is engaging in her lecturing, but excited to converse and discuss with students throughout the lesson. The workload is great super interesting readings before each class, 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. The exams are fair and students are well-prepared for it. The content is another huge strength it sits at the intersection between art, gender studies, and medicine, all under the umbrella of art history contextualized in the modern era.",
    "Fascinating material",
    "I think this course is great in its incorporation of student comments, teacher thoughts, primary sources, and critical analyses. it also made great use of the variety of resources yale has to offer.",
    "I didn't think the feedback on my paper\/midterms was particularly helpful. With the second paper, Christine and Dr. Bass' commentary seemed contradictory, which was frustrating.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely Professor Bass herself. She's on her game all the time, and demonstrates a clear passion for and familiarity with the materials we cover. She is able to make even the weirdest material totally relatable, or at the very least, compelling. I struggle to find a weakness of this course. It seems a little odd, but I would maybe have preferred to have another short paper or reading response style assignment in the semester, just so that I would be forced to approach the class's materials and synthesize in a more timely fashion.",
    "This course provides an amazing survey of artworks organized thematically. The method of presentation was fantastic and both lectures and readings were really great. The thematic lens of the course was extremely valuable in helping us analyze a wide variety of artworks.",
    "The lectures were incredibly engaging and that is why I enjoyed the class. The sections honestly did not do much for me.",
    "Overall this was an absolutely wonderful course. Professor Bass takes an interest in each of her students. She is able to interweave their academic and 'non-academic' courses to make the course material more relevant. I feel as if the first half of the course is exceptionally crafted. I came away with the knowledges needed. I also really appreciate her awareness of different learning styles; she allows students to either participate in class and section or online in forums or a combination of the two. I think that perhaps the second half of the class, particularly the last couple of lectures (specifically the anatomy classes) could use a little more fine tuning. The relationship of ideas to one another was a little less clear in these sections and I felt as if they jumped around a bit. But I really only noticed it because of how well communicated the first classes were. Overall the class is well balance between focus on participation, papers, and tests. Professor Bass even separates the stressful hour long exam question into a take home exam which I really appreciated. It definitely lowered my text anxiety for this class.",
    "This class was brilliant. I honestly can't think of a single way it could be improved. It was structured wonderfully and went at a fantastic pace. I learned more than I could have ever imagined and gained an appreciation for this type of art that will last a lifetime. It should be cross-listed in WGSS.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was without a doubt the professor, who is one of the best I have ever had at Yale. She is so clearly passionate about her subject and puts a huge amount of thought and care into each class. She genuinely cares that her students are interested and find joy in the material she is teaching.",
    "I loved this class! The lectures were great and I wouldn't change a thing about them."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course- not only is it interesting on a purely visual level, but it provokes a lot of thought and consideration, as well as challenging widely accepted views. It is not so much an art history class as a class on thought and discussion.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend it to both someone who has a lot of expertise in Art History and someone who has never taken a class in the area. This is is a fascinating, very well-taught course. It is the best class I took at Yale, and will definitely take any other class Professor Bass will teach.",
    "Yes the course is really interesting and honestly delightful. The syllabus, readings, and sections are all well thought out.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially those outside of the major considering taking an art history course. As a non-major, it was at times challenging to complete the kind of writing and analysis the course required, but feedback from Professor Bass and my teaching fellow was very helpful. Lectures are fun and interesting, and I hope I am able to take more courses similar to this one during my time at Yale.",
    "Yes! I could see this course appealing to any student with an interest in how past and modern notions and representations of the self were and are constructed. I would especially recommend this course to a student on the fence about taking an art history class it is an amazing, thought-provoking, engaging course that inspired me to consider art history as a major!",
    "Yes! Great class. This class made me realize that these modern issues of gender, sexuality etc have existed much longer than I expected",
    "10\/10 would recommend this course. Even though it's a lecture, professor bass is easily accessible and completely engaged with her students in the learning process. Interesting material as well.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone in Yale College. Professor Bass made the material very accessible even to those who had never studied art history before. She made an effort to learn each student's name, and welcomed our input in class. The images were exciting, and there was a reasonable number on each midterm. I learned a lot about Renaissance Bodies, which I feel will strengthen my studies in multiple subjects.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, not just Art History majors! It was fascinating, engaging, and totally mind-blowing. If I could only recommend one Yale course to anyone, it would be this one. RenBod made me think critically about art history, medical traditions, the body, and convention in survey-style courses. If you want a class that gives you ten times what you put in, this class is definitely it. One thing to be aware of: Professor Bass has a strict no technology rule. This was actually great for me, because I was able to engage more fully in each lecture and felt better prepared for the midterm and the final. Also, each lecture was engaging enough that I never wished I were messing around on Buzzfeed or Facebook! I would encourage anyone who considers this a dealbreaker to reconsider. There are not many classes I would have given up my laptop for. This is one of them.",
    "Absolutely! Lectures were incredible and thought provoking. The material was well-organized and the readings were inspiring. Professor Bass is amazing and extremely passionate about her subject.",
    "Yes. This is a fantastic class for both art history majors and non art history majors. Professor Bass is absolutely wonderful. This class weaves together art history knowledges with a critical look at how various otherized groups are portrayed. I really enjoyed all of the lectures and the readings are really interesting and not too overwhelming. Section is devoted to looking at source material and Professor Bass takes the time to get to know all of her students. I came away from this class with a lot of knowledge about art history. I now feel like I can walk into an art gallery and say something meaningful.",
    "One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. It focuses on the underbelly of Renaissance art - the witches, sexy drawings, dissection paintings, and body fluids while also providing an amazing foundation in art history in visual analysis. This is not the traditional Renaissance art class - it's just so so so much better. Professor Bass is the most wonderful teacher\/human being I have ever met. The class also isn't a huge amount of work - midterm, final, two short papers, and weekly readings. The sections are fantastic! Instead of just sitting in a classroom pretending you've read the readings, you take trips to the YUAG, YCBA, Medical History Library etc in order to see the incredible objects you discuss in lecture in person.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. The subject matter was interesting, lectures were engaging, and getting to look at prints\/painting first hand in section was cool.",
    "I couldn't recommend this class any more. Even if you are not interested in art\/ have never taken a history of art class - take it.",
    "RenBod is an amazing course! Professor Bass loves what she does and is so so good at it. This is a strange wonderful survey of Renaissance art through the lens of the body first the classical body, then the monstrous body, the dissected body etc... Although when I took it was listed only under art history, it really also addresses issues you'd expect to find in a WGSS or HSHM class. If you're interested in art, or interested in how classical ideals have shaped representations of the human figure across time, or interested in the birth of medicine and medical dissection, or the representation of women in art, or the representation of the disabled in art, or even think you could potentially be interested in one of those things at some point in the future, take this class!"
