    "Do not take unless you have to. The course starts out fine, but by the end, there is a lot of memorization of reaction mechanisms. The course appears to be rushed at the end and a lot of information is presented very quickly. You need to put in a lot of time before the midterms. Herzon is a decently clear lecturer, but does not seem to think it's his responsibility to teach students (explicitly stated this during lecture). Lectures need a bit more structure. Plans to cover certain material, but often ends up not getting through everything.",
    "CHEM220 is everything you'd expect from a basic science lecture class at Yale - disengaged professors, incompetent TAs, boring format, etc.. Herzon was a solid lecturer, but he basically just used lectures to outline the textbook. Yes, this is useful. But this format means that you're not going to learn organic chemistry in class; you have to do a lot of work on your own in addition. He comes across as extremely uncaring - having said, and I quote, \"My job is not to teach organic chemistry.\" He was inaccessible and incessantly reminded us not to email him; office hours were at 5pm on a Friday (which obviously no one wanted to go to). None of the TAs were competent enough to answer questions, but Nadia was pretty great at reviewing mechanisms we had studied in class during section. Take it only if you have to.",
    "I opted to take this class over Freshman Orgo because it fit better in my schedule. With Herzon as a professor, I'm not sure I'd recommend doing so because from what I've heard from classmates, 125 is a better course with a better professor. This isn't a course that people generally take because they're interested in the material, but one taken usually to fulfill premed requirements.",
    "This is usually a course to take as a pre-req for something else. It is the most work I have out into a class, but the support structures are there, the TAs want to help, and it is rewarding to finally understand it by the end. You learn a lot.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Not with Professor Herzon.It might as well have been taught by a book with a bad attitude. The TA's are not personable, and the professor said in class \"I am not here to teach you.\" The material covered is the same as in any other orgo class, but the tests were graded unnecessarily hard so the averages were 56, 51, and 26.",
    "Hardest class ever. Average for the 3rd midterm was a 26%. Hated this class but I had to take it since I'm premed.",
    "Horrible. Stay away unless you HAVE to take it. But consider it over the summer with Dr. DiMeglio because she is an angel and Seth Herzon is no where near an angel.",
    "Worst Course I've EVER taken. Lectures were useless. I didn't go to a single one and did very well in the course (just so you know I'm not answering bitterly). Seth Herzon couldn't have cared less about his students or the course, and nearly everyone was failing. The class average on the lasttest was a 26. It singlehandedly made me change my life direction away from premed. The uncurved average of all my assignments was in the 40's, and I despised my professor and TA's. There were ZERO strengths. All weaknesses. There needs to be a complete overhaul, starting with the professor and Ta's and his tests that don't even pertain to the material. I know you are taking this class because you have to for premed, but don't take it with him.",
    "Herzon makes this class impossible. When the class average is 26%, the tests were way too hard. He wants to see people fail. He won't curve anything, which is why science majors suffer from low GPAs. I put so much work into this class, and still did not see results. It was a semester of tears.",
    "It is a difficult course, and very memorization oriented.",
    "Orgo is a tough class, most people who are taking it are pre-med or chem majors anyways, so you'll have to take it no matter what. Just try to avoid taking it with Herzon and you should be able to manage the class.",
    "Organic chemistry is easier than gen chem but much more challenging, take it only if you need to.",
    "If you have to take it, takeit over the summer and take it with a light course-load.",
    "THe content is not that daunting. Just pray Seth isnt the one giving you your grade.",
    "You probably have to take this class, but if you have a better teacher than Herzon who will actually engage with the material I would recommend taking it even if you don't have to. Organic chemistry is very interesting and allows you to problem solve in a new way applying many of the concepts you learn in gen chem.",
    "No, but unfortunately as pre-med you are forced to deal with an awful class. The class needs a complete overhaul much like Physics 170, where it is tailored to a pre-med student with information that a med-school student would actually need to know, rather than just irrelevant, difficult mechanisms.",
    "Better then general chemistry for sure. Especially if you are going into biology or medicine, you can really see how the information is applicable. Herzon is a harder professor than others, and the curve is hard as well. However, his lectures are organized and you really learn and master the material if you put in the time. Definitely will prepare anyone for future Orgo or science classes.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. I think the material is very interesting and engaging, and it's certainly enjoyable for anyone who likes science, not just the pre-meds and bio-chem majors. It is a lot of memorization, and if you're not good at that,I would stay away. But if you don't mind memorization, and if you really like getting down to chemistry at the molecular level, I highly recommend the course.",
    "Chem 220 is an intro orgo course. You will learn a lot. Put the time in and really nail the basics. A great course. Seth Herzon is an awesome teacher.",
    "Chem 220 is a good overview of the basics of chemistry. Be prepared to do a lot of learning on your own to understand the concepts, but the class is very doable as long as you are willing to put in the effort. Go to lecture, he gives great notes.",
    "Take this course if you're a premed or chem major, otherwise don't bother. It's well taught but the exam and midterm are tricky. The curve is very generous, and Herzon is a good teacher. If you do take the course make sure you go to the review sessions held by the TA's before the tests because they write the exams, so a lot is revealed in those sessions.",
    "It's difficult, so be prepared to put in a good amount of time on it. I would recommend you take it only if you have to, not just for kicks..",
    "Organic Chemistry lives up to its reputation. However, if one studies hard and diligently puts time into it everyday, you will be surprised at how much you know and how much you actually might end up enjoying it. I'm afraid a lot of people are going to sound off in this box about how horrible the professor was. While it is true that the professor didn't seem as enthusiastic about teaching us as he probably should have, he is a good lecturer that gets what you need to know across to you. He is a personable guy if you get to know him outside the lecturehall and he was willing to help for at least the first part of the class.",
    "This was without a doubt the hardest and most painful class I have ever taken at Yale. The exams were absolutely ridiculous, and no matter how much I studied, it was never enough. I honestly don't know what I was missing or what I was doing wrong, but I've never had a class be so frustrating, difficult, and unrewarding.",
    "Chem 220 is a good alternative for freshman organic chemistry, and I'm actually glad I took to class over the freshman class. I would probably recommend the class for freshmen.",
    "It's much, much more difficult than general chemistry due to sheer number of reactions and material in the course. Be prepared to spend many hours with a lot of flashcards. I would recommend this course to people who are willing to put in the time and seriously want to be doctors.",
    "Chem 220 is a very challenging science course that will likely demand more than your other courses. It requires a lot of consolidation of material outside of class, and the three midterm exams are very difficult, but if you put in the time and effort ultimately this class will be extremely rewarding.I would recommend this course to any science major prepared to put in the necessary energy. Don't take this course if you want an easy science course or are looking to coast by.",
    "This is a rigorous class that covers a lot of material. If you're going to take it, decide right off the bat to commit to studying it regularly--that doesn't mean rereading, but rather doing practice problems as much as you possibly can. If you do this, you will be able to learn all the material. What makes the class hard isn't really the difficulty of the concepts; it's just a ton of material. Professor Herzon gives good lectures and follows the book closely.The only thing that makes this class \"very good\" and not \"excellent\" is that the testing was pretty wonky. Tests focused on unexpected\/seemingly unimportant topics and because they were broken up into only four questions, if you didn't know how to start one you were already down a lot of points. Even with a curve, they just didn't seem like fair assessments of our understanding. If Professor Herzon adjusts these tests, the class will be much better.",
    "Chem 220 is a rigorous course, but if you stay on top of the material it is possible to do very well. Many are probably taking this for pre-med, as I did, but trust me orgo doesn't have to be something scary, it can actually be enjoyable.",
    "Take it if you need too.",
    "A very challenging, but rewarding class overall. Tests and grading are very unforgiving, so I would recommend the course only if you are committed to studying hard. Prof. Herzon does a great job of explaining concepts, and the TAs are helpful as well. As long as you apply yourself in this class, you can potentially get a lot out of it.",
    "Let's be honest, no one takes Orgo for funsies. So, regardless of what I say in this review you'll most likely be taking the class anyway. Don't let the bad reputation Orgo has get you discouraged from the beginning. If you approach it with an open-mind at the beginning of the semester you'll find that it actually isn't that bad. Is it the world's most exciting topic? Not really. But there are parts of it that are genuinely interesting. Mechanisms can be fun (gasp) if you're into puzzle solving. Herzon is a good lecturer and obviously knows what he's doing. GO TO TUTORS, UTILIZE OUTSIDE RESOURCES. If you attempt to trudge through this class in complete solitude, you will be miserable.",
    "Where to start with this class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Something just didn't click between lectures, psets, and exams. The average of 26 on the last midterm has to say something about the course.There were weekly psets that were graded based on accuracy (5 points per pset). Three exams, all of which counted (100 points each), and a final (250 points).Professor Herzon wasn't exactly a bad professor, but between lectures, psets, and exams, things just didn't connect. His lectures made sense (though he did tend to go fairlyslowly and wasn't able to cover every topic he would set out to cover for the day), and he was organized. He wasn't very enthusiastic about it all though.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Professor Herzon is absolutely amazing. He's like the drill sergeant of Organic Chemistry - he makes you work very hard, but you come out feeling extremely satisfied and far more knowledgeable. I know that after having Professor Herzon for a semester, I actually know the material I learned in this class in an interactive, not just memorized way.",
    "Do the practice problems after each chapter. The midterms were really unpredictable... the average on the last midterm was a 25 my year. Final wasn't too bad. Class is not as horrible as people make it out to be, just don't be lazy.",
    "Chem 220 is a really hard class. Be prepared to work harder than in any class you have taken at Yale. Also be prepared for the \"pre-med mentality\" that you will encounter on a day to day basis, as the competitiveness of the class is sometimes out of hand. Don't take it with Herzon.",
    "Only take it if you have to, or have some undying love for chemistry. It's not a lot of actual homework, but it is a lot of soul-crushing hours in the library studying.",
    "The material in Chem 220 is definitely manageable. However, Seth Herzon was not.This class was extremely unfortunate. While Seth Herzon, who we heard has done remarkable research and is an extremely brilliant organic chemist, had the potential of being a very inspirational professor who could not only change the synthesis of important\/beneficial molecules but also change the way his students thought about organic chemistry. Rather than expressing his passion for organic chemistry or displaying care for his students, he treated us very unfairly. His exams were not an accurate representation of the material taught in class, but rather were \"curve-ball questions\" that left extremely well-prepared students wondering what had happened.After Hurricane Sandy, Herzon pushed the test back from Friday to the following Monday. When students emailed him to write that they would not be in class on Monday, Herzon wrote an intimidating email that stated he was moving the test back to Friday and that we were not allowed to email him any longer. We then received an email from the head TA that forbade us from contacting Herzon at all in the future if we had any questions, making him completely unapproachable. Rather, we were only allowed to contact our TA's.He then spent a majority of the following class scolding us about it is people like us (students in his organic chemistry class)that will become doctors who will prescribe the wrong drugs to their patients. He continued to say that if we are doing poorly in the class it is not his fault, not the TAs fault, but our fault, because he is \"not here to teach us\".However, Professor Herzon was infuriatingly ambiguous on how the grading for the class would work. He continuously stated that he would \"curve the class to how he saw fit,\" which questions the grade transparency in his class. How are students able to remain in his course if they are uncertain of their performance? In meetings with fellow students, Herzon indicated in a raised voice that we should not feel entitled to a curve at all, even to a B-, because he refuses to \"reward F's.\" In addition, while an outstanding number of students had dropped the course, he indicated that the grades of those students would not be included when determining the curve or the final grades for the course, essentially punishing the students who remained in the course.Many students have been extremely disappointed in Professor Herzon. He has not demonstrated any interest in helping students succeed or learning the material, often missing his Friday 5pm office hours without indicating to students that he was cancelling. Frankly, Herzon does not care about us as students, as scientists, or as members of the same Yale community, and this is very disheartening and unacceptable.",
    "Take class if necessary or very interested in organic chemistry.",
    "Orgo is a challenge! I actually liked orgo more than gen chem, though. The professor and your TA can make all the difference. Professor Herzon was very unsupportive. Try to get a good TA! Be sure to do the practice problems in the book. This course will require a LOT of out-of-lecture studying.Good luck!",
    "It's aight. The subject is pretty interesting. The textbook (Wade) is awesome, so I just read that and didn't go to lecture very often. The lecture is full of aggressive pre-meds, so there was a lot of tension with Seth, but he wasn't all that bad. He writes terrible tests that you can't really study for (which was alright with me because it meant I didn't have to waste time studying...), but he's an alright teacher. You'll make it through. Don't worry.",
    "Taking organic chemistry with Professor Herzon was a miserable exercise in almost every way. He made the midterms incredibly difficult, and as a result the averages for these tests were never above 60 percent. The average for one of the midterms was a 26, and the test had to be turned into a take home exam. Inaddition to this, he seemed to believe that the low averages were due to a lack of preparation on the class' behalf, rather than the degree of difficulty of the exams. He was also very unclear about how the grading curve for the class would be implemented. I wish Professors like this would be as appreciative as I am to be surrounded by the best undergraduate students in the country. Avoid taking organic chemistry with Professor Herzon if possible.",
    "If you need to take this class there is nothing you can do about it except to try to take it with a professor with good reviews who is clear on the grading scheme. That is NOT Herzon.",
    "This class is tough, and requires a lot of studying outside of class. It's hard to say I'd recommend the class, since most people take it because they have to take it for pre-med\/major requirements. This semester's class was a bad example, but this class generally isn't that bad.",
    "I would only recommend it if you are pursuing a career in the sciences. I actually found organic chemistry very interesting, unlike many of my classmates, so I definitely recommend it. But be ready, it is not easy and it often comes easier to some than others.",
    "Ball-buster class with a bad teacher and EXTREMELY picky TAs.",
    "No. Just no. Chem 220 was a nightmare.",
    "CHEM 220 covers crucial concepts in organic chemistry. If one wants to do well, they should practice as much as they can with as many problems that they can.",
    "Orgo really is going to be what you put into it. Lectures are only meant to outline key ideas in each chapter, with the expectation that students will take the time in section and at home to make sure they understand the concepts in depth. The topic itself is honestly more interesting than many people make it out to be, so it definitely helps to approach the course with the intention of learning the material properly, instead of as just another premed requirement. Wade's textbook is excellent to learn from - I often found myself relying on it to better understand the material.",
    "Chem 220 with Herzon is a good class. He is the best chemistry lecturer I have had at Yale yet, so if you're taking orgo because you're required to do so, I would take it with him. The problem sets are very straightforward and follow the book very well. I would recommend buying the solutions manual for the textbook; I found it very helpful when studying for the exams. I would also recommend GOING TO LECTURE. I regularly went, but I knew many people that didn't, and a lot of the small things he covers in lecture that are NOT in the textbook show up on the exams. Orgo is orgo--it's hard, but you'll get through it. Constant vigilance!",
    "Take with a different professor if you can! We didn't get through all of the material (a serious problem for continuing chem next semester and taking the MCATs), and the prof was rude and aggressive. We definitely pulled the short straw with Herzon...",
    "I would not recommend organic chemistry with Seth Herzon to anyone. Orgo is actually not a terrible subject - it's interesting if you like problem solving, but only take it if you can really dedicate 20-30 hours a week to one class and you know the professor is a good one.",
    "You're going to take this course because you have to, but that doesn't mean you have to hate it. It's actually a really cool class. The material can be challenging but that's what makes it interesting.You may not want to take it with Seth Herzon if you want to avoid te headaches. He eventually curved our class to a B\/B+ but constantly threatened to make the average a B- but he is a solid lecturer.In sum, take this course, maybe not with Herzon",
    "I would only recommend taking this course if you need it for a major.",
    "Don't take it!!!!! unless you have to.",
    "It's a lot of studying to get to know the material and the tests are challenging but it's a good class.",
    "Herzon is a mediocre instructor. His lectures are organized, but uninspiring. He clearly didn't want to teach this class. He was very unclear about grading and caused a lot of student unnecessary anxiety. Take Orgo I with him only if you have to.",
    "Wait for another professor.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Yes.",
    "Not a bad course but the tests felt built to a curve",
    "Professor Herzon was unapproachable and made it clear that he had no desire to teach or patience for questions or students with difficulty. Shortly after Hurricane Sandy, Professor Herzon moved the date of a midterm several times, creating confusion and then proceeded to lecture the class loudly, telling us that we were \"lazy\", had \"no desire to learn the material\" that the pre-meds were going to \"kill their patients\" and that it wasn't his or the TAs jobs to teach us. If you are going to take this course, you probably need it for your major or the pre-med track. If at all possible I would suggest seeking another professor or trying to wait. Overall, I found this class discouraging and found the only way to get through the material was to tackle it on my own. The second two midterms were unfair in terms of material covered.",
    "Enjoy this course. It's a great way to BOND with someone ;]Takes blood, sweat and tears but what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.xoxoGood Luck",
    "Don't take unless pre med or love chemistry. READ THE BOOK and STUDY HARD. If you want to take something away from the class\/ for personal growth, the material will not help you. Only the pain and suffering of wading through a ton of material might make you stronger.",
    "This is the worst course I have ever taken. Do not take it with Professor Herzon. He will ruin you. Be prepared to memorize (despite what your instructor tells you) reams of reactions. Beware, it actually will take over your life.",
    "I greatly believe that Orgo I depends a lot on the professor, and their approach to teaching. Thus, unless great changes are made in his teaching approach and communication with students, I would suggest not taking Orgo I with Professor Herzon. While his lectures were clear and concise, something that is easily noted during reading period, the tests often were quite unfair, especially the third midterm. With an in class average of 26%, the third midterm tested information mentioned in lecture that was not in the textbook. And even some of the information tested was mentioned perhaps in a minute of a 50 minute lecture. It was an incredibly frustrating test, that clearly did not test the proficiency of the students. In addition, student's complaints were often unheard, and attempting to express them was very inconvenient, as his office hours were on Fridays 4:30-5:30. I have no doubt of Professor Herzon's brilliance, but his expectations of himself greatly skewed his expectations of his students.",
    "Overall, I would only take this class if it is needed for you major or for the Premed track!",
    "Organic chemistry can be a very insteresting subject, as I did understand the material realtively well. Just don't take it with Seth Herzon.",
    "The course material was engaging and really valuable. You will get out a lot for this course but you have to be willing to do most of your learning outside of class.",
    "The class is very challenging, but I think individual experience with the class depends a lot on who the professor is. Organic chemistry has the potential to be a fascinating and engaging class, but it also has the potential to be a miserable class--it really just depends on which professor is teaching it.",
    "If you have to take it for premed or for your major, take it. If you go into the course with the right attitude, you will succeed. If you're taking it as a means to an end and aren't really focused on the material, you're going to do poorly.",
    "Chem 220 teaches useful, interesting things about synthesizing different organic molecules. It was not very well taught, and is a lot of work. I would not recommend taking it unless you are really interested in chemistry or biochemistry, and are willing to put in a fair amount of time.",
    "This course was as hard as expected. I know that you will read a lot of complaints as Professor Herzon and his teaching, but I really do think that he had a realistic expectation for us. Having said that, there was some disconnect between the practice problems in the textbook\/problem sets\/his lectures and the tests. The tests were obnoxiously hard compared to any of these things.Professor Herzon had very high expectations for us and those expectations would have been aligned with that of a chemistry major, but maybe not a bunch of pre-med non-chemistry majors. He was good at giving the lectures and they were entirely comprehensible, however there was just some sort of disconnect with the exams.",
    "Terrible terrible class. Do not take this class. This was easily the worst class I've ever taken. Obviously Organic Chemistry is supposed to be some sort of nightmare class to weed out the uncommitted pre-med students, but this class was absolutely unfair. I understand that pre-med and bio major students have to take this class, but I definitely would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't absolutely need to take it. And if you do need to take it, do NOT take this course with Seath Herzon. It will be a complete waste of time, you will learn nothing, and no matter how well you learn the material on your own, you will fail the impossible tests that he writes, which yield class averages of 26%. This is a ridiculous course that teaches you nothing and simply makes you miserable for a semester. Take it if you have to, but don't take it in the fall and don't take it with Herzon.",
    "only take it if you have to for a major\/premed...not a fun class",
    "NO",
    "Organic Chem I is challenging and very interesting. However, you NEED to stay on top of the material. You cannot cram tons of reactions days before the exam, especially the final exam!",
    "I don't recommend this course, though if you're reading this you probably have to take it anyway. If you can, take it over the summer. The TAs often don't seem to know what they're doing--it was ridiculous to see them make mistake after mistake during review sessions. Herzon actually isn't an awful lecturer, but his exams are completely unreasonable for the amount of time provided. When the averages on the three exams are 58, 50, and 26, you know that there's a big problem with the teaching. It's so frustrating to take a class where you know that failure is a pre-determined conclusion and you're just trying to fail less miserably than everyone around you. The final wasn't too bad, though, so maybe they're beginning to adjust....",
    "This class requires a lot of memorization. If you are incapable of that, give up on this class. Other than that, it is very fair, but very hard.",
    "Do not take unless necessary. People say Zeigler is bad but Herzon is ten fold that.",
    "Do you like chemistry? Take it, you'll learn a lot. Most of my friends who took some form of organic chemistry in high school learned a lot despite the previous class.If you're premed then you don't have much of a choice. If you're premed AND you don't like chemistry... well there's a problem, but best of luck in this class.",
    "Well you probably have to take it if you're looking at this. If not, I don't know why you'd want to. Yes, organic chemistry is incredibly interesting, but the demands of the class, at least with Herzon, are a lot.",
    "don't take it unless your life (or premed requirements) depend on it.",
    "It is a terrible course because the Professor does not care about the student. The material is difficult but with disciplined study habits and an encouraging Professor it can be interesting. DO NOT TAKE IT AT YALE.",
    "I would never recommend this class to anyone if Professor Herzon is teaching it. It was absolutely horrible and demoralizing. The material isn't that hard but the tests were miserable.",
    "It's a requirement if you are pre-med or some science\/engineering major so just stick it out",
    "Be prepared to put in a lot of time not just understanding chemistry concepts, but memorizing reactions mechanisms and the like. The textbook is an invaluable resource, and I recommend just reading it as class goes along through it. Although the material for this class is interesting, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless it is required, because it proved to be increasingly extremely stressful and demanding throughout the semester.",
    "No, definitely not.",
    "Keep a positive attitude and stay on top of the readings. If you're taking it you probably have to so good luck."
