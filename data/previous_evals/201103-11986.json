    "if you are majoring in Egyptology...not otherwise.",
    "The class is okay. While the material is sort of boring (building inscriptions aren't exciting or fantastical), the texts are challenging and you learn a lot about the general concepts behind building a new monument. The texts are useful and the broad expanse of types of texts was fun (we did everything from Old Egyptian through to Roman Obelisks!).",
    "Take this course if you are interested in pursuing Hieroglyphics. Keep in mind that the focus of this class is specific, which is great if you are interested in architecture or construction like I was. Realize that this course will demand much time as far as take-home assignments, but it is worth it if you are focused on improving.",
    "If you have only taken L1&L2 hiero, then be aware that this course is difficult. Every week you have between 10 and 30 lines of rather esoteric and challenging egyptain. Also, this course is more of a graduate level seminar than an actual L3 class. As someone who had only taken a year of hieroglyphics, this course was extremely challenging and took up a considerable amount of time every week. The one redeeming quality was that the course met only once a week. If you are taking this as your language requirement, be forewarned that it is challenging and you will need to contribute a large amount of time to this a week.The class is really geared towards graduate students, who had a much greater depth of knowledge andit was blatantly apparent because we had to read our translations out loud.This class was my most difficult class this semester and I was taking Organic Chemistry 2, at the same time.",
    "This course was a very fun transition course from the introductory levels, where you learn a lot of grammar and a lot of verb forms, to a level where you actually do TONS of translations of real building inscriptions. Some highlights included the connection between Ozymandius and Ramesses II (watchmen?) and Professor Klotz's Halloween costume."
