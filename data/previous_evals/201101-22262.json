   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to all those interested in anthropology, sociology, environmental studies, and political science.",
    "I would recommend only if you are prepared to do the readings and remember them throughout the semester. You will not read something one week and forget it for the next class, but revisit them throughout the rest of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in globalization and the environment. The topics discussed are quite thought-provoking and relate to many global occurrences.",
    "Yeah, I would recommend it.",
    "The title pretty much says it all: it's a great course for someone genuinely interested in nature and globalization and how the two interact. If you're not deeply interested in those topics, you might find the readings dense and boring. I personally found the more anthropological readings difficult to get through at times. At times the readings and discussions aren't wildly engaging, but I still found everything interesting and came away feeling like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes to think about globalization from a philosophical, sociological and economic perspective. The course has a holistic approach, rather than a very detailed, fact-oriented curriculum. This is probably not the course for those who want to learn specific information and find the right answer to develop solutions. Instead, the course allows you to question the material by focusing on different perspectives to look at issues related to globalization and the environment, mostly from the perspective of indigenous communities.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting, and the readings are overall pretty good. They tend to be dense, anthropological readings, so it was definitely a little painful getting through some of them. Looking back, though, I'm glad I did it, as it really has shaped the way I think about environmental justice, different resource systems, and how environmental issues interacts with local rights issues in the developing world. Although this was technically a lecture, enrollment was low enough that it turned into a seminar, which I liked. I don't think this course would really work as well as a lecture. Professor Hebert is very, very nice and approachable."
