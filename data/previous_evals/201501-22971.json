    "TAKE THE CLASS! incredible experience. Without a doubt, the nest course I have taken at Yale (with MCDB 344).",
    "Second half of the 344\/345 combo. Take it. Or don't. But you'll regret it if you don't",
    "This class is as great as a high end",
    "Second part of the 344\/345L sequence. Pretty much the same as the 344L; you'll be spending a lot of time with your instructors, TAs, and peers, and so the quality of the class largely depends on who they are. Wolenski is absolutely fabulous, and I'd recommend taking this lab as a lab credit if possible.",
    "Same as I'd say for 344: BEST CLASS. Continuation of the first half, just as good. Take it if you can.",
    "This is a fantastic lab class. The twice-weekly meeting period may seem like a big time commitment, but it's definitely worth it, and the time you will spend in lab will be very fun and informative. Though the experiments change each year, you will learn about a lot of different lab techniques over the course of the semester and will be able to practice many of them. There is a great emphasis on being able to distill scientific concepts and techniques to their simplest points, and the short class presentations will make you a much better speaker and presenter. These presentations were one of my favorite aspects of the class. Almost every day, someone will do a short presentation on a recently published paper or technique and explain it to the class. This gives everyone a broad exposure to the most exciting things going on in the field and keeps you up to date with research in many different areas of biology.",
    "This class was incredible. Each lab flew by and everyone got close. I learned valuable techniques and enjoyed all of the paper talks and chalk talks.",
    "Second half of 344.",
    "MCDB 345L is taught the second half of the semester and is the logical class to take after MCDB 344L. I would really recommend taking this class because it is very well organized, taught, and executed. Professor Wolenski is a gem to learn with - he is so passionate about teaching and always willing to help his students with whatever matters concern them. The job talks in this class were challenging to prepare for but SO rewarding - I feel so much more comfortable talking about esoteric science topics because I prepared so much for the 15 minute job talk! I really appreciate Prof Wolenski as well as our TF, Junyi. Junyi made herself available and really helped the students throughout the semester. Great class!!!!",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. I cannot express how truly grateful I am to have been in this lab this semester. It has given me a much better understanding and appreciation for basic science, and has made me so incredibly excited for my medical career. The lab also gave me the opportunity to meet and grow close with some of the most brilliant students I've met at Yale, and I feel so honored and humbled to have been able to work so closely with them.",
    "Highly recommend!",
    "Take this class if you are taking the class before it. You will continue to learn and have so much fun. You will look forward to class everyday!"
