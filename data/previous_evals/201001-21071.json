    "I would recommend Microbiology 702 01 to a fellow student just because it is important to be exposed to different research going on across the country. I think that the fact that graduate students also get to interact with the visiting faculty members provides an opportunity for grad students to figure out what other departments at different universities are like. This is important when it comes time for a student to begin to decide where to go to do a postdoctoral assignment."

    "Very good seminars. Very helpful in understanding the latest research in the fields and getting to know a lot of professors.",
    "It helped deepen my knowledge of my chosen discipline because it provides an opportunity to hear about research going on at other institutions. It is a great venue to hear ideas or different research techniques that could potentially aid in research or a disertation, but I feel that I am not far enough along in my program to have benefited from this aspect of the course yet.",
    "It's quite helpful to open my mind. Somewhat helpful for my own research."
