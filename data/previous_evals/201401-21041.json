   "comments": [
    "Yes, not to challenging but you learn a lot.",
    "Good class if you're on a med track and have plans of going abroad or something",
    "It is a great class-you learn a lot and you will improve as long as you want to.",
    "Solid course if you're looking for a fifth class and to keep hearing Spanish, but not ideal if you actually want to come away with a ton of knowledge\/speaking practice.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. There's not a lot of work but you definitely learn a lot and enjoy yourself.",
    "Absolutely. Anybody from any major who has a desire to practice their Spanish in a fun, engaging, and informative environment should take this class.",
    "SPAN 225 is a lovely class. Mercedes is really great, she's such a sweet professor. The workload is super manageable (reading responses, final paper, final presentation) and I found the material to be really interesting. We did a reasonable amount of speaking and writing practice in Spanish, but there wasn't a lot of feedback on how we could improve our Spanish. Take it if you're interested in any way, shape, or form in medicine, but don't expect your Spanish to improve immensely.",
    "I loved this course. I definitely recommend this class to continue (or start) taking Spanish at Yale. Professor Carreras is very caring and helpful.",
    "It's a pretty easy course, but you won't necessarily learn a ton of Spanish.",
    "YES! Great L5 credit for those going to the medical profession but also those that are not. You learn a lot of useful stuff.",
    "You have two weekly page writing assignments on the reading. You also have one final essay ~10 pages on a topic of your choice.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Such a refreshing course if you have any interest in the subject!! Take it!!",
    "Yes, particularly if you want a low pressure way of continuing with Spanish. As a non pre-med student I definitely encourage others like me to take the course. The content is informative."
