    "The class goes really fast towards the end of the semester. Chances are, if you're looking at this class, you need to take it. It was a good math class, probably better than if you took it through the math department. There was a problem set every week, 2 midterms, and a final.",
    "Unless it is absolutely necessary, don't take this class. But if you have to, it's not that bad once you get the hang of it and the TA is very helpful.",
    "Good class- gives you a broad understanding of diff eqs and how to solve them. I thought it was pretty tedious, though- mostly just formulas followed by hours of algebra where easy mistakes could happen.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Though Professor Ahn is a very good lecturer, the course is still rather difficult and more hours on a PSet than you probably want to invest. If you have to take it for engineering, you'll definitely survive, but be prepared to work hard.",
    "Differential equations is a fundamental math, and ENAS 194 is the one to take if you are interested in learning it. The material is applicable, particularly if you are an engineering or physical sciences major, but also if you are simply interested in improving your math.",
    "good class, taught very well by Ahn (he's a physics professor).it's fast paced though. you don't learn a ton of partial so if you've had ordinary diffeq before just take partial through the math dept. (supposed to be more on the gut side). It's basically all science and engineering kids so the curve is pretty tough.this is very much on the applied side, extremely light on proofs.",
    "It is a difficult class. Not the exams or the homeworks, which are problems from the book. But the final is both unexpected and difficult.",
    "Yes, especially if considering engineering or math. Take this if you're not a big fan of proofs. Be prepared for long (5-8 hour weekly) problem sets, though. Be sure to get a study group going.",
    "Applications of Diff-eq. You learn very little theory in this class.",
    "Simplest advice: Avoid taking this class with Mitchell Smooke as his problem sets are beyond gargantuan. You'll need paper clips instead of staples and there is nothing in this course material that warrants that level of tedium. Should you find yourself in Prof. Smooke's section either read the book or go to lecture. Do not do both. You will find that he teaches the examples you have in the book.",
    "Good overview of Ordinary and Partial DiffEQs. Useful, and well-executed.",
    "For a course like this where the material can get repetitive and tedious, the instructor plays a large role in the course experience. I liked Charles Ahn because he took the time and care to actually treat us like real human beings. He'd take the time to tell us what was going on in science, and how Yale the endowments worked, etc. Whenever he missed a class he'd tell us why, what he was up to, etc. After spring break he showed us a slideshow and video of a military trip he took as part of a science team. Pretty neat stuff. Very personable man. Very structured and clear lecturer. He'll tell us what he's about to do before he does it, e.g. \"I'm going to state this theorem, explain it, then show you an example.\" Very good lecturer.",
    "the class piles up to a ridiculous amount of material at the very end, so study ahead of time, you can't cram for this in one night (after just having taken the final). that said, the prof is a very clear, concise lecturer. you can't make mindless, boring, purely mechanical equation solving any better, so nothing to blame but the actually material. it is definitely taught really well so just put the effort in and you'll learn some useful techniques for fluids, physics, etc (partial diffeq is also covered). the tests are fair(5 questions with 4 kind of easy questions and 1 much more challenging, theory based problem), psets tedious but doable (start them early!). probably required if you're looking at this but it's an alright class; too bad it's boring and at 9AM, definitely not the worst thing you're gonna take at yale, nor the hardest.",
    "Requirement for MechEs, but pretty interesting and useful.",
    "Way too much material crammed into a short period of time. Textbook might as well be written in a foreign language for all that I learned from it. Same deal with lectures. I was hoping that an ENAS class would be interesting because I would learn about real-world applications, instead I was shown a bunch of arbitrary presented equations and hardly ever applied them to anything. Do not recommend it.",
    "ENAS 194 is a great class! The material is challenging but completely conquerable as long as you do the problem sets. The problem sets take a while, but they teach you how to tackle the different differential equations very well. Take it!",
    "Take it if you have to; it will actually be one of your more pleasant pre-reqs. The class is challenging and demanding, so don't take it unless you have to, but overall it really isn't so bad.",
    "I actually ended up loving diffy-Q. It's a little less creative than linear algebra, but it's MUCH simpler than 120. It's kind of cool to break down a simple class of equations into a million different ways to solve.If you're going to take diffy-Q, I'd do this instead of the math version. You actually cover more material (partials included!), but the professor is AWESOME and really clear and the class is pretty easy. The only thing that makes it hard is the curve--you're competing against ENAS majors, so be prepared.The problem sets are kind of rough, but the answers are all in the book if you're enterprising enough to look them up. The midterms were much easier than the final, so be prepared!All in all, though, great experience. I'd recommend it highly for someone who's into math.",
    "You probably know if you are going to take this or not--maybe some people are deciding between this and a math department course though. This class is solidly plug and chug. There is almost no thought involved--exams and psets are just regurgitating the methods presented in class. This certainly leaves you able to solve diffeqs, but there are definitely people in the class who did fine and had no idea what they were doing other than following the mechanics. Workload is really manageable, exams are very doable. Ahn is a good lecturer, I would recommend taking it with him if you have a choice.",
    "It's a good course. There's not too much work, and it'll be fairly straightforward. I wouldn't worry too much about the course. As long as you keep up, it'll be fine.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Ahn is very organized and teaches extremely well. The weekly problem sets took me anywhere from 3-6 hours a week. The exams are not terribly difficult and the curve is nice. I would recommend this class.",
    "Take it because it's required (most likely) and a great course. You will spend a lot of times and possibly a few all nighters on the psets, but it's worth it, it's a great class.",
    "Final was difficult. Psets can be if you don't start early, but it's worthwhile to take if you need to know differential equations.",
    "Solid class on methods, very straightforward and not difficult at all. Recommended, as it can help for all fields in sciences. Be prepared for lengthy problem sets and limited theory.",
    "I know this class is required for most engineering majors and science majors, but that said, I think it is a fantastic class. So even though you probably have to take it, enjoy it because Professor Ahn is one of my favorite professors I have had at Yale. The teaching assistants are fantastic and the workload is not absurd. The best part is that you will come out of this class knowing how to solve differential equations -- and well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who enjoys calculus, as it allows you to delve further into an area of calculus that is mostly glossed over in other courses, but that is also essential in any physics-based or engineering career. Professor Ahn is an exceptional professor, the tests are very fair. My only complaint is that the problem sets seemed unnecessarily long at times, but overall, I learned so much in this class.",
    "Yes! If you are any type of physical science major, or engineering major, you should take this class, even if it isn't required! Professor Ahn is very organized and presents the material very lucidly. Matt, the TA, is also very helpful. Make sure to come to the weekly review sessions, and take advantage of office hours!",
    "Differential equations are clearly something that will be immeasurably useful for any engineering\/science career, so there really isn't any way to justify not taking this. It's also taught well, so you won't have to suffer through it.",
    "This is a great class to learn Diff Eqs. Charles Ahn is a great lecturer and is really great at answering questions. The problem sets are challenging but you feel like you're learning a lot because you're solving real problems. Tests are fair and the curve isn't too bad. I definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yeah, if you want to learn how to solve various types of differential equations I'd recommend this class. It's not particularly challenging if you've had experience already in higher level proof based math classes, but I found it enjoyable.",
    "Although most students taking this class will be required to, I found this class really cool anyway. The math material is probably the most interesting that I've encountered and ties together many concepts from previous courses and high school. Prof Ahn was pretty good and clear, although I think other teachers might be better. Matt was a great TA, and you should really take advantage of his weekly reviewsessions. They were really helpful.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Some interesting material is covered and the professor and TAs are good. (So if you have to take it for a requirement which you almost certainly do, I would recommend professor Ahn and the TA Matt Herdiech who had a huge role in running the course.) However the material covered is extremely frustrating. You largely focus on techniques for solving differential equations that you could easily solve with a computer. The homeworks test these technique and are EXTREMELY tedious and boring. I hope they change the focus of the material in the course so that this is a more worthwhile effort. As compared to Math 246, apparently they are about equally difficult. However, its nice how this class covers Fourier transforms and some partial differential equations whereas Math 246 at least in the past has not.",
    "Take this with Charles Ahn if you can. Charles Ahn is one of the best math professors I've had. He's very personable and approachable. He explains information throughly in class and is always open for questions. He also talks about the applications of the equations in class -- e.g. applications in computer chips, which makes the class more relevant and brings in the engineering aspect of the differential equations course -- otherwise, you might as well take the course offered in the math department.",
    "Take it. Learned a lot about difeq.",
    "I usually hate Maths but I this class is the best math class I have ever ttaken. Pr. Ahn is great and it is not too bad. Psets are extremely long aand tedious",
    "Good course",
    "Only take it if you have to. It is not worth the work otherwise.",
    "ENAS 194 basically teaches you a lot of analytical (pen-and-paper methods, as opposed to using computers to do numerical approximation) techniques to solve differential equations. Chances are, if you're looking at this class, you probably need it for your major. (I wouldn't take the class if it's not required for my major - it's not like Intro to Psych or one of those classes you take just for fun). Professor Ahn is a very good instructor. The workload is slightly above average, but not an impossible amount. I took this class in a 5.5-credit semester and went through it fine. Overall a pretty solid, enjoyable class.",
    "Why would you take this class if you don't have to?",
    "hard hard class, dont take it lightly. i did and didnt too hot.",
    "Take this class if you want to be able to solve differential equations. It's very methodical and mechanical. If you're looking for something more theoretical I'd recommend a different class. Charles Ahn is well-organized and easy to learn from. Lecture is everything you need to understand the material.",
    "You probably are talking this because it's required, but if you stay on top of things and go to the help sessions it's really not at all that bad. I would make sure to take it with the engineering dept rather than math."
