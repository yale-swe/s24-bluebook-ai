    "Only take it if you need it for your major because it is difficult",
    "Math 120 is not a course that should be taken lightly. It moves quickly, and some of the concepts are very challenging. It's not bad if you need to take it, but don't bother if you are not a fan of math or planning on majoring in it. It should only be for those who want to continue in the field.",
    "If you take this class, plan on draining your time on weekly psets and spending a bunch of time cramming for exams. In the end, there's still no guarantee you'll do well because the curve is bad and the tests are hard.",
    "As an overall course, MATH 120 is taught well. Han is leaving so he won't be here next year; take it with Miki if you can.",
    "Math 120 is very useful if you would like to thoroughly understand multivariable calculus principles. The pace of the class may be pretty fast, but the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "Challenging but doable, just a class you have to get through.",
    "I would recommend this class, but strongly suggest shopping for the best instructor. It is very fast-paced and it is extremely difficult to keep up if your instructor does not teach well.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to someone who is interested in the material, and willing to read the book and try to learn on their own.",
    "Math 120 was a somewhat challenging math course. I would stress the importance of getting into a section with a good teacher. This class does require that you put in the work, but if you do you can be successful. I would recommend this class to another student only if they enjoy math or are interested in the course (or need it as a prerequisite). If you do not enjoy math and don't need this class, then I wouldn't take it.",
    "Professor Li taught this course well, but was a little hard to understand, and sometimes went too rapidly through material that was challenging. He did provide many opportunities for questions and answers them well, and was good with one-on-one help."
