    "I would definitely recommend SOCY 319 for EVERY student at Yale! I think it is so important for us as Yale students to at least know SOMETHING about race relations in America. This class is a befitting introduction which delves much deeper than an introductory ethnography course. The books in the class are one's that I believe I will keep for a lifetime! Such classics!",
    "If they want a class that meets once a week and has very little pressure, take this class.",
    "I would recommend African American Ethnography to another student, because the course content is essential knowledge for anyone who considers themselves American. African Americans are as integral to the American experience as any other founding group and everyone should learn more about the rich history and present-day condition of African Americans.",
    "SOCY 319 01 takes one through the historical events that led up to present day prejudice and racism that American society face up till today. I would definitely recommend it to every sociology major as it provides a more in-depth view of the race issue in America."
