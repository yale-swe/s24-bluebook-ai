   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Irrelevant as everything about Building Project is predetermined - no research was necessary.",
    "Yes.",
    "Excellent.",
    "Yes.",
    "The library lending policy is a problem. We need to be able to take out more than one book every night.",
    "The physical resources were generally available.",
    "Library circulation policies restrictive!",
    "Everything was great!",
    "Resources were fine. Could have used more file space on the school servers, but that issue isn't unique to this course.",
    "The 7th floor conference room as particularly useful and often overbooked. The table and overhead projector was a real help. I wish there were more of them in the building.",
    "The shop and the staff in the shop should be integrated into the Building Project as the shop is being utilized, but not optimally.",
    "The library has terrible hours, service, attitude, selection, etc. I will say it again, as I say on every evaluation: the library is not open for learning. It is a museum to books, and we are only allowed to look at them through glass.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
    "I believe the resources provided by the School of Management are ill-fitted for the School of Architecture in general. I appreciate a number of the points they raise in terms of presentation and dealing with clients however the \"data\" they provide us about our group and team dynamics fall into the realm of common sense at best and are wasteful of our time. Their stress on speaking to the client is pertinent to an extent (as we actually engage a client during BP) yet the reality of the situation is highly different than any true \"real world experience\" and should be treated as such. Essentially: we are still in school, this is not a typical client relationship.",
    "Resources were available",
    "Yes."
