   "comments": [
    "This was my first statistics course, and it was an excellent way to engage with the kind of statistics that appear in social sciences. If you want to take a statistics course with information that is applicable and not just theoretical, take this course.",
    "Learned the basics of Statistics, developed more Math skills.",
    "I learned how to use Stata, an important statistical software. I also learned many applications to material I learned in AP Stats in high school. We went more in depth than that curriculum.",
    "I've learned so much about statistics and I now feel confident that I could read a scientific paper and not just have to rely on reading the discussion but I could actually evaluate the accuracy of the research methods and results. I've learned how to conduct significance tests and create confidence intervals, I've learned how to find the right sample size given certain confidence and error levels, I've been introduced to STATA and use it at least for rudimentary functions. I've also learned how to do regression analysis and analyse multiple regressions and talk about the impacts of omitted variable bias.",
    "Learned how to do lots of stats stuff and better interpret research and statistics",
    "I learned a lot of statistical methods that can be applied in daily life and my future career, as well as some basic statistical theory underpinning these methods.",
    "I learned so much in this class -- understanding things from a statistical viewpoint, and being able to identify and analyze trends and the relationships between variables are some of the skills I have learned. I have also learned Stata, which is an incredibly important skill that will help me conduct research and obtain research work in the future.",
    "How to apply quantitative skills to the social sciences. This was an engaging and very fun course",
    "In this class, I learned about all the important topics that an intro stats class should teach.",
    "I mainly only learned about linear regression, as the rest of the class was a review of AP Stat.",
    "I learned how to use Stata",
    "This course taught me how to conduct basic inferential analysis on data sets. I learned how to conduct tests of significance and confidence intervals for means and proportions as well as conduct linear regressions.",
    "I certainly learned how to question statistical data included in social science and political science research papers. I also learned how to use Stata.",
    "I learned a lot about statistics and critical thinking.",
    "You get a really good basic grounding in stats from a research consumer's perspective. I feel like I can get a lot more out of a social science paper than I did before taking this and as though I could judge good research. A lot of the first half of the term seems like it might be redundant if you took AP stats z-scores, null hypothesis tests, etc. (I didn't, but that's the impression I've gotten from people who did). By far the most useful is learning how to do multiple regressions and the technical underpinnings that social scientists often screw up writing papers.",
    "It was an excellent introduction to the statistical aspects of social sciences research. There's definitely an emphasis on pointing out common misinterpretations of data, which I appreciate.",
    "-Statistical methods applied to social sciences.",
    "I learned the basics of statistical analysis and theory.",
    "Knowledge: Basic measures of central tendency, distributions, types of data Central Limit Theorem, Law of Large Numbers, sampling+sample+population distributions Confidence intervals, significance tests, t-distribution for small samples, comparison of two means Linear regression: assumptions, models, R, R^2, TSS, SSE, MSE, RMSE Multivariate regression: adjusted R^2, controls, SSE Omitted Variable Bias and multicollinearity Skills: Very basic Stata Statistical intuition Research criticism Insights: Professor JTs life",
    "Thorough understanding of basic statistical concepts Ability to comfortably perform statistical tests by hand and on Stata",
    "AQA is a very solid course in introductory statistics. I learned the concepts and calculations for standard Stats metrics, and used Stata to run regressions, etc. I am now equipped to understand statistics in the news and in journal articles, with a thorough understanding of where statistics can mislead people and what standards a statistician must apply in order for their data to be accurate.",
    "I learned a great breadth of knowledge in regards to statistics. This course starts out with pretty simple and basic statistics and ends on a much more complex level. I learned how to apply statistical models to real life research and how to make conclusions from actual data sets.",
    "I developed knowledge of statistical and inferential methods, and I also gained skills in understanding and judging the methods used in research."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "While the course discusses a lot of important concepts in Statistics, it tends to do so at an incredibly fast pace. I am not a particularly Math-inclined person and at times it was extremely difficult to follow in class.",
    "This course was fantastic. Professor Thomas is an incredible person and professor. This course was always fun to go to. Weaknesses were that the theory material was sometimes not well communicated, so when a test rolled around, those questions were challenging.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Thomas' endless enthusiasm and boundless energy. He makes stats fun! Lectures were super organized and the material clearly explained in easy-to-understand language. Not too much work but enough to feel like you're actually learning something and practicing your skills. Weaknesses: Honestly, not much. Prof. Thomas is a big reason why I enjoyed this class and he's doing a fine job.",
    "Very strong on the math and practical application, but I would like to see a bit more of the theory",
    "This class is great. Can't think of any ways that it could be improved.",
    "Justin Thomas is great. The subject material is tough\/dry and the TAs were not fantastic but he really is such a wonderful professor and all around guy",
    "The major strengths of this course are strong instruction by the professor, who is very open to answering any and all questions, and clear organization of class material that makes the completion of problem sets easy.",
    "Strengths are definitely the professor: he's fantastic. Homeworks should be reduced, there are too many problem sets.",
    "I think explanations of the concepts could be a lot clearer. Also, it would be really helpful if like the slides were in the order we were speaking in. It was confusing to look back at notes and not have the slides be talking about the same stuff in the same order.",
    "The main redeeming quality of this class is Professor Thomas. The main weakness is the problem sets. They are mainly busywork and do not require students to show understanding of the material. They are repetitive and too time-consuming. Working with Stata is miserable.",
    "Professor Thomas was a strength. He made everything really understandable and was great at answering questions and keeping the class engaged.",
    "Professor Thomas is amazing. He was incredibly engaging and made learning statistics interesting.",
    "While the TAs were very willing to try to help, they often times had to look up answers to questions or referred us to Professor Thomas before they helped. I would find TAs that have freshly explored the material. Strengths are Professor Thomas's enthusiasm and teaching abilities. Weaknesses are that the sections did not help much with Stata. Would have also preferred to see PSET answers posted after submission.",
    "I cannot for the life of me sit through lectures, esp on quant topics, no matter how good the professor. It's just not how I learn. However, the lecture slides, section notes, and problem sets are extremely conducive to learning. This course is very fair and we are set up for success (even though I don't know my grade yet). One complaint is that we aren't provided with proper feedback on the psets.",
    "I thought the lectures were well-structured and the progression of material made sense. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way a bit was that Justin would often use gender as his example for binary data sets I get that that's still the common way of analyzing gender in stats research, but as someone doing research in queer communities I had to reinterpret some of the material to make it useful for me.",
    "The structure of the course was sometimes a bit confusing in terms of how the material built off of one another, and I would have found a quick overview of the guiding questions helpful during the first lecture. The strength of the course is in its practicalityI never wondered how the material could be applied to real world scenarios. The psets were challenging but doable, and the exams were fair.",
    "The course could be improved by doing practical more examples and less of the theory behind statistics. For example, instead of having to do a problem that requires computing a summation by hand, we should be doing more problems on Stata that we could be expected to do for either thesis work or a social science research job.",
    "AQA is a well-taught, easy and informative introductory stats course for GLBL and other non-technical majors. Instructor: Professor Thomas is great. He is conscious of how boring stats lectures can be and makes every effort to make them interesting and interactive. His life and times at the beginning is always welcome and begins the class on a positive note. He constantly asks question and makes the lecture interesting his questions, prodding and repetition makes answers easy to remember at all times without the need for revision. He does reviews and pre-exam summaries very often so you never feel like you are behind on the course material. He makes himself quite available and has very frequent office hours. Although he encourages all sorts of questions in class, he is open to one-on-one discussions. He also makes himself available for extra office hours in most weeks if you have scheduling conflicts. He is a nice person and cares about the class. If someone didnt do so well on the exam, he is quite encouraging and helpful. He remembers everyones names and puts in the extra effort to remember everyone individually and call them in class\/understand their situation Having said that, it didnt seem like he cared much about the course. He has taught this so many times that he was quite lax about it, showing up late to class and not being ambitious with covering more content. Course content: Initial content seems too basic and before the midterm, the material is fairly useless and monotonous. Post-midterm regression material is very useful and something everyone will benefit from knowing. Multivariate regression was also a smart inclusion since that is so fundamental in global affairs papers. However, we do simple things for far too long and extend them beyond what is needed. This leaves very little time to do real stats stuff like ANOVA, Monte Carlo, F-distr, Chi-distr etc. If we had moved through the material faster, this was definitely achievable. Many people will need this for approaches to international development but they didnt learn it in this class. Lecture content and slides were really really boring and poorly made. Some pictures and color would be much appreciated. The readings were pretty useless the book is boring and poorly written and way too expensive. The last few assigned chapters were way outside the scope of the syllabus. Course assignments: Problem sets are very easy. Everyone gets a 5\/5 just dont make silly mistakes. There are also only seven. Exams are quite easy and predictable but the curve is fairly brutal. Professor Thomas says the predicted average is like 70 but it was actually 86 and the bar to get an A is probably too high and values perfection too much. The exam was checked brutally with endless points deducted for small, silly mistakes. The final sample\/practice exam was very bad. All the solutions said see lecture notes and there were so many errors. Only 4\/5 short questions were even doable given the content on the exam. It was very annoying and seemed like no one cared about the course.",
    "This is the worst course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Unbelievable course at Yale. I wouldn't change a thing.",
    "Strengths: VERY well taught class by Professor Thomas. He is funny, relaxed, and yet drills his students in and understanding of statistical concepts. He frames things from the perspective of you, as an intern or new employee in the social sciences, faced with statistics to calculate or analyze. He learns everyones name in the 50-person lecture, and makes sure his students are alert and learning. Psets are well organized, neither crazy long nor super short. Tests are very fair in their questioning and grading. If you pay attention in class and do the psets youll know whats coming. Weaknesses: Stata is taught in section but many people dont go. On psets usually students piece together which commands to use but dont thoroughly learn the software. One aspect that could be improved is the organization of Prof Thomass lectureshe often switches back and forth between lecture slides that are full of text and white board software on which he can do example problems. The dense slides are helpful to look at afterwards, but very hard to digest in the moment. The best technique is for students to listen to Prof Thomas, only paying attention to the slides when he references them, and to write down the examples. If he said this at the beginning of the class, that would be a great help.",
    "This course was great for someone who is interested in the social sciences because it taught useful statistics skills without harking too long on the theory behind it. The course, as the name suggests, really focuses on teaching students how to apply statistical models to their own research or existing research. Professor Thomas clearly explained the topics throughout the semester. As section was optional, many people did not show up. I think section could have been a great place to really ingrain the subject matter into our brains, but instead it was not really a valuable use of time.",
    "This course was interesting, engaging, and well-taught. The material and concepts taught are extremely important for understanding research methods. I feel like I will be able to use the concepts learned in this class in the majority of my future classes. The only weakness of this course is that much of Stata had to be self-taught, as the sections did not always cover all of the Stata functions that we were expected to know for the problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "This is a fine introductory Statistics course. Professor Thomas is engaging and really tries his best to make sure everyone understands the concepts. Unless you are a Global major, however, you would probably be better off taking another intro Stats course, since this one is EXTREMELY fast paced and if you are not a math-inclined person and\/or have not taken Statistics in high school, you might (probably will) struggle to keep up.",
    "Yes, I would. If you need to take a stats class for pre-med or just to satiate your curiosity, take this one. You will not regret it.",
    "Absolutely yes! This class presents stats in an easy to understand, approachable and applicable way. You will go away having learned a tonne of useful information about designing and evaluating research studies. Prof. Thomas is a gem at Yale and you must take his class!",
    "Yeah, it's a good way to get a solid grasp of stats",
    "Yes!!! Take this class. Much better than other stats classes, from what I have heard.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course -- Justin Thomas is amazing and getting to know him through this class will definitely add to your Yale experience, and learning Stata is very useful from a career standpoint.",
    "I don't think this class was maximally organized for facilitating understanding of the concepts behind statistics, which makes it seem easier but in truth be harder because you can memorize the equations but it's harder to memorize every step of finding the p value and doing 2-tailed and stuff if you don't get WHY. JT's questions were one level too conceptual so only people who were following could try to answer them, so it was easy to disengage. JT is really nice though.",
    "Yes, highly recommended",
    "The psets really take a lot of time, probably unless you've taken AP stats. It wasn't impossible but I did have to do a lot of learning on my own because I was very often confused by what was going on. Justin is a wonderful guy, though.",
    "It is hard to find a better intro stats class than GLBL 121. Period. I had taken a few stats class at Yale before taking AQA and seen how other stats class are taught, and Justin Thomas's class is above and beyond all of them. Stats is never easy, but with this class, you stand a fair chance of learning it.",
    "Only take this course if you are a Global Affairs major and it was required. Also consider taking it if you did not take AP Statistics in high school and want an overview of statistics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Though I took AP Stats in high school, this course solidified my conceptual understanding of all the formulas and tests we learned in class. I have a better grasp on why we use certain methods when observing quantitative data versus categorical data. Professor Thomas was also a great teacher.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, because I learned useful things, and since I put in the effort I felt like I did decently well.",
    "If you're looking for a QR that doesn't require that you be good at math, this is the class for you. Short and easy p-sets once a week, one midterm, and one final (both very fair) you really can't expect a lower workload than that. I never opened either textbook and almost never went to section, but I paid attention in lecture and almost always got 5s on the p-sets. Only bit of advice is don't bother buying \"A Gentle Introduction to Stata\" and maybe share the other textbook with a few friends taking the class; they're just not worth the money. Bonus: Justin tells very sweet and funny \"Life and Times\" stories at the beginning of class.",
    "Yes--really useful material and a great QR for anyone in the social sciences.",
    "-If you are a humanities person who likes math only when it relates to humanities, this is the class for you.",
    "The class is pretty boring but Prof. Thomas is great. You don't really have to go to section either which is a plus",
    "I would recommend if you want to learn very basic statistics and are especially interested in the theory\/ideas behind complex statistical analysis.",

    "I cannot stress how strongly I would oppose any friend taking this class. The material is immensely boring, and the professor and his TAs hardly understand what they're doing half the time.",
    "Take take take this class if you not only want to learn stats but actually UNDERSTAND it!",
    "YES!!! Everyone should take this class!!!!!",
    "Yes, take this course for a solid background in intro stats and for Professor Thomas (JT). He will make sure you learn the material, and is very personable, kind and hilarious. Each class opens with a funny story from his life, which helps because the material is unavoidably dry. JT asks lots of questions in class and learns everyones name. Hes the kind of teacher whose respect you want to earn. Psets are fine and tests are very fair in both grading and the questions asked.",
    "If you are a Global major, you have to take this course, but it is not one that should be dreaded. Any student looking for a QR or who wants to specifically take a statistics course, this class is great, especially for those involved in the social sciences. Although lecture can sometimes feel long because intro statistics is inherently not very riveting, Professor Thomas does an awesome job of keeping the class engaged. The psets are not too bad, and Professor Thomas is clear about what material will be tested for the midterm and final exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the material and concepts taught are extremely important for understanding research articles and research methods. I feel like I will be able to use the concepts learned in this class in the majority of my future classes. Also, JT is an amazing professor and teaches the material so well; plus he is funny and engaging so I was never bored in class!"
