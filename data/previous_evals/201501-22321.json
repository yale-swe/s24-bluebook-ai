    "This is a good course, but can get a little boring just due to the length and breadth of the material. I am glad that I took this course for the sake of future traveling. I have not been to Rome, but think it would be more interesting if you have been or at least plan to go. I liked that it was an open yale course because you can skip classes if you need to and still make them up later.",
    "Roman Architecture is basically a virtual journey through the Roman Empire. On top of being a very interesting class, the grading is very favorable. Even though there is no curve in the class, if you are good at memorizing, this is definitely a class to take. There will be about 175 monuments to memorize for each midterm (there is no final) and as long as you can talk about the building, and general architectural themes that it shows, you'll be able to do very well in the course. As a result, I also learned more than I ever thought I would about architecture in general and can now spot Roman themes while walking around Yale's campus.",
    "Yes, great intro to Roman architecture. You learn a lot if you are willing to show up and participate in the online forum.",
    "This is a good class. A short paper (no need to locate sources, they're provided), occasional comments online, and a couple of nights of memorization are the bare minimum requirements. You can scale up to get whatever you want out of the course by buying and reading the books, talking to TAs, diving into the projects, etc. Online courses and the ebook made this a good choice for people who might miss lectures due to interviews etc. Lecture was like a mini vacation twice weekly although sometimes I zoned out after forty or so minutes. I liked it! Credit\/d takes a lot of stress off but grading was very lenient anyway. I'm a bio major and I enjoyed being the new perspective.",
    "A great course. The only downside is that it's at 9am, so I often found myself skipping class. However, I would advise that you take this class and try to make every lecture. Prof. Kleiner is a GREAT (see: amazing) lecturer, and she's always so well dressed for 9am o.O All in all, you'll learn a lot, and your eyes will be opened.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, and I already have, in fact.",
    "I highly highly recommend this course to all students at Yale, regardless of their major. It really helps you understand and appreciate architecture wherever you are in the world.",
    "Roman Architecture is a very interesting class and teaches you a lot about Roman architecture that is the foundation of modern architecture. I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in learning about the foundations of our architecture today.",
    "Nothing like anything you've taken before. It will literally change the way you look at the [urban] world.",
    "Take it if you are 1) a visual person 2) interested in architecture and history 3) have an acute sensitivity of art appreciation",
    "A wide-ranging survey of ancient Roman architecture with a passionate leader scholar in this field. A class of breadth, if not necessarily depth, though Prof. Kleiner is diligent about discussing recurrent themes and continuities. Lectures are early morning, which I found a useful way to get the day started. Workload is light -- however, the online forum was a nuisance and far less preferable to a real in-the-flesh discussion of the material. Still, you will learn a lot about ancient Rome and think quite hard about the fundaments of architectural form. Ancient Roman history is stunning, and architectural study is a great way of accessing it.",
    "Easy take it!",
    "Solid course--beware of memorization",
    "You will experience very steep learning curve",
    "Roman Architecture is a good 5th class. The important thing to know is that you CANNOT cram for the tests-- they're straight memorization so get started early. They're not too difficult if you've done the work. The Build a Roman City project can be fun to work on, and a good break from other work if you're not an art major. The pictures do take a surprisingly long time to draw, though, and it's worth doing a lot of them-- generally more drawing gets you a better grade than more research, or at least that's the way it seemed to me. The class is also more interesting if you've been to Rome and so have seen the things she's talking about. I found that when I started losing steam during the lecture (it's long-- 75 minutes, and she often goes 5 or more minutes over, so keep that in mind if you want to take a class that's right after it), it helped me to pay attention if I had been to the place she was talking about. The other thing to know is that the lectures are all online on Open Yale Courses, and at least while I was in the class it didn't seem like she had changed it very much. So if you can't (or \"can't\") go to lecture one day, you can catch up another time. It is worth watching the lectures, though, and not just memorizing the monuments, because most of the points on the exam IDs come from discussion. I am glad I took this class, though. I did learn a lot, and I got an insight into what art history classes are like.",
    "Not a lot of work but you really have to study for the midterms those are very difficult if you don't know how to study for them",
    "I did not particularly enjoy Roman Architecture, and I would not recommend it to others. First, there are only three graded assignments, which means that doing poorly on one greatly lowers your chances of doing well in the class. Professor Kleiner knows what she is doing, and has spent decades at Yale, but the lecture can be slow and difficult to engage in (perhaps this is a function of the material). Midterms require the memorization of hundreds of monuments, which is difficult. I think those interested in Rome might do better in an actual history class; this one was more appealing nominally than in practice.",
    "This is a good survey of Roman architecture. You will learn a lot about the evolution of technology in Roman architecture. I'd recommend it if this is something you're interested in, but would not recommend if you aren't. That is, it's not a course that just anyone will enjoy. That said, Professor Kleiner is an expert in Roman architecture, so if you want to learn about this subject, she is definitely the person to learn from.",
    "A very good introductory class. Provides a broad overview of themes, patterns, continuities and changes in Roman Architecture. Professor Kleiner is a very good lecturer, and the fact that the class is available on Open Courses means that if you have to skip one or two lectures, you won't fall behind. That said, the fact that it's offered at 9 am makes it incredibly tempting to skip lecture, and of course being there in person makes a huge difference. I think it would make a big difference in attendance if it were offered even half an hour later. There's relatively little graded work. We had only two midterms and a paper. The midterms are easy if you've studied hard enough, and impossible if you haven't studied at all. They're mostly based on memorization: aside from the thematic essays that come with almost every introductory class, Professor Kleiner puts up pictures of various monuments we've studied and asks you to name each one, date it to within five years, say where it's located, and then write an ID paragraph explaining its significance, which can include which emperor put it up, what its architectural elements are and what they tell us about the building and its time, etc. That sort of memorization cannot be done in a short amount of time, so know that you need to devote at least a week's worth of study sessions for these exams. That said, the course is interesting and not overly difficult. Recommended, especially if you have a particular interest in the ancient world or anything Roman-related.",
    "Great class if you are interested in Roman Architecture."
