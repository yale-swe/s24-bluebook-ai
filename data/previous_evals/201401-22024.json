   "comments": [
    "It is alright. There are way better senior seminars.",
    "Take it if interested in the material and ready to work somewhat hard!",
    "A very good overview of 1) facts about the US healthcare system, 2) stylized facts about the US healthcare system based on the research literature, 3) theories and models about health and healthcare, and 4) specific important studies about health and healthcare. The lectures go at a good pace; the grading is somewhat tough. Kowalski is nice and organized, though strict.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in health care or acquiring a more critical perspective on today's news. Keep in mind that the content does get quite technical for an economics seminar, but I found this a refreshing break from the glossed-over version one gets in the media.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you hope to have a comprehensive overview on U.S. healthcare, you should definitely take this class. The professor is very helpful and explained clearly on each topic. The exams are a little bit tricky though. Unlike most of the Economics exams that involves applying model to evaluate real-life situations, exams for this course require you to memorize some important facts in healthcare industry and some important findings in the healthcare economics literature. The process of reviewing and memorizing can be a little bit painful, but after you realize how much you have gained from the class, this is definitely rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they are really interested in the material; otherwise, I have mixed feelings. If you are a junior thinking about writing a senior thesis, take this class. Kowalski is eager to help students think about and pursue economics research and is full of ideas and good advice on how to get started. If you\u2019re a junior also interested in getting an econ senior class requirement out of the way, this is also a good \u2013 albeit, challenging \u2013 course. However, if you\u2019re a senior, unless you\u2019re really passionate about and\/or familiar with the material, I am not sure if I would recommend this course. On one hand, it is terrific. The structure is great, you delve into the world of health economics with a young star of a professor, and you learn a lot about health care (I knew every little about health economics before taking this course and you learn how to apply econometrics to an interesting topic area). On the other hand, it is very broad and, there are several assignments (3 policy memos and two problem sets) as well as a midterm and final. It\u2019s quite a bit of work for a second semester senior \u2013 especially one still looking for a job! \u2013 and because the work is distributed throughout the semester, your midterm and final count for as much as those other grades. As a senior, if you are interested in the course material and\/or economics research, then I\u2019d recommend it. Otherwise, there are other economics classes you could take that have less work and are as interesting. As a junior though, I think it\u2019s very worthwhile.",
    "Must take if you are at all interested in a health profession. Professor Kowalski is highly knowledgeable of her field and current research, and extremely intelligent. Though I had taken courses in healthcare economics prior to this class, I felt I was continually building upon my knowledge and expanding my understanding. I took this class with Econ 132, which was extremely helpful in understanding the technical aspects of the papers.",
    "I really enjoyed the course! It was a great follow up to Prof. Forman's ECON 170 (Healthcare Economics and Public Policy), and I appreciated the more rigorous economic approach that Prof. Kowalski took to the topics that overlap. Prof. Kowalski's reorganized version of the course this year flowed very well, and I think the split of the course between building block lectures and applications (which occurred very naturally at spring break) was generally very effective. I would have appreciated more guidance on what is expected for the policy papers, or an example of a successful paper (perhaps from a previous year). The course assessments were very fair and appropriate considering the material covered in the class. Professor Kowalski was very friendly, and obviously passionate about her field. She was always punctual, responsive, and well organized. She gave great advice on topics directly related to the course and on the economics major at Yale in general. I appreciated that there was never a deviation from the Syllabus - that's how well she had planned the class!"
