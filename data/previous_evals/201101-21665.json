   "comments": [
    "Probably the best \"science for non-science majors\" class on campus.",
    "Wells is a really good prof his tests were easier than Kundel's but dont be fooled Kundel teaches the majority and isnt the best lecturer. Unreal SC credit if you can get in.",
    "MCDB 135 is an introduction to the brain and how it develops, how it deals with emotion, how it controls our movement and more. I would definitely recommend the class for an easy Sc credit.",
    "The \"seminar\" is more like a lecture. The environment is stagnant and we hadn't introduced each others until late February.",
    "a great class to learn about the brain for non-science majors",
    "This class was a good science credit for non-science majors. The material was fairly interesting, although it was superficial in places (which is to be expected for a class designed for nonmajors). The professors were helpful, and it was generally a manageable class. The workload was very reasonable - 3 noncumulative exams and a short final paper. Take it if you need a science credit.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a non-science major looking for a science that is interesting and won't kill you. If you want something truly stimulating and\/or challenging, though, this isn't the course for you.",
    "Take it. It's a great intro and totally possible to take without any science background.",
    "I would reccommend the class for a student who wants an interesting way to fulfill a Science credit. It's definitely not the easiest course, but it's very manageable.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, take it! Especially if you have an interest in how diseases like Parkinson's, Huntington's, Autism, ALS, MLS, and Autism are manifested in the biology of the brain.",
    "I would definitely take this class. The curriculum is not difficult at all, the grading is fair\/easy and the material is quite interesting. I feel like I came away from the class having learned a lot about neurological processes, and although I took the class as a science credit, it has definitely stimulated my interest in sciences at Yale. The teachers are great, and a combination of them and the seminar setting I never felt bored. Great class!",
    "A fun class, although not necessarily exciting. Requires little to no reading, work, or studying if you review your notes and pay attention in class. I liked that class participation was welcomed within the lecture format.",
    "I would recommend the course. You get learn some science in terms of the biological mechanisms behind brain function. But you also get to learn about applicable topics such as Alzheimer's and whatnot. It was a really good non-science-major course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a really interesting class and a great way to get a science credit. The tests weren't too hard and weren't cumulative, a HUGE plus. Also, the class is small enough that you get to ask questions if you are confused and the class is not intimidating because it's full of other nonscience majors. However, it's a popular class, and you get in only by lottery, so make sure you have a back up class.",
    "One of the better gut sciences. You actually learn things but are likely to get a good grade. Walking out I really do feel like I know a lot about how the brain works. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "MCDB 135 is probably THE best science class for non-majors class at Yale. It'll provide you with a good knowledge base about how your brain works (it does what it promises in the class name). I would definitely encourage other students to take this class.",
    "If you need a science credit, go ahead -- but only because most of other Sc classes look pretty bad too. This is boring and you get very little information."
