    "It is a good opportunity to study a topic the department does not offer. However, you need to be motivated and self-disciplined to ensure the semester goes well. Think about doing a Directed Reading the fall semester before your senior essay is due--it is helpful to build up knowledge in a subject area yet does not have the associated pressures of doing a year-long senior essay.",
    "Yes! I would even take it earlier than senior year if possible.",
    "Independent studies are among the most valuable and least utilized opportunities available to Yale students. If you can, take some sort of directed reading! They're challenging, and it's hard to slack off when it's just you and the professor, but you'll learn a lot and it's definitely worth it. No need to save this for senior year.",
