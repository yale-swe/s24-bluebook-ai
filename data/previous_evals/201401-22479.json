    "good",
    "Very good ethics class. Interesting enough to keep me awake even though it was early in the morning",
    "This is a mandatory course for all students as of now. The class was valuable but the material was very generic.",
    "As a master student, I don't think I should take this course. It is defintely helpful for phDs, but no so much for master students.",
    "Yes - it give a good guidelines for responsibility you have as a researcher.",
    "A good course covering various ethical topics that a graduate research student may encounter.",
    "Necessary",
    "I would say its the best ethics class you'll fine. definitely consider it.",
    "The course progressed well.",
    "Surprisingly interesting, and sort of an entertaining lecture that you are required to attend. Bring breakfast and pay attention!",
    "Yes. The class was helpful in many ways, especially with research ethics, safety, and in learning about the resources available to students doing research in labs. It was also helpful in learning how to solve\/approach potential authorship\/publication conflicts",
    "You gotta do it so...",
    "It is a required class, so you will have to take it, but it's really no big deal. It is interesting to go and listen\/take part in the discussions.",
    "Would definitely recommend---because of principle, though the Professor teaching it was also a great bonus to the course's effectiveness.",
    "I would describe it as a brief overview of many of the challenging issues faced by students performing graduate level research. I would recommend it.",
    "This course discusses relevant topics in bioethics that are often encountered by PhD students during the course of their study. Topics included \"what qualifies as authorship,\" \"sexual harassment,\" and \"animal and patient care\/well-being,\" to name a few. I would highly recommend this course to individuals working in the sciences, as all content is helpful and relevant. Since taking the course, I have actually suggested that Post-docs of Yale University also be required to take a short Bioethics course with Dr. Latham upon being hired at Yale University. I believe refreshers are necessary for everyone and that this would be quite helpful for Post-Docs and PhD students to have reviewed every 1-2 years of their study.",
    "I would recommend because knowledge of dos or don'ts in research is quite important.",
    "It depends. The course seems to be useful for experimentalists, while for theorists, I am not sure."

   "comments": [
    "useful",
    "This course was required, but not directly applicable to my line of work.",
    "Since I am not doing research at Yale just course work, this question does not apply to my program specifically in terms of my research.With respect to general knowledge, this course was a good overview of Yale's policies in different fronts.",
    "Definitely taught me a lot and showed me different sides of various ethical issues.",
    "It gives me more understanding of profession.",
    "i definitely think it addressed ethics issues - some that we were familiar with and many that we are unfamiliar and gave us a head start so we know how to address these issues if they arise during our careers.",
    "Reviewing\/learning publication ethics will be extremely important during (and beyond) the Ph.D. process.",
    "Made me aware of conflicts of interest at Yale and in the professional community at large.",
    "The class was helpful in many ways, especially with research ethics, safety, and in learning about the resources available to students doing research in labs. It was also helpful in learning how to solve\/approach potential authorship\/publication conflicts",
    "Im going to keep the stories I heard in the class throughout my graduate career",
    "Most of the material was stuff I already knew. The talk about authorship was useful.",
    "I now understand more specific nuances in publication, power-dynamics, research ethics, that seem much more a daily reality than before. That isto say, the ethical principles were abstractions I did not expect to have to invoke, assuming that since I had no intention of breaking these rules, I would not encounter myself in circumstances in which they may be broken. In particular, the specific examples of how daily circumstances do fall under these ethics made them a more immediate reality in my day to day research activities.",
    "Some of the topics, particularly those pertaining to authorship, addressed topics that I had been wondering about, and knowledge of such topics will be generally helpful as I proceed with research.",
    "I found the content to be helpful in my understanding of certain biothical topics. For example, now I have a better idea of what sort of contributions warrant journal article authorship, the consequences of not properly citing sources\/giving credit to those who deserve it, and the details of funding\/grants\/fellowship application\/use. This course is very helpful for my future research and will serve as a point of reference, as I continue with my studies\/research.",
    "It definitely broadened my horizons and I know more responsibilities when I conduct research."
