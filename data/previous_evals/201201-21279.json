   "comments": [
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Absolutely - this class is a must-take if you're interested in elections and how they are affected by campaign rules and norms. Besides that, the discussion are very interesting and the seminar is full of students involved with election campaigns or are very well-read on American politics, which makes for interesting discussion, especially given this class was taking place as the Republican presidential primaries were!",
    "Good class, will teach you a lot about elections.",
    "Election Rules& Campaign Strategy is unusual among Poli Sci seminars in that it takes empirical political science data and actually uses it to analyze real-world campaign strategies, so it's easy to see how the class material relates to what we might be doing out in the world if we become political strategists. It's a very reasonable workload (this year, only three 5-page papers and an oral presentation, with a regular Poli Sci seminar level of reading), and Professor Hersh is good about challenging people's assertions when they're contradicted by the actual data. I would certainly recommend this course to others.",
    "Take it if you want to know about the mechanics of elections. You'll learn more in this than you will in a big lecture about it. Good if you ever want to go into campaign management.",
    "This class was kind of a survey course in seminar form. We sampled a lot of different topics in elections, never delving that deep into any of them. That can be good or bad, depending on what you are looking to get out of the class. The class discussion was entertaining, and the workload was reasonable.",
    "As someone who came into this class with limited previous knowledge of elections and campaigns, I really enjoyed the broad overview the readings provided. I thought the course was well-structured, the assignments were appropriate and engaging (especially the essay requiring us to attend a campaign event), and I left the course with a solid foundation of this field in political science.",
    "If you think you might want to work in the campaign world, much of this subject matter will be very interesting stuff that you probably couldn't find elsewhere inthe department. Professor Hersh is young and has put together a syllabus and assignments that are more interesting than average. Try to size up the sophistication of your classmates early on, as this is exactly the type of professor and type of subject matter than can be prone to unproductive conversations that involve input from folks who haven't read.",
    "Would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in understanding American politics and campaigns.",
    "I'd recommend this class. I enjoyed the discussions, the material, and Professor Hersh was great. A lot of what made the class good was the fact that it took place during the Republican primary season, so I'm not sure if it will be as good in another semester. But overall, I enjoyed it and it forced me to keep up on current events, so that was a really positive side-effect and one of my main reasons for taking the course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course as an introduction to a lot of major topics in the field and getting to learn about them through a contemporary lens. Prof. Hersh is very laid-back, does very interesting scholarship himself, and is very willing to help his students learn and point them to further resources, meet during office hours, etc."
