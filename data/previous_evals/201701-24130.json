    "This course made me think in a way I haven't in other Yale classes. The intellectual rigor used in approaching sex, domestic work, emotion work, etc exceeded many of my other classes. I got to engage with theory, popular writing and books, TV shows, and academic papers, a mix of sources that befitted the interdisciplinary nature of the course.",
    "I absolutely loved this course and the material covered. I had never taken any sort of gender studies course at Yale before, and loved the use of many different types of sources and readings.",
    "In this course, I learned a fundamentally new way of thinking about work, economic value, and gender. Additionally, I learned more about developing a research project and creative use of sources."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is really varied and interesting, and I actually really liked the differences from week to week in subject. I think at times it was hard to place exactly why we were using a given work, and how we were supposed to evaluate it. That being said, the sources were really allowed to speak for themselves and as students we were forced to academically engage with things we didn't fully understand the importance of, which is a useful skill.",
    "I thought that the course was well organized on a weekly basis, and I liked that we had one or two major readings per week instead of a bunch of smaller readings. This way, in class discussions we were able to cover all of the reading instead of just mentioning a few. That way, when I was doing the reading for homework, I knew that it was actually going to come up in class and be useful for our discussions. I also liked that we had student presentations each week on the readings. Seminars can often feel long and get a little boring if you just sit around a table for two hours and discuss the readings of the week. By having class start with student presentations and powerpoints to introduce the various readings, it broke up the class period and made me stay focused longer. I also loved that each class Devin brought in extra sources or video clips that related to the readings.",
    "The strengths of this class are that it covers really interesting material and topics - especially toward the second half of the class. Another strength is setting up a system where students start their final papers early and have to submit a rough draft. A weakness of the class was class discussion. I think that occasionally there was too much reading assigned and as a result, the majority of students could not complete it and class conversation was hurt as a result.",
    "Despite it being Devin's first class, it was exceptionally strong. I can't, as I sit here, think of any obvious weaknesses in the course.",
    "This course is strong because it is cohesive, intersectional, and interdisciplinary. It pulls together a lot of threads to make an overarching argument about concepts that we too often consider to be simple or defined. However, it is hard to cover all the interesting topics that could be woven into the framework of the course in a single semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is definitely one of the more mind-altering courses I've taken at Yale, and is relevant to everyone. Something that was a real bonus was that the students in the seminar came from a bunch of different majors, which contributed to even more interesting discussions.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, especially as a non-major taking it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is interdisciplinary and is relevant to a wide range of individual areas of study and personal experience. The discussions were enjoyable and engaging and there was room to direct the course based on our interests."
