   "comments": [
    "I learned multivariable calculus.",
    "Learn many aspects of multivariable calculus. The second half of the course is focused on many, many different methods to evaluate line \/ surface integrals and the first half gives you the tools necessary to do so. We did skip some sections of the textbook which made the class less physics-based.",
    "While this course exposes students to an extreme breadth of multivariable calculus, it was taught at a very quick pace. As a result, it was harder to retain and understand material. I definitely gained the skills of self-teaching and time management on exams, as they are very long and crammed into a short about of time.",
    "A general understanding of using multivariable calculus concepts.",
    "I learned everything I expected to learn: Vector-valued functions, multivariable functions, Double and Triple Integrals, Flux Integrals, Vector Line Integrals, and more. More importantly, I learned how to work hard for a demanding course; I learned how to keep up with a fast-paced course and how to study for two midterms and a difficult final.",
    "I \"learned\" multivariable calculus, but not in a lasting or comprehensive way.",
    "I learned how to analytically approach problems and developed a great calculus foundation.",
    "Advanced mathematical analysis skills, refined problem solving skills in having to analyze questions and determine which of many routes to take to solve them.",
    "Introduction to visualizing in 3D (lines, planes, vectors), analysis of curves and surfaces (derivatives and integrals as well as applications: surface area, area under a curve, volume), non-Cartesian coordinates (cylindrical and spherical)",
    "I developed skills in problem solving and expanded my skills in abstract thinking.",
    "Understanding of linear algebra and how to approach math problems.",
    "I further developed my skills in mathematics. This course introduced me to and made me more comfortable with thinking in three dimensions. I feel it was a good transition between one-variable calculus I studied in high school to a higher level of thinking, as many ideas in multi-variable calculus were paralleled to ideas in one-variable calculus. This course allowed me to brush up on integral evaluation, while also giving me brand-new techniques to evaluate brand-new integrals. These techniques encouraged students to think about things in multiple (usually three) dimensions, and how the state of one thing relates to the state of another (ex. orientation of a surface should match the orientation of its boundary).",
    "I feel that I gained an understanding of the content of the course but not necessarily any skills or viewpoints that I had not had previously. However, I do appreciate the knowledge of multivariable calculus that this course has given me and hope that it will prove useful in the future.",
    "quantitative reasoning",
    "I developed a better ability to visualize concepts in three dimensions and worked on my general problem-solving abilities (such as choosing and following methodical procedures). I also became more computationally independent (due to not using calculators).",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "At the end of the course you will hopefully have an understanding of multivariable calculus. Ximera and Sudesh are strengths. The rest of the class is quite challenging and it is very difficult if you are part of the minority of the class who hasn't taken multi before. It could be improved by having equal quality of lectures among the sections and having the exams curved by each class instead of across all of the sections.",
    "Lots of support through chimera, office hours, and practice exams. The tests are very fair and problems sets are not busy work. Sometimes the explanation of concepts is not very thorough, but easy enough to follow that it this is not problematic.",
    "A strength of this course is that the order of units\/subjects is logical, and we never jumped to something that we hadn't learned enough to do prior. However, there are many weaknesses. There is so much information crammed into the course, that my professor was never able to finish an entire lecture. Although it would be a radical change, I believe it would be very helpful to have this class meet three 3 per week instead of just 2, in order to ensure that all of the material is taught.",
    "The course is pretty well laid out, and because it follows the textbook well, I never felt too worried. The classes are quite small (20 kids), but the small class nothing to get excited about. The classes are in a lecture format and I didn't feel like my instructor interacted too much with us. It would have made no difference to me if there were 5 or 200 other students in the class at a time. The homework is relatively useful.",
    "The classes could be less problem-driven and more explanatory. We can't jump straight into a problem for a topic we have barely learned, instead, let's talk about the steps we need to take first, and then attempt a first easy example (step by step).",
    "There is too much taught in a very short amount of time. The bar for entering the class is very low... in my opinion a 5 on BC calc does not equate to preparedness for this course. The professors are all nice and offer review sessions and office hours but there is simply too much information taught at too quick of a rate for true understanding. I am also appalled at the lack of practice exams provided. For each midterm and the final I did all of the Ximera practice, attended review sessions, and did the practice exams. I also attended class very consistently, more so than many of my peers. And I still felt underprepared. I truly believe that with more practice exams I would have succeeded with much more confidence. I'm not sure how many years Math 120 has existed, but I assume there is much more material that can be provided (more than only two practice exams per large exam). And at that, many times this year the practice exams had questions that were marked \"You don't have to know this!\", making the exams less than a full exam anyway. I'm not sure why HELPFUL review materials that would allow students to succeed more are being withheld.",
    "Better explanations\/teaching",
    "Strengths: Well paced, enjoyable content Weaknesses: Lectures could become dull at times",
    "Besides lectures, Ximera modules, practice exams, and review sessions prior to each test were all extremely useful resources that students at all levels of understanding could learn from. (The difficulty of the practice exams did not always correlate to the difficulty of the actual exams.) The course is entirely application based, which means the theory behind why things work the way they do is not entirely covered in class. This means that a lot of the theorems are simply memorized, as opposed to understood.",
    "The course could be more effectively taught if it was taught the same way, with the same exercises and with the students receiving the same number of materials\/handouts. The course is taught in so many different ways by different teachers, making it harder for students to know and practice what they are missing\/do not fully understand.",
    "Learning isn't enforced with a deep understanding of the problems, making the tests harder than the lessons.",
    "Strengths: course material is very well-organized, many resources for studying (i.e. endless practice problems with Ximera, many practice tests, helpful review sessions\/problem sessions) Weaknesses: difficult to find many quality teachers because it's such a largely-subscribed course",
    "I felt that the course moved too fast and that there was too much of a disparity between different instructors. We would often be taught a new topic without having it framed or contextualized in a helpful way, so it was difficult to understand how to use the new equation that our instructor had written on the board or why we were learning it. Ultimately, I did not find the classes that helpful; I feel that I wound up teaching myself much of the material outside of class using Ximera or the textbook or other resources. On that note, one strength of the course is the availability of other resources.",
    "I like the small class size",
    "I think the strength and weakness of this course are the same: its fast pace. The speed at which we covered material was challenging in a good way and felt productive, but it also created the opportunity for some concepts to be left not fully explained."

   "comments": [
    "No, however if you are taking it you probably have to for a pre req or major. I would not recommend this course especially if you haven't taken multi before. If you must take it, try to find a good professor- read the reviews of professors very carefully.",
    "Yes! If you have already taken multi it will all be a review but can be a good QR, or a good way to strengthen your calc skills before going further in the math department. Sometimes the concepts can be difficult to understand if you haven't already been exposed to the material but nothing is too hard. Problem sets are very manageable and you will do fine on exams as long as you have a basic understanding of the material.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class if you want to do it \"just for fun.\" It is definitely a challenge, and not particularly intellectually stimulating. Most STEM majors require this class, and if you have to take it, then just know it won't be the easiest class in the world. If you are between taking MATH 115 and MATH 120, then I would suggest taking MATH 115 because it is really important to have a strong foundation in single variable calculus before taking this class.",
    "It's a fine course, but you probably have to take it at some point of Yale regardless of wether or not I recommend it. It's a standard math course. It doesn't need to be anything spectacular, and it does a fine job of accomplishing what it needs to.",
    "Even though there's a lot of room for improvement, I would still recommend this course with a warning that they're going to have to put in a lot of work outside of the classroom.",
    "No, I would not. I took this class because I ADORED mathematics in high school. I had wonderful teachers with a lot of passion for math and they taught me to see the beauty in understanding and solving problems. The energy is very different in the teaching of Math 120. It definitely killed my joy for math and despite having come to Yale wanting to be a math major, I fear that this course was indicative of the attitude towards mathematics at Yale, hence steering me away from the idea of the major.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student and I would encourage them to take advantage of all the online resources available to them.",
    "Only if you are required to take this course",
    "Definitely! It is a foundational course for upper-level mathematics that I found was taught wonderfully to administer my knowledge development.",
    "Yes. Math 120 is a pre-requisite for many majors. Beyond that, multivariate calculus has introduced me to many new concepts that I found interesting (especially visualizing in 3D). The level of teaching varies section by section so it is important to find a good lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, but it depends on which instructor is teaching the class.",
    "Maybe but there aren't enough good teachers for this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who likes math. There is a lot of fun mathy stuff going on, but I would not recommend this course to someone who is trying to explore math because it is very computational and would not be very interesting to people who would like to find out cool things about math (I think?? trying to put myself into the shoes of a non-math-lover).",
    "Yes, because it's a useful course and necessary for many other interesting and important courses, but I would not recommend it as a fun or engaging course but rather as a course you can't really get around taking in many disciplines.",
    "yes! the material is clearly presented and the course is well-taught",
    "I wouldn't strongly recommend this course, but I wouldn't discourage others from taking it eitherit's not the most interesting course (at least to me), but for a prerequisite to many majors and foundation to a lot of classes, I think it is a good course to take."
