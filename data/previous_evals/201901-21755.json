    "The strength is Professor Muravnik and his supply of interesting facts and nuances when explaining the Russian language, especially in the grammar topics. Perhaps there could just be more clarity on what day we will discuss what homework so that we can be fully prepared.",
    "Loved this course! Constantine is fantastic. You improve speaking and reading a lot; I wished we had done more work on non-academic subjects that come up more often in organic conversations.",
    "Constantine is great, and I think the content we covered was really good for me, but I think the syllabus is just over ambitious, especially since Constantine doesn't really enforce deadlines. It's really easy to just put off doing Russian homework once your other classes get busy, knowing that Constantine won't really hold you accountable for it and that you probably won't finish everything you were supposed to in class anyway, but I really wish I had felt more pressure to put the time into Russian, because I wanted to but would just consistently let it slip to do work for other classes that I knew would be graded more harshly.",
