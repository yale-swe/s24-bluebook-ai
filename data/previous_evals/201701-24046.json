    "In terms of classification, while this course indeed counts for a writing credit, I don't think my writing particularly benefited from taking this class. The day-to-day work was tedious; in-class quizzes going over reading from the night before felt unnecessary, and turned the essentially converted otherwise interesting essays and articles into assignments of memorization. In addition, I felt as though Professor Wright's comments on my essay had little to do with an actual critique of my writing, but rather more of a personal gripes about of my own style of taking the course in general."
