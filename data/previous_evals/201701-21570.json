    "I learned about the different philosophers and thinkers that have contributed to political philosophy throughout history.",
    "I have learned very interesting political philosophy concepts.",
    "Thought provoking class. This was my first political philosophy class, ever. I thought the material was interesting, the readings were occasionally pretty dry, though.",
    "I learned multiple approaches to the question of whether we can find a moral basis for political systems; especially those stemming from Enlightenment reason.",
    "Overview of different approaches from enlightenment to mid 19th century of moral political philosophy.",
    "I developed an understanding of the theories of a range of foundational political thinkers. Specifically, I learned about the progression of the Enlightenment theories, Marxism, social contract and natural rights, as well as anti-Enlightenment beliefs and Democracy.",
    "Solid poli sci",
    "MOFOPO is an excellent survey of what makes government legitimate. It examines the Enlightenment, anti-Enlightenment, and democratic traditions in reasonable depth. I had never studied philosophers before and this felt like an excellent introduction. The writing intensive version requires considerable introspection and significant thought if you want to write a good essay (which I would say is a very good thing). The class left me with what is probably a healthier level of moral uncertainty. Perhaps the most intellectually stimulating class I've taken yet at Yale because it helps you see so many of notions implicit in your own thought about human rights, science, and democracy.",
    "We talked about the major political philosophy traditions that have occurred over the past few centuries, beginning with the Enlightenment, and then progressing to the Anti-Enlightenment and finally democracy. We talked a lot about the origins of modern political argumentation and different ways of thinking about problems\/solutions in society.",
    "I learned how to think about things that I have not previously thought about.",
    "I learned about Enlightenment, Anti-Enlightenment, and Democratic political philosophy.",
    "Gained a sense of many types of arguments and ideas in political philosophy, as well as some argumentative and logical skills.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundational ideas in political philosophy--from Marx and Locke, to Nozick and Rawls.",
    "You can't wring the politics out of politcs",
    "I learned how to analyze complex philosophical viewpoints and apply them to modern day political dilemmas.",
    "This course was a comprehensive introduction to various political theories and their many applications throughout history and in the present day. I explored the Enlightenment thinkers John Locke and Thomas Hobbes, covered Marx's criticisms of the free market, and pondered the classical and neoclassical utilitarian modes of thought. This course made me realize how difficult it is to construct a society that takes into account both equality and individual rights. Too much of one or the other has resulted in much political conflict throughout history. This course taught me, however, how important it is to pursue both when trying to run any society.",
    "I learned a lot about the Enlightenment and political philosophy.",
    "An intro to philosophy and political thought.",
    "Knowledge: Basic summary knowledge of a number of different political philosophers from different traditions (e.g. Enlightenment, Anti-Enlightenment, etc) Skills: Synthesizing large amounts of that information into very very basic arguments Insights: You can't take the politics out of politics",
    "I learned the reasoning behind the moral philosophies at the heart of major political theories. I developed a much more profound understanding of the thinkers I had previously studied (John Locke, Thomas Hobbes) and gained a deep knowledge of those I hadn't ever studied (Kant, Nozick, Rawls).",
    "I learned a lot about different political theorists and how they incorporate notions of morality and justice into their political systems. More importantly, I learned how these ideas relate to one another, and different ways they can be categorized.",
    "Intro political philosophy course with basic real-world applications",
    "Foundation of politics and overview of major political theorists",
    "None",
    "I have developed my intellectual skills, looking beyond what my be inherently obvious to analyze an issue from multiple facets.",
    "Critical thinking and applying theories to everyday life.",
    "Introduction to philosophies of major political philosophers and theorists from John Locke to modern day. Skills included crafting an argumentative political essay, critically analyzing philosophy, and building an argument around pre-existing arguments. Helpful introductory course.",
    "Great intro to foundational philosophy of western politics. I had no background in philosophy or political theory before this course, and found it very valuable",
    "Gained knowledge about many philosophers an an ability to map their theories onto more practical issues.",
    "This class is a great intro to political science! Professor Shapiro makes you think, and is an interesting lecturer who explains content well!",
    "I learned a lot about some of the most influential Western political thinkers in recent history, which changed the way I think about how the individual relates to and interacts with society.",
    "I learned a lot about the Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment, as well as prominent thinkers during those times. By being exposed to different theories and ways of thinking about utility or the social contract, I also became a much more critical thinker.",
    "I learned a lot of useful information about various political ideologies from major theories. Moreover, I learned how to apply these ideologies to everyday political conflicts and modern political events.",
    "I learned a lot of philosophical schools of thought and explored concepts I had never thought about before. This is basically an introduction to philosophy, applied to government, and I thought that was a very good way to go about learning it. It was not so abstract, but didn't compromise in learning the actual basis of the different philosophical branches.",
    "This was the first political science course I have ever taken so it opened my eyes to new ways of thinking and analyzing.",
    "This course provided me with a foundational knowledge of political philosophy and taught me how to apply the concepts to a modern society. It also taught me the foundations of modern governments and why they are they way they are."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were that it was very informational and the information was easily accessible. The only weakness was that sometimes lectures can be a little difficult to follow.",
    "Professor Shapiro is very interesting and does a good job teaching the course. Needs better TF's.",
    "Lots of reading. Thought provoking.",
    "I enjoyed hearing Professor Shapiro lecture because he included interesting stories in his lectures.",
    "Professor Shapiro provides an overarching narrative within which we can situate multiple complex, heterogenous ideas. The course was selective in reading and provided a very manageable load. Sections were sometimes very disappointing, however: I believe expectations of doing readings and citing from them to make substantive arguments could have been set early in the course.",
    "As a grad student auditing this course there were no sections we could go to - I do suspect there would be enough grad students who are interested in the course that it could have been useful with say two discussion sections with some theme... Just a thought. If I was doing the course I would add some of the more recent works on what one might call the psychology of morality - e.g. Jonathan Haidt on how we do morality in practice in his book \"The Righteous Mind\" or maybe Joshua Greene on moral incompatibility in his book \"Moral Tribes\". Also seems to me the fundamental discussion of what do we consider to be moral domains was never made really explicit - though it of course runs through the whole course.",
    "Professor Shapiro's course did a great job covering a whole range of political theory, from the Enlightenment and the anti-Enlightenment, to Marxism and Democracy. As a political science major, I think it is very useful to have this introduction to the foundational concepts of the field. One weakness of the course was that sometimes the lectures were a bit hard to follow, as the Professor jumped from one person to the next without always fully explaining how they correlated. It was easy to get lost. However, section was very helpful in clarifying much of the information.",
    "Great lectures. Solid everywhere else",
    "Professor Shapiro is an incredibly engaging lecturer. He elucidates highly complex ideas in a way that doesn't oversimplify. Despite his immense intelligence and experience (and they really are immense in pretty much any context), he seems very willing to consider what students have to say; he often asks the class's opinion and really does listen. I looked forward to the lecture each week and truly enjoyed the readings. The teaching fellows for this course were superb. The readings could be slightly more balanced - some days there would be very little reading and some days there would be nearly one hundred pages of relatively technical work (then again an efficient study would probably find a way to plan for this).",
    "The strengths were that lectures were always very interesting and Professor Shapiro was BRILLIANT! The weaknesses were that Professor Shapiro seemed too often to insert his own opinion or twist on the course, which seemed inappropriate in an intro political science course, and the balance of how much time we spent per topic seemed odd.",
    "Definitely the discussion sections, the one I was in was terrible and that made a difference when trying to understand the course material.",
    "The lectures present the material incredibly clearly. I do not think I was ever confused after leaving one of Professor Shapiro's lectures because he broke down the information in a concrete, approachable manner.",
    "The course gives a very good introduction of the many different ideas and theories in political philosophy, and is taught in a very clear and logical way. I am especially a fan of Ian Shapiro's overarching theme. However, in terms of what we are actually graded on (particularly for the writing intensive students, and the final) I think that the course does not necessarily aid in that aspect. What I mean is that the course gives us more knowledge of different arguments and theories, but I never really felt like it taught us how to make our own specific arguments.",
    "Great lectures, and interesting mix of philosophers. Only sometimes wish there was less reading so I could really focus in on each reading.",
    "Lecture and section were both interesting and helpful, open note exams were great.",
    "Readings could be more engaging and related to the course",
    "This course's greatest strength was its accessibility to complete novices in the area of political philosophy. The course was understandable, engaging, and clear. However the amount of reading assigned increased too quickly toward the end of the semester and became impractical.",
    "Strength: The corse provided a very thorough introduction to philosophy. Weakness: the presentation of the philosophers was often presented in a way to advance the professors argument which resulted in only a surface level understanding of some philosophers",
    "Weaknesses: You'll only get anything out of this course if you take it writing credit. Otherwise don't take it; you have 36 credits at Yale and this just doesn't deserve to be one of them.",
    "On the whole, I feel that I gained a real, deep, vital understanding of many major philosophers and political thinkers thanks to this course, and that is immediately a strength. This course's lectures were extremely informative, and they are led by Professor Ian Shapiro, one of today's leading democratic theorists, which means we are learning from someone with profound experience in the study of political theory and philosophy. I felt that I learned a great deal from Professor Shapiro and his lectures. I did think, however, that the lecture could be a bit slow at times and that the PowerPoint presentations could be a bit confusing (I explain those in detail in the questions below), but those are small problems with easy fixes.",
    "The course readings and lectures were extremely useful, well-balanced, and manageable. I would not change anything about how it is taught.",
    "Strengths: Well-strucutred, engaging lectures, great material Wekanesses: Costly textbook, minimal student-professor interaction",
    "Strengths: resources, section Weaknesses: super vague final",
    "It's not well organized or deep, very shallow glance at philosophy. However, it's a good first survey",
    "Strengths: very informative, lecture slides posted online, weekly section, interesting readings. Weaknesses: lectures not always particularly engaging, very large, TF's varied in quality and teaching style, reading greatly varied in length and difficulty week-by-week (sometimes unmanageable). This class could be improved by spreading the readings out to be more consistent week to week and having more interaction between students and the professor during lecture.",
    "Section with Armando was great, really fantastic way to discuss theory and improve understanding. lecture was very helpful too.",
    "My TA was much harder than the TA of a makeup section I attended was. It felt like there were unfair advantages in this regard. The course itself is very interesting and well organized, though.",
    "This course is a great intro to political science- take it if your interested in getting a general overview of the theories that underlie our system of government!",
    "The courses strengths are in the flow of the course. The way Professor Shapiro structures it, approaching it not purely chronologically but instead in a logical progression through the Enlightenment (including early enlightenment, social contract and marx), Anti-enlightenment and then a discussion of democracy makes the course material easy to track and understand. One weakness of the course is that perhaps it could be a bit more intimately linked with contemporary\/realistic political issues. In section, we sometimes looked at how the political theories we were discussing related to topics such as abortion or euthanasia; however, this could perhaps be done more, maybe during the lectures as a way of engaging the students and making the content more relatable and engaging (that's not to say that it isn't very engaging already!).",
    "For the writing-intensive course, I think that there could be more papers during the semester because I felt like I understood best the thinkers assigned to papers and with whom I interacted. There could be additional shorter papers or another means of interacting with the thinkers, apart from just reading their pieces and talking about them in section.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! Since we learn SO MUCH throughout the semester, I really appreciated the open-note exams. They were more about application and less about regurgitation of information. I do wish that some of the lecture slides were a bit less wordy and there were more opportunities for grading. I took the class without a writing credit, and I was really nervous about the fact that my grades essentially hinged upon a midterm and final.",
    "Strengths are that the syllabus is well thought out and lectures are very interesting. Weakness is that my section didn't help that much, and if I didn't understand something after both lecture and section, I didn't really feel like I had a way of learning it (although there may have been resources I didn't use)",
    "This course may be improved if accompanied by a historical textbook as most of the class is based on the work of past philosophers.",
    "To be completely honest, Professor Shapiro was not engaging whatsoever. I found him to be monotone and quite boring, as well as being unapproachable. The format of the course was also not conducive to learning as the slides didn't even provide information when one was not inclined to listen to Professor Shapiro. The readings were dense and hard to process. Section was the only strength of this course, the saving grace."

   "comments": [
    "I believe that any student that is interested about the way that American politics has come to be should take this course.",
    "I wouldn't not recommend it, but it was not one of my favorite courses.",
    "Easy class if you are vaguely interested in the material. Worth your time if you are looking for an overview of moral\/ethical philosophy.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone that is not interested in philosophy. I thought this course would be more about applying the principles of political philosophy to case studies.",
    "I would certainly recommend it: the Professor is highly accomplished and the questions asked are relevant to all students as future citizens of states, regardless of major. However, note that what you take out of it is what you put in; skipping the (light) reading load simply means wasting the learning opportunities.",
    "I would indeed recommend it. Though as mentioned earlier if there were enough grad students auditing the course I'd consider whether it would be worth a few section style discussions during the semester.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning about the foundational theories of politics. You will learn about various political theorists and will gain an understanding of the progression of the Enlightenment theories, Marxism, social contract and natural rights, as well as anti-Enlightenment arguments and Democracy. In all honesty, the lectures were sometimes difficult to follow. Although Professor Shapiro used a PPT, he often skipped from one example to the next, and it was easy to get lost in the barrage of information. However, section was very helpful for clarifying much of the information. It is worth noting that, if you don't choose the writing option, your final is worth half of your grade. It is a 3.5 hour written exam consisting of one essay question, and there is only ONE option to choose from. Just keep this in mind, as your final can make or break your grade if the question just doesn't happen to go your way.",
    "Great intro to polisci class",
    "150%. The material is good and so relevant. Listening to Professor Shapiro is an excellent experience and his TFs are often just as fascinating.",
    "Yes! It's a good intro class in political philosophy-esque thinking if you're looking to try something like that.",
    "Do not take this course unless you are really interested in philosophy and really looking into what thinkers really meant. Choose right your discussion section because that definitely was a factor for not enjoying the course.",
    "Yes, not only does the class teach students basic political philosophy, it helps students begin to question how and why political institutions operate in certain ways.",
    "I recommend this course for those interested in Political philosophy. It gives a great and expansive introduction, without going too in depth into any one thinker or idea. However, I may have enjoyed the course more if I had taken it non-writing.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course--and not only to those who need it as a major requirement, but to anyone at Yale. If you want to know the basics of political philosophy, and to be able to engage in conversations about political theory as applied to current issues, take this course!",
    "Yes, especially if they are interested in philosophy or politics.",
    "I was quite depressed by the end of the semester because I didn't do most of the readings (although I attended most lectures) and I felt I only half-understood the concepts in the course. I took the class writing non-intensive and had other priorities so I didn't spend too much time for the course (thinking of it now, taking the class writing-intensive seems like a a good option if you have the time to do so and want to learn the theories more in-depth). I had no idea what was going on even by the date of the final review session, but during the few days before the exam I reviewed my notes and the Moral Foundations of Politics book (I think reviewing notes is a better strategy but this might be good way if you end up being as inconfident as I was in what was going on in class) and realized I had actually learned quite a lot from the class. Although I'm not sure whether Professor Shapiro's lectures are necessarily the best way to teach introductory political philosophy, having a great TA (I would recommend shopping a few different sections to get the best TA) helped me get a fairly good grasp of the important fundamental concepts in political science.",
    "This course is super fun. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you're looking for a good writing credit.",
    "This is a great intro to political philosophy. Professor Shapiro provides a smart and interesting frame for the course, and lectures in a way that really challenges you and shows you the strengths and weaknesses of different ways of thinking. Nothing not to like, you'll enjoy it if you take it.",
    "Yes, i enjoyed the course",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a solid introduction to the political sciences. This course's focus on morality in politics is central to all political science.",
    "I would heartily recommend this course to any student who is looking to understand basic political terms that are frequently thrown around: utilitarian, Marxist, Lockean, and to any student who is interested in what makes a government legitimate. Really a phenomenal course.",
    "Absolutely--it was an extremely elucidating intro to political philosophy.",
    "Definitely, it completely changed my perspective only politics and discourse",
    "Unless you take it writing credit, you won't really get much out of this course. There is a midterm and final, and neither require much studying to begin with. You also don't need to do the readings; the TA's in the course explicitly said that the readings aren't even necessary to do well on the examinations or anything - you would only really have to do them if you were taking the course writing credit. In other words, there aren't too many opportunities to engage with the material, so there are much better options for you if you really want to take an intro poli sci course.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. Shapiro is an amazing lecturer. Whether or not your taking it for a major requirement, or simply as an SO credit, this course is a wonderful introduction to political philosophy.",
    "Favorite course I have taken so far at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because you will learn the underlying rationale for the moral\/political philosophies that are at the heart of some of the most important political theories in history. It is a vital knowledge that will help you in your study of not only political science and philosophy but also history and economics. If you are a philosophy major, a political science major, or an EP&E major, there may be other courses that could replace Moral Foundations of Politics as an introduction to the field. I wouldn't necessarily say that you ought to set those to the side in order to take this class, especially if those courses focus on a more specific subject or set of thinkers that you prefer, but this is a good place to start.",
    "Yes, the lectures and readings are great and the workload is manageable. Shapiro is engaging and a lot of the theory is very interesting, and it feels like very relevant foundational knowledge. A great political philosophy class.",
    "Good general knowledge that's applicable today",
    "Yes I would, this course was a good introduction to philosophy and essential for political science majors.",
    "Yes I would. I enjoyed this class a lot.",
    "This is a really great course if you're interested in an introduction to political philosophy. We covered Bentham, Mills, Rawls, Nozick, Marx, Burke, Madison, and some othe people. It is very much an overview course, but the papers are great for letting you dig deeper - they are really were a lot of the learning occurs. I didn't find this course too too difficult. Section was always interesting and helpful, and the papers aren't too bad if you meet with your TF to discuss your arguments beforehand.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student interested in political philosophy or looking for a foundation course for Ethics, Politics, and Economics. It is interesting and informative, but sometimes the material can get a little dry if you're not particularly interested in political philosophy. I would recommend taking it with a friend with whom you can review the (often dense) readings every week.",
    "Yes, it gave me a valuable understanding of relevant topics in modern society, and I am very happy I took it.",
    "Yes -- as long as theyre willing to engage fully in the material.",
    "A good overview of political science- no more, no less- if you aren't taking it writing intensive it is very little work- just a midterm and final!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, because it introduced me to so many ideas and perspectives on how society is governed which I had never considered before. It is an important class to understand the roots of our contemporary western liberal democratic government and the problems and advantages associated with it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who wants to be more knowledgeable about political philosophy because I had never really been exposed to or learned about political philosopher or different Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment thinkers. Professor Shapiro is also a phenomenal professor and makes lectures very engaging and accessible to all students, regardless of their backgrounds in political philosophy.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I thought it was fascinating, and these are concepts that you will be glad to know about and know how to think about",
    "I would recommend this course for other people who want an introduction to political thought.",
    "No, probably not, unless they had a passion for political philosophy."
