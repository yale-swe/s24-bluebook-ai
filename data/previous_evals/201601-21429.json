   "comments": [
    "LITR 122 was a really great class. You read all sorts of poetry (short lyric, long epic, drama) from all over the world (European, Persian, African, Asian, etc) and from a huge range of time periods (from poetry written on stone tablets to pretty modern stuff). This was a really small seminar with 2 professors and 7 students, so discussion participation was easy and encouraged, even if you're an introvert who normally doesn't speak in class. I also thought this class was accessible enough that I felt comfortable in it, even as the only science major. The professors are incredible and put a lot of time and thought into giving you feedback on your essays and leading class discussion. You'll get to know them pretty well throughout the semester which is awesome. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Kind teachers, nice readings, somewhat boring discussion.",
    "I would summarize this class as one where we study literature from various cultures, and how this literature reflects the culture it comes from. I would definitely recommend it to other students! The readings are interesting, and mostly material I don't think most students would have heard of.",
    "Take it if you want to read some cool texts that are often talked about or referred to in popular culture, and want to expand your literary horizons. Workload is not too much, and it's an enjoyable class.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone, especially if it is taught by Katie Trumpener and\/or Katerina Clark. Even if the topic of \"world literature\" catches your suspicion, you will find that the course is thoroughly grounded through Professor Trumpener's lectures on the social, historical and material contexts of each text."
