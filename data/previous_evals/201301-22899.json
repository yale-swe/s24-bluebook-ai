   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy art, yes. If all you want to do is arts and crafts, no.",
    "Not that much work, it gets disorganized at times. If that does not bother you and you are interested in art I would take it again. Some days you will get bored, but others it is the most amazing thing.",
    "It is a very interesting class, it has a smaller work load than many other yale classes but it is not a gut class. The projects require time to complete outside of class and there is a research paper and weekly readinging. Take this class if you want a small class size and an interesting experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend Paper to another student, as it was a very enjoyable class. The workload is not hard, and if the topic and the prospect of studio time is appealing, then it is definitely worth your time. The final research paper was enjoyable to write, as there was a lot of freedom in what our topic could be.",
    "Having never taken an art class at Yale before, I have to say that Paper was a great experience for me. I really enjoyed the combination of artistic studio work and museum tours that gave a comprehensive impression of the art world. Actually making paper was incredible, and I liked our trip into New York to visit world-renowned art institutions. I would highly recommend Paper to another student \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was a fun but instructive class.",
    "I would recommend others shop the class, and experience it for themselves. It is indeed a very interesting class, and as a freshman seminar, should provide first-years with a unique experience. However, I do not recommend anyone take it with Elana Herzog.",
    "I would not recommend this if you are looking for an intro art class at Yale. It provides little artistic growth or creative outlet. Most of the projects turn into an attempt to meet the instructor's confusing directions. If you want to stay quiet and accept unwarranted criticism then this class is relatively easy.The workload includes one long paper, weekly reading responses, and hard to follow take-home projects."
