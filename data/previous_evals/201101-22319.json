    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The work load is completely doable and the subject material is relevant and really interesting. The class was basically an exploration of sexuality and gender through various modes of African-American art and culture.",
    "This class is basically a collection of different films, music, visual art, and literature that all deal with Black sexuality. The topic really interests me, so I may be a little biased, but I do think this is a class everyone should try to take if they are at all interested in African American studies, sexuality, or just want to read some good books. I never regretted the 9:25am class, because I looked forward to some great discussions. Also, the work load was completely manageable. There was one paper (about 8 pages) a class presentation, and a final creative project. The reading could be a little heavy at times, but it was interesting and well worth it.",
    "Summary: The course African American Sexuality in Literature and Pop Culture integrates novels, analytical essays and texts, films, and music into a larger discussion concerning sexual identity of Blacks in the United States and beyond.I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As some one who would have considered themselves relatively well versed in African American culture before taking this course I still learned tons of new information during this course. I developed new ways of thinking and coming at different issues as well as analytical and writing skills. Also, the intimacy of the seminar setting allows for a more in depth exploration of the materials. Our class was relatively diverse and as a result everyone had something unique to bring to the discussions which benefited everyone.",
    "If nothing else it's a great bunch of reading. Every topic is engaging and elicits strong feelings, so every class is interesting.",
    "It was basically a class on how sexuality is viewed in modern times and where these views come from. I recommend it 1520%! The readings were good, the discussions were very interesting, and the professor is great!",
    "I highly recommend this class with the caveat that you have to be sure you are interested in the topic. Professor Avilez is great and isn't a really hard grader and this year there was the option to do a creative project in the end, which was fun.",
    "The class was interesting. Occasionally I found that some of the literature we read lacked sophistication, but for the most part it was a fun and engaging syllabus. The teacher is helpful and excited to engage in interesting class discussion. The readings and films did seem a bit random however, and I felt that the syllabus's reading could have culminated into more of a coherent conclusion on race and sexuality issues. If the student is interested in dabbling in various ideas about this and getting a taste of it, then this class is more for him\/her.",
    "A look at sex and sexuality in African American communities through literature, film, art, popular music and popular culture. I would definitely recommend this class to another student -- it's fun and interesting. Even I didn't mind waking up at 9:25 for it. In fact, I looked forward to the class every week!",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT. most interesting class at yale. only class i'd ever wake up at 9:25am on a thursday for"
