    "Computer Networks is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is fascinating - you learn how the internet and a bunch of other systems work. We covered system architecture, implementation, scalability, and a lot of other things that are important considerations in real life. Prof. Yang is a very engaging lecturer and he clearly puts a LOT of effort into his presentations.The workload is definitely more than most classes here, but it's not absolutely nuts. The written assignments are easy and the first programming assignment is just a warm up. We had two more programming ones - web servers and TCP. The web server assignment just has a lot of stuff to do, but it's not that difficult conceptually, and we get a lot of starter code for it. The TCP assignment is ridiculously tough though (def. way more than LZW) - there is just so much to take care of and maintain, and it took a while before I was confident that I understood what was happening. Nonetheless, it was a very rewarding assignment, and I learned a ton during the process.In short, definitely take this course or anything else by Prof. Yang. Just an amazing experience.",
    "This is a fantastic course! I never really understood the Internet and various networking protocols before, but now I feel like I have a solid grasp on the fundamentals. You learn about architecture, get to do probabilistic analyses, learn about multithreading and synchronization, and get to implement various protocols. Prof. Yang's lectures are always very interesting; he is a very energetic and good lecturer, too, and you have the opportunity to ask lots of questions and participate a lot in class. The two programming assignments in this class are VERY MASSIVE, so start them early, brainstorm with friends, and ask questions!",
    "tl;dr: One of best CS electives: intense, but take it!Learn a variety there is to learn about networking: from the application-layer (HTTP, web servers) to the lowest, infrastructure levels (e.g. routing (BGP), TCP\/UDP, IP) and theoretical aspects (queuing theory). It is a LOT.But this is the best CS class I've taken so far at Yale. The explanations are clear and applicable regardless of whether you're building web apps or doing research. Yang is a clear lecturer, the lecture slides (which are partly Yang's work, but also partly the textbook's I think) are amazing, and the (time-consuming) assignments really help you understand what you're learning. It also helps you see how software is architected, and also applies a bunch of concepts from other classes! (Bellman-Ford, anyone?)",
    "If you're a CS major, you'd be a fool not to take this class. So much of what we do now has to do with networks and the internet. Professor Yang makes the class interesting, and the material easy to understand. The projects are fun and are graded pretty leniently. All-in-all this is a really great class.",
    "A programming and theory intensive introduction to computer networks. Great instructor. Definitely take it.",
    "Yes. You'll learn what you need to know about networks, and do some awesome programming in the process. The programming assignments are time consuming, but the class is not as bad as 323 and not nearly as bad as Operating Systems in terms of difficulty and workload.",
    "Be prepared to work. A lot. There really isn't much of an excuse for the workload in this class, but it was incredibly interesting. I started off knowing nothing about networks and by the midway point had coded a server (well, several) with better throughput than Apache. That should give you a decent idea of the workload, the second programming assignment was to write 5 server programs and analyze the throughput. The big one was a TCP-layer clone which was incredibly challenging but very rewarding ultimately. You will be prepared if you took 223\/323, but know that the work load for each assignment is like a final project for most classes. Also, everything is in java, which I didn't know going in, but could pick up quickly because I had a lot of prior object-oriented experience. If you don't know java already or aren't familiar with object-oriented coding, consider that you'll be writing complicated programs fairly quickly while teaching yourself a new language.",
    "Good class with a very well prepared professor... The amount you learn is incredible. A lot of work but definitely worth it, although the late penalty can be ridiculous",
    "Do it! Aside from a small number of really tough assignments, the class is really fun. Prof Yang does a great job of walking you through a lot of the basic design decisions of all the systems you'll study. I really learned a lot from this course.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Even if you are remotely interested on the fringe applications of the Internet, Professor Yang will find a way to engage you. Don't worry about the tough assignments, everybody struggles and the curve is your friend. Do not pass up an opportunity to take one of the most exciting CS courses Yale has to offer."
