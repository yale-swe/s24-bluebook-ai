   "comments": [
    "It was great and the lab was good for practicing concepts.",
    "I think that the class gives a solid background of different types of regression and distributions (particularly linear regressions). Some classes were more useful than others.",
    "More theory in non-parametric forms would have been useful, or better suited for the first half of the course to coincide with other courses like Epi 2. Linear regression was thoroughly covered and I now feel strongly capable of both modeling and interpreting such models.",
    "This was a wonderful course. It taught statistical and other mathematical concepts with clarity, giving me a foundation for statistical thinking that I can now use to fill in with more complex mathematics if I choose. It also emphasized the importance of interpretation, which is really the heart of statistics and data analysis.",
    "I waived this class, not sure",
    "good",
    "Strength is that the course contains a lot of important statistics skills with a brilliant instructor. I think the biggest weakness was that there was no exam this year, and I feel like I ended up learning not as much as I could've. I highly recommend for the pedagogical purpose to have the exams back in the future.",
    "The main weakness of this course is the instruction. Professor Zelterman is a caring and kind person, but his teaching style is a bit unorganized. It might be helpful to have powerpoints or something to create more structure in the class and facilitate learning. The textbook is very helpful. The lab assignments are useful for applying concepts learned in class.",
    "I learned a lot and it was excited to apply SAS\/R.",
    "strengths: I have a clear understanding of the concepts and how to use those indicators to make and evaluate a regression weaknesses: it would be better if there are online answers for all exercises of each chapter",
    "Strength: Prof. Zelterman's textbook is really helpful! Weakness: 1. However his class is not 2. It's a morning class",
    "I think that this course did a great job in preparing me with the basics o biostatistics. I think the instructor did a sufficient job in conveying some of the troubles of working with real data.",
    "Such a laid-back way to learn statistics. I loved it.",
    "Strengths: weekly lab reports = a good way to apply statistical knowledge learned from class\/textbook to answer practice problems; you can practice writing in statistical language;",
    "Strengths - learned a lot of useful statistics skills (SAS and R), course focused more on understanding the statistical concepts rather than the nitty-gritty codes Weaknesses - course was too easy and slowly paced (especially compared to first semester), very little motivation to attend class or review material in the absence of a midterm or final",
    "Informative, but in serious need of structuring and coordination with other core courses (epi 2, aame)",
    "Strengths - the change to not having midterms and finals to focus on R was great because it allowed people to focus on the labs and learn for the sake of learning. Weakness - While I liked the fact that we focused on just learning by switching to R, I do wish there were more R classes."

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0A really great course, and Prof. Zelterman is a wonderful teacher who really cares that his students understand the material. Always available for questions, and very good at explaining complicated concepts. His passion for statistics is contagious, and I really wish he taught more stat courses at Yale...",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is nice, helpful, approachable, and brilliant.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a really nice professor who strives to do right by the students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman enjoys the subject and knows it very well, but does lack some structure in lecture. However, the TAs of the course were very helpful and clarified any problems that arose from the occasional lack of structure.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professors Zelterman is just fantastic. He is a talented lecturer, extremely thoughtful, willing to field questions, and has a real gift for helping students understand complicated concepts more clearly and simply. Perhaps most important, he creates an atmosphere in the classroom that is open to questioning and learning, and he truly makes no question unwelcome. This is especially wonderful for those of us who have in the past been shamed for asking \"stupid\" questions when it comes to mathematics and statistics. His classroom is truly a space for learning, no holds barred.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Nice Professor",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor is brilliant, although more structure to the class would improve the teaching. Maybe have students do the R together with the instructor instead of just passively watching or not spending too much time on R during class, and have students know what their expectations are from the class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is a very kind and caring professor, but his explanations and organization could be improved.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was very knowledgeable about the course and very passionate!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0instructor's explanations of concepts are clearly enough to understand",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Same as last one",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Amazing!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I think the instructor did a sufficient job in conveying some of the troubles of working with real data.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I wish that the professor would drop the women-are-violinists-and-men-are-bassists-because-men-have-bigger-hands example, though. A) Gender isn't a binary. B) Most of that discrepancy is due to sociological factors, not physical factors. He also commented on how sports might not play well as an example because there were so many women in the class. I could do without all the stereotypical gender references in general.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths - explained concepts clearly (but at many times, a bit too slowly and simplistically) Weaknesses - I disliked that Professor Zelterman called out students for asking questions. I don't think this was done maliciously, but it was extremely uncomfortable when, after answering my question, he would repeatedly refer back to me or my question throughout the rest of lecture.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman was always willing to answer any questions thoroughly. I enjoyed his lecturing style. He is always available in office hours and incredibly helpful in explaining concepts.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Okay lecture, very informative during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was great at explaining complicated concepts to us and he would repeat them until we understood it. The class's speed did seem a little all over the place with some topics getting a lot of coverage and others not so much."

   "comments": [
    "A great intro stats course with an awesome teacher!",
    "good class for learning how to understand regression and the proper methods of analysis. Daniel is great and the course runs smoothly.",
    "The class was run differently this year than it usually is. There were only like 20 of us and we didn't have tests. Instead, you just had to do a weekly lab write-up which wasn't that bad. A lot of material overlaps with AAMIE and Epi II.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they are interested in learning a lot of the epidemiological tools introduced in epidemiology courses. I feel my understanding of concepts like Poisson regression, or survival analysis was strengthened by this course. Professor also encourages learning and is reflected in his syllabus and organization of the class.",
    "This is a really wonderful class and I would strongly recommend it. It's an opportunity to solidify statistical concepts and sharpen your analysis and interpretive skills. If you were frustrated with the black-and-white interpretations of statistical significance etc. crammed down your throat in 505A, then look no further than 505B, where debates about analysis and interpretation are the norm, and questions are welcomed. Professor Zelterman is a gifted lecturer and teacher - Monday and Wednesday mornings were the highlight of my week.",
    "I waived this class,",
    "useful recommended",
    "This course is necessary for students pursuing careers in epidemiology. But highly recommend having exams back for the educational purpose.",
    "This class teaches some important statistical concepts. The labs are useful and you will learn a lot, but some of it will have to be self taught. Overall, the class is not very difficult but it can be boring at times.",
    "I would say that it's a great course and can provide in-depth exposure to advanced statistics!",
    "good",
    "Actually it's a helpful class to understand statistics, and practice SAS.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students. This course will not make you an expert on the subject, but it provides a sufficient base with which to build on with further courses.",
    "Definitely. Learned a lot, not too stressful.",
    "A very straightforward class. I would take it if you are looking for an easy credit and want to learn little more basic SAS or R methods. If you want a more rigorous statistics class, look elsewhere. The lectures were frustratingly slow and simple (especially compared to first semester BIS 505). The workload was extremely light: weekly discussion sections (with the lab write-up due in the following week), no midterms or finals. There was very little coding, as almost all of the SAS codes were given to us. Rather, the focus was more so on understanding statistical concepts.",
    "Basic theory behind various regression models. Frankly, not worth taking.",
    "While both Biostats and AAIME are necessary for CDE students, I don't think they should be. There was significant overlap between the two courses, and AAIME teaches the practical aspects of SAS and statistics a bit better than Biostats."
