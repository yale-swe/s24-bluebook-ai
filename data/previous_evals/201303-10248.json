    "I would recommend Math 120 to any student taking a quantitative discipline as their major. It teaches invaluable problem solving skills that are applicable far beyond the scope of calculus. Professor Wang is a great professor and the problem sets are not too difficult. There are two midterms and a final with the final composing 40% of the final grade.",
    "Most people taking this class are taking it because they have to take it, so you're unlikely to find the majority of your class to be passionate about math. For many, this is indeed the last class they will take. The result is that lectures are far more focused about how to do the problems, not why one does them that way. Few proofs, etc. You'll probably learn the material fairly well, but no guarantees.",
    "A standard introductory math class. The professor you have makes a world of a difference. I found it very hard to learn from Zhiren Wang.",
    "Terrible. I would never recommend this course to someone who doesn't have to take it for a major. The material is extremely difficult, and while there is an extensive network of help available (I went to weekly problem sessions and had a tutor) ultimately there are only one or two people in the whole network who are really good teachers.",
    "I would recommend math 120 only if someone really liked math.",
    "It is a basic multi-variable class that covers everything. Yes, I would recommend it. It gets the job done.",
    "DO NOT choose this section, come what may. Take this class if you have to, but be prepared to really have to slog."
