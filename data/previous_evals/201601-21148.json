    "A terrific class. Wonderful to carefully read through *just* Aristotle. Seems limiting, but of course we didn't come close to getting through it all. One (relatively minor) concern was that class discussion sometimes felt a bit disjointed. But overall, a very nice course. The assignments--2 small, targeted papers and 1 broader final paper--were also very helpful. Forcing yourself to do those careful reconstructions or specific arguments is very helpful. Professor Garsten is the best teacher among the political theorists at Yale. Incredibly knowledgeable, intellectually open, and dedicated to teaching, he is an absolute delight. Take whatever he is teaching. You will not be disappointed.",
    "Don't miss.",
    "This is a course that simply consists of a close reading of Aristotle's important texts with one of the most intelligent, kind, and articulate instructors at Yale. I am extremely glad that I have received a fundamental influence on the way that I view Aristotle - as well as the way that I reflect on scientific investigation - from Professor Garsten. The only negative is the large class size, but the course's high demand speaks to Professor Garsten's quality. It is a beautiful, foundational course that I highly recommend!"
