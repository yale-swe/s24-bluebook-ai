    "Excellent -- see above",
    "A worthwhile class if you would like to spend two hours a week with Emma Sky (which is well worth it) as well as some fascinating students from all over the world and the University. However, if you are looking to learn something about the Middle East beyond a cursory overview, this probably isn't the course for you.",
    "I would recommend. Emma is amazing, the course is not too much work. The only down side is sometimes class presentations can be hit or miss. You also don't so much develop skills as an understanding of things going on. Nonetheless, you do leave inspired to some extent.",
    "A good overview of political movements and events in the Middle East over the course of the 20th century. Covers a broad geographic and thematic range of topics, with a great emphasis on discussion.We spend a good portion of class discussing current events and connecting them back to themes we've discussed in the course, which definitely enriches the class experience and makes what we discuss seem more relevant to current events.",
    "Incredible course, you learn so much from the other students as well of the professor. You get to focus on one country and learn a lot about it through work on your own and on the class. professor sky livens up the Middle East in this class, keeping the students up to date with current events as well as reviewing historical events",
    "Yes! It is an amazing class!",
    "GLBL713 introduces a wide range of matters regarding the politics of the Middle East. The format is student-led presentations and discussions. I would recommend this to another student who has an intellectual curiosity about Middle East politics and who enjoys seminar-format classes and class discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for a student hoping to gain a broad sense of both history and modern politics in the Middle East. It would be too shallow a course for someone desiring a more intense academic exploration of one particular issue or country, although the set-up by which each student chooses a nation to focus on for the whole semester as well as following the general reading did allow for a more in-depth consideration in this sense. The workload was very manageable.",
    "I would recommend the course for any students interested in broadening their knowledge of the history and politics of the region. For those interested in a certain country, it is also an opportunity to do in-depth research for the term paper.",
    "I would recomend the class to anyone slightly interested in the Middle East. I knew very little of the region's politics before hand, but was able to fit right in and contribute. I also thought many of the more experienced students into the Middle East leanrt a great deal. The class thus fits to all levels of knowledge before hand."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Sky is an outstanding professor with a firsthand understanding of many of the issues she discusses. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and look forward to keeping in touch with her.",
    "Very much so",
    "Yes, she taught me how to see the world with different eyes.",
    "The course allowed me to geographically expand my interest in issues of religion and minority studies outward from a focus on Europe. It was more helpful in thinking ahead to future career hopes in the area of diplomacy or foreign service work than for my current work at graduate school in the history department.",
    "The class walked on the thin line between great overall views of Middle East politics coupled with in-to dept research in different countries as well as subjects relevant to the region. This is perhabs the bniggest strength of the course because it provides the student with great knowledges to use in other general global affairs couses as well some more distinct insights to the subject itself."
