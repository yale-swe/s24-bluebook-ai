    "Raisa is really nice, and somewhat one of the easier graders. So take this with her.",
    "French 120 is a continuation of French L1. It has less grammar but definitely more vocab. It is great!",
    "French 120 is a good introduction to French, using the materials of French in Action. Class does meet every day, and there is homework every day and weekly tests, but if you put in the time you will quickly gain a decent working level of French, which I found very rewarding. And the work, although continuous, isn't too difficult. An effective and efficient way to learn French--I would recommend it!",
    "Yes! Absolutely go for it",
    "It is a lot harder than french level 1, but not horrible. I've heard that level 3 is exponentially harder as well. I would recommend the class depending on your teacher. Rexer won't be teaching next year which is a shame.",
    "Take it. French is a fantastic language.",
    "I would recommend the idea of taking french- but with the warning that French in Action is a dumb way of learning it.",
    "Only take it if you must.",
    "Definitely.",
    "This course is an extension of the previous level, building upon the foundations of last semester to further develop vocabulary, and grammatical skills."
