    "Math 619 is a rigorous introduction to Algebraic Geometry. It introduces all the key concepts of the subject and prepares you for further study of schemes and sheaves. It is a good class, though the flow from class to class could be smoother. I would recommend the class, and Jose is a very good lecturer."
