    "Material gets somewhat repetitive towards the end of the course, but there is a good distribution of work throughout the semester. Surprisingly heavy reading load, and it's not terribly interesting.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale so far. It provided me with a new lens with which to look at American history and helped me understand the ways in which America grew and how the American identity developed. Dolores Hayden is an amazing lecturer--every class was engaging with memorable anecdotes and her lectures felts like stories. The readings were a reasonable length and interesting. Also a writing credit with only 2 papers! If you're interested in learning about America's suburbs, housing patterns, the effect of the highway on America, patterns of architecture, or American culture, this course is a must!",
    "The first half of ACL is basically about New York and the second half about suburbs. Both are highly interesting topics though.",
    "A great way to learn about urban and suburban trends in America. Really interesting and a great writing credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - yes yes yes! It was not an overwhelming time commitment at all but it was still really really interesting. It's a great way to think about American history in terms of how cities and suburbs developed, their relationship to each other, the development of the highways, etc. It was an aspect of American history I hadn't considered as much before but after taking this I'm really fascinated by the built environment. The way the course is structured is great too - it's kind of stressful early on in the semester when all of a sudden youhave to have a research topic for your final paper, but it's such a relief to be done with that before Thanksgiving break. The two hour-long exams were also really fair. Definitely consider taking this course!!",
    "A great course, especially for people who want a solid knowledge of the history of suburbanization in our country. Many topics are covered to create a thorough whole - a class that any Urban Studies major should take.",
    "Yes!",
    "Excellent class. Lectures can be a bit dry at times. Final paper for this class takes a lot of research and time to write (start early on research).",
    "Fantastic American Studies class that is also an architecture course, writing credit and social science. If you have any interest in history and social dynamics or the built environment like how cities changed or suburbs formed, i'd highly recommend this class.",
    "It's a veryintroductory, low-pressure course on the built environment and the broader trends shaping american cities. The workload is light--just a short paper, two hour long exams, and a final paper--and it's all over before reading week. I would recommend it as a fifth class. Professor Hayden is flexible and understanding and a great person to know in general if you're interested at all in cities, landscapes, architecture, etc.",
    "Absolutely!!!!",
    "It is a mediocre course. A good 5th class, or other chill option.",
    "I took this class because I needed a writing credit, and I ended up liking it more than I thought I would. It was a pretty simple writing credit, which was fantastic, but it got me thinking about topics that are all around me in the real world (cities, highways, suburbs, etc.) in a new way, and I actually enjoyed a lot of the discussion that took place. Definitely take it if you're open to trying something new and in need of a WR\/HU credit. The workload is very manageable.",
    "I would if you have an interest in American culture.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a pretty good class. It teaches you a lot about the world you live in (if you're American). But don't take the class if you don't find the first two lectures incredibly engaging-- it does not necessarily get more interesting after that. Also, the workload is very very front-loaded. There is no final, and the paper is done before Thanksgiving, but for a few weeks it seems like there are major assignments nearly every week.",
    "Pretty straightforward, easy class. Assignments are fun.",
    "Cool course that explores the relationship between American culture\/traditions and the built environment. Midterm and final (both in-class, 50 min) seem stressful\/hard but are fine if you go to class and study the terms\/images that are postedto V2. Two papers - one short (4-5) pages and one 15 pager. The longer paper is due REALLY early in the semester for a term paper (it was Nov. 13 my year) and that seems horrible at first, but it's honestly so nice when it comes around to finals period. In terms of material, I liked most of it but for some reason felt lukewarm about most of the lectures. Not really sure why, maybe Hayden isn't the most inspiring of lecturers. Good AmStud lecture course regardless.",
    "disaster. professor checked out. ignore first lecture.also workload is actually enormous but no one does it and it doesn't affect anything.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "It's a great course, very revealing about the American built environment. I would definitely recommend it, I learned so much.",
    "yes!",
    "If you're at all interested in urban studies, this is a nice way to get an overview.",
    "I would summarize the class as a nice survey course on the development of the American Landscape. Outside of the paper, the work and 2 midterms were very easy, and the paper was not that bad, as long as you choose an interesting topic with enough resources. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in urban\/regional planning, anyone interested in development of American culture, and if you need an interesting humanities or writing credit. Overall, pretty good class.",
    "This is a great class for any major. The information is very interesting, the course load is pretty light. Dolores is a great lecturer, I looked forward to going to class each week. I definitely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Again, it was a great but intense course. This is not an easy class- there are many assignments that require a lot of research and thought. But it's fascinating. You leave this course with a great sense of how our landscape has been shaped, and the forces that create the landscape we have. You leave the course with an ability to analyze the landscape in which you live, and that's something I'mreally excited about. Highly recommend it.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes, somewhat contrary to its name, is basically a history of the American city and American suburbs. I love the subject, so this was a great way to dive into urban issues and planning. The lectures were on point, though the discussion sections seemed to lack direction. The course was not too much work, and, with your whole grade determined before reading period--the term paper is due in early November and there's an in-class final on the last day--taking this class alleviates some of the usual stress of the end of the semester crunch. A good fourth or fifth class and low work for a writing credit.",
    "I was pretty unsatisfied by the course. Although it provides a lot of information, it's rarely presented in a cohesive manner and there aren't many arguments presented, and when they were, they weren't presented well. Professor Hayden clearly has a distaste for a number of architectural forms and certain kinds of development, but when she justified why she sees things the way she does, she tended to rely on aesthetic judgements and leftist ideological leanings that went unsubstantiated; I'm leftist myself but her biases were evident and came off as arbitrary, or dogmatic during the lectures. It's all the more frustrating to witness this because I would guess that she has well-founded arguments backing up her beliefs, but she didn't put in the work or care to articulate them during class. That goes as well for the content she puts together - a lot of the time it felt like we were going through the motions of a survey course, covering the things we \"should\" cover. A legion of pictures of different buildings sliding by on the powerpoint, a brief note about each one, not much sense to it other than, \"Look, this kind of building was a thing that happened.\"Occasionally we would have this history tied in with feminist analysis, but it was also largely an upper class white woman's kind of feminism that was weak in considering the differentiated impacts on people in terms of race, sexuality - and forget about class.As far as the classism goes, it seems that she has a disdain for suburbs overall, especially unplanned suburbs that expand without much planning. She criticizes the overdevelopment of green fields, the endless sprawl. It's a totally valid critique with a very potent thrust behind it - what the hell will we do when we eat up all our space? But it also didn't come with a cohesive solution on Hayden's part; it was more negatively critical than it was generative.The Teaching:It felt like Hayden barely cares. A number of us are pretty sure she hasn't changed the syllabus since 2002 (that's when the one we first received was dated\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). Her lectures contain the bare minimum of effort, a number of them ended 10-15 minutes early (out of a 50 minute class), and she sometimes ended them by asking shitty questions to the class that only once created an interesting discussion and usually made for awkward silences and uninteresting responses (for example, after a lecture on public art, she asked the class, \"I'd like to ask you, what's your favorite piece of public art?\" On the other hand, a really cool discussion followed when she asked, \"What would America have looked like if it hadn't become a nation of highways?\" Although now that I think of it, it might have been a student who posed that question to her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). Either the study of the built environment is still nascent or Hayden has not done a good job picking the readings, but many of them had little analysis to them, which often left them at the level of lukewarm history of the development of shopping districts or department stores - instead of spurring further questions about the built environment, they left us asking, \"why did I read this?\"The first lecture, the Futurama lecture, is fascinating (so don't be fooled and think that the rest of the course will be that good). It posed compelling questions about who gets to design our country's appearance and how the democratic process can be undermined by carelessness or greed. So are a few select lectures, including ones on the digital house and the development of skyscrapers. And in studying for the final, I felt a huge appreciation for the scope and history of the American built environment, but I think this was more in spite of the class than because of it.",
    "A great crossover course between architectural and urban thinking and a more general historical and sociological perspective. Excellent choice for any student, really.",
    "TAKE IT. because reasons",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a really interesting class. The lectures can be a bit dry sometimes, but the material is still pretty interesting and Professor Hayden's excitement about the material is nice. It's graded fairly generously, and the term paper is due 3 weeks before the end of the term, which is nice for someone who doesn't want to have to worry about something like that during finals period (although it does fall during midterms).",
    "This was a great class overall. It provided a new way of looking at the built environment, and it was clear that Professor Hayden is an expert in her field. The readings aren't all crucial, (much of the important material is in lecture), but most are pretty interesting. Overall, I loved this class, and it provided lots of opportunities for deeper investigation of a variety of the topics we explored. The exams aren't too bad (just two midterms), and there is one big paper, which I found fun and interesting, as we were permitted to choose nearly any topic relevant to the class.",
    "I thought American Cultural Landscapes was a fascinating course to take. Professor Hayden is an expert and many of the topics she covers are incredibly interesting. As an international student, I thought it was a great way of understanding the US and how it came about from an urban perspective. The midterm and the final were very straightforward. Again, if you are interested in the material, I would definitely recommend this class, but make sure you are, because if not it can be slow at times.",
    "I loved this class even before I went to the first lecture! The subject matter is so relevant today, in the age of urban\/suburban sprawl and lack of necessary landscape and historic preservation. The format may be similar to a history class, in which the readings are from journals or history books and a lot of attention is given to early industrial cities. The term paper is due before Thanksgiving and can be on a topic of your choice. Readings are usually around 100 book pages\/week or less, and take several hours. The course is rigorous, well organized and moves through a variety of topics, although it is not hard to get a good grade if you do all the readings and put forth effort on the assignments. Covers a variety of topics, as it fills the niche of an introduction to the built environment, urban development, and landscape\/architecture history all rolled into one class.",
    "The cultural and architectural history of the US from 1820-2000.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a great course but will make you a bit depressed about how America devolved due to cars and highways. Hayden is definietly cynical about how housing and cars destroyed downtowns and produced shopping malls but it will give you a great understanding of why cities and suburbs are the way they are now. The course covers social issues, architectural design, cultural history and planning and you will learn a lot of stuff you thought was obvious but actually don't know that much about. The workload is really manageable (one short paper, one long one and 2 tests), the tests are easy and the course is over before reading week begins-take it! You will stay interested throughout and although it is not difficult the material is engaging.",
    "Fantastic course overall. Great overview of the built environment in America: Specifically, understanding the shift from city life to suburban life.The course probably should acknowledge the angle that it takes however: more like American Cultural Landscapes and the Role Women (and sometimes minorities) Have Had in Shaping Them. The angle is not a bad one -- Professor Hayden approaches the subject in a highly educated and professional way -- but that is definitely the bias.As a lecturer, Professor Hayden is very engaging and clearly an expert in her field.Highly recommended.",
    "Every American Studies major at Yale should take this course. Not only is it subject matter you won't find in many other history classes here, but it's also taught by one of the preeminent scholars of the American landscape. This means, however, that the course is notably skewed toward the history of suburbs and has a clear agenda, which isn't to its detriment, but is something to be aware of. The grade is based largely on a 3750 word research paper on a topic entirely of your choice. Deadlines approach quickly for the paper, so ideally come in with some idea of an aspect of the American landscape you find interesting toward the beginning or even before you decide to take the class. Other than the paper, though, there is not much work to do week to week. Lectures are generally more important than readings for the midterm and final, so the course is better suited to students who will go to lecture most weeks, especially because Hayden doesn't post slides (though she does post key terms and images). This year, at least, teaching fellows had radically different styles of grading and running section, especially because some are American Studies grads and others architecture grads. Ultimately, this wasn't my favorite class while I was taking it, but I feel like it provided a good environment for writing my first big research paper at Yale and a strong survey of urban and suburban history that will serve me well in the AMST major.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes teaches you more about your hometown and modern suburbia. Interestingly enough, I am not sure what international students did for the early transportation assignment; I'm assuming they may have also done their hometown but maybe related it to American developments? Really not sure. Anyways, I would highly recommend the course because it has changed the way I look at human community development and the material was honestly fascinating.",
    "Take it! This class is very accessible for people with little experience in American studies. If you're at all interested in the material- go for it! Getting the final paper and exam out of the way before finals period is great, too.",
    "I would highly recommend American Cultural Landscapes! It is a fun, enlightening way to get a writing credit (one five-page, one fifteen-page paper). Professor Hayden does a great job of getting you invested in the material. She gives a detailed overview of how and why America's current landscapes came to be. In my experience, simply going to lecture is enough to do well on the exams. The large paper is not too difficult if you take the preliminary assignments seriously. The best part was being done with the course before reading week.",
    "AMST 207 is a survey of the built environment, stretching from colonial America to the present. We cover a wide variety of topics, but trace common themes throughout the course that serve to unite everything we talk about. One particularly important theme is land use--we discussed extensively the debates surrounding what land should be used for, how\/if it should be developed, and whether it should be used primarily for public or private purposes. I definitely enjoyed this course, and would recommend it to another student looking for a class that is applicable to today's world.The course load is not too much--a decent amount of reading every week, but on very interesting and relevant topics (the history of Central Park, public housing, urban renewal, air conditioning, highways...). Aside from that there is a short (5 page) paper early into the semester that deals with transportation in your hometown, and a term paper on any topic of your choice that emphasizes primary documents (due before Thanksgiving break). I really enjoyed the freedom of the term paper, and had a great time writing it.One thing I found a bit frustrating about the course was that it covered so much that we couldn't go in-depth on any one topic. Of course, that's the nature of a survey course, and I'm glad I have such a broad understanding of the subject, but there were definitely many times when I would have liked to talk about something for more than one or two classes. Just something to keep in mind.",
    "Absolutely. I would have preferred not to have to write a long paper....but I enjoyed it. Some people comment that Prof Dolores is overly biased or that the material is too depressing--I think that in some respect this is true, but only if you are over thinking everything. A nice course with manageable information and a lot of learning.",
    "This course was truly awesome. It made me want to major in Urban Studies. It ties in social, political and historical aspects, as well as design\/architecture and even has applications in energy and environmental fields. It really opens your eyes to literally everything around you, and you will definitely get something out of this class that you can apply in real life, regardless of your major. Lecture were succinct and interesting, and my discussion section was quality. I took it because I needed a WR credit, and it was the best decision ever. Take this class, especially if you need a WR credit and aren't so confident with writing, need a HU credit if you are more of a social science person, or need a SO credit if you are more of a humanities person! Or just take this class, because this is the sort of class that I think all Yale classes should be like.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes provides an overview of American cities and suburbs and the development thereof in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Architectural, city planning, anthropological and sociological theories are applied to American cities - from NYC to Boston to Chicago to LA - in order to unwrap their complex urban histories. In doing so, one gains a sense of and appreciation for cities and their ups and downs.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a broad survey, from 1700s to today, of how the American built environment was conceived, built, destroyed, and renewed on a large-scale since the beginnings of this country. Hayden points a very liberal, biased lens at the material, but her intelligence and expertise outweigh the drawbacks of this slant. A must-take class for anyone who has any interest in the building and plot of land you're currently sitting in.",
    "Take it if you're interested in American Studies, like history, or are interested in American culture and\/or the built environment. The first class is a good indicator of the rest of the course. Start the papers early, and study for the exam with your section. Some of the Hayden's lectures overlap with the readings from her book almost verbatim.",
    "If you're looking for some kind of urban studies course, there are plenty of other options besides this one. Hayden monotonously reads each lecture from a printed-out packet every time, and the syllabus hasn't changed in around a decade - a professor should be putting work into changing and improving a course for the sake of the students, not just repeating the exact same material every year the course is taught.",
    "This is a fascinating, interdisciplinary look at how America has come to be like this. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale -- readings are long but interesting and definitely necessary, overall not too hard but hugely informative. Necessary for anyone who lives here (= you, at least for 4 years).Focus is spread evenly between architecture, history and politics -- a well-rounded look at the history of our built environment.",
    "If you're interested in urban planning and American History, definitely take this course. Professor Hayden has an incredibly thoughtful point of view on the American culture both past and present and always organized great lectures. The course work is very manageable as long as you stay on top of the readings. Great class, one of my favorites so far at Yale."
