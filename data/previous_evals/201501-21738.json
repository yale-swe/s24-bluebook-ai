    "It was definitely a ride from start to finish. It's really incredible to look back on the beginning of the semester and seeing where I am now in regards to being able to read Greek. Professor Robinson is great at explaining the inflection and grammatical constructions. He frequently relates Greek to Latin, which is helpful if you know Latin for comparison.",
    "Be prepared, obviously. Those two credits don't come cheaply. It's not impossible -- I did it with DS, and held up alright. But you'll be up late drilling grammar forms, and if that's not your thing, you may want to reconsider. The end result, however, is wonderful. I knew no Greek in January, and last week I finished reading Plato's Apology in the original -- that's the most amazing progress I've ever made in a single class. You can come out of this genuinely qualified to read most Attic Greek texts, and that's a skill I never dreamed I could obtain in such a short time. Professor Robinson is wonderful. Incredibly knowledgeable about not only Greek, but about Latin, classical and modern literature, and even a bit of Sanskrit. Can reference proto-Indo-European roots for vocabulary. But more importantly, he's very, very friendly and kind. He'll push you when he needs to, but you'll never feel attacked, which is important in a class that moves at this pace. The kind of professor you want to keep in touch with after the course is over. If you can put up with a substantial workload in exchange for access to a beautiful language and incredible literature, this is the class for you.",
    "This is one of the most difficult courses I've ever taken. It's a marathon: two hours a day, five days a week. If you don't do the homework, and you don't do it well, you will be miserable and embarrassed. But if you do--if you put in the time and the work, and you commit yourself to making the most out of the semester--you will learn an enormous amount of Greek. In the course of fourteen weeks, I went from knowing the alphabet and a few words to being able to comfortably read and decipher Plato's Apology. I can't tell you how wonderful it was, particularly after Spring Break, to begin each day with two hours of Plato. Sitting together and translating, laughing at our mistakes, exploring the infinitely complicated and wonderful artifact in front of us...it was in some ways a model of what humanistic education should be. Our conversations never soared to the intellectual level of a seminar, but I didn't mind. I preferred to think about verbs (and pretend to think about participles). The question for someone looking at an intensive Greek class is whether to do it during term-time or during the summer, at the CUNY course, the Berkeley workshop, etc. This, at least, was the question I was grappling with. To be entirely honest, you will probably learn more if you do a summer course. You will simply be able to concentrate more of your energies on learning the language. And, at least after CUNY, you can guarantee placement in L5. The advantage of doing it at Yale is that the course will almost certainly be smaller, you'll be learning from a more experienced teacher (Prof. Robinson has been doing it for twenty years; CUNY or Berkeley instructors are usually grad students) who really knows a lot about historical linguistics, and you'll get to know the department a little bit. But you will be taking up two valuable Yale credits. All in all, I'm really happy I took the course. Learning a language like Greek is very grounding in a deeply personal way. Ultimately any course, as long as it's taught well, will do the job. This is certainly as good an option as any."
