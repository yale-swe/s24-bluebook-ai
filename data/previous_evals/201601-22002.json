   "comments": [
    "This course is an overview of US history from WW2 to the present. It has a ton of reading, intense discussions, difficult papers, and harsh grading. There is a lot of emphasis on minority perspectives, which I found very interesting and engaging. Interesting class, but lots of work and very stressful.",
    "read a lot of interesting articles and books about marginalized segments of the US population after WWII. engage actively in primary sources. definitely worth it if you're interested in reading fascinating articles and books and getting the chance to do hands-on research in Yale's archives. however, seminar does drag on and i think you get a lot more out of the readings than the class itself.",
    "Hist 012 is a great course for anybody who wants to think critically about the themes that characterized post-WWII life in the US, and how these changed over time. I would recommend this course to another student, as its fast pace, although overwhelming at times, meant that the class was able to learn more and find connections across the time period. Furthermore, Professor Klein does a great job of sharing her knowledge and using it to direct interesting discussion.",
    "This class is an interesting freshman seminar about issues of American society and government in the postwar period, and the small class size and discussion-based format are really conducive to participation and forming connections with peers. I would definitely recommend the seminar to those interested in (American) history or even political science, but I would warn potential students that the workload is very heavy and the readings can be very overwhelming. You have to really enjoy the material and want to succeed in class conversations in order to complete and get a good understanding of all of the readings.",
    "This class is for students who are interested in American history after WW2 but don't want to delve into a specific era\/topic. It's a survey course with a lot of course material that might be difficult to stay on top of. All of our classes were discussions on the readings so you really need to have read the material to be prepared for the class. I found the papers difficult to write because we never got guidance on how to write papers using primary source documents from Sterling. Overall, a great course, but very heavy on reading.",
    "Take this class!",
    "A whirlwind of a class where you get to study so many aspects of Post World War II history. A lot of homework, you don't really know what your grade is at any point in the course, but the discussion is interesting.",
    "HIST 012 was a very different class than what I originally expected. I would say that if provides great context for many political and cultural themes that are discussed in the present day. I felt knowledgeable before this class about political topics, but now I feel like I have a historical edge when debating with my friends. The work can be a bit overwhelming, so only take it if you are willing to put in the time.",
    "I would recommend HIST 012 to another student because it opens your eyes to a variety of issues and themes from the 1940s to the 21st century. The discussion based classes allow the students to, for the most part, take control of their learning. However, the class requires a lot of time to do the readings for class."
