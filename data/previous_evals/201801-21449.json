    "This course was very poorly taught. I have been going to class since the beginning of the semester, but I have now realized that Uebelacker simply cannot teach. All he does is read off of his slides. What's funny is that he complains that people do not show up to class when he should KNOW that the reason for this is that he cannot teach. I have found more help from Shiyue and the AMAZING peer tutors (bless their hearts!) more than Uebelacker. Really the only times that I have felt that I have learned a lot in class was when we did clicker questions. But going over deeply important conceptual theorems (such as the MVT or IVT) by reading a slide just is not enough. Do NOT (I repeat, DO NOT) take this course with Uebelacker. He's a great guy who obviously cares, but if you care about your grade and understanding math in general, don't play yourself.",
    "Weaknesses: teacher only used powerpoint, class was really unenganging",
    "It would be better if the class was more standardized across the sections.",
    "One big weakness was there was a major disparity from what we learned in class to what was on the problem sets and tests. The problems we did in class did not prepare me well for problem set and exam questions.",
    "Without any competition for miles, this is the worst class I've taken at Yale. Before highlighting this class's many weaknesses, I need to commend it's only strength highly. Professor Uebelacker is one of the kindest and passionate instructors out there. My frustration with this class doesn't stem from any fault in teaching but rather in Content. - The syllabus is too dense for an introductory class given its narrow time frame. So much time is wasted on small picture stuff such as limits and continuity. The important stuff suffers as a result as it is taught towards the end in a hurry to complete the syllabus. -Web assign is just awful. The Math department should consider lifting all penalties so as to encourage students to experiment with content learnt in class in a risk free setting. -Many many resources are given to help struggling students, but I always felt like I was fighting with 12+ other students just to get one question answered during office and tutor hours. - I wish the textbook used simpler language. - I wish math 112 followed a hybrid format of math 115. Not necessarily watching all the class content before hand but perhaps have primers and spend more class time tackling problems. Math department consider renaming this class what it really is Math 115 part 1. Make Math 115 a yearlong sequence where students can place into the second semester equivalent during the fall if they so choose. The class is extremely difficult and our efforts are discredited by the seemingly innocuous branding of the class.",
    "I think that there could be less lecture, and more ways to engage the students. Going over more homework problems would have been better."

    "Do it for the prereq, but don't expect much. Take this class with anyone but Uebelacker.",
    "Never. Absolutely no learning happened in class. This is why a max of 5 students showed up everyday - everyone knew that coming to class would be a waste of time.",
    "No because most of the questions are ridiculous and it's just not worth it. Only do it if you have to",
    "Yes for QR credit",
    "I would recommend this course if you want or need to take a math class but for pure enjoyment purposes there are better courses.",
    "No. Please only take this class if you badly need to meet your math requirement for Econ. There are many many better ways to meet your QR requirement. -The class moves way too quickly. I had studied a bit of calculus and I'm certain that there's no way a student seeing these topics for the first time would be able to succeed. -There is way too much homework. A homework set is due 3 days of the week and they are really long. think 3 hours plus office hours every week. Frankly you'll be living Pset to Pset.",
    "I would recommend it because it gives you a foundational knowledge as to how to apply math to the real world."
