    "I really enjoyed this course! I thought the readings were complex and forced you to think critically about your role and project. I had a great group and an awesome project and feel very proud of what we accomplished this semester. The faculty members have differing skills and knowledge and they complement each other nicely. It would be great if there could be a group bonding event towards the beginning of the semester to help groups mesh.",
    "This course was incredible. I wish we had more opportunities to apply the reading material to our specific projects in diverse ways. The in class discussions were very helpful but I felt limited by the format and the time."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali was very pleasant to work with! Her passion, eloquence, and knowledge are both intimidating and inspiring. Her comments \/ feedback are not always completely clear, but she is quite adept at explaining what she means if you ask.",

Her guidance and continual search for more opportunities for collaboration and application has renewed my excitement for what I hope to contribute throughout my academic and professional career.

    "Clinic-based course that involves semester long group work that is often open ended and student directed. Requires substantial time commitment but being worth 2 credits helps make it reasonable! If you are interested in the interactions of law and health, either domestically or internationally, this is the course for you!",
    "This course will be challenging. I was formative in my academic development. I recommend this to any student who wants to make lasting partnerships and work hard and passionately on a specific project."
