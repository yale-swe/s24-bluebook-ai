   "comments": [
    "Content-wise, I learnt a lot about the Western philosophical tradition. We read the works of several important thinkers who have shaped what modern society looks like today, both socio-politically and economically. In terms of skills, I think the main outcome of this course is an improved analytical and writing ability. You have to engage with some really complex ideas, which helps you improve your ability to understand and synthesize long texts.",
    "A deep insight into the interdisciplinary at the heart of ethics, politics, and economics, a thorough look into some key theories of the thinkers listed on the syllabus, and the ability to perform a deeper dive on thinker(s) for a final term paper.",
    "Classics of EP&E provides a thorough and interdisciplinary grounding of numerous relevant thinkers. From Aristotle to Schumpeter, we really extensively dig into these texts and ponder the perspectives of these writers on questions such as what is virtue, or how the capitalist economy has shaped the way the political system and ethics operate within society.",
    "I developed insight into the fundamentals of the ethics, politics, and economics major.",
    "Magnificent class. From the Hegelian underpinnings of modern society to the nature of justice, this class exposed me to fundamental ways of viewing the world in which we live and understanding our place within it. Will advance close and abstract reading abilities, writing, and discussion. I particularly enjoyed discussion with my peers, and the fact that the professor would respond to our specific points.",
    "In this class, I learned how to connect the disciplines of ethics, politics, and economics, through a comprehensive syllabus of various theorists.",
    "- The relationship between the classical branches of philosophy; how they are derived from the previous ones and what inspired the deviation\/change. - An interdisciplinary view of the thoughts; how the political thoughts are related to more fundamental views",
    "This course allowed me to understand political philosophy more than any other course I've ever taken. The professor very clearly connects various texts and makes the material much more dynamic than it would be otherwise.",
    "We learnt about great interdisciplinary thinkers in ethics, politics and economics.",
    "Classics is an excellent introduction to ethical reasoning. I learned to think in a completely new way about how to judge the morality of my actions and the actions of others. The class helped me understand the different ways to think of the relationship between reason and the good.",
    "I learned how to synthesize core concepts in political philosophy and political economy across multiple thinkers.",
    "Gained tools to analyze classic texts and read more closely; learned a lot about",
    "Learned about the ideas of certain EPE thinkers, but more importantly learned how to read future EPE thinkers. I learned how to evaluate and compare the arguments they make, and pick out the most important and original parts of their ideas.",
    "I learned most importantly that the idea of 'rightness' and 'goodness' is ultimately historicized and contextualized; a really great overview of major Western thinkers that aren't necessarily covered in intro philosophy courses (especially 20th century thinkers).",
    "I gained the ability to apply an interdisciplinary approach to the three fields. This was a very well-organized course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of this course is definitely Professor Kapustin! He is incredibly passionate about the subject, and knows the texts inside and out! He guides discussions really well, and most students participate, which makes the debates really interesting.",
    "The content of the course is fascinating, but the seminar did not feel all that productive, and often resulted in a bunch of students talking to talk and trying to sound smart to impress Professor Kapustin. Additionally - and for some this is a feature, not a bug - the discussion centered primarily around the repetition of a given thinker's theory, not around critically engaging with it.",
    "Professor Kapustin is an absolutely wonderful instructor. Not only is he a fantastically engaging lecturer, but he is also a great facilitator of discussion. I loved how the class was a mixture of both lecture, helping to establish a baseline of understanding of the readings, and conversation over the readings. This structure was especially helpful in not hearing the thoughts of my classmates, but also consolidating the main takeaways of the readings.",
    "There could be less reading to not fall behind.",
    "Truly excellent. Would not change a thing about it, given its extremely voracious scope and fast pace. Professor Kapustin was extraordinary in inculcating a meaningful understanding of the text in his students.",
    "This course could benefit from keeping up with schedule a little bit, as the lack of time for discussion of readings later in the semester did weaken the course somewhat.",
    "- It would be better to have two sessions a week, as we didn't have the time to finish all the content and had to have a make-up session; more sessions may also help guide reading",
    "I think the course is taught very well.",
    "Excellent course, perfect",
    "The course is exceptionally well-taught and the only way I think it could be improved is more feedback on writing.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Kapustin is one of my intellectual idols and I truly enjoyed every minute of it.",
    "Could have been improved with more but shorter assignments rather than two longer ones.",
    "Prof. Kapustin's seminar is 70% him talking, which is honestly the highlight. Class discussion felt kind of pointless, since we knew we were all about to be blown out of the water by whatever Prof. Kapustin said next. So much learning happens every week in this seminar - it legitimately makes you think differently about the current world, even as you're reading hella old texts.",
    "Kapustin is definitely a highlight - his remarks are incredibly detailed and enlightening. Workload is pretty light, but you have no clue what your grade is gonna be - throughout the semester, you only receive your midterm paper grade. Weaknesses: It is pretty hard to stay awake sometimes because his voice falls into this rhythmic cadence and the classroom is stuffy and warm. I recommend bringing lots of drinking water and chewing gum. Which, granted, is graded pretty easily. The makeup of your class will definitely shape how discussions go, but I was frustrated at the amount of tryhard philosophy bros in the class trying to impress Kapustin. Everyone talked in very roundabout and pompous ways that made it hard to actually understand their point. If you can squash this environment from the beginning, kudos to you, because it'll help everyone participate and learn better.",
    "Seminars and lectures were very engaging and rewarding! One of the most insightful courses I have taken."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student regardless of whether they are interested in EP&E or not. The philosophers we read have all shaped modern day governance in some way or the other, and engaging with their work is an incredibly valuable and rewarding process. Also, Professor Kapustin is probably one of the best if not the best professor I have taken a class with at Yale, and his passion for the subject makes this class that much better.",
    "Yes! Required for EP&E, but a fascinating class in general. Some of the theory covered is very relevant to the modern day.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course with Professor Kapustin. He really puts so much effort into encouraging discussion and deep analysis of the readings, as well as in helping students further their own thoughts. The readings were especially interesting, and even if you have already read them in another course, Professor Kapustin always has a different perspective or further insight to provide.",
    "Yes, but only if theyre willing to put in the work to appreciate learning.",
    "Absolutely. If you seek to develop an interdisciplinary view of society, and begin to understand the interplay between Ethics, Politics and Economics, this class is categorically imperative.",
    "Yes. Aside from being required for the EP&E major, this course is an excellent way to familiarize yourself with some of the major works of philosophy out there, even some which you might not agree with.",
    "Recommend to students who have solid background knowledge on this topic, otherwise the reading could be a bit overwhelming.",
    "I absolutely would recommend. Prof. Kapustin is a phenomenal educator and taking the course without his expertise would tarnish the experience.",
    "Yes if theyre generally interested in the material. Also Prof Kapustin is the GOAT",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in moral theory.",
    "Absolutely. This course has made me a more rigorous thinker and certainly a more competent interdisciplinary writer.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely, as long as you've had some experience in the philosophy\/political philosophy field or are willing to put in the work to read some pretty dense texts. This class completely satisfied what I thought a \"Yale education\" would be like, and I've never felt so intellectually challenged or intellectually rewarded. Prof. Kapustin can be intimidating at first, but he loves the subject, loves students, and loves getting to teach this course.",
    "If you're an EPE major, you have to take it. I'd recommend going in with the mindset that I read in a review from a previous year - to get the most out of the class, you need to engage with the readings fully and early on. Class is supplemental in the sense that Kapustin's remarks make much more sense and enlighten so much in the readings when you do them first. Of course, you can get by with taking good notes and reading the readings afterwards but it's much harder to engage in class.",
    "Yes! You will walk away with a solid understanding of the texts studied and the ability to understand the three fields on a deeper and more connected level."
