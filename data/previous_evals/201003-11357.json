    "It's a broad overview of the field based on the research that current Yale professors are doing. In truth, I wish this wasn't a course for credit--I think it could easily have been a weekly non-credit workshop (with attendance still required for a certain percentage of the classes for first years) without a final paper, thus making it clearer that first years could take an additional class.",
    "I would summarize it as an introduction to various professors in the department and their work. I would recommend it to incoming students.",
    "Has potential to be a good course if better designed and structured. As is, just ok.",
    "I would say: \"You get to meet all the faculty and hear what their academic interests are. But you don't learn anything substantive or particularly useful beyond some occassional nuggets of wisdom that are genuinely valuable. After all if you want to speak to faculty you can just go speak to them in their office hours. I wouldn't recommend you take this course, certainly not.\""

    "It certainly gave me sense of some holes and puzzles in the political science literature, but I wish that professors had also given us more practical advice, both on how they work, what they read, and where they think the discipline is heading.",
    "learned about the variety of research agendas in the department, and the variety of ways professors are approaching these questions. A great introduction to the diversity of the discipline.",
    "Contributed to knowledge somewhat, but in an unsystematic way.",
    "Despite the criticisms of the course it did give me a fair overview of the discipline, which I value. And I am glad that I have a better understanding of the kind of research that's going on in the department and what professors' interests are. That's why it would be useful as some kind of brown-bag lunch.It didn't contribute to my research."
