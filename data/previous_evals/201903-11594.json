   "comments": [
    "I learned a substantial amount in this course about the philosophy and legal theory surrounding punishment. The course tackled important and contentious issues in a way that facilitated productive discussions and forced you to think critically.",
    "Ethical and political arguments concerning the practice and justification of punishment. Different theories of why we do\/should punish people and how.",
    "This course is great for a concise understanding of sentencing philosophies and exposure to philosophical logic. Professor Rosas forced us to think more critically about our ingrained biases and how they manifest in our treatment of criminal justice.",
    "I learned a great deal about theories that have impacted American legal thought regarding the purposes and methods that punishment should assume. All in all, I think that this course helped me think through arguments about when, how, and why the state should punish more critically so that I can identify their theoretical bases and determine whether these arguments are persuasive or desirable. This was a very theoretical class, so I gained experience critiquing theoretical arguments and defending a position or interpretation of an argument. I also thought this class was very good for learning how to identify the theories and motivations behind court opinions when they do not make use of the same language and explicit theoretical references as readings from political philosophy. This is not a class about the U.S. criminal justice system and its critics, but I think it prepares students who are interested in the criminal justice system to critique it from a theoretical perspective. Though the class itself was generally not very applied, the prompt for the final paper is very open-ended. I think that final paper definitely helped me improve my writing and argumentative skills, as well, and Prof. Rosas's feedback was very helpful for this.",
    "I learned how to think critically about the course material and to evaluate my own assumptions about the way of the world. This course taught me to defend my ideas with more eloquence and depth than ever before.",
    "Deep dive into the main theories of punishment and their ethical and legal justifications and approaches. Critical thinking.",
    "Incredible class. You survey important texts related to theories of punishment, understand their most pressing arguments, and learn to formulate and debate your own arguments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was structured incredibly well. The readings were engaging and the term paper provided you with ample opportunity to write about something you are interested in.",
    "Readings were all pretty good, the material is certainly very fascinating if you're interested in legal theory... I feel like we talked about the same things quite a bit, and it was difficult to have productive discussions without tackling the underlying political-philosophy questions that gave rise to different opinions.",
    "It's difficult to find a weakness in Professor Rosas's teaching. His intimate familiarity with the material and unbridled passion for the subject made discussions substantive and meaningful, while challenging us to embrace viewpoints that we never thought we could or should. The course structure was very well designed. One short midterm paper, and oral exam (intimidating initially, but his encouragement and support make you forget your nerves) and one final essay. The oral exam was initially uncomfortable, but proved to be a valuable opportunity to learn from Professor Rosas's incredible experience and insight in a one-on-one setting. He strikes a good balance between understanding the point the student is making, and pushing them to go farther, refining and sharpening the way we communicate our ideas.",
    "This course gave a strong showing as an introduction to sentencing philosophy, and gives students a lot of insight in a small amount of time. Reading loads are very reasonable and class discussions are usually fast-paced enough that something interesting will come up each week. Some exploration of how each sentencing philosophy informs larger perceptions of the world, or their ramifications on society, would not have gone amiss, although I admit this would be a difficult discussion to structure.",
    "Prof. Rosas is definitely a strength of the course. He has clearly spent a great deal of time thinking through these ideas, and he really cares about his students' intellectual growth in the course. I think it's for these reasons that he was so effective at pushing us to think critically about what we were arguing (in class and in our papers) and to think through the full implications of certain lines of thinking. He would challenge students in class and cold-call from time to time, and I think that this helped us all be more thoughtful. I also thought the oral reading reaction was a really useful assignment; after the midterm point in the semester, we all met with him individually to discuss a few readings we were particularly interested in and he worked with us to describe what it was about the arguments that we found compelling or problematic. I thought this was really helpful for thinking through my own evolving position on the theories and how I would go about crafting an argument in the final paper. I think the range of readings is also a strength of the course. I liked that we read court cases along with the more theoretical readings, because this was helpful for seeing what it looks like when people attempt to implement these theories or are influenced by aspects of their arguments. They were also helpful for giving us examples to discuss in class. Another strength was that we talked through our final paper ideas a few weeks before they were due. This helped me start to seriously think about the paper in advance and narrow my topic down, and I liked that we got feedback from our peers while doing so. This is a very discussion-based class, which I think is another strength because my classmates were always able to point out things I hadn't thought of. I'm not sure if this is a weakness so much as something to be aware of when you're shopping, but the course readings do skew very American\/European. I think this is really because we're focusing on the ideas that have been most influential in American legal thought regarding punishment, but I would think that there are readings from other parts of the world that could also be helpful from a theoretical perspective.",
    "Very well organized and clear standards, topics are relevant and readings are interesting.",
    "Prof. Rosas created a warm environment for students to debate ideas and to respectfully disagree with each other.",
    "I think there could have been a bit more help \/ intro for maybe people who did not have much experience with philosophy at the beginning.",
    "I really loved the high quality of discussion in seminar, the selection of course readings, and the variety of viewpoints of other students in the class. Really I don't have any major criticism, although maybe we could have spent slightly less time discussing each other's paper proposals.",
    "The course was very well structured with a balance of both theory and cases in order to frame the issues. Honestly there were no weaknesses apart from the fact I wished we could go deeper into the topics. Great class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Yeah, it's just a very interesting topic, and relative to what you get out of it, the course is not too demanding.",
    "Please take this course. Rosas is (one of) the best professors at Yale, and your discussion experience will be unrivaled.",
    "Yes, definitely. I found this course very challenging, and it helped me to think more carefully about how and why we should (or should not) justify punishment. Prof. Rosas is a great professor to work with and will push you hard to do your best while really caring about your growth as a student and independent thinker. I would honestly recommend taking any class with him (and I think there were a few people in this class who took his freshman seminar a few years ago and came back for more). If you're at all interested in theory, this is class that will push you to think within that framework, and I think classes that teach you how to think are an important part of a liberal arts education at Yale. If you're interested in criminal justice reform or working in the legal field, I'd also recommend this class because it gets you to analyze some of the ideas and language surrounding punishment. This class is not an expos of racism in the criminal justice system, and though it does incorporate prison abolitionism towards the end of the course, I wouldn't say that this is a key focus. But I think that the theoretical focus of the course can help prepare students who are interested in those topics to discuss them in a more thorough way while being aware of what their own views are regarding how\/why punishment can be justified. If you're interested in taking the course, I'd definitely recommend trying to preregister ahead of time. I think something like 70 students may have signed up in OCS before the first class, so be warned that this may be a tough one to shop!",
    "This is a great seminar course which leaves us with more questions than answers, but in terms of mental stimulation and consideration about the nature of punishment, this course is excellent.",
    "I would absolutely recommend to any student of policy, philosophy, ethics, or related fields.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Rosas was incredible, and really knows how to set up deep interactive seminars where he excellently toes the line between pushing individual students on their own contributions and synthesizing those contributions so that students interact and push each other. Highly recommend taking a course with him.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. Incredibly engaging and incredibly important. Its worth it even to take to learn from Professor Rosas.",
    "Yes. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would, it was challenging but Dean Rosas is a very engaging seminar leader and I felt like I gained a lot intellectually.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone else with any interest in the topic of justice or politics, since it covers so much material that is really useful and interesting for a lot of areas of study.",
    "Absolutely"
