    "So so so worth it. I did not speak a word of French this time last year and now I can have a full conversation without giving it a second thought, I can read books in French (I've read like 5 in this course alone) and I can write complicated emails to French friends. It's a commitment, but you get so much out of it it's absolutely worth it and I would never have done it any other way. You're truly immersed in the language when taking intensive because that's the way you learn a language--all at once. The readings are great, and everyone that takes this class is super dedicated to learning the language so you're surrounded by great people and you're guaranteed to learn the language quickly and well.",
    "Intensive French L3-4 lives up to its name and then some. If you take it, be prepared for the challenge. I think participating in an intensive program is the best way to learn French, or any language. This particular term, the course was not as fun or engaging as I think it could have been, but that could change in the year to come. If you're committed to learning French, I'd recommend taking it.",
    "WORK: Daily homework assignments, weekly writing compositions, weekly tests. [Tests and compositions are due on the same day, Thursday]. Two oral presentations for the semester. Compared to 125, the workload is quite similar. The only difference is that the homework is collected daily rather than weekly. It is a daily time commitment to keep pace with the course. CONTENT: You'll be rewarded for keeping up, though. You get to read some amazing books and stories in this class. My favorites were la Symphonie Pastorale, which is a French novel from the 20s about a pastor in a rural village who adopts a blind girl. I also really enjoyed the anthology Diversite, which contains short stories from different French-speaking countries (Morocco, Haiti, Viet Nam, Senegal, Canada, etc). Take it if the above sounds appealing to you. If you took 125 and did well, definitely continue on the intensive track if your schedule\/sanity can afford it.",
    "French 145 is a really good way of completing L3 & L4 in one semester. However, it is a lot of work. You should only really take this class if you have a good reason for wanting to get through the language levels faster than usual."
