   "comments": [
    "I would say this class is an intro to biology. It's not incredibly in depth but there are a lot of application questions involved on tests, quizzes, and in section.",
    "Absolutely take this course. I put it off until my junior year and I really, really wish I had not. We learned so much in such a short amount of time, but everything was incredibly interesting and highly applicable. Seriously--this course teaches you how life works. What else could you want?!",
    "It's difficult if you don't have any strong biology background. It's not really an intro course.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a class that covers the basics really well.",
    "Highly recommend the course, very well taught and super interesting material, especially with HIV applications",
    "I would take this class for a requirement but not for fun.",
    "If you need to take it for a major, or are interested in bio, then take it. Otherwise, it's not really a course that I would take for fun.",
    "I would recommend Bio 101 to another student if they have a solid foundation of Biology or if they're willing to put in the time and effort to learn both the material itself and how to apply the information.",
    "BIOL 101 is a great way to build a strong foundation in the biological sciences.",
    "Yes! Biology 101 was a nice transition into the modules and intro biology courses here at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend BIO 101 for other students because I think the lecture size and set up of the class is far from ideal, however many students don't have the option of not taking it.",
    "BIOL 101 is a solid foundation for biological concepts. Professor Koleske is amazing, and Professor Gardner is also very good (get her as your TA if you can!). I would recommend BIOL 101 to another student because the concepts are taught very well and the workload not unreasonable.",
    "I think the BIOL 101 class got lucky this year with its professor. Tony Koleske was very engaging and downright adorable. He even met with students for lunch to talk about their interests. With a less passionate lecturer, I don't think this foundational course would be as enjoyable. Material- Interesting to learn about, we talked about key experiments, course ended on tying together all concepts into learning about HIV Structure - The lecture slides and lecture study guides are consistent in format, easy to follow, and aesthetically pleasing. I would highly recommend reading the textbook pages before coming to class. Lecture will be so much easier to sit through and you will get so much more out of it. It will also lessen your studying load for quizzes and the final. There was a quiz every Monday on two lectures and a PSET due every Wednesday. The PSETS took about 1-2 hours and collaboration is encouraged. The quizzes were somewhat difficult if you didn't study effectively. Grading - The goal of this course is to explicitly not make grades the main focus. The curve is generous and as long as you put effort into it, you will be more than alright. I am not pre-med but I still found this course engaging and interesting even though it wont go toward my major. Would highly recommend if Koleske is teaching.",
    "A surprisingly good course, despite what you might have heard about the Intro Bio Modules. Koleske is a really engaging lecturer who explains everything really well.",
    "Take it, its a good class.",
    "This is your standard introductory biology course. A semi-solid high school bio background is helpful, but not necessary, and the various instructors really do want you to do well and give you a lot of resources to do so. It is not difficult if you put in the time, though it is a good, but not overwhelming, amount of work (a quiz every Monday, a problem set every Wednesday). I had no big problems with it, and I would suggest taking it with Tony Koleske, because he is a great lecturer. The last unit on HIV is especially interesting and makes what you have learned feel very relevant, which is great.",
    "Take it, not hard and not too much work.",
    "Take the class! It's a good overview and introduction to biology. The class material is a lot like that of AP Biology, but it's interesting and lectures go much more in depth. As far as premed requirements go, this one is definitely painless. You'll learn a lot of biology and enjoy it as you go.",
    "BIOL 101 is a decent class and Professor Koleske is a great lecturer, but the material is mostly repetitive of AP Bio. I would not recommend it to a student who is not majoring in biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIO 101 to another student. Its a pretty good introductory course that gives a nice overview of biochem and biophysics. It is fairly basic material so if you feel confident in your bio abilities, I would highly recommend trying to test out. The weekly quizzes aren't bad if you make sure that you understand the material each week. Professor Koleske does a good job with presenting the material.",
    "BIOL 101 gives everyone a solid foundation to understanding biological processes at the molecular level.",
    "Great way to gain a general understanding of bio (much deeper understanding that usually gained in HS)",
    "I would summarize BIOL 101 as the first section of the BIO modules, which provide a solid foundation of the information necessary to be successful in a biology-related major here at Yale. I would recommend it to people who are either Bio majors, premed students, or students interested in biology in general (like myself).",
    "Bio 101 is a good general overview of the concepts you need for more advanced bio. The course instructors have done a really good, complete job of providing extra help if you need it (plus the Piazza Q & A website), and they've made homework assignments that help go deeper into material from class. I'd recommend it if you need that foundation for something or are genuinely curious; I wouldn't recommend it if you want a totally chill science credit. (Depending on the level of your high-school bio, it might be pretty chill, though).",
    "BIO101 is an introduction to major biochemical processes and covers material that includes the macromolecules DNA Replication, and DNA technology. If you want an introduction into the biological sciences I would recommend this class.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you're seriously interested in bio. If you just think it's cool and want an extra class, don't go with this one. It's also best to have taken this course after AP Bio and\/or Chem, so if you haven't taken either of those and are hell-bent on taking BIOL 101, enroll in the enrichment or take the course during a term when you have some more free time.",
    "Not a fun class by any means, but if you have to take it, it isn't particularly difficult and will prepare you well for upper level bio courses. 1 quiz a week (5 total, 1 of which is dropped) and 1 hw assignment a week (similarly, one is dropped of the 5).",
    "Bio-chem and bio-physics. Reading the book can help with things that are ambiguous but going to lecture and understanding the slides is of prime importance.",
    "Yes, the course is interesting and you actually learn how to apply concepts and not just memorize things.",
    "Biology 101 is an easy course as long as you take the time to read the lecture notes and textbook pages. The homework is easy and is usually based on the notes from lecture or from the textbook. The class is well-paced and there are plenty of resources if anyone needs help. Piazza, the website used in Biology, allows students to anonymously post questions they have about the material, Enrichment classes, quizzes, and homework. Checking the website is very helpful, especially if you are stuck on a particular question in the homework. The professors are always willing to answer your questions, and will do so quickly and efficiently. Biology 101 is very fun, and I am glad I took it.",
    "A pretty good class, esp. if taken with Koleske. Lots of what is covered is touched upon in high school curricula, but this class goes deeper in most topics, which keeps the class interesting even for those that might have a decent background in bio. Homeworks don't take up too much time, and weekly quizzes are a good way to keep you up to speed with the class in terms of knowing the material. Not a very stressful experience at all, and would recommend for anyone wanting a brief foray into bio.",
    "I would recommend it as a great course in the fundamental principles underlying biological systems.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in an introduction to biochemistry and biophysics. The course is well structured and easy to follow. Most of the assessments are fair and have a good balance of application and recall.",
    "Biol 101 is a great introductory course that goes beyond merely teaching concepts; they want students to be able to apply what they learn in class to different, real-word scenarios and problems. You get a greater understanding of biology through this, I feel. It's a fast pace class, so you must keep up which may be hard at times. I know it was for me. Regardless you learn so much within that short amount of time that it's ridiculous. But that's the key: you actually learn. This isn't a regurgitation class where all you need to do is memorize material, you need to be able to apply concepts and explain and have discussions about the material. This made the course unique to other introductory courses and also made it both more enjoyable and difficult. However, it is a lot of dense material being thrown at you so I would recommend it if you're interested in the topic and want to dedicate time to truly learning the material or if you are interested in a career in the biological sciences.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 to students who need to take it, like pre-meds or students who need it as a prerequisite for another class. The format could have been a lot worse, but I just felt like there was a lot of material to be learned, far too much for only half a semester.",
    "If you need to take it, take it. I learned a lot.",
    "This was a very demanding course, that had difficult weekly problem sets, and challenging weekly quizzes. This course requires a lot of effort and is not very enjoyable.",
    "Biology 101 was like a sped up, condensed version of AP Biology. If you have a background in AP Biology or even general biology, I think that the material in the class is manageable. Though, I think it is definitely harder to do well in the class due to the pace and frequency of assessments. Overall, I would recommend this class if you are thinking about pursuing biology further or need the class for a requirement.",
    "If you have to take it, take it in the spring with Dr. Koleske. The rare professor who is a great researcher, too, Dr. Koleske is just a cool dude who teaches concepts well and tells funny stories.",
    "Bio 101 is an intro to bio that is rigorous and difficult however made easier to understand and not too stressful.",
    "I would recommend Bio 101 to another student.",
    "Biology 101 was an intensive and thorough investigation of biological processes. We covered an extensive amount of material that involved not only the basic surface material, but also applications in everyday life, which made the course very interesting. However, for an introductory course, this may have been too advanced for a half-credit course.",
    "It would but not whole heartedly",
    "I took it as pre requirement for MCDB even though I am still undecided. I wish I had taken another class, to be honest. I felt like I didn't make the best of my time by taking this course.",
    "Bio 101 was so great! I came in terrified because I hadn't taken Bio since my freshman year of high school. The instructors are so helpful and make the expectations for this course clear. Sign up for enrichment, it's like a mini review session every week. Keep up with the (manageable) work and you will be so fine.",
    "The course was a good transition from AP Bio to college level science. It helps to have a strong background in science, but there are enrichment sessions for those who do not. The lectures are better than most, but it helps to focus or else it is easy to get lost. The weekly quizzes will become routine, and the homework is fair. Section is helpful as well and makes the concepts more concrete.",
    "Yeah I would recommend the class as long as you don't have anything planned Sunday nights because you will be studying for weekly quizzes.",
    "I would definitely recommend 101. The workload is not too bad, the weekly quizzes help you keep up on the material, and tony is great. All in all a great course",
    "No - especially if you have not taken AP Biology. There is no time to process the information before having to be graded on it. The Enrichment section was not much help at all - it just seemed like a review of what was said in class rather than being presented in a different way to students that really needed the help.",
    "I definitely recommend it. It goes beyond biochem and biophysics and touches on genetics and some chemistry principles as well. I very much enjoyed the application to HIV today.",
    "BIOL 101 is an interesting and engaging class, regardless of whether or not you are interested in pursuing science. Since there is a wide skill range in the class, some students will be much more prepared than others, and some material will be very easy and other material will be very hard. The course is set up so that students are able to do well regardless of prior experience--there is even a special enrichment section on Wednesday afternoon that goes over the material for the week (the required section tends to expand upon ideas). Professor Koleske is a really engaging lecturer, and I enjoyed his lectures greatly.",
    "BIOL 101 01 forces students not to regurgitate information but rather to apply concepts in order to come up with solutions to open-ended problems.",
    "I would recommend the class because I enjoyed the subject and thought I learned a lot.",
    "This was a surprisingly fun introductory bio class. People often complain about large intro science lectures, especially about the professors, but Dr. Koleske was fantastic. He was an engaging lecturer, he was very organized, and he was patient with us. I can understand why this class might be challenging for people who havent had AP\/IB Bio or Chem, but otherwise its a pretty fun overview of biochemistry concepts that will get you excited about science! Admittedly, it starts out very slow and at the beginning the material might seem almost trivial, but by the end of the half-semester you will find that youve learned some very interesting and applicable scientific concepts. I would definitely recommend trying to take this with Koleske.",
    "This is pretty much a standard intro bio course with similar elements to AP Bio. My one recommendation would be to definitely study for the quizzes ahead of time since there is a time crunch on quizzes and you do not really have time to think for an answer. Additionally, straight memorization is not enough, application of material is a big part of it.",
    "Learn about composition and function of basic macromolecules with some jokes here and there.",
    "I think bio 101 is the most organized course I've taken at Yale so far. Although the material can be kind of overwhelming, there are many helpful resources. There are lecture slides, study guides, piazza, enrichment session, etc. I learned so much from this course that I believe for those who want to learn more about introductory biology, this course is a good choice.",
    "A typical intro course that was very straightforward and interesting.",
    "As a student who never took AP Bio, this course was able to introduce various topics in a clear and comprehensive manner. The quizzes were too long for the time period given, but evaluations otherwise were fair.",
    "I would recommend this course. I felt the weekly quizzes were graded harshly.",
    "Introductory biology course. Great for anyone interested in the field. Recommended!",
    "This class is not easy. It will teach you how to study, though probably not in time to get the kind of grade you were hoping for.",
    "Lots of people will likely tell you not to take this course unless you have to for a major or for premed, but I think anyone who expresses a basic interest in knowing a thing about Biology would benefit from this course, even if you don't take it with 102. The information was intriguing and Professor Koleske was one of the best professors I've had at Yale in my freshman year.",
    "Sarah Bertino was my TA and she was great overall.",
    "BIOL 101 was an informative class and I especially enjoyed the application of the material to HIV\/AIDS and current topics in medicine at the end of the course. However, I would not recommend this course to someone without advanced background in biology and\/or chemistry, because without previous knowledge, it would be very difficult to keep up with the fast-paced, half semester system. However, Professor Koleske is great and his lectures are very easy to follow, which makes the learning experience easier and more enjoyable.",
    "I would only recommend it if it's required for that students major",
    "An intro module, you will at times feel lost without the lectures, because biology is a very applied knowledge",
    "I would recommend this class if someone is interested in learning more and gaining a better understanding of the biology concepts that were most likely presented in high school. The class requires work, but if you are willing to add more effort than just memorizing facts then you will do fine.",
    "Bio 101 moves quickly and covers material efficiently.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend Biol 101 to another student.",
    "Would definitely recommend for anyone interested in Bio. Discussion section is probably the most important part of this course, and I cannot recommend going to it enough. Make sure to talk to friends about questions and homework, too.",
    "The class overall is a fair overview of some of the principles of biochemistry and presents the topic in a way that makes it relevant to the real world. Often STEM classes run the risk of being deemed boring, oftentimes because it is presented in such a manner that makes it seem like the subject exists in a vacuum and has no relevance to anything somebody might encounter on a daily basis, even if they are a prospective scientist. Thus, as a result, I'd highly recommend this class to anybody with even a passing interest in the molecular basics of life as we know it, because it is incredibly fascinating material and well worth the knowledge gained.",
    "Nope, I would not recommend this to another student.",
    "BIOL 101 is a great into bio course. The structure of the course is great with the weekly quizzes, since they keep you on your toes and help reinforce and allow you to better understand the material as you go along. Professor Koleske is a phenomenal professor, and Dr. Gardner is also a wonderful course coordinator. Although the course may not cover a huge amount of new material if you have a strong biology background already, it's a good introduction to the intro bio modules that reviews and goes slightly more in depth into key biological concepts.",
    "A class that will be very difficult to those who havent taken ap bio.",
    "Going over a few topics in biology in an invigorating class environment.",
    "BIOL 101 has a lot of similarities to AP Biology, so if you have had that the material may feel a bit overdone. That being said, enough new material is added to make this a worthwhile course to take.",
    "I would recommend Bio 101 for any student considering the pre-med track or the biological sciences. The class thoroughly covers the beginnings of biochemistry and biophysics. It is, however, a challenging class, so students should enroll knowing it's a demanding class.",
    "The emphasis of BIOL 101 is a build-up from understanding of basic principles of biochemical interactions within living cells towards understanding of how these basic interactions lead to higher systems and processes that become the foundation for metabolism, gene transmission, and disease spread and treatment. The course really encouraged me to think of biology, even at its most sophisticated level, as a science ultimately traceable back to the very simple biochemical interactions we were studying in lecture. That focus on making higher biological inquiry accessible even to beginning students provided a framework and a motivation for understanding the material in new ways.",
    "BIOL 101 is a course that must be taken for many science majors but one that I would not otherwise recommend. The class is stressful, fast-paced, and competitive. Although the quizzes are very frustrating at first, it is possible to learn the rhythm of the course and do well in the end. The concepts begin to fit together towards the end of the course, and the final is very fair."
