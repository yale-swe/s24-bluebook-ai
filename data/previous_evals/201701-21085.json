    "My Russian language skills (mostly reading and grammar, also listening and speaking)",
    "In my year of Russian, I have learned so much. At the beginning of this year I had absolutely no knowledge of the language. At this point, I am able to confidently write and speak about myself and others at an intermediate level, as well as understand some of the language in Russian programming.",
    "I learned new grammatical structures and vocabulary.",
    "This course helped me get a better understanding of foundational Russian grammar and introduced many concepts. We learned about different uses of the genitive case, the instrumental case, some verbs of motion, among other things. We also covered some Russian poetry, and the Russian birthday song. Though we haven't covered a lot in terms of everything that is needed to be fluent in the language, this semester definitely gave me the sense of how rich and nuanced the language can be, which helped me to appreciate it a lot more.",
    "I learned how to speak a different lanugauge. I also learned the importance of daily practice and review."

   "comments": [
    "Lots of strengths - friendly, personable instructors really care about the students, are available for frequent office hours, small seminars so everyone gets speaking time and feels comfortable asking questions Weaknesses I don't like memorizing poems that I don't even understand",
    "I think the teaching and availability of help are the best assets of this course. The textbook is very comprehensive and helpful to studying, and the tests and quizzes are very fair. Would not have changed much, except perhaps having more time on our more difficult quizzes.",
    "I think this course could do more to integrate oral speaking in throughout the semester.",
    "This class is small and very high on student engagement, which helps in learning the language. The professor and TFs are easy to access, and you can tell how much they really care about and love Russian. You will learn a lot, as the class is intense and covers a lot of ground. One thing that is hard about the course is that sometimes it moves at a fast pace, which doesn't allow you to absorb all of the information as well as you would like, but it is definitely manageable and you can get the concepts down well if you put in the effort to improve and practice.",
    "It's really hard but the program is great and its a lot of fun."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, very interesting language! Lots of fun",
    "I would recommend the class. Russian is a very relevant language in the geopolitical sphere, and though challenging, I truly don't think you'll have a better opportunity to learn it than at Yale. If you are even tentatively considering it, go for it! The Slavic department is a great group and will definitely add to your Yale experience.",
    "Yes, it is definitely lots of work (because you have homework every day) but you come away with a skill, so I think that makes it worth it.",
    "Very difficult. You have to be truly invested in learning the language, but if you are it's beyond worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that it's a lot of work. Russian is not an easy language, but this course is taught really well for student learning, and they really give good support. Russian is a beautiful language and Russia has a rich literary and cultural history that is not well known in the West, but is well worth taking Russian to learn more about it.",
    "Yes. It is awesome!"
