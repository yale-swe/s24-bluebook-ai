I would have appreciated the opportunity to read a few of the authors at greater length and to have less repetition (for example, we read chapters from Ferguson's The Anti-Politics Machine on three separate occasions, rather than devote a week to that important work).",
    "The readings are very great, and Carol's dissection of them was always helpful.",
    "I love the structure of Carol's courses \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0lecture followed by student-led discussion; weekly thesis sentences; comparative analyses twice during the semester. The topic was also fascinating and mind-blowing, and my brain was overwhelmed for the first little while but got more used to it. Carol is really good about answering questions as they arise, and providing feedback and guidance at office hours.",
    "Discussing the readings during class.",
    "The readings are super interesting, and Carol's very thorough explications are great. Her classes always make me think very critically and question my assumptions.",

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was VERY repetitive to have the professor spend approximately two hours per week lecturing on the exact points the authors we read discussed. As graduate students, I would hope we would be expected to be able to understand what we are reading, at least at a basic level, without having to rely on the professor walking us through it (and through her own very particular interpretations) each week. This was a repetitive formula and a very slow pace for a graduate course. Lectures would have been much more interesting had the professor expanded on that week's reading or given further case studies or even opened up the floor for a longer student conversation (seminar style) of the material.I also found the professor a bit one dimensional. Perhaps this was due to the repetitive, even redundant, teaching style described above or my own personal dissatisfaction with a Yale professor who seemed so bound to the confines of Foucauldian anthropological interpretations and her own personal background\/field work to the point where she gave the impression of a lack of curiosity or interest in other disciplines, regions of the world, etc.",
    "The 3-hour weekly class format made it hard to stay focused at times.",
    "This course was perfect!"

   "comments": [
    "Most weeks the lectures (which I have above described as repetitive, even redundant) took up the majority of the class time and we only had roughly 30 minutes remaining for discussion. I would have liked to see this ratio a little less lopsided. I feel like I gained a lot from the readings, very little from the lectures, and a fair amount from the often too-brief discussions."

    "Instructor: Jeffrey James Stoike \u00a0Jeff's lecture on his own fieldwork the last week of class was very interesting and I thought he did a nice job in its presentation.I was a little bit puzzled by his responses to some of the class's written work in which he critiqued student's ideas always in the less personal \"we\" as in \"we thought...\", \"we felt...\", \"we interpret Gudeman...\", etc. While some element of agreement with the professor is to be expected I wondered if he had any of his own ideas or if he was simply regurgitating the professor's opinions. I'm not sure if this is a critique more suited to the TA or to the professor.Finally, and this is not at all a critique of Jeff or the professor but rather of the structure of the course within F&ES, I find the use of a graduate student as a TA in a class with graduate students to be a bit awkward. I'm not particularly comfortable with essentially a peer giving me a grade. Maybe some of the seniors and first year graduate students in the class felt differently about this, however. In my opinion, peer critiques and peer comments are almost always helpful but the situation is a bit awkward when they are assigned the task of grading my work.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey James Stoike \u00a0Jeff was awesome! Very available to talk and work through things. Good at helping figure out what some of the more cryptic authors were saying. Any logistics were invisible. Helped me think new things about my research, too!",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey James Stoike \u00a0I think discussion in class could have been improved with Jeff's involvement.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey James Stoike \u00a0Jeff was very helpful, and responded quickly to questions via email. He also gave a compelling lecture, and was helpful in preparing for discussions."
