    "This class is great. We learn all about eukaryotic molecular bio. The smaller sections are really good - you discuss papers in depth. Overall, the course helps you learn to read scientific papers, and also presents a huge amount of information about bio.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Essentially a grad course, you come out knowing so much more about how to set up experiments and what to watch out for. Paper discussions also focus on data analysis and how to draw conclusions.",
    "I would certainly recommend it to other students. Not a lot of undergrads take this course, but the materials are really not that difficult. It's a great course that explore selected in-depth questions in molecular biology, including transcription, DNA Repair, mRNA and protein control. The course is very well organized and the materials are very interesting. The course load, albeit manageable, is fairly heavy. You can give it a try and see whether you like though details and ways of interpretating data.",
    "One of the toughest classes I have encountered thus far at Yale. But it was made very reasonable given how well the course was taught and its structure which included plenty of discussion sections and feedback on short biweekly papers. The midterms were dense but doable and the term paper was difficult. I would definitely recommend this class to those undergrads going of to grad school in the sciences or those that have a tremendous interest in the methods behind the biochemistry that allow us to indisputably resolve the action and interaction of a whole slew of little molecules bouncing around inside our bodies."
