    "I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes, it's a great set of readings, not attempting to cover everything but deal with key themes in modern history, and also incorporate literature and art. Would recommend to another student who is up for the double readings.",
    "Excellent discussion, excellent reading, and out of this world professors. If you have any interest in London or Paris, you really must take this course.",
    "Without hesitation. The course appeals to a broad community of students since its scope is so large, and yet it allows for individual participation. Even if I didn't feel comfortable commenting on certain debates due to my insufficient experience, I still profited from learning from such informed students, under the guidance of such informed professors."

    "I found this course helpful content-wise for my fields of study. I would have liked to see a bit more emphasis on the 20th Century, but the 19th Century was covered quite well.",
    "My understanding on both cities is now much more developed. I took this course because of my experience in both cities, and I have learned so much more about both the UK and France. Even though I am not a historian, I learned a lot about the craft of history."
