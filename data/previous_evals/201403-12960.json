   "comments": [
    "Interesting exploration of British art, great use of the BAC as a resource",
    "Art and the British Empire is definitely not an easy course but the amount of knowledge you get out of it definitely makes it worth it. Tim Barringer is amazing and, if for no other reason, you should take it because of him.",
    "A perfect introduction to British empire studies. Provides a solid foundation to build upon in future courses on individual countries",
    "A great class for everyone! I highly recommend it!",
    "This course fits into so many other categories of courses and is a great supplement for learning about European expansion. I highly recommend this course. Though the reading can be intense, it was a great course for understanding the cultural development in many nations.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class. Even with my reservations about some of the logistics of the course, this is the best History of Art class I've taken at Yale. Professor Barringer in a huge star in the field, and an absolute pleasure to be in class with. Also, the class is one of the few that really takes full advantage of the BAC, and so exposes you to a tremendous resource that is well worth spending time in. Barringer infuses all aspects of the course with more history than other History of Art courses (which tend to be more visual), making for an even better experience in my opinion. Students should be warned though that this class is probably not for those who have little experience in History of Art. It was one of the hardest History of Art classes I've taken at Yale, as the level of detail expected in the essays and exams is quite high.",
    "If Prof. Barringer teaches this course again, TAKE IT! The subject matter is fascinating, but his approachable, socially conscious, and incisive teaching style makes it. I went into the class scoffing at art history as elitist and irrelevant, and now I'm considering making it my second major. (I say this as a female POC with a personal history intricately linked to the history of the British Empire.) Prof. Barringer gives you the tools to understand colonial art and imagery as chronicles of sexism, racism, and propaganda. Ultimately, he gave me the tools to challenge the premise of the course itself and he approved when I did.",
    "Art and the British Empire is probably the best class I have taken at Yale. It is an in depth look at how British colonization affected the world through the lens of both history and art. The section in the Yale Center for British Art really allows you to interact with the collection and learn firsthand instead of through slides. I would recommend this class to anyone. It would be a great humanities credit or just a really interesting class to credit D. Honestly, everyone should take this class. Just take it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "I would say that it is a difficult course, with a lot of prep work required for each class and a lot expected of you for the evaluations, however, it is an interesting insight into British colonization and a new side to art history.",
    "Not...really. Take it if you are really interested in the material, and look through the syllabus before committing--a lot of it is super-archaic and obscure stuff. Be prepared for a pretty disorganized and confusing class. The only positive, to be honest, is being able to sit in on Barringer talk sometimes. Audit instead! Or just come to the classes that you are interested in.",
    "This was a fascinating and rich lecture course. It manages to cover an impressive historical and geographical range while still remaining attentive to historical specificity and local dynamics."
