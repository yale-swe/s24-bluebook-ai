    "I learned more of the french language in all aspects of it.",
    "This intensive French class was essential to my growth as a French speaker. The three largest categories of focus were vocabulary, ease of speaking, and ease of listening. After this class when listening to French on the radio, I sometimes even forget to what language I am listening.",
    "I really feel my conversational and written French greatly improved over the course of the semester. There often was a lot of work involved in this development, but I finish the course with an appreciation for the texts read as well as the grammar learned.",
    "Writing, reading, speakng and listening French.",
    "My speaking, writing and reading skills improved drastically during this class.",
    "I became much more comfortable understanding and utilizing advanced grammatical concepts; began developing a more nuanced vocabulary; become more ready to digest more difficult texts and discuss abstract concepts"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is well structured and geared toward teaching the kids effectively. It may benefit from being longer in time or taught on more days of the week to cover even more material.",
    "Part of the reason that this class is so helpful is that it consists of a lot of French practice. However, this is obviously a downside too, as I would often find myself frustrated with the sheer amount of work for the week. I understand the need for practice and for work, but sometimes I felt like it was just a little too much for a 1 credit class. Additionally, I think that this class could relate a little bit more to the current French culture and politics. We did discuss many French themes, but the texts and movies were all relatively old (1990s to 2000s or much older). I say this because many French 150 students are interested in further developing their abilities to live in a Francophone country and might be interested in a slightly more modern cultural understanding.",
    "The classes strengths stem from Madame Schneider's enthusiasm and toughness. She expects a lot out of her students, which means there is a lot of work. But, this also means that she will help you improve your conversational French greatly. The main weakness of the class is the expansive workload. It sometimes feels like the Course Pack exercise become busy work, and they are assigned nearly daily.",
    "This course is very interactive and the materials are very interesting. It builds up our language skills in vocabs as well as grammar.",
    "I enjoyed the literature we read and the movies we saw, and I felt like my grammar was overall strengthened. The downside of the course was the workload, it was so much more than any other 1 credit class. We were expected to spend hours reading\/watching and doing grammar excercises.",
    "This course was fantastic although it was a lot of work. The one downside was that I did more work for this class than I did for L4 French and only earned 1 credit. I guess it makes sense since this course met 3 days a week but the workload should be met with 1.5 credits.",
    "The strength of the course is that it works the gamut of language abilities - vocabulary, grammar, listening comprehension, speaking comprehension, reading comprehension - while being fully engaging and immersive. This is thanks to the diverse and interesting texts and movies and balance between grammatical practice and analytical writing. But also thanks to the professor, who did a great job cultivating a lively engagement with the exercises. Weaknesses - a bit too much work at times made it difficult to fully engage with the exercises and keep pace with the course. Especially with assignments during the week that included watching a movie, which altogether could take up four or more hours."

   "comments": [
    "Great extension to learning the french language if you want to master it truly.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in improving your French beyond just being able to get by in a Francophone country. After this course, you will be able to have conversations about art or culture in French, for example. However, it is an incredible amount of work, so make sure you are ready for the commitment.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, if they had a light course load from other classes. To fully derive satisfaction from this class, full attention has to be paid to it. Taking it as a fifth class would not bear fruit.",
    "This class is very important for students who wants to pursue studies in French literature",
    "Because of the workload I would not recommend continuing French past what is nescesary for the distribution requirements.",
    "Be prepared to work but your writing will improve drastically by taking this course. If you want to improve your French but aren't willing to do the work, take this class Credit D for sure. Madame Schneider is a joy and you will love having her as a professor.",
    "A great way to move one's French ability to a more conversational level."
