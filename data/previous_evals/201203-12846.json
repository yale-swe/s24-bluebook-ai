    "Spanish 140 will provide you with a review of the major grammar concepts and introduce you to a broad range of useful new vocabulary through the analysis of literature and film examples.",

    "If you want to learn more Spanish (and finish up the \"grammar\" chunk of the learning process) - take L4. It's speedy and effective. It was the first level I took at Yale, so I can't compare it to the others, but it felt a lot like high school workbook-style classes, just swifter. We don't do terribly many things \"outside\" of the confines of the textbook, which may feel stifling and silly for some students. And: most students don't care about learning Spanish, so that might feel frustrating. If you want a SOLID class, with a dependable, not-at-all-crazy workload, take it! Next semester I'll take L5, and I could NOT have gone there (even though I placed into L5) without L4 preparation.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I don't feel my Spanish improved that much at all, not a lot of real-world application.",
    "dont take this if you dont need to, or at least take it credit d if you can. super repetitive and boring and annoying exercises",
    "You're taking this because you have to or because you want to get to L5 classes. For these reasons, It's worth it! It isn't as bad as the intro classes are when it comes to pointless rules. Still not perfect, but not the same."
