   "comments": [
    "WIth Zuckerman, it's a pretty laid back class. Combination of it being right after lunch and his dry voice made it hard to stay awake sometimes. About 5 problem sets the entire year (25%) two midterms (20% each) and the final (35%). Problem sets are very manageable, especially if you've done proofs before. Didn't get very far in the book - studied set operations, relations, functions, cardinality, countable sets and some work with uncountable sets.",
    "Courseload fair and not too difficult. Best math class I took at Yale, Set Theory borders on philosophy.",
    "Zuckerman is definitely bizarre, but he is a good teacher. Yes, he does take liberties in going through the material more slowly than some might like, but he does it with a purpose \u0096 he exposes some subtleties that you would otherwise gloss over. In that sense, he gave us a deeper understanding of stuff at the expense of not treating as much. His humor is a bit weird, but you definitely get used to it once you go to office hours a bit. A quirky but likeable guy, basically.",
    "Challenging class, but completely manageable. The class atmosphere was small and very collegial. Also, Professor Zuckerman is amazing! He made all the material so interesting. And he is very approachable to talk to during office hours or after class if you have questions.",
    "Take this class if you are philosophically inclined. Pure mathematicians will probably find it too slow and not nearly challenging enough, and will end up covering most of this material in other classes. For philosophy majors, computer science majors, and math and philosophy majors, it's both a great insight into the fundaments of arithmetic, and a good source of tools that will be useful in other settings.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone!!You will learn a great deal about proofs and the way mathematics works.I think this is a great course to take right after high school math, because you get a great idea of how exciting mathematics can actually be. On the other hand, it seems like my friends from math and logic also learned quite a bit, it seems.One caveat: Homework will take a long time. You will think and think and get frustrated (time\/problem varies from 10 minutes to an hour, and each problem takes longer as you advance through the course). However, all of it is exciting and none of it is busywork!"
