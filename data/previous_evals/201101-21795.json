   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for any student. But if you are genuinely interested in some aspect of italian culture it will be more enjoyable. You'll come out with an average to firm grasp on the material.",
    "ITAL 120 is a fairly straightforward course in the italian language, cramming in the last sections of Italian grammar before L3. Honestly, you'll have covered all of Italian grammar by the end of this course, and while it may seem boring at times, you'll be shocked by how much Italian you'll learn at the end of this course. It dabbles a bit in literature and film, which were my favorite parts of the course. Anna is an excellent professor, and I would definitely recommend having her as a professor for this course as her enthusiasm for the subject is captivating.",
    "If you like studying languages, then definitely take Italian. It is fun, entertaining and you would enjoy becoming better as the year progresses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is slower paced than Italian 110 and covers half the chapters that you cover in 110. I would recommend taking the class with Iacovella but all of the teachers are very nice.",
    "This course gives you all the fundamentals of the language, continuing from L1. meets everyday which can be annoying, but a great way to get to learn the language.",
    "Definitely take it with Anna! She's wonderful and totally laid-back, which I think is the best kind of professor to be in an introductory language course. She makes you feel really comfortable with speaking and taking risks with your writing!"
