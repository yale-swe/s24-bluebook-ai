   "comments": [
    "This was my favorite class this semester and possibly during my entire time at Yale. The seminar surveys a broad history of abortion, contraception, birthing processes, reproductive technology, etc. from the 1800s to present day. The amount of reading was fair -- substantial enough to start earlier in the week but not overwhelming -- and all relevant and interesting. Professor Eisenberg is very open and engaging, and is a great resource on everything related to reproductive health. I highly recommend this course to another student as long as the student is passionate and committed to the topics covered in class. Prof. Eisenberg expects students to come to section prepared and engaged, and things are no fun unless everyone participates.",
    "Weekly discussions on pre-determined topics about very interesting readings.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to a fellow student, regardless of their level of interest in the subject matter. I learned a great deal about how to approach the study of history.",
    "lots of reading, but it is interesting and really supplements the class. you cannot get by without doing the reading, but you will want to do it. the workload is typical of a seminar",
    "I would highly recommend this course and Professor Eisenberg allows each student to pursue his\/her choice of topic on the final paper. This made it easy to make the course relevant to my own studies. I enjoyed having a small seminar and lively discussions each week!",
    "Great class. Definitely take it!",
    "Despite being cross listed, it's definitely more of a history class than a WGSS class (less focused on ethics\/morals or theory than I expected). I would absolutely recommend it! It helps you learn a lot about the roots of a topic that's so important in today's politics that it's easy to ignore its history!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you can secure a spot. There are a lot of readings, but they are worthwhile. The information gives students relevant background and nuance to participate in modern debates on reproductive rights.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "If you want to learn about reproductive history in America, then take this class! There's a decent amount of reading and much of it is online, but it's worth it! The discussions were great and the topics were fascinating. One warning: it's an interesting seminar in that it sometimes runs more like a lecture, so be prepared for that.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying American history from a different point of view, or to anyone interested in the history of sexuality and reproduction in the US."
