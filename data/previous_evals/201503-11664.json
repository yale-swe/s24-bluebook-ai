    "The class moves fast, and you have to come prepared. If you are willing to put in the time, this class will immensely boost your Latin abilities, and you will find enjoyment from reading the Latin. Bryant is the absolute Jesus of teaching Latin, so definitely take this class with him if available.",
    "Take it if you need to or if you like Latin. Not the most fun and interesting course of you don't like Latin, but not overly difficult and the text is cool.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's very difficult in my opinion, but is rewarding nonetheless.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy reading some great Latin prose (or you need to fulfill a requirement)! It isn't easy, but it shouldn't be too much work either."
