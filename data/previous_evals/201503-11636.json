    "this course is an interdisciplinary overview of global child issues. i have some takeaways due to paper research\/writing, but readings and conversation were oftentimes dry. erika's weekly slideshows were interesting but raced through, so that we didn't understand the information presented. it would have been helpful to clearly discuss paper expectations in class, since she cares so much about style. unfortunately, the class environment deteriorated over the course of the semester.",
    "This is a great class for people who want to explore any aspect of child development. Erika really works to incorporate any topic that students are interested in, so if you want to talk about something in particular it is definitely possible. It is not a hugely empirical class and I'd say I came away from it more with a broader sense of the issues around child development than with any clear facts learned. Honestly, I prefer this in a seminar, but if you like to come away with clear evidence-based answers this class probably isn't for you.",
    "I would! It is a shame that she isn't teaching again. If you want to learn about how to raise your children properly and about children on a global scale take this class when she offers it again!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "The seminar room, like most I suppose, is mostly dependent on the group you get. I would recommend the class if you feel confident that you care about children's issues and problems.",
    "Erika Christakis extremely knowledgable about so many aspects of childhood, and this course opened my eyes to the many problems children all over the world face. She is a genuine, caring and compassionate teacher. I hope that she will resume teaching in the near future.",
    "If you can get in, please take it. You won't regret it",
    "If you take advantage of the assignments you can learn a lot. Unfortunately I don't think this class will be taught again, and if it does it'll need some major restructuring to actually meet its course objectives.",
    "Good, interesting class, can be a little disorganized at times but Erika really allowed us to direct the conversation\/discussion topics.",
    "I hope Erika decides to teach the course again in the future. It was eye-opening and an interesting introduction into child-related public health and policy (particularly early-childhood-related). Erika is a wonderful professor who clearly cares about each of her students, and I think this course will be even better in future semesters (some of the kinks were worked out this semester). Would definitely recommended to anyone interested in children and\/or global public health."
