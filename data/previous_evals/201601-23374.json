    "This was a typical Shelly-style class. Most of the work happens outside of class when you read the assigned readings. The discussions are sometime interesting and helpful, but oftentimes driven by tangential concerns that you may not be interested in. Overall a solid course in value theory.",
    "This class covers four topics in depth that one spends (at most) a half hour or so each discussing in Shelly's Normative Ethics class (if you have not taken the latter, by the way, I would highly recommend doing so before taking this class). I was a bit surprised that the discussions about each of the individual components (virtue, desert, etc.) were not brought to bear on one another that often: we asked questions about what the most plausible theory of virtue would look like, for example, but rarely asked, for instance, how to weigh considerations of virtue against considerations of desert. What the seminar lacked in continuity of content, however, it made up for in continuity of methodology: it was fascinating to see each successive author take up and refine the methods of the previous one (I am thinking in particular of the successively more sophisticated use of graphs). Shelly is an incredible seminar leader, and I grew so much as a thinker, writer, and interlocutor in his class.",
    "Fabulous. Take as many classes with shelly as possible",
    "I would recommend this course. There are 3 papers (two 5 pagers and one 10 pager) and about 100 pages of weekly reading. Papers are both exciting and very challenging because there are no specific prompts. As is common knowledge, Shelly has very high expectations for his students, including for class participation.",
    "I would recommend. Makes you think a lot and challenge your intuitions!"
