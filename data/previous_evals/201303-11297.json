   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The class takes a probing, enlightening look at a period so crucial to the development of many of our contemporary political institutions and attitudes towards religion, economics, etc. Be warned, however: the title of the class is somewhat misleading. It is not so much a course on John Locke as it is a course on the history of late seventeenth-century England and the events leading up to the Glorious Revolution. That said, it's real gem. Professor Pincus is extremely knowledgeable and runs a rewarding seminar. Every class fills in a piece of the historical puzzle, and as the weeks go by you start to see the various circumstances and strands of thought being discussed come together to form a picture of the birth of classical liberalism. Professor Pincus is also very helpful outside the classroom, taking the time to comment on (very short) reading responses every week and meet with students regularly to help them with their research.",
    "I would recommend this class if a student were very interested in John Locke or the late 17th century. It is a good class to write a paper for, but I would not recommend it if you want a complete survey of Locke's period in English history.",
    "Not a philosophy class",
    "This was a very good course - highly recommend taking a class with Prof. Pincus. Take advantage of office hours and work closely with him on the papers."
