   "comments": [
    "I took it to fulfill an upper level requirement for G&G, but it was a really good course overall. Pretty rudimentary if you're in the major and have taken any of the other classes on natural resources, but it's valuable knowledge to have and Oristaglio is a pretty good teacher.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about fossil fuels and energy transitions.",
    "Awesome class, interesting, great science credit if you are well rounded in math and chemistry, but not a science-related major.",
    "If you have no background in environmental science or history, I would not recommend the class because it isn't a very comprehensive introduction to the subject. It's a valuable perspective but also you don't learn a ton in the class since we go over things so many times.",
    "G&G is an interesting an easy way to get an overview of Fossil Fuels and Energy! I would definitely recommend taking it if you have any interest in the subject.",
    "MUST TAKE if you are at all interested in this.",
    "I would recommend this class for a fellow student if they knew they were interested in the course material. Obviously a very relevant topic, but sort of becomes on you to maintain engagement because the material and class can verge on dry.",
    "If you have any interest in Energy Studies or the way the world uses energy in general, take this course. Prof. Oristaglio is great and the material is low key and interesting.",
    "I'd definitely recommend Fossil Fuels to anyone looking to have a better grasp on the major environmental issues of our day.",
    "It's what you make of it. Easy but opportunity to learn a lot if you engage with the professor. Also the field trip is a bonus!",
    "Overview of fossil fuel use, extraction, and effects in the U.S. and around the world. Take this class if you're interested in learning about fossil fuels, but more about the process of obtaining them than their impact. Course includes 6 problem sets worth 10% of grade, and two tests (mid and final) worth 20%. Class is very fun and not all too challenging until the final, which you should plan on memorizing the review slides for.",
    "Don't take this class. Psets are tedious, boring, and useless. Exams are disproportionally hard. Haven't met a single person who enjoyed this class. Oristaglio is one of the most boring professors at Yale. If you need a science credit, take something else. If I could go back in time, I would not have taken this class.",
    "Cool class, some materials become repeated many times throughout the semester. Final was tough.",
    "Good professor, learned a lot, not very time consuming, probably got a B+ because the final was very difficult",
    "A good introductory science course and look into the G&G major.",
    "Shop this course if you are interested in an introduction to fossil fuel resources with plenty of review of basic earth systems science.",
    "learn a solid foundation of the geology of the different kinds of fossil fuels, the chemistry behind them and their environmental effects. the psets were difficult at times but be prepared to get bored in lecture sometimes because Professor O will go on forever about somewhat irrelevant info. I had a much harder time in this class than I thought I would. However, that being said, I still did well in the class. He also took attendance this year. Take it for a science if youre okay with doing a decent amount of work but this is no gut.",
    "Brilliant Rhodes Scholar-gone-oil-sellout (Dr. Oristaglio, Yale Hoops circa Frost-Nixon) teaches a banal class on an immensely complicated subject. Build up from chemical foundations to understand energy intensity, stratigraphic\/structural traps, et al., from middle school science to an impossible (petroleum-heavy) final exam. Attendance at 9am was mandatory\/p-set every two weeks, relying more on how long you spent researching than intellect. Useful at course's end (although individual components felt odd\/scattered), even for the environmentalist in understanding what we're combating.",
    "Very good course for GG\/non GG majors alike. Even if GG isn't your thing you'll learn a bunch about a very important field, regardless of your opinion on fossil fuel usage.",
    "This course considers both the geological facts and uncertainties of fossil fuels, as well as the political, social\/environmental, and economic contexts that affect and are affected by the fossil fuel industry. As such, it is great for many students and I would recommend it to another student.",
    "low key course, with interesting material, very pertinent.",
    "This class is useful for those who know very little about energy issues, and need quite a slow pace of learning. There were certainly some interesting and challenging lectures, but the class is lacking in depth.",
    "This is a great science course regardless of your science background. I took it as an engineering major and felt neither overqualified from other science classes nor underprepared. The workload is very manageable (especially compared to other PSET classes) and Professor Oristaglio provides plenty of opportunities to get help. The midterm was on par with the difficulty of PSETs and the final exam was harder (though he warns you about that). Overall, I really enjoyed this course, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in better understanding energy.",
    "TAKE IT!! Professor Oristaglio is a teacher you do not want to miss out on getting to know. The courseload is spread out such that the class teaches you important knowledge and skills without being overtly demanding. Non-STEM majors should consider this class to expose themselves to scientific reasoning in a non-stressful and rewarding way.",
    "G&G 274 is a survey course on Fossil Fuels that focuses on the formation, distribution, and extraction of coal, oil and natural gas, and also touches on the end uses and environmental consequences of these fuels. It goes into more detail that many other G&G courses do on these subjects, and is interesting regardless of how much scientific training you have coming into the class (however, the class is also very acceptable to people who have taken no science class since high school). I would definitely recommend this class to another student (as long as they are interested in fossil fuels).",
    "This is a relatively easy Science credit to take. The Midterm and the psets aren't difficult and that's 80% of the grade, but the final was much harder than the rest of the class. Be prepared for that.",
    "Covers the origins of coal and petroleum, extraction processes for fossil fuels, and environmental harms of their use. Really expanded my knowledge of the US energy system, and I'd absolutely recommend it as a SC credit for people interested in energy policy (I wasn't, but I now am after taking the class). Problem sets are pretty simple, but don't reflect test material that well. The midterm is fair, but the final exam is challenging. Oristaglio is a seasoned veteran in the petrochemical industry, an expert, and I'm very grateful I took this class, as I know so much more about how we power our economy, and the harms that this system brings.",
    "Pretty interesting class, but you will only learn as much as you want to. The math\/science aspect is easy, class material is coherent and well conveyed, and Oristaglio is a very lenient grader when it comes to the problem sets and midterm, BUT this results in everyone having really good grades up until the final, which he makes significantly harder than the midterm and grades more harshly to balance it all out\/make sure everyone doesn't get flat A's. Good class but NOT A GUT.",
    "Yes. This class is a good basic course for those that do not fully understand and are curious about the origins of fossil fuels.",
    "The class is a based around 6 problem sets, each due every other week, that make up 60% of your grade. The problem sets are interesting and well thought out; each is an exercise in a different aspect of the life cycle of fossil fuels. Lecture is interesting, although it can move slowly at times. A good class, take it if you don't mind getting up for a 9am.",
    "A good class if you need a science credit and are interested in fossil fuels.",
    "A great SC credit for non-science majors - really insightful, not too much work, and a great professor. Highly recommend.",
    "This is a really interesting, pretty easy science credit. The material is good, especially the first half and you will learn something, which cannot be said for some of the other science classes. The location and time suck. Get a bike. The psets are pretty easy, maybe a few hours on each. The final is totally unfair and is way way harder than the rest of the course, not at all what we learned.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. It is an amazing course with a very passionate and knowledgable professor. As an economics major interested in the energy sector, I'm really glad that I took this class. Professor Oristaglio is great at making the materials accessible to any students. I finish the semester with a better understanding of fossil fuel formation and energy transition. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "I really liked this class and thought it was a great survey of the basics of world energy and fossil fuels.",
    "It's a good class. Informative and not much work.",
    "Really interesting. Wish I'd paid attention more in the second half of the course. The PSETs are not hard, the midterm is doable, and the final is HARD. But study for it and you will be fine.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Interesting and not too hard. Psets were kind of tough at the beginning.",
    "If you think the material is interesting take it because it is an enjoyable class and Professor Oristaglio is a cool professor. However, if you have a heavy course-load and don't anticipate having a lot of time to study for the final -- be warned, you will probably screw yourself over because the final was a lot more difficult than the rest of the class. If you have adequate time to prepare for the final, however, take the time to do so.",
    "An easy science credit. If you are STEM, it will be even easier.",
    "Great course! 6 psets, 1 midterm 1 final--go to all lectures they are really interesting. only complaint: it would be much nicer if he could use the online grading system. Review sessions were really helpful.",
    "Definitely recommend this course.",
    "Great course. One of the few courses at Yale where you can get a balanced perspective on the US and Global energy supply and the importance of fossil fuels. Prof. Oristaglio does a great job of discussing the geology of fossil fuels as well as the pros and cons as an energy source. The workload is modest to light and the material is interesting.",
    "A strong course on an interesting topic, though lectures can sometimes be a bit dry, and homework can feel repetitive. Good background for many debates though.",
    "If you're interested in getting a basic, yet comprehensive overview of fossil fuels, take this class! The problem sets are manageable, as were the exams (though make sure you study for the final because it was significantly more challenging than the midterm), and if you show up to class and pay attention you'll come away with a lot from the class. I wasn't using this to fill any requirements, I'm an environmental studies major and wanted to learn about the material, and was happy with the class.",
    "Great course. Really hands on and applied focus. You learn pretty much everything about oil. A really fun approach to science. The P-Sets were challenging in a good way, and completely easy to get 100% on (you could just go to a study session).",
    "G&G 274 was a very interesting class that gave a thorough introduction to the geology, chemistry, and environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Professor Oristaglio has a particularly interesting insight into the industry given his work experience, which I think really adds to the course. I think some background in chemistry is important, but all of the earth science concepts can be picked up during the course. I would recommend the course for someone who is interested in learning more about where the modern world derives its energy. A word of caution is that the final is very difficult.",
    "Great science class, would absolutely recommend it. Low workload and you get a decent knowledge about fossil fuels."
