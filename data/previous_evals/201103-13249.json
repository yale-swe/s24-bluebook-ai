    "Overall, I am very happy with the course. Working on real research data allowed me to utilize my data management skills and develop products that were helpful to the research team. Since I was able to work one-on-one with Professor Pettigrew, we established timelines that were appropriate to the both of us. In addition to meeting weekly, I also attended lab meetings to get a sense of what other team members were working on.",
    "A wonderful learning experience, it was great to practice hands-on lab research, and it was an independent based learning format.",
    "Good way to learn the practical side of public health research and figure out what you do and do not like about it.",
    "For me, it was extremely useful since I was taking the course offered by the professor simultaneously as working in their lab, which allowed me to learn the material in the classroom and hands-on at the same time. I spent a lot of time with the professor's research assistants and lab assistants and barely any with her, however that is what I expected and the experience was very beneficial to me."

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Professor Pettigrew is very knowledgeable in her field of study and I was glad to be able to work with her this semester. During our weekly meetings, she would spend time teaching me about the important background information that is essential to her research project. I was able to learn a lot from these discussions on top of what I accomplished through my own data analysis.",

    "It's a wonderful course if you are looking for a true laboratory research experience."
