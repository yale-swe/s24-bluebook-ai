   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course!",
    "This is a must-take class. It's unlike any history class you have ever taken before--but don't be afraid. You'll learn a ton and have a great time doing it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Overall, the workload is pretty light, but the readings\/films are weighted significantly more on the latter half of the course, which can be rough. Professor Merriman is an absolute gem - he really makes the class enjoyable! The readings and films themselves are also pretty interesting. The only assignment (apart from section assignments, which I assume vary by year) is a 10-page paper on any topic of your choosing, and the midterm and final exams are reasonable.",
    "Definitely an interesting class about both well-known and little-known episodes of French and European history.",
    "An interesting course, but Merriman's lectures are all over the place.",
    "Yes definitely",
    "Although I learned a lot from the readings and my conversations with the TA, the lectures are poorly organized. Take it if you're interested in the materials despite the teaching.",
    "A very good overview of modern French history. Lectures can seem a bit structureless at times but the readings make up for any gaps. The movies are also all fantastic.",
    "A good class that teaches you all about 20th Century France. I would recommend it if you're prepared to learn primarily from the textbook, as Professor Merriman often only covers the very basic (or even minor) details during lecture.",
    "John Merriman type of crazy, amazing historian that I imagine when watching movies like (forgive this reference) National Treasure. His lectures are informative, insightful, and well-structured, and among the best that I've had at Yale. His focus on cultural history in particular is really excellent, because it allows you to focus on great themes in French history: How did people come to see themselves as French? How have minorities come to be seen as \"ethnic others\"? His approach to history is also really great -- he doesn't really care if you know about specific dates and minute details, as long as you know how they fit into broader themes of history. This laxness allows you to really go into the course material without being paranoid or hyper-focused, and just marinate in history. A word of advice, though: be careful about work piling up toward the end of the semester. The work is pretty light up until the first midterm, and then after, you have almost a book a week, several movie to watch, AND a short final paper and exam. It doesn't look like a lot because you don't have that many actual assignments, but section is pretty rigorous. It's definitely manageable, but be sure to plan ahead.",
    "Don't take it, I did not enjoy",
    "Excellent overview of 20th century French history.",
    "I would recommend it for students with an interest in history, especially European history. I don't think those with a previous interest in history would find it particularly interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class towards any student who likes history or France. However, given its deep diving into French history, I might caution a student who doesn't fall into either of these categories. I would also caution a fellow student who has absolutely no interest in cultural history."
