    "I learned about Turkish culture and grammar.",
    "I learned how to engage in conversation, literature, and film after only a year of studying Turkish. This course taught me a lot about Turkish culture, and was the highlight of my week.",
    "In its own way this felt like more of a life course than a Turkish one. The whole class was in Turkish, of course, but throughout we were watching films and tv shows, reading and analysing literature and discussing current affairs. Improved my Turkish in leaps and bounds, and came out of the course feeling more mature and learned for it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this class was that it provided me with a setting in which to practice my turkish. The small-class environment allowed me to participate a lot, and really develop my language skills. I have become much more comfortable with Turkish.",
    "It's hard for students of such varying levels of ability to all be in the same course. I guess I wish there was a little more structure to developing language skills (maybe a one month review of more complex grammatical structures at the beginning of the course), and I think weekly vocabulary quizzes would be helpful.",
    "Strengths of the course are its flexibility, small class size, 1-on-1 attention with the teaching assistants and even the teacher. Field trips are also a big plus! Teaching quality deserves mentioning too! Weaknesses of the course might be sometimes lacking a clear structure to too great of an extent and having to find our own direction sometimes."

   "comments": [
    "Turkish is a fun language, and Ozgen cares for her students a great deal. This class is wonderful!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Students have a lot of say in how the class is run, which makes it really great in terms of tailoring it to the interests and abilities of the students. Really the whole point is to be practicing and speaking Turkish, and Ozgen is really willing to put in the work to make sure that happens in a way that works for her students, in both engaging their interests and making sure they're learning. Definitely worth it.",
    "100% would recommend to anyone interested in taking Turkish, especially people who speak the language at home but have never learned it in a formal setting. Ozgen is a great teacher and the course is very interesting, student-oriented and unique. Learned a lot about Turkish culture and felt prepared to go into the Turkish world after taking this. The only shame is that there aren't more L5 classes in Turkish.",
    "Absolutely recommend the professor and course!"
