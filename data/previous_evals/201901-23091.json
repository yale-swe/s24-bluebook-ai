    "The professors are great and workload is light.",
    "Swapna ji is a great instructor, and probably the most patient professor on campus. She would regularly let us get samosas and chai from SAS department events and was very understanding when it came to things like having to reschedule certain assignments. I think in terms of content, the course would have been better had there been more of an emphasis on reading Hindi literature, though I understand that it might have been difficult to implement given our class' tendency to not practice reading in our own time.",
    "Great course. You learn a little of everything: music, literature, history, film, and politics. I wish we read more Hindi diaspora writing.",
    "The course, at times, can be unclear and confusing. Perhaps a bit more structure would be helpful. The class is like a family, though, and Swapna Ji and Wafa are incredible. You will be lucky to have such caring instructors!",
    "One of the only weaknesses is that the course was a little bit disorganized at times. Besides that the course was great. The instructor and teaching assistant were very accommodating and helpful, especially to those who did not have as strong of a background."

    "Definitely take this course. It was very interesting.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. This course is a great way to build on pre-existing Hindi knowledge that you have, even if you're only able to understand. The teacher and class guide you along beautifully to ensure you're on your way to success."
