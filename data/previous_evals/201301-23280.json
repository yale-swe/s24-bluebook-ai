    "absolutely. if you can take it, take it",
    "If you take 114, you MUST take it with Professor Guy. He is one of the coolest guys you will ever meet, and even if the material sounds boring, I don't think there's a way to be bored in his class. He's also very approachable, and he's always willing to give feedback on all drafts. The 4 essays and light reading (with additional writing exercises and forays) made for a very manageable work load. The grading was always fair and his comments were super helpful. Overall, one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale!",
    "You MUST take English 114 with Professor Guy. He is wonderful. It makes the class so enjoyable! He is willing to meet with you as much as you'd like to talk about the papers, or about whatever is on your mind. He is really helpful in giving feedback after each paper, so that you can improve as the semester goes along. I was ambivalent about taking this class as a sophomore, but it didn't even matter because I so enjoyed the experience with Professor Guy.",
    "Yes, definitely take it!",
    "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat. There's a reason the waiting list for this semester had 30 people on it. Alfred Guy is a phenomenal teacher, and the students his class attracts (at least my semester) are engaging and provide great insight.If Professor Guy taught even four of the twelve required courses for the English major, I would major in a heartbeat, just to work with him.If you can, take this class. Actually life-changing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for anyone looking to take an introductory writing class at Yale. I have learned a lot about writing papers of all different kinds, logically creating arguments, and organization. The teacher was excellent because he didn't simply assign essays without any constructive work. Grades fairly. Excellent pick.",
    "This is a wonderful class! It will drastically improve your writing skills, yet it will do so in a fun and enjoyable manner. The professor was wonderful, the class was interesting, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in improving their writing skills.",
    "This is a great course to take if you haven't written long, analytical papers at Yale yet. You get at least one draft and you learn the techniques to writing a juicy paper.",
    "I would say that it's a pretty straightforward 114 class where you write 4 essays that you have multiple drafts for and you get to talk about interesting ideas about the good life that you hadn't thought about before. Great way to get a writing credit, actually learning how to write and gaining new perspective. The class also won't kill your workload if you manage it right.",
    "I would highly recommend this based on the subject of the class as well as the teacher and his teaching style.",
    "This 114 section is a blast, and a great opportunity to hone your writing skills. It is based in a very philosophical content, so you will read all the most well-known philosophers throughout time and learn to make connections and arguments based on their writings. If philosophy is your interest, absolutely take this course. I chose it more because of Professor Guy's fantastic reviews, and he is an amazing instructor, but sometimes the content of the class was too heavy\/probing for my personal taste. Didn't matter. I still loved the class above most others I've taken at Yale just because Professor Guy is so great. So even if you hate philosophy, take this class.Professor Guy is lively and fun and eloquent. He leads discussion and expresses his own opinions with flair and enthusiasm. He's head of the Writing Department at Yale, and he takes your suggestions\/comments about writing at Yale to heart. His main focus of the class is to get you to learn to make a more effective and provoking argument. He cares about getting to know everyone individually and learning what they have to say. He also wears great suits and lapel pins, and he's a Sci-Fi fanatic and the whole of 35 Broadway is riddled with his cult-classic movie posters.One thing you should know going into this class: be prepared that the entire class will be allowed to read your work without your foreknowledge or permission. Professor Guy runs his class with the ideal that we can all learn from reading and responding to the writing of our peers. So every time you turn something in (be it draft, foray, assignment, finished essay), he will select one student's, and pass it out for everyone to read, and then you will conduct a class discussion for at least twenty minutes on that person's work. Everyone is positive and constructive, and everyone will get that treatment at some point so there's no judgment. Just know that it will happen. And in truth, it really does work. You will gain ideas about what to do with your own writing by reading and workshopping the writing of your peers.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest at all in enlightenment, spirituality, ideas of happiness, or the argument against all of these.Professor Guy is one of the greatest teachers out there and the course is fun, relatively easy, and will actually improve your writing.Take this take this take this and you will not regret it."
