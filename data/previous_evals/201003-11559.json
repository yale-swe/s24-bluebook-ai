    "I gave the class an average-poor rating because the course did not go deep academically or theoretically into the issues. The usefulness of this rating comes down to your belief about the usefulness of practitioner-leaning courses. I did enjoy the wonderful array of guest speakers, but I am a person who thinks the best instruction for later practice is academically challenging instruction rooted in theory and creativity. I was surprised at my ability to use the language of the course well in the final project though, so there is use in that.",
    "Unfortunately, there was not much substance to the course. I wish there had been more practically applicable information rather than general topics like \"eco-efficiency\" and a case study or two that focused too much on upper, upper management decisions. Maybe there is not enough substance for this class to be a full-semester class. Green to Gold itself is very much an outline. Using that as a jumping off point for more depth would have been better than more or less covering the material in the book in class.",
    "Excellent course, excellent mixture of theory and case studies. The professors were great.",
    "This class is a vital first step to exploring corporate environmental strategy.",
    "The course was most valuable when Steve Ramsey or guest speakers lectured and less so during Professor Esty's presentations. Although I am a believer in the tenants of eco-strategic advantage, I need more empirical evidence to be convinced of its success than Professor Esty's content afforded. Conversely, Steve Ramsey was incredibly effective at framing issues and strategies.",
    "4. Steve Ramsey far superior to Dan Esty in engaging with students and delivering lectures. Prof. Esty was perfunctory at best and disengaged at worst.",
    "Q5&7 The instructors encouraged student participation during the class but then did not participate in the one significant activity that required student presentations. The latter caused a fair amount of grumbling from students.",
    "Business management oriented, but still relevant to non business degree students",
    "Questions 7 and 10. Although the teachers seem capable, the material being taught is useless. Using the prefix 'Eco' in front of regular business words is not Environmental Management and doesn't provide a Strategic Advantage no matter how nice it sounds on Green to Gold. The teachers showed disrespect by not showing to student presentations, taping them instead, and submitting grades for them 8 weeks later. The assignments had little to do with course work. Important classes (such as two on CSR) were skipped in favor of \"guest lecturers\" that showed up and told us nice stories, presentations and anecdotes but taught us little to do with the actual class. I will strongly discourage anyone from taking this class.",
    "5. I didn't actually contact the professor outside of class.",
    "-overall really useful case studies in the class-great introduction of various sustainability tools",
    "Save yourself a semester and read 'Green to Gold.' That's all this course amounts to."

Prof Esty gave a broad survey of what is going on with corporations and sustainability and various strategies they are taking to be green. The information used was very current which made it interesting and relevant.",
    "Professor Ramsey was a fantastic lecturer. He engaged the students in the material by asking questions and drawing from his own extensive professional experience. I really enjoyed learning from him.Also I found all the visiting speakers to be a hugely important component of the course. I was very impressed with their professional backgrounds, speaking skills, and thoughts on the material taught in this course.Finally, I really enjoyed the BP project.",

   "comments": [
    "NA",
    "More discussion and deeper dives into case studies",
    "The lectures need to go deeper into the theory behind sustainability and environmental progress through business. What is the roll of business? We answered this question through examples, but we did not dive into the philosophy and rich theory behind this question.",
    "Steve Ramsey's part was too GE-heavy. I know that's his frame of reference, but it played like a giant case study and was hard to get perspective. Esty should have gone into more depth rather than the outline form that he seemed to stick to.",
    "It will be nice to have more strategy based training based on reading. Reading materials were good but too bad we didn't get to utilize them.Regarding guest lecturers, it was nice to have them but there has to be some linkage between the course. And sometimes there was no announcement before the guest lecture so I had to listen to lectures without being prepared.It would be better to have guest lectures aligned with scheduled course materials. (For example, Ben&Jerry talk was great but we didn't touch anything at all about green marketing at the talk but that was originally scheduled in the syllabus).",
    "Adding more data analysis to the course to explore how environmental strategy can truly be value-adding; Re-thinking the assignments of the course - I would have preferred to write a sustainability report earlier in the semester and then do the group presentation farther into the class.",
    "Some form of 3rd formal assignment to pace the course better, rather than mere discussion. Another short paper, perhaps.",
    "1. Prof. Esty's lectures were dry, boring, and repeated information already available in his book. He rarely engaged with the class and failed to attend key assignments and class sessions such as the BP presentations.",
    "The instructors clearly know their material as well as one could hope for; sometimes this comfort may have allowed them to be less structured in their agenda, so we would end up reiterating much of what was assigned in the reading rather than digging deeper.",
    "Content should be more practical instead of anecdotal.",
    "When the professors asked questions, it seemed that they required a canned response without room for discussion about new ideas and\/or concepts.While our final project required us to develop a sustainability plan, I would have liked to learn more about developing it with concrete examples or templates. I'm not sure if we will get any feedback on our submitted paper and it would be helpful to know if we completed it effectively.",
    "-move away from some redundant or overlapping topics; supplement the course discussions with newer case studies-move away from group assignments (see below)",
    "Professor Esty could use PowerPoint to liven up the lectures. It would also be helpful to have some smaller assignments throughout the semester. I would have really liked to have written brief sustainability strategies earlier on to get a better idea of how to write them. By writing an additional paper during the course I would have learned the material in greater depth.",
    "Professor Esty is so thoughtful and smart, but I wished he could have engaged the students a bit more during his lectures.",
    "In five years of taking university courses, I have never met a professor less engaged with students and his role as course instructor. It is abundantly clear that he has at least 4 other priorities that outrank his teaching. This went from being frustrating, to just a class-wide running joke. He only lectured at 1\/4 of the time, leaving the brunt of the work to guest speakers and a co-lecturer. Neither he nor co-lecturer bothered showing up for the all-important mid-term presentation. Furthermore, I would be shocked if either lecturer actually read our final project. Grading was arbitrary to the point of being unfair.",
