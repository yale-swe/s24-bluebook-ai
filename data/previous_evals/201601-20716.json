    "I 100% recommend this class to literally everyone. If you think you already know what feminism is, if youve ever watched a human rights organizations inspirational ads and felt like there was something missing, if youve never gotten a chance to think about the way gender, sex, and sexuality are constructed and produced outside the US, if youre a human being, TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Agard-Jones is tragically leaving Yale, but anyone teaching this course will most likely be fabulous.",
    "This class is an amazing way to look at issues of gender\/sexuality as they travel transnationally. I would highly recommend to any student looking to broaden their worldview and learn about things outside of the US. Even though it was a requirement for the major, I really enjoyed it and would have taken the class even if it was not required.",
    "\"Globalizing Gender and Sexuality\" is a must-take course for people who want to think critically about the rhetoric they use, the cultural constructs they use for reference when talking about gender and sexuality, and the way postcolonial identities, politics, and power disparities contextualize human rights claims. That said, I think the course could fall flat without Professor A-J. It needs her spark and pushback.",
    "WGSS 206 is a look at how concepts--such as gender and sexuality--travel. Moreover, it is a general critique of the liberal, human-rights framework and how it imposes its values on other societies.",
    "This class is a great balance of a lot of theory and how theory applies or doesn't to what's going on in the world right now in terms of gender and sexuality.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who can take it. This course alone is a reason to major in WGSS, and has been seminal in my academic development. I appreciate how the class is structured around slow critique, something I had never before experienced in my Yale career. I also think that class discussions were relevant and urgent, and that my writing greatly improved from the various opportunities I had in class to revise it with my peers.",
    "This class will do a lot to develop and push your thinking as you move issues of gender and sexuality into a global frame. It forces you out of your comfort zone and is full of amazing discussions!",
    "Regardless of your major, this class is great. The emphasis on individual experiences and interests creates a learning environment that is useful and conducive to students from different backgrounds both academically and personally.",
    "Take this class if you want to be challenged and learn how to think critically with multiple scholars"
