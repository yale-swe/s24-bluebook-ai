    "This is a great class. It might not be what you expect (it's a lot more about journalism generally and the state of things than it is an intensive writing class). You write two articles - one a profile of a classmate and then a long form piece. Workwise it's minimal and the stories that Prof. Abramson shares are incredibly interesting and she brings great guest speakers plus you get to go to the Times. If you can get in - take it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn about journalism (but perhaps not write too much)",
    "Journalism is a great class if you are interested in journalism and already have some experience in it. You could not ask for a better window into the industry. Definitely take it.",
    "Jill was a great teacher - her stories were compelling, her comments on our writing were helpful, she was very kind and encouraging. I really recommend this course - what a cool woman!",
    "This is a course in not only the writing of journalism but also its business and future. It's unlike other creative writing courses in that there's less time devoted to workshop and more time to discussion of trends and practices of journalism. For example, we discussed major events in journalism history -- Watergate, Wikileaks (Prof. Abramson revises the syllabus to keep it current) -- and crafted our own business models for a new journalism enterprise, in addition to writing a profile and a feature article. Prof. Abramson is awesome, with (of course) lots of insight and stories to share, and she brought in several interesting visitors. The visit to the New York Times building was a ton of fun, and just one example of the time and energy Prof. Abramson, busy as she is, seems to enjoy devoting to this class. She made herself available for meeting outside class as well. Take this class if you want to learn about journalism and get into the Journalism Initiative. It's a lot of fun -- I would take it again. And, as with most writing classes, you'll get out what you put in.",
    "Take it take it take it",
    "Yes, this class is great! Professor Abramson is amazing and knows so much about the journalism world and is happy to share it with her students. You hear tons of cool stories and get great advice about writing, reporting, and editing.",
    "Honestly, this course was not what I hoped it would be. I was expecting to learn more about how to discover, research, and write a compelling journalism story, and what I got instead was essentially a beginner's guide to the inner-workings of the New York Times. Don't get me wrong--that was pretty cool. But the course didn't help me learn how to report, and it didn't give anyone in my class who didn't have previous experience in journalism a good idea of how to navigate the area of study. All in all, a pretty big letdown in spite of some of the really interesting stories that Professor Abramson has to share.",
    "chill class if you're interested in learning about the world of journalism in its inner workings; two assignments, including a profile of a classmate, in which you have a significant degree of freedom"
