   "comments": [
    "I don't recommend this course. Try taking it a different semester; this class starts slow and accelerates to a ridiculous pace, compared to other orgo classes. The pacing wasn't very balanced or even. Not enough time was spent in class over the reactions.",
    "If I had one hour to live, I would spend it in this class, because it feels like an eternity.",
    "as a class, it is actually pretty interesting, but my experience was horrid.",
    "I would never recommend this course to ANYONE. Not even my worst enemy.",
    "If you could take it with a different professor, I definitely would. For exams, Saunders does not explain what material will be focused on. He also often goes off-topic.",
    "Do not, under ANY circumstances take this class. Even if it means you have to gnaw your own foot off. You will NOT learn organic chemistry from Saunders. If you are taking this class for MCATS you will have to teach it to yourself or go take another orgo class (at a certain point in the semester our TAs made the choice simple, if you can't learn from the book, drop the class). If you're taking it because chemistry genuinely interests you, then you will be even doubly miserable.Never in your life will you encounter a more horrendously taught class. It really is an embarrassment to this school. You should do everything humanly possible to avoid taking this class with Martin Saunders.",
    "Absolutely not. I hope that Martin Saunders is not allowed to teach this again, in which case I would just say make sure you keep up with reading and study the reactions a lot. If, however, this travesty of a professor is allowed to continue teaching, avoid the class at all costs. You will learn nothing from lecture, you will be subjected to constant tirades about the uselessness of resonance structures, you will learn that the Schrodinger is the unequivocal ruler of the universe, and that's about it. You will be tested not on understanding but on regurgitation (make sure you use exact words or else you'll pay!), and when you're finally getting comfortable with that mindless form of testing you will be asked to understand things that he is too lazy to satisfactorily explain (beginning with the 150 reactions you are expected to learn in the second half of the course, while you cover only three out of eleven book chapters in the first half of the course). If you are facing the possibility of Martin Saunders just wait a semester; believe me when I say you will be glad you did.",
    "If you have the choice to take Orgo II with another professor, I would recommend that instead. Prof. Saunders is a friendly guy who is a pretty good lecturer and is excited about the material, but he was so terribly unorganized. The tests and assignments in no way reflected the student's understanding of the material, and its impossible to tell what your grade will be. I would actually recommend it to anyone who is bad at orgo, because you really have the same chance of doing well as the kids who are great at it.",
    "Overall, a good class. Prof. Saunders is easy to listen to. But it was sometimes a bit frustrating because the chapters covered are unevenly distributed so that the professor has to teach during reading period.The tests are fair. Do the problem sets - they prepare you well for the tests and the final exam.",
    "it is second semester orgo",
    "I would recommend this class, but be prepared to really put in a lot of work outside of class studying on your own and learning from the textbook. Professor Saunders is very nice, but he tends to focus on more conceptual things which is good if you like that but a little frustrating if you're used to professors teaching straight from the textbook. Fortunately, he still generally follows along with general principles and reactions in the textbook. Though some of his tests are conceptual, it's really important to know all the reactions, so again be prepared to study a lot on your own. Problem sets are optional, though I would recommend doing them at some point as they give good practical practice in addition to conceptual things in the lecture.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "I would only take this if you have to or are very interested in Organic Chemistry. It is an intense course load and if you want to get everything out of it you need to be able to really focus on this class.",
    "NO. Take the class in the Spring!",
    "Chemistry 227 is the natural successor to the previous semester of organic chemistry. I enjoyed the course, but truth be told, I also had to take the course, and I'm sure that many other students (pre-med and biology requirements\/recommendations) will similarly have to take the course.",
    "Orgo 2. Only take it if you have to.",
    "If Saunders is teaching CHEM 227, DO NOT TAKE IT. Just take it next semester. You will be much better off that way. Trust me.",
    "I'm not going to bother reviewing the material itself - it's orgo, it's not the end of the world but don't take it if you're not pre-med or a chem major. However, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SAUNDERS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. Although Professor Saunders clearly knows the material, he has no desire to connect to his students or to help them more easily understand or enjoy the material in any way. He frequently goes off on tangents which are completely irrelevant and above the level of the class, and alienates students who ask questions. Almost all the students who I have talked to about the class, myself included, gave up on learning from the lectures long before the end of the semester and instead relied on the textbook to gain any sense of an understanding of the material. Professor Saunders should no longer be teaching this class.",
    "I would recommend this course, but warn them about the change of pace in the end and tell him\/her to go ahead.",
    "Don't take it with Prof. Saunders. Read the book, but lectures don't help too much.",
    "Love orgo, hate Professor Saunders.Lecture is useless, problem sets are not graded, exams are random and don't contain a single structure or diagram.",
    "Typical of an organic chemistry lab, usually recommended for only pre med students.",
    "Take this course if you want to pretty much do all the studying yourself and are willing to devote your life to it so you can get a decent grade. Otherwise, stay away from it. The teacher does not teach it and his assessments are not typical for organic chemistry courses. They're more like essays.",
    "Yes, it was a good class overall.",
    "Although organic chemistry can be an interesting subject, it lives up to its stereotype in this class. Saunders' lectures only helped with around 1\/4 of the material. The rest you had to find in the book or from a TA. Don't take the course unless you really have to. I would definitely suggest looking at the other options for second semester orgo.",
    "Chem 227 was a satisfactory second semester orgo class. Having Professor Saunders is sometimes a treat, as he has been at Yale and in the field of organic chemistry since before many of our parents were born. He is open to student interaction for the most part and can be quite funny when he feels like it. You cover a lot insecond semester orgo, but it's comparable to any of the other second semester orgo sequences in terms of volume, and it really just depends on the teacher.",
    "Orgo II with Saunders is a frustrating experience. On the one hand I like organic chemistry, particularly the synthesis problems (which are very satisfying to figure out), but this was not the focus of the course at all. Instead Saunders lectures (many times over) on the few aspects of organic chemistry he has strong opinions about (NMR), and skims over the other sections. Its impossible to tell when lectures are going to be worthwhile, but test questions are in general drawn from the lectures. Speaking of tests, they are hard to study for, as he won't tell you what is going to be on them, but in general the problem sets are a decent guide. If you can avoid Saunders, I would avoid him.",
    "If you are premed then you have to take it!",
    "You are taking Chemistry 227 because you have to complete second semester orgo. I would hold off for a semester if Professor Saunders is teaching. I took the course because I wanted to get orgo over with, and a lot of people felt the same way I did. It probably would have been a better idea to wait and take it with a better professor.",
    "I would wait on taking orgo, if you have to take it with Saunders. His exam questions were arbitrary and difficult, definitely not what he 'taught' at all."
