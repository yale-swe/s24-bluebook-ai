   "comments": [
    "I would say this course makes sense for someone who is interested in getting a taste of relationship science and getting Professor Clark's perspective on the topic. She really shares a lot with the students so it is a good way for people who don't know her to benefit from all her experience. Plus, my love of the research covered makes me want everyone to take the course! It is also a very pleasant course to attend, though I would caution that it isn't as demanding as I expected for a graduate course.",
    "I would recommend Psych 557 to anyone who is curious about close relationships theories and the dynamics of the field of close relationships. It gave a fairly comprehensive overview of a fairly large field in a way that was manageable and entertaining. Class discussions ensured student engagement with each subject and the work load was very manageable.",
    "This was a fairly interesting, intro-style psych class. You would learn a good amount of relationship\/attachment styles and some interpersonal processess that occur in people. The material wanes a bit toward the middle of the course, but there is usually a good amount of discussion. DISCLAIMER: if you are an undergrad looking to take this class, the workload is totally manageable, but the grad students in the class were not particularly friendly to the undergrads; they were very condescending and clicky, and were quite unpleasant throughout the semester. This may have just been a one time fluke, but it's definitely something to keep in mind.",
    "Highly, highly recommend. Professor Clark is an excellent and fun teacher and the material is extremely interesting."

   "comments": [
    "This course did not directly assist me with my research, however, it did deepen my knowledge of the field of psychology as a whole. As my first \"relationships\" course, this class filled in some of the gaps in my working knowledge of psychology and helped to make me a more complete scholar which is invaluable in and of itself.",
    "I did not do a dissertation, but it definitely reinforced some knowledge about social psychology, and taught me some new things about close relationships and how they function."
