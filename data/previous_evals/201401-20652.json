    "This is a truly amazing course. It is a lot of work, but the investment pays off completely and then some. It is a chance to learn from one of the greatest living theatre composers, who also happens to be a brilliant and thoughtful teacher. An absolute must-take.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. Its one of the best courses I've taken here.",
    "Life-changing, career-defining. Jeanine Tesori is a genius, and her classes are revelatory. One warning: don't take this class on a whim. Jeanine essentially treats this as a pre-professional class, and expects a high level of preparation and engagement. Also be aware that there is an audition\/interview for this class at the end of the Fall semester -- email Dan Egan early if you're interested, or you might miss out.",
    "Take this class. TAKE THIS CLASS. This was the best class I took at Yale. Jeanine is exceptional in every way.",
    "Just do it. Clear room in your schedule to Really do it; you'll be disappointed in yourself if you're turning in material you don't like, but you'll learn so so much if you really do it."
