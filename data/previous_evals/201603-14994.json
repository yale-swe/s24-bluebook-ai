    "I now have a notion of the overlap between harmonic analysis and homological algebra. Cohomology has interesting applications to mathematical physics which I can now appreciate.",
    "This is a very good introduction to the ideas of differential geometry, Lie theory, and cohomology in the context of studying various topological spaces and the algebraic structures we can associate to them.",
    "I learned how to synthesize old material that I knew, like differential forms, algebras, modules, and SO(3), with new material, like representation theory, cohomologies, harmonic functions, and so on to understand a new theory. It allowed me to learn how mathematicians think.",
    "This course introduced me to combining the materials of different subjects in to allow for a better overall picture of math."

    "This course introduced a lot of interesting material that isn't taught in the math curriculum otherwise. The lectures were very good and professor Zuckerman conveys the material well. The course seemed to ramble onwards at points, but on a whole, it was quite good."

    "I would definitely recommend this course, if it is ever offered again, to any aspiring mathematical physicist. Math students interested in algebraic\/differential geometry, or topology, would definitely benefit from taking this course. Its a great expansion of the ideas set out in 231, and prepares you for the various topology and representation theory graduate courses that the department offers.",
    "Karn i mis you so much",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Zuckerman is a good lecturer and teaches interesting material that you wouldn't encounter otherwise."
