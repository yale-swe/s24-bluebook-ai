    "This course was a good introduction to data mining principles. I feel confident that I would be able to understand applications of some of these methods in my field of study.",
    "I don't think the grading is fair. We'd better know why we got poor scores on the assignments and when argue that, the instructors seem that they did not care about that at all. I think we should get more respect of their time and tuition.",
    "Homework improved my coding skills and taught me some new, cool methods. I wish lecture could do the same...",
    "The programming topics are very helpful for me as a statistics student.",
    "Good practice problem",
    "I am not required to complete a research. The course is overall very educational.",
    "The course helps me be more familiar with matrix calculation and some algorithms.",
    "Personally, i am very interested in data mining. I focused on the application aspect of data mining before. This course introduced data mining from theoretical perspective."
