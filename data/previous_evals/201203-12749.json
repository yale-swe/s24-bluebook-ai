    "if you get the opportunity, TAKE THIS COURSE. this may be the most valuable thing I've done at Yale. Professor Roach is the man you wish was your grandfather: he's kind, brilliant, and carries around years of wisdom.the course tracked famous historical addresses and the 2012 presidential debates and speeches. then students wrote and performed their own speeches: 3 one minutes, one 4 minute, one 8 minute, and a final 2 minute declamation. the class is a tremendous learning\/bonding experience.TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE THIS",
    "I don't know if this class will be offered again because it was centered around the 2012 election and presidential debates. If it is, I highly recommend it. This class is about public speaking, but ironically the most important thing I learned was how to be a careful attentive observant listener. Listening is a skill that will take you far in life. The format was 3 1-minute speeches on ethos, pathos, and logos, a 4-min speech, and a 8-min speech. One key strength is you could virtually talk about anything you wanted in your speeches, and so you get to hear the issues that are most important to your classmates. Each member of the class gives verbal and written feedback for all other speeches, which is how I became such a good listener over the course of the semester. And btw, Joe Roach is an AMAZING professor. He loves teaching and it shows.",
    "This class is the best I've taken at Yale. Incredibly unique, valuable, well-taught, and fascinating. And it's not much work either!",
    "A class in which you study the elements of a great speech and perfect public speaking skills - would highly recommend for ANYONE, no matter your major.",
    "Definitely take it. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never ever regret it. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best class I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken so far at Yale. I came into it enjoying public speaking already, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a must. Everyone grew from the place they started, and it really felt like an environment in which that growth was the goal. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a manageable amount of work, but expect the speech preparation to take time. It also takes up a fair amount of mental space, because if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing you really really want to be prepared for, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giving a speech in front of your entire class. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice balance, though, because on days when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not giving a speech, you sometimes get to just listen to great speeches by your peers, which was always a wonderful and pretty restful part of me week. Professor Roach is an amazing professor\/person, and you should give yourself the chance to work with him. Take this class.",
    "It's a great class in teaching you the art of public speaking and all the complex techniques that go into it. Youwill also learn a lot about analyzing the speaking of others, both famous political figures and your classmates. It's definitely a class worth taking if this interests you and this semester it was a great seminar environment to be a part of as well!",
    "This is a fantastic course that really helped me refine the way I think about my public speaking. The class readings and discussions aid in the creation of a strong theoretical framework about the nature and practice of eloquence that each student can then adapt to their own style, preferences, and abilities. There is also extensive practice; you will give no less than six speeches, and all of them will be fairly extensively critiqued by your peers and the professor. Incidentally, Joe Roach is amazing and has great presence. Apparently all it takes to become a Sterling professor is sheer brilliance, tremendous wit, total mastery of your chosen craft, and a tiny hint of showmanship. One of my best at Yale, and I've had some winners.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in being able to form coherent, persuasive arguments and\/or to articulate their thoughts through the use of elegant language.",
    "This is a wonderful seminar. If you're inclined to join a class called \"Eloquence,\" you're in good hands with the most eloquent man I know, Professor Joseph Roach. Take any class with him that you can--he is one of the most outstanding professors Yale has to offer. This semester was particularly exciting because of the presidential campaign: we watched and discussed the candidates' rhetorical techniques and performance in the debates. I am confident that future classes, outside of campaign season, will be equally enriching in terms of developing your abilities as an orator, but rather than watching live political speeches, you would be discussing recordings of previous political speeches. As assignments, we wrote and delivered our own speeches with increasing length and skill. I also feel that I genuinely got to know my classmates through their chosen speech topics and speaking personae, and the overall vibe of the seminar was warm and welcoming. But be warned: preparing an eight-minute speech is not for the faint of heart, no matter how short eight-minutes may seem.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is at once the most practical and the most expansive class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely!! A wonderful blend of theory and practice. The best class I've taken at Yale by far.",
    "Yes. If you want to be better at speech writing and delivery and get to analyze the present politicians' rhetorical method at the same time, go for it. You also come together as a class as well as you're constantly delivery speeches to each other that are open ended enough in assigned content that each person brings their life to the class in a really wonderful way. If you can get a spot, go for it.",
    "TAKE IT. A fantastic mixture of theory and practice - this course felt especially relevant in a presidential election year, but would be equally useful and possible any semester. Ample feedback from Professor Roach and fellow students throughout the semester was much appreciated, and nearly every student's writing and speaking improved substantially over the course. Great that class members came from a variety of backgrounds - actors, debaters, activists, writers, etc...Also, Professor Roach is a champion: such an amazing mentor and wise teacher. By far, one of the most credible professors in Theater Studies, and an overall great guy with so much knowledge of both performance and politics.",
    "This class is terrific for someone in Theater\/English or someone who knows Prof. Roach well, but if not, find a similar course in another department. Unfortunately, someone has to be the low end of the bell curve.",
    "I have so many fond memories of Rhetoric! It has been a long time since I \"developed\" through a course. I grew tremendously as a speaker and a thinker. The class was very timely with this year's election, but I know the rhetorical skills we learned will always be of use. PLEASE take this class.",
    "A class in speech writing and speech making, simultaneously developing our own skills as orators while exploring the speeches of American politicians past and present. I would recommend it, I think it's a unique, important, and fun class. If you put the time into the speeches it's easy to do well. I think it was very interesting to do it with the election this year, but if offered again it may actually be more clear and less frantic in a non-election year."
