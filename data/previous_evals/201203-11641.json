    "This class is a lot of work. You have 4 quizzes and a 150 character essay, as well as a mandatory tutor session with a TA, each week. The quizzes are easy however, and the tests are relatively difficult. The quizzes make sure you do work. In class, the teacher puts the text of the chapter on a projector screen, except there are many characters missing. You are expected to hear the text spoken out loud and then are expected to be able to repeat it back when the teacher calls on you. This is difficult and it takes a lot of concentration. Each class is 50 minutes long, but you must focus the entire time. Class generally goes by quickly.",
    "I was originally placed into L5 but decided to start with L3 since L4 (which I assume is the appropriate level for me) wasn't offered. Contrary to the opinion I had held prior to the course, it was quite helpful. I went over the basic grammar, structure, and vocabularies I had forgotten and the weekly tutorials were helpful as well. Instructor comments on the homework assignments were also very assisting.",
    "I would take this course again. You have to if you're going to go up through L3 in Chinese, but it's also a class where you'll learn a lot. It's fairly fast paced but doable.",
    "Chinese is an extremely strong department! All the teachers for 130 are friendly and engaging and helpful, and make being in class really fun. I found that I didn't have to put nearly as much time into studying and homework as I expected, because I picked up so much just by being in class. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone! Take Chinese for sure!",
    "Yes, I recommend this course.",
    "This class is appropriate for those who have casually learned Chinese for about 2-3 years. Although the coursework seems very demanding and overwhelming at first, it is actually very doable once you get used to it. I would recommend this course. It really helps improve my Chinese in a very effectvie way.",
    "Good step forward from L2, but is significantly harder.",
    "Great class, great teachers. Take it."
