   "comments": [
    "The readings were really interesting and the workload was not terrible, but we basically just spent classtime presenting the readings to each other. Days where we ended up having discussions were more fun, and presentations on final papers were also interesting.",
    "Take it. Very interesting course.",
    "Interesting course, but at times repetitive especially because of the class presentations. The nature of the material makes it worth taking though!",
    "Fantastic course for anyone truly interested in the complexities of psychology and curious about human ignorance. Professor Keil is an awesome professor, and the class is the most relaxing one I've had this past year. Be ready to keep up with some heavy reading and for a hefty final paper, but (like many courses at Yale), it's worth it if you're willing to put in the effort.",
    "If you are willing to do the work, and it isn't ridiculous, but it is substantial, then do it. If you can't find 3-4 hours minimum to put into weekly reading responses, then this may be more burdensome than beneficial.",
    "Definitely. Decent amount of coursework and good discussion.",
    "Absolutely. Frank Keil is awesome. You get to learn about all these little mistakes you and everyone else makes when approaching new information. Fun and informative. Class consists of reading weekly papers, answering a reading response, and individual presentations of these papers to spark discussions led by Frank. The final paper is a research proposal, so note what you find interesting in class and expand off of that for the paper."
