    "This class will challenge you and requires a large time commitment to do the problem sets (recommend working in groups). However, this is the best opportunity to learn this information at FES, and probably Yale, so it is highly recommended.",
    "While they were time intensive, the problem sets were really helpful in understanding and learning the class material. I would actually say they were the most valuable aspect of the class. However, I should also mention that the problem set instructions could have been written to be clearer. At times, due to grammatical errors, I found myself completely dependent on the TAs to clarify what was expected of us for the assignments.The readings were really comprehensive and served as great resources.",
    "This course provides me a lot of information and I really like the way the instructor analyzing the data.However, sometimes it is very hard for me to follow the instructor because of my English.",
    "Overall, this was a great course. I came from an energy background and this class helped clear up many concepts for me and is a great foundational tool for a (continued) career in the energy industry. Even though I had been speaking the vocabulary for several years, this class taught me the true meaning of the vocabulary that I knew, and helped expound my knowledge of the varying, complex energy fields and arenas throughout the world. A great course, overall. It is demanding, but the professor warns students on Day #1 that the course load is not light, not easy, and will be frustrating. It's worth sweating it out, in the end.",
    "Professor Grubler often goes into hours of lecture with little attention to the energy or responsiveness of the students -- he often simply lectures without engaging students.",
    "This class is helpful for anyone interested in energy. There is a lot of work, but most students know that going into the class.",
    "It was a great course. I highly recommend it.",
    "The homework assignments are a bit difficult and time-consuming but very useful. Supplemental readings were a bit less useful unless they related to a strong personal interest outside of the class. Trips to the power plant, the energy tour of Kroon Hall, and the debates were interesting and educational but not essential to doing well in the class.",
    "Arnulf is a great lecturer and knows his stuff, though sometimes it was overloaded with information and you didnt come away from the class after taking home a few key things.The course work was a little excessive and could have been less quant' heavy.Overall though the best course I took this semester.",
    "The material taught in class did not in any way prepare us for the homework assignments. The problem sets were time consuming and the bulk of the effort spent on them was mining data, not actually understanding concepts. The lectures were more like paternalistic\/patronizing rants about the state of energy in the United States rather than actual explanations of processes. I often left with no solid take-a-ways."

   "comments": [
    "The exams were a test of how well we could find answers in a book rather than an opportunity to demonstrate critical thinking based on themes presented in the course. Similarly with problem sets, the bulk of the time spent working on them involved looking through large documents to find numbers rather than in conceptualizing the problems. Additionally, my background is in science\/engineering and spending time doing unit conversions is, frankly, a poor use of time and would be better covered in an introductory chemistry course. I think splitting the difference in material for science and non-science students resulted in tedium for science students and ill-preparedness for non-science students.",
    "Providing more direction as to where to find some data for the problem sets. Occasionally some links or hints were provided, but the data mining, while an important part of research, adds a great deal of time to an already very time intensive homework assignment.",
    "The explanations of the homework; both in order to prepare to answer them and then also to understand what it is the homework is asking you to do (the questions were often unclear).",
    "Arnulf needs to tighten up the lectures. His rants are interesting, but we had to come in for 5 extra hours of class because he was so far behind.He can still do some ranting but keep track of time.",
    "The lecture slides are clear but Arnulf tends to go off in tangents that are not only confusing, but takes away from the class.",
    "Some of the problem sets could have less of a data-research component and more focus on the analysis and math. Also, the lectures were sometimes fairly dis-connected from the problem sets. More lecture time could have been spent on how we were supposed to do the calculations and answer problems like those given in the problem set.",
    "The problems sets for this course are RIDICULOUS. Obscene! Preposterous! Lilliputian math problems! What in the world is the point? We all know how to spend countless hours slogging through spreadsheets and data-mining--do we really need to do it 6 times? Why not short papers on the concepts presented, or at least problem sets with a more conceptual bent. I just think it's a shame because the concepts are so fascinating and worthwhile, but in terms of homework we spend 1% of our time thinking about the concepts and 99% of our time dredging up all the statistics that prove them.",
    "The problem sets can require upwards of 20+ hours and not all of the material or concepts are covered in class. The biggest problem with the problem sets is the delay time between when the material is covered in class and when the problem sets are assigned. Sometimes there is a lag or delay of a few weeks, which makes the relevancy of the problem sets compromised sometimes (but not always).",
    "The concepts asked in assignments should be discussed later in detail in the class as well.",
    "Problem sets could require an excess of 20 hours to complete, with much of that time often searching online for very specific data. This required far too much time finding one point of data rather than working through course concepts.",
    "The form that the course is graded is not according to a professional-master course. The exam does not allow to apply any knowledge because is more memorize test instead of test \/paper of a master program . The tests of this course decrease the depth that may reach.Also, once, we had 11 hours of lectures during one week because there was a incoordination of some professional lectures. It is not positive for students to have these amount of lectures during one week. The next semester professor should plan better the numbers and times of lerctures.",
    "The problem sets could be improved by making the directions clearer and providing more guidance on where to find some of the information needed for the problem sets. Sometimes, these problem sets would take so long because our groups would spend a lot of time looking for the right metric online since there was no recommended organization\/source provided.",
    "The homework while helpful in some cases seemed unnecessarily time consuming. Having to spend hours looking up information just to make a simple calculation didn't seem like the best use of homework.",
    "The organization of the class according to the material was not clear from the beginning. Students had a hard time getting the pace of the class.Another point is that the problem sets are very long, taking over 15hours do one, not because of conceptual issues but because of the difficulty in understanding the questions [they are not in a clear language]as it is posed and finding a reliable data to use.",
    "The problem sets sometimes ended up being very time intense. This was mainly due to research of single statistical values, which offered no additional insight. This time could be spend on other material",
    "exams should require more critical thinking and less memorization of specific numbers.",
    "needs to be more interactive. like we're being talked at the whole time. problem sets take WAY too much time mining for data instead of doing the analysis that is useful.",
    "The TA's weren't that helpful to email questions. They wrote vague responses and took a long time to grade the assignments -- one was even returned after the final exam.",
    "Clarity of instructions",
    "A little heavy!!",
    "Grubler insults American students (or maybe just those at Yale (and for the record, most of it was probably spot-on) and he does not seem terribly concerned with student learning. He refused to give us our midterms back so that nobody would give the midterm to next year's students. Thus, instead of changing the tests and allowing us to learn from our tests, we got nothing out of the tests.Homeworks were obscenely long at times and not terribly helpful unless I am going to do energy research for my career. I was confused by the focus on knowing where data is, rather than analytical understanding. I got the feeling Grubler was too lazy to grade papers.",
    "class notes need more explanation, especially climate change one. So many figures lack explanation.",
    "I suggest a group project or more problem sets rather than a cramming marathon, which is not conductive to long-time learning, for a midterm and a final.",
    "Lectures and problem sets should be aligned to emphasize key take-aways and concepts rather than having one be an exercises in listening to one side of the argument on the energy debate and the other an exercise in how much time\/effort a student is willing to put into data mining."

    "Took the course because energy is such a big component of sustainable urban economic development. It provided a good starting off point for learning the language\/an initial framework of the entire energy system (not just the supply side, but also demand), and some context for the global energy crisis, as well as some good resources to use for global expenditures. However, I wish the class had delved more into conceptual explanations. I would have also gotten more out of the problem sets\/completed them fully, had they not required an additional ten extra hours of data mining. While I appreciate that in the real world, part of our work will be culling data from reliable resources and knowing where\/how to research, many of us will also be in positions where we will have staff culling the data or have been given a mound of data to sort through. The problem sets would be more useful if we had more time to spend on the analysis of data versus just the gathering of data."
