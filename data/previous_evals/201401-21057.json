    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. A must if you're an Anglophile - with sweeping implications far beyond Britain for religion, economics, and politics. Wrightson designed this experimental course based on decades of in-depth knowledge of British social history, and the results are simply fascinating. He is a treasure-trove of knowledge, and he's more than willing to share and provide ideas for new research to boot. If he teaches it again, definitely take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. As with any History seminar there is a lot to read. The written assignments include a five page paper, a fifteen minute presentation to the class, and a final ten page paper. I enjoyed doing all of them and learned a lot from this course.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the topic (which you should be)! Professor Wrightson is an amazing, thoughtful professor, and he is really passionate about the material. Also, the YCBA classroom was awesome. We learned all about famous works of art that we could then go upstairs and see in person -- really makes you appreciate Yale's resources.",
    "The course was, in Wrighston's own words, experimental. It took an unusual angle for a history seminar \u2014 examining the concepts of time in place in a variety of different contexts \u2014 but one that I thought was great. The reading was fairly light, especially for a history seminar, and there was a big emphasis on visual resources as well. I really enjoyed this class, but I can image it isn't for everyone."
