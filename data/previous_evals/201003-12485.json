    "No need to. Take it if you need it. Don't take it otherwise. There is nothing to be considered. Doesn't really matter whether you take it concurrently with the class or later I wouldn't say. Don't take it with an otherwise packed schedule.",
    "Nope, but its required.",
    "Lived up to all previous reviews. Very difficult, exceedingly large amount of work (i turned in over 180 pages of typed lab reports) plus 5 quizzes (1 for each lab) and then a final. 2 of the labs made sense, the other three were a complete joke with no real understanding. There are so many nuance little formatting things that points are taken off for that trying to fix them all is futile. Don't go in with high expectations and you'll be fine.",
    "This is a challenging course, mostly due to the sheer volume of work, rather than the difficulty of the material covered. You will have to compartmentalize your time effectively so if you need to take it, avoid taking other time-consuming courses at the same time.",
    "You're taking this course because you have to, so enjoy the concepts because they will blow your mind, just START ON THE REPORTS THE MINUTE YOU GET OUT OF LAB! MAKE IT A RITUAL: 1-5 LAB, 5-6 DINNER, 6-11 REPORT! Really.",
    "Chem 330L isn't as bad as its reputation. Part of the reason may be that two of the five reports are now only partial reports, which I think might not have been the case last year. The key to success in this class is to start the lab reports early! The labs themselves are pretty boring and tedious. Still, don't let this class stop you from being a chem major. It's not that bad, and at least it's a full credit unlike most labs.",
    "Yes, this class has a terrifying workload. The days leading up to lab report due dates were the most stress-filled and sad that I have had at Yale so far. I freaked out so hardcore. My friends all felt so sorry for me. But I got through it, I turned everything in on time(ish- you have some grace days for due dates), and I learned a lot. This class is boot camp. Go into it expecting hell. You will experience hell. You'll come out stronger. Indeed, the most powerful blades are forged in the hottest of furnaces. Pchem 330L is Mount Doom.DO NOT LET THIS DETER YOU FROM MAJORING IN CHEMISTRY. Chemistry is wonderful and magical and I love it. It also goes really well with pchem lecture, so take it concurrently (but make the rest of your schedule easy!!!!)",
    "Lab reports are definitely long and tedious, and will require that you will have absorbed the material. I literally spent every single night two weeks before each set of lab reports were due working on the reports, and even then, I felt I couldn't give my best work. Word of advice: start early, and work on the reports consistently as soon as you have data. Secondly, choosing the class based on the TA isn't very effective, since TAs switch off for different experiments, since Professor Vaccaro staggers the experiment since there is limited equipments. Having said that, Gennady is one of the best TAs I have had at Yale for any class, let alone a lab. He's very patient and willing to take the time to make sure you understand the material. Also, Professor Vaccaro is an excellent professor. He's organized, and presents lectures in a very lucid style. Overall, this class isn't definitely as bad as some would make it out to be, but be prepared to work.",
    "ITS OVERRRRR!!!! Take it if you have to. Don't take it if you don't. Its as simple as that. This is the hazing class of the chem major, but it only lasts a semester. Do as much of your lab reports as you can ahead of time, because they take a deceptively long time.",
    "I can't imagine any reason why you would take this class if it isn't a requirement of your major, so my opinion doesn't really matter. The professors and TAs are good, but the material is boring and kind of redundant, and the workload is AWFUL. I wrote 148 pages worth of lab reports (that's for 5 labs), and the structure of the class is such that you don't really have time to learn in between each report (usually two reports are due on the same day), so you can't really improve. Basically you should just expect to pull a bunch of all-nighters.",
    "If you're reading this, you have to take the class, so here's what to expect: late LATE nights writing lab reports on boring experiments, Friday afternoon lecture, and incredible satisfaction upon completing the course. You absolutely cannot procrastinate. I always tried to start writing reports within the same week of starting and experiment, and because they're often not due for weeks later, I never did. Big mistake. The result? At least two consecutive all-nighters to write ONE substandard report. Several times (4, to be exact). When you're finished, though, you feel really smart and like a real scientist. Though the experiments are boring, the techniquesand concepts embodied in each one are really fundamental to chemistry and science.",
    "It's not as bad as some of the reviews make it seem, but it's still really bad. The labs are mind-numbingly boring. Pray that you have interesting lab partners and an interesting TA because you'll be chatting with them a lot while you wait for your experiments to run. Be sure to devote plenty of time to lab reports.",
    "Yeah, before I took this course I checked the evaluations and saw warnings after warnings of \"this is the worst class at Yale, never take it.\" I thought, \"I can take it. I'm only taking 4 credits this semester anyways.\" I was wrong. Very very wrong.",
    "sucks. watching water boil for four consecutive hours is great fun. you know if you have to take it.",
    "Hard.",
    "The class is one of the most rigorous, comprehensive courses taught at Yale.I would not recommend this to a student if they are not a Chemistry major. The class is not necessarily bad, but you definitely have to have special interest or purpose for taking this course as it is one of the toughest science courses at Yale, and it will take up a lot of your time. There is really very little that can be done to improve the course; it just requires a lot of commitment and work from the student so he has to be prepared.",
    "The labs in class were pretty basic, and not too complex. However the lab reports were a whole other monster. It would always take at least 2-3 times longer to work on a particular section or table than anticipated. These lab reports were by far the most time consuming work I've had to do for any class. Maybe its because I am I science major, but even though I have already completed both of my writing credits, I ended up writing more in this class than I had written in either of my WR's. To top it off, you have a lecture outside of the lab on Friday evenings. Chem majors and Chem E's prepare for a fun one. Anyone else had better run as fast asthey can in the opposite direction.",
    "CHEM 330L is a very time-consuming course that should only be taken if it is required for your major (Chemistry or Chemical Engineering ACS-certified). The work you complete during the lab session comprises about 5-10% of the work you will actually need to put in for one lab report, so be prepared to pull consecutive all-nighters or just disappear from social life for a week, even if you've finished all your experimentation easily without feeling stressed. That's how p-chem lab is different from orgo lab: during p-chem lab sessions, it seems like you have plenty of time to get everything done, and you can usually leave early even. But once you leave the lab, that's when the real work starts. Hours and hours and hours and hours in front of your computer without an end in sight...",
    "Don't take this class unless you are going to be a physical chemist, or need the class for your major. It's just not worth the pain. I could rant for pages, but i've already written too many for this class."
