    "Yes!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Avilez is a FANTASTIC professor and the readings are interesting and easy to read. It's definitely a very useful (and interdisciplinary) look at a lot of socio-political-economic issues that effect minorities.",
    "Survey of some great books that dialogue with the presence of African americans in the legal system.",
    "If you're interested in literature and law\/race, you'll love this class.",
    "Anyone interested in race, law, or American history should consider this class: the stories we tell have everything to do with the way we behave and the way we want others to behave, and the historyof stories about race is a fundamental part of the recent history of the US. Prof. Avilez is an energetic and open discussion-leader, and the reading list is very worthwhile.But anyone interested in literature should definitely take it if he\/she has the chance. I sometimes have doubts about the importance of what I study in that weird nebulous place we call the \"real world.\" Taking this course helped me negotiate some of the real connections that exist and helped me think through ways to put my interests to use, as well as making me question and challenge central American myths in all sorts of useful ways. Though discussions can get uncomfortable, it's the healthy kind.",
    "This class is a really excellent way to look at literature and law in a way you probably wouldn't have thought about it. To really get a lot from the class, I would recommend having a previous interest and knowledge of race issues and American history. I would definitely recommend this to another student, Professor Avilez is great, a very fair grader and very understanding. There is a ton of reading and it really helps if you do it which makes this somewhat of a lot of work, but it is very interesting and introduces a lot of new and interesting ideas in his juxtaposition of law and literature.",
    "Take it if you're interested. It was interesting and a reasonable amount of work.",
    "I would recommend this course -- good reading list, awesome professor. Also, because it is Professor Avilez's first time teaching, the course will likely become stronger in future years.",
    "Af-Am Studies 345 is an excellent intersection of American civil rights law and African-American literature. More than just another African-American studies class that gives a basic overview of Af-Am history, however, this class forced me and my classmates to ask crucial questions about what it means to be an American and how to interact with problems of race that remain prevalent in our society."
