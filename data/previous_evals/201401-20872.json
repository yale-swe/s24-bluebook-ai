    "Definitely take it!! The workload is manageable and Professor Stern is just really good.",
    "If you're interested in Jewish thought - yes!!! Otherwise this would be a little bit repetitive.",
    "Take it. Stern is an awesome lecturer and you learn a lot about Jewish history.",
    "Probably a hard class to keep up with if you're not Jewish or a religious studies major. It was an interesting course and taught me a lot about Jewish intellectual history, but definitely a course I'd only recommend to people with a specific interest in Jewish history and culture in the modern period.",
    "I strongly recommend this class. Prof. Stern's lectures are engaging and delivered in a semi-seminar format. I learned a ton in this class and gained a new perspective on both Jewish intellectual history and Western thought in general. I left everyday with something to think about. The workload is also pretty manageable! Definitely take this class!",
    "If you are genuinely interested in Jewish history\/philosophy this is a must take. I highly recommend the class.",
    "Learn an intro to modern Jewish thought from an enjoyable knowledgeable and VERY reasonable professor. Overview of major thinkers and waves of thought\/historical developments. Opportunities to explore more niche things that interest you in writing two papers."
