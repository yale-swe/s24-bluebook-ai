   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure if you are actually graded on anything. We had lots of fun, and there are things to be learned if you want to.",
    "Great class to take. You learn a lot, and not too much work. We didn't have a midterm; just a final essay and homework and some debates. Mercedes is great.",
    "The course was great. The subject matter is a little dense and dry at times but Profesora Carreras always keeps it interesting and fun. If you want to keep going with Spanish but aren't looking to do a ton of work, this is the class for you.",
    "manageable 1 page homework writing assignments due each class. we had 3 debates instead of a midterm, and the final paper which you can choose any topic you want for. Mercedes is the best.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes- if you can get into this class, take it. It's super easy as long as you can speak Spanish well. The professor is really chill and interesting.",
    "A good easy L5 Spanish class. Professor Carreras is very nice and friendly and the only real work is daily paragraphs that are graded generously. Be aware that the class is pretty disorganized and won't really follow the syllabus.",
    "This is such a great course! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually the chillest thing ever. You write a small homework assignment for each class and periodically prepare for in class debates. There's also a 10 page final paper which isn't terrible at all. Mercedes is wonderful, kind, energetic, and deeply caring. You learn some legal concepts and get to practice your Spanish. But mostly you get a relaxed and positive experience.",
    "chill, take it if you don't love spanish and want to get a good grade and an l5",
    "Legal Spanish is a good course if you are looking for a good course to keep up your use of Spanish. The course is also very grade-friendly.",
    "Mercdes is the best! Great teacher, great course, manageable workload. Go for it!",
    "Good introduction to Legal System",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student who seeks to maintain their Spanish skills without too heavy a workload, but with challenging material. It's a fun course where you learn very new content. Professor Carreras is very sweet and sincerely wants everyone in the class to learn and thrive.",
    "Take this class! It was interesting and fairly low work. Prof. Carreras is the nicest."
