   "comments": [
    "Great, you should take it. Not really a gut, but worth it.",
    "The class is very math intensive. You do not need to understand math to get through the course, but you will be lost in lectures if you are not comfortable with proofs.",
    "Cooperative game theory has lots of interesting applications, and many of the results are beautiful. Dubey is great at presenting these results simply, and is very accessible if you ever need help. Reasonable workload.",
    "take it but actually do the work",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend. It's a light workload 3 psets, a midterm, and a final paper but it's reasonably interesting stuff and you learn a good deal by the end of the semester. Friday morning is tough but doable.",
    "Good class - proof heavy...can be difficult if you don't know all of the math notation.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want a mathematically rigorous but low workload introduction to foundational concepts in game theory. Worth the Friday 9AM tiling (most of the time). Be ready, however, for difficult mathematics and proofs.",
    "Yup! Great and chill econ elective credit. The 925 Friday slot is a little rough, but the class is great.",
    "Incredibly boring. The fact that this was a Friday morning seminar added to the pain. It was very very easy which was the only reason I took it. Professor Dubey is very kind but is oblivious to how the class is reacting to his lectures. 75% of the class doesn't pay attention at all.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course, unless you're really interested in set theory. The course is quite math heavy, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something that I wasn't prepared for going in. If you love math, you might find this course applicable and interesting. Otherwise, probably not."
