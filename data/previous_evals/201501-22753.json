    "Each week, the course investigates a different Islamic Social Movement, situating the movement in social movement theory, historical context, and effects \/ contemporary relevance. Main questions include: what is the role of Islam? How has the movement been caused and (mis)understood by the West? What strategies and contexts facilitated the successes (and failures) of the movement?",
    "This course is an excellent survey of social movement theory as well as many Middle Eastern Islamic groups. There is a fair amount of reading involved, but it proves worth it if you are interested in understanding groups like al Qaeda, ISIS, or the Taliban.",
    "Yes if you are extremely interested in religion, social movements, or gaining a social movement theory perspective. If you are not, don't.",
    "If you're interested in the content, take the class. The readings are interesting but the seminars are hit or miss. I did not find the class difficult or too much work (but I also had lots of prior knowledge of the Middle East).",
    "This course was a bit all-over-the-place. Its a great idea applying the frameworks of social movement theory to the full gamut of modern Islamic movements. The problem was that the professor (Wyrtzen) did not do a great job of bringing continuity and connections to the material. Seminar discussions were disappointing: they often went off topic on a tangent, and the professor assumed that everyone had lots of background on all the topics beyond what he had assigned or any pre-requisites for the course (and some students did have the background for various given topics, which left others lost). I was OK with it because the readings were good and could work on lab reports during the class (engineering major with a special interest in the middle east), and I took it with a good friend so we could have better discussions about the material together."
