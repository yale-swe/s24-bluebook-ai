    "Opportunity to read and write poems every week but don't take if you're interested in really working on bettering your poetry",
    "It was a good class! The work load is definitely manageable and the seminar style is really conducive to the subject matter. I learned a lot!",
    "A surface survey of American poetry while exploring your own ability to interpret built space through your own work. I would recommend this class if you are interested poetry, built space, or writing, but not as your main career or subject matter.",
    "If you're at all interested in reading American poetry or writing poetry, definitely take this class. Even if you don't have a strong background in it, there's so much room to learn and grow in the class. The workload is really manageable and the weekly reading is all so good that it doesn't even feel like work. It's also actually really nice having the weekly writing exercises, they were a great creative outlet. All in all, fantastic class and I definitely recommend it!",
    "Poets' Landscapes is a class where you will study how American poets have constructed or used places across the U.S. in their work. You will gain a broad exposure to poetry from the mid-19th century to the 21st century, and if you enjoy studying the cultural production of place (especially U.S. cultural places), then you will find this class awesome. You may also find this class awesome if you like to read and write poetry!",
    "I would recommend it to another student, though I think the combination is bound to put a student out of his or her comfort zone at one point - not fully about architecture and not fully about poetry. Workload is manageable, with one short paper analzying a photograph, one long paper about a poet, one presentation based on that long paper, and a poem to write every week (a nice way to keep yourself writing throughout the semester!)."
