   "comments": [
    "In my opinion, the structure of the course is too formal. Presentations are often very formal, and I think students would benefit more from being able to workshop ideas and problems with their research. Because the nature of the lab meetings feel so formal, students often do not feel comfortable speaking up so the meetings tend to be driven almost exclusively by the professors.",
    "Strengths: great medium for collaborations Weaknesses: This seems silly but the classroom layout makes this feel more like a course than a collaborative space for brainstorming. A classroom in which people can sit around a table would help with this issue."

    "Yes, is very beneficial to be exposed to other students research inside and outside of the department and to receive feedback on your own research.",
    "If the student is very interested in developing collaborations with these labs, I would certainly recommend."
