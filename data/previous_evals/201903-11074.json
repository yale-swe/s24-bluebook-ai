   "comments": [
    "A new framework for approaching decision-making; designing simulations to train groups; better understanding of my intuitive reactions to (and behavior in) different situations.",
    "I learned a reliable framework for evaluating ethical dilemmas and complex issues often encountered in public leadership.",
    "I learned how to observe group behavior and learning and how to direct them towards a specific objective, which I think will be very useful for my work in the future. Also learned a lot about ethical ambiguity in public leadership and how to develop my own compass to navigate it.",
    "Through the discussions, the readings, and our participation in student-led simulations, I learned the importance of planning for the uncertainty and difficulty of making an ethical decision from a position of power. I also started to shade in some of the borders and details of what a plan might entail; a framework of things to consider: promises, constituencies, weights, etc. But more than this, I felt I began to appreciate the fact that a lot more goes into the judgement of an action's morality than just the outcome. Intention, justification, honesty... I didn't ignore these before the class, but as a fairly confident utilitarian, I definitely downplayed them. But being in the class - even just noticing how I trusted or listened to other students differently depending on my assessment of their intention, justification, and honesty - I started encouraging myself to incorporate these non-outcome-based factors into my framework. I think I will make better decisions and judgements because of that. I also learned useful, concrete skills by developing the simulation, particularly by the task forcing me to become hyper-detail-oriented while still preserving creativity. Finally, I think I got better at learning and changing my own mindset and beliefs just by sitting back, listening to and appreciating other people's stories from their life and career. It was a unique experience in a unique class.",
    "We learned a framework upon which we could rely when facing ethical dilemmas. The structure of the course was fornightly 3-hour seminars where we discussed key readings and then ran through simulations of ethical dilemmas. Aside from the frameworks and tools for ethical decision-making, I also learned a lot about myself from observing how I behaved in certain dilemmas. It forced me to reflect on my values and why I make the decisions I do.",
    "A great framework to apply in difficult decision-making situations. A deep examination of my own ethical choices."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Engaging instructor is a key strength. Thematically, my favorite parts were learning the decision-making framework which introduced a totally new perspective to decision-making for me. I also liked the practical experience of seeing how I react to various situations through the simulations to be more aware of and impact my intuitive reactions. Weaknesses include meeting only every two weeks (the break between classes can feel long). On the margins, I might consider increasing the amount ofinstructor-led discussion on substantive topics, decision-making principles, and the readings at the expense of student-led simulations (perhaps have groups of 4 designing simulations or slightly shorter simulations).",
    "Strengths: This course does a really good job at getting students to be intentional and deliberate in class discussion and with their reasoning behind their views. The course does a good job at getting students to be both introspective and outward-facing. Weaknesses: In the beginning, the professor told everyone to turn off our cell phones because we were going to discuss difficult topics and he wanted us all to explore perspectives that would not play well should they ever be leaked. But the class discussion rarely ever got to that level of intensity. I think there could be more effort made to encourage students to challenge their own beliefs. Readings were interesting but sometimes too extensive, especially since they often were not covered adequately in class.",
    "Really enjoyed the simulations and found them very helpful--whether it was to participate in them or to create them. Also enjoyed the readings. I think the discussion could be improved if the instructor somehow gets the students to pull all the readings for the week together and identify the thread that links all of them together--this can be just a short exercise, but I think it would help focus and improve the discussion.",
    "I really appreciated when Eric made the content of the course suddenly very real and immediate by forcing us to make a decision in class. Whether this was through a simulation made by Eric and Adam, or through a direct yes\/no question, when we were made to decide for ourselves (with no caveats or tricky work-arounds) it helped to ground some of the more abstract or convoluted discussions. The only weakness of the course was in the timeline of the simulation development, although I think that was mainly due to unavoidable scheduling issues because of travel rather than any structural issue with the class. Also, because the reading lists were so long it may have been useful to have an indication of which of the readings were more\/less important, so that all of the class could be sure to have done the most important readings in a lot of depth. Obviously in an ideal world we all would have done all the readings with close analysis, but that tends not to happen in university classes!",
    "The course was excellent - I really enjoyed the simulations and Eric is a great instructor. Sometimes the discussion in the class was a bit tepid - this is partly because in a seminar with 20 people, you have to let everyone speak and so it's difficult to have deep discussions to get to the bottom of debates (which would typically involve multiple back-and-forths). As a result, sometimes it felt as though we only scratched the surface of some topics before moving on. But there's not much that can be done about this, it's the reality of having a 20-person discussion."

    "Excellent instructor, interesting decision-making framework, and good practice through simulations for those interested in becoming better decision-makers.",
    "Yes, but I would be careful to say everything I am writing down in this evaluation! Further, I think it is important to take leadership classes like this one, because it is rare to get deliberate time to tackle the subject head-on.",
    "Absolutely. The subject matter, readings and class structure are all incredibly interesting and enjoyable. But more importantly, the class is an opportunity to learn from students across a variety of Yale schools, and thanks to that alone I feel like I significantly improved my own perspective on many important issues. Also, the class is worth taking just to be able to learn from Eric. He is brilliant and really passionate about teaching. You'll learn a lot just by listening to him and the way he sees and explains the world around him.",
    "Yes. It was mostly an interesting mechanism by which I explored my own ethics, morality, and values. I enjoyed the debates with and getting to know other classmates in and out of the classroom, and the simulations were fun."
