   "comments": [
    "There was an attempt to relate the studio to music and acoustics but the overarching lack of musical knowledge among the students did not allow for music to be genuinely integrated into the studio. Also, any attempts to create acoustically sound spaces were for the most part rudimentary and functionality was frequently sacrifice on the altar of expression.",
    "Rudimentary planning exercises were undertaken in the studio. However it was never intended as that. Instead it was a foray into one's own design strategies and\/or process. No other disciplines were integrated besides an art sensibility.",
    "There was a lot of coordination throughout the semester with various people including Craig Webb, Yasuhisa Toyota, Daniel Barenboim, Ara Guzemian and many others. Trattie was more organized and prepared than I ever would have imagined. Frank and Meaghan were just as good. All said, this was a very intense semester and without Trattie it wouldn't have worked out.",
    "The studio was somewhat removed from the normal constraints - landscape, structures, sustainability etc, it was really up to the students to take that on as they saw fit.",
    "The studio articulated design and related disciplines in a very serious and generous way. During the semester we had the chance to meet first-class experts in acoustics, digital fabrication, middle-east history, as well as representatives of the client (Daniel Barenboim, Mariam Said and musician from the orchestra)",
    "This studio was simply the best thing that could have ever happened to me. A classmate said it best, it was simply a gift. For once, it felt like an intelligent, engaging dialog between students and critics. There was no need for any of the usual bullshit, the exercises, the artificial constructs to talk about landscape and meaning and what not. You don\u0092t need a diagram if you can look at a model and you don\u0092t need to make up theories if you are always working with a model at the urban scale while still doing all the necessary work in terms of program, precedent analysis etc\u0085I never thought it would be possible to seamlessly encompass such a wide range ofissues and ideas and it all happened in this studio in a fun, challenging, exciting atmosphere.",
    "There was little focus on landscaping\/planning\/structures in this semester. It was a studio about the design of a building from the very first day, which was very refreshing. It was up to the students to integrate their own structure\/planning into the project, which most did very well."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "Outside experts were a great resource. We could have benefited from a few more juries and outside feedback. The studio felt extremely insulated. The bi-weekly presence of our teaching assistant, while a sign of great commitment, often became tiresome and hindered real progress.",
    "Most valuable the osmosis from Frank and Trattie in terms of assimilating architectural practice into a personal stance and passion. Hard to comment on what was least valuable... There were certain things that were needed like more structure in the crit-process for coming up with straight-forward representation.",
    "There were many valuable aspects to the studio. Our pin-ups as a class with Trattie were very helpful and I learned a lot from them. Our studio visits with other experts was also very important. Trattie is very helpful one on one as well during desk-crits and she always pushed me to do more than I thought I could, but somehow got it done. While Frank wasn't able to be around all the time he was always available if we needed him and the video conferences were very helpful as long as he had a PDF to look at. Often times I wondered in one on one phone conversations wouldn't have been jsut as helpful- although we were invited to call him anytime, I never did. Im not sure what the least valuable aspect would be. I feel learned a lot from everything we did. This was the best studio of my life and the perfect way to end my education here at Yale.",
    "Most valuable: The extensive meetings with various musicians, historians and acoustician. We were provided with extensive background, knowledge and expertise which gave us a great basis to develop the project.Least valuable: not applicable to this studio.",
    "we saw a lot of outside experts which was amazing. it really contributed to the nature and feeling of the studio. it made the project seem like it mattered beyond our own designs, which it did.",
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was the encouragement and motivation for each student to discover and develop a personal approach to design. This commitment to understand each individualis something unique in the school and the effects of this generous attitude was evident in the variety of design solutions and the amount of work by the end of the semester.",
    "Some of the unforgettable moments in this studio were of course our encounters with amazing guest critics and major intellectual figures outside of architecture, such as Daniel Barenboim or Mariam Said. But the most important thing is that Frank, Meaghan and Trattie were there to keep the conversation going throughout the semester. Just when we thought we were burning out around spring break for example, we got to meet Yasu Toyota and go to a concert at Disney Hall. But I think that more importantly than the amazing resources that were put at our disposal was the level of support and the faith our teachers had in each and every one of us. Unlike 90% of the faculty at YSOA, who are all too glad to embody their role as critics in a negative way by always finding something to criticize, these three \u0093critics\u0094 were able to pinpoint the pitfalls of our design in real, pragmatic building terms while trusting us to unleash our creativity in all other aspects.",
    "This studio was extremely full of valuable aspects, its hard to focus on what was not. I feel, perhaps, Frank and Trattie were almost TOO receptive (not a real complaint), and that some of the feedback during desk crits, etc,could have been slightly more critical \/ in-depth.",
    "This was a great studio overall, we had fantastic outside critics and experts from just about every field we were looking at. from the history of turkey with our own personal architecture historian in istanbul to Yasu toyota for the acoustics. they were all great."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of the studio as a pedagogical tool",
   "comments": [
    "The studio's emphasis on model production was both an asset and a liability. While it made for an impressive body of work at the final review, in my opinion it hindered the real development of ideas throughout the course of the semesters. Model-making, especially when it is not fast and dirty, can be a very time-consuming process. It was difficult to find the time to sketch or simply think without producing in order to make progress when models proved an inadequate tool.The studio was also confused in the definition of its goals. It was originally set up as a one-room assignment but it proceeded to incorporate a political, programmatic and urban aspect that was overly ambitious. There was little direction as to what one should be focusing on and therefore little dialogue among students about what was being produced. Finally, there were no criteria for the evaluation of a student's success in solving a given problem.",
    "Program= complicated, challenging, driver for planningSchedule= consistently pushing, short but sweetProduction= unrivaled",
    "The studio was very intense but the atmosphere in Frank's studio is overwelmingly positive and as a result made working really hard all worth it. The schedule was just as intense as the work load and we were constantly traveling. Whether it be to Turkey, Berlin, LA or NYC, we were always on the move but somehow seemed to produce an insane amount of work as well.",
    "The design brief was a gift. It was complex, challenging yet achievable, which is unfortunately quite rare in the advanced studio curriculum. The intent of the studio was clear, as was the program, schedule and mode of production.",
    "i think frank tried to bring out the best in each of us. sometimes he tried to relate an ancillary interest to architecture which didn't always work for the student. he tried togive us a window into his own design process which was great, but might not work for everyone.",
    "The exercise posed a very intelligent problem which include a challenging program in a great site. The schedule was very well studied and the evolution of the project went from understanding of the site (in terms of physical as well as cultural features), to defining of an urban solution, designing a building and developing a concert hall in detail. The level of production of the studio was very high, and it is very positive that it was the result of the individual motivation and genuine interest rather than a strict requirement from the instructors.",
    "I really don\u0092t think there was any weakness to this studio and the more we gave, the more we got back from our critics, the kind of dynamic that I never thought would be possible at YSOA. I think in fact all advanced studios should follow this studio\u0092s model and stop trying so hard to be hip, or theoretical or what not, because we have seen the crippling effect of that kind of attitude. We were thrilled to still be designing a real building with very challenging technical constraints but we were able to explore so much more. In fact, I think even 1st year and 2nd year studios should try to come closer to the spirit of this studio.",
    "The studio was had a very specific architectural agenda for a very specific client. With this framework and clarity, it became easy to focus on an architectural solution, without 'wasting time' on endless illustrator diagrams and mapping analysis that is so prevalent in other studios. It was a studio about architecture, about a building, and about its use. Going to places in Istanbul, LA, and New York that fulfill a similar purpose, to experience the built environment itself was analysis enough. Similarly, meeting its clients and representatives made the project that much more hands-on. As a pedagogical too, this is the most valuable I have ever experienced in any studio."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I expected the studio to be more focused on a resolved concert hall interior. I was certainly free to pursue that goal but I expected more feedback and certainly more pushback than I actually got.",
    "Expectations were to model and model we did.",
    "My expectations were blown out of the water. I couldn't have asked for more from the professors. I learned so much and Frank constantly had the top people in their fields come to meet with us. Frank, Trattie and Meaghan are amazing people and I will always remember them for all they taught me.",
    "All expectations were met and exceeded. I was looking for a studio in which to develop an architectural project. In this studio I was able to do so, while also, constantly experimenting, tuning and developing my approach. It was a wonderfully iterative design process and we were encourage to push our own limits design wise.",
    "my expectations were exceeded. frank was a very kind, humble and patient teacher. i enjoyed every moment with him. he was very sensitive to our thoughts and was very kind in arranging for us to meet with so many people.",
    "I expected from this a space to explore my formal vocabulary with the advise of responsible and inspiring instructors. This studio surpassed all expectations and was an incredible ending for the program.",
    "This was simply a life-changing studio and an experience I will never forget. It makes up for all the negative memories and feelings I have had of so many other studios (Mark Gage's ridiculous curriculum for our 1st semester 1st year, Keith Krumwiede's incredibly unprofessional attitude as a coordinator of our Fall 2nd year studio, the fiasco of the portfolio review that only revealed how clueless the faculty was and the kind of pathetic political games they were playing with students... the list is long). We worked hard but we had even more fun. We were overwhelmed at times by the amount of traveling we were doing (but thrilled of course) and when we thought we'd never have time to work enough on studio, we somehow kept going. This was one of the rare times where I think many of us simply wished we could simply focus all our energy and attention on studio compared to anything else.",
    "I actually expected to spend a lot less time with Frank. However, his attention to the studio and each of its students was shocking, and very very well appreciated. He got to know each student well, and spent more time with us than any studio critic I have had in the past. With this, I was able to take more from the studio than expected.",
    "My highest epectations were met. this was the best semester at yale and i believe the the best studio that YSOA has to offer."

   "comments": [
    "Frank is a lovely person and a very open-minded teacher. He was available, willing to help and encouraging of innovation and personal expression but did not push back as much as I would have hoped. Trattie was a phenomenal assistant. She was always available and extremely supportive but she also did not offer creative pushback. I understand that the philosophy of the studio is to allow students to find themselves but I happen to believe that a certain amount of tension is the best way of getting to what someone really is after.",
    "Both Frank and Trattie are very similiar. Both exude a passion for architecture and humanity. Both are skillful and concise planners. Both speak frankly and without confusion. The only weakness is again the lack of critique on the actual representation besides modeling.",
    "Frank is beyond amazing. He is extremely smart, knowledgable on the subject, and above all, passionate about art and architecture. He was always available to us and while he wasn't in New Haven often, Ialways felt like I just saw him. His presence was always in the studio and he couldn't have done anything else to help make the studio better.Trattie is great! She knows how Frank thinks and she was extremely helpful to all of us and did everything she could to help us see where we needed to take our project. She was always very positive and I enjoyed seeing her every week.I love them both!",
    "I would like to actually discuss Trattie, rather than Frank, who was with us, supported and critiqued us throughout the project. She is an exceptional teacher and crit. She is an excellent listener, she challenges the students and tries to get them to achieve their own goals for the project rather than impose her own on them. This is incredible rare in a studio environment.If I were hiring at the school, I would consider Trattie as an excellent candidate to be a critic, perhaps in a core studio. She is someone that should be around the school much more.",
    "the main strengths of Frank are all listed above. Trattie was a great teaching assistant. She was always very sensitive to our design intentions and tried to bring out those intentions in a clear manner. I think she could be a little bit more demanding.",
    "Frank Gehry: Inspiration, knowledge and generous attitude.Trattie Davies: Dedication, genuine care for each students and very valuable advise and support.",
    "Frank, Trattie and Meaghan are maybe the most humane, happiest, wonderful architects I have met at YSOA (there are of course a few other exceptions such as Turner Brooks, Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen, Alan Plattus). Being around them was a daily source of inspiration. Their humility, their talent... They are the kind of people who still make you think that architecture is an ok profession and not simply made of anrgy, frustrated old white males.",
    "Frank was great, and so was Trattie. They work well together with little effort, and without fumbling over each other's ideas -- there was never a conflict of interest. As stated above, Franks loyalty to the studio was remarkable, and his availability was more than surprising. While I feel at times that this studio could have been slightly more critical, I probably learned more than in any other studio I have taken here. Frank and Trattie both encourage a hands-on, first hand experience with the subject -- with many site visits, and meetings with clients and representatives, which was refreshing and new. And, Megan was a huge plus! Thanks to them all for a great semester.",
    "Frank and Trattie were both excellent teachers, their willingness to let individual students explore their own interests, process and methods was what made it a very personal semester for each of the students."
