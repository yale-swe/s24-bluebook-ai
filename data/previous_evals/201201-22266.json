   "comments": [
    "Philosophy is a greatly variable subject, and it largely depends on the professor that you get. Matt Smith is one of the less popular teachers. I have been told that class is much better with professors like MDR and Scott Edgar.",
    "Yes, i'd recommend it - it covers a much more interesting gradient of thought than first semester",
    "Do it; you'll learn interesting things. More philosophy, more DS.",
    "I would totally recommend Directed Studies. Even if you're not into the humanities or will be majoring in something in the math or sciences, you will learn so much from doing Directed Studies and probably enjoy it, too.",
    "Philosophy is definitely one of the more difficult subjects on the Directed Studies curriculum, and despite that I really enjoyed second semester philosophy. Take it if you really want to delve into the nature of reality instead of boring Plato and Aristotle from first semester. I've essentially concluded that no one makes a great and conclusive argument about anything, but it's a great exercise of the mind to see philosophers like Kant try to prove that we can have certain knowledge of anything. It's a very great class I would encourage other thinkers to take.",
    "It's very mathematical. If you're not a person who loves this stuff, the class might be tedious. But DON\"T LET THIS DETER YOU FROM DS. A lot of the philosophy fits in nicely with stuff you read in other sections, and once you get to the end, you'll realize you've learned a lot about major trends in Western thought. I didn't really enjoy Philosophy, but I guess I'd recommend it b\/c I recommend DS.",
    "Great overview of Western philosophy. Goes through all of the most important thinkers of the Western canon. Tough to dive into anyone too deeply, but at least it gives you a basis for taking classes about philosophers who were particularly interesting.",
    "Absolutely! I'm not the biggest fan of philosophy, but I really enjoyed this class and definitely learned a lot!",
    "Two big questions: how do we understand the world metaphysically, and what is ethical behavior? The authors are all really engaging and responding to each other, which is refreshing. Matt Smith is the man. Knows his stuff and runs a solid discussion."
