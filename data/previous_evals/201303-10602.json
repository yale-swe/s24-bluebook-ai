    "FREN 130 is an intermediate course focused on acquisition of grammar and speaking skills which meets (tediously) every day. Aside from those inherent flaws, the class isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad\u00e2\u0080\u0094the texts\/films are mostly interesting, and Mme Koizim is caring and energetic. I found that she could sometimes be a bit sarcastic for the fragile ego of a language learner, but I never doubted that she believed in us and wanted us to improve.",
    "Absolutely. Don't be scared off by the workload - you get through it and become so conversant in the language. Take it with Ruth Koizim and it will immediately become your favorite class at Yale.",
    "An amazing course!! Be warned- French 130 is a lot of work, so if you're just looking to get your language credit out of the way, consider doing something else. It takes at least an hour of your time most nights. But if you want to learn French, read some cool books, and watch some great movies, this is the place. And if you can take it with Professor Koizim ABSOLUTELY DO. Like seriously. I'm not really into language learning, but she's just the best. Besides being a fantastic teacher and incredibly nice, Professor Koizim is actually one of the most sarcastic and hilarious people I've ever met.",
    "Yes yes yes!!",
    "It's a solid mid-level French class where you will cover grammar with much more depth than you did in high school (at least, if your high school French instruction was anything like mine). It's a daily class and sometimes the workload can be very tedious (worksheets, audio exercises). I wish class involved more casual speaking opportunities. Madame Koizim is a great teacher with a biting sense of humor (which I like, but depends on how fragile your ego is).",
    "A great class, especially if you can take it with Mme Koizim! She is positively awesome, so entertaining and energetic - a bit eccentric too, but that just makes her more fun. The workload is manageable, and you get a really solid grasp on grammar\/vocab concepts and read\/watch some really interesting books and movies. Just take this course, and take it with Mme Koizim.",
    "Highly recommend this class if you need to learn french - very effective",
    "French 130 with Madame Koizim is an intense French course. The work load is rather large but manageable. She is an incredible teacher and manages to make the material entertaining and extremely accessible.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The curriculum is very structured, which had some drawbacks. I felt that I got a lot of practice listening to and reading French (especially reading!), but not as much practice speaking. I would have liked more opportunities to practice real-life interactions in French, rather than only focusing on situations derived from the texts and films.",
