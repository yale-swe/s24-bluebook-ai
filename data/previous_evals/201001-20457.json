    "It is a difficult course to summarize! I would say that it provides ample opportunity for developing one's interests in American literature if they are already formed, or for finding something that can really grab you if you are still wondering about where to go for a good research topic or area of interest."

   "comments": [
    "Some ofthe readings were really crucial to have \"under my belt\" and discussing them in class was truly helpful; other readings were perhaps more interesting but less relevant. But then again, I imagine my lists for either category would be very different from another student's list--the nature of the class allowed a great deal of individuality."
