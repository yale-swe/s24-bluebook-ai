    "The expectations were met.",
    "Did not meet expectation. I thought this class is research methods but we did not talk about methods a lot, though the scientific thought readings are fun. The discussion was not active enough, we need more dynamics. The course should be more structured.",
    "It's what I expected.",
    "No. Little time was spent discussing natural science research methods which is what I expected from the course. Many of the assigned readings were philosophical analyses on the meaning of science and the teaching of ethics which, although important, I do not believe should have comprised the bulk of the course. The classes that were most dedicated to research methods (statistical analysis, data and citation managers, etc.) were not required to attend whereas the ones that weren't directly related to methods were required.",
    "I expected more class discussion about what science is and who it is for.",
    "I was expecting to learn more about structuring research questions and different approaches to developing reserach methods. I appreciated that this class took last year's feedback and didn't include as much methods review but I think the course title is a little misleading."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Lauenroth could participate a lot sometimes and I wished that students got more time to lead and discuss.",
    "Strengths: Facilitated a learning community where everyone had very different skills and interests. Weakness: More one on one discussions would have been helpful",
    "Strength: good tie with the help for writing up the research proposal; weakness: less useful in other ways.",
    "I think we had some interesting discussions based on the readings surrounding the philosophy of science and some of the challenges scientists face in conducting equitable, ethical research. While this content was interesting, it didn't always feel connected to the core objective of writing a proposal. I think the title of the course is misleading, as I don't think we learned much at all about research methods. While I understand that teaching specific research methods to such an interdisciplinary group is probably impossible, the mismatch between the course name and content left me feeling a bit disappointed.",
    "It would be better if the continuity of this course can be improved.",
    "The structure of the course needs to be adjusted. More classes should be dedicated to skills needed to develop the research designs for our projects. Less classes should be spent discussing philosophical literature on the intricacies of science. I also would've liked if the role of the professor was to facilitate class discussions, not participate in them. Their participation creates a power imbalance that sometimes prevented me from wanting to contribute.",
    "Strengths: freedom to explore a topic of my interest Weaknesses: lack of engaging class discussion, did not feel like there were enough deadlines to hold ourselves accountable",
    "I would prefer a more thorough exploration of quantitative methods, like what we began to touch on after reading the marshes paper early on in the semester.",
    "Having time off in the middle of the semester to work on our proposals and watch lectures from PhD students was one of this courses' strengths. Assigning fewer readings and having less work for this class allowed me to dedicate more time to reviewing my independent research question. Kaggie's discussion facilitation method was also a strength. She was able to create an atmosphere in the class that complimented Bill's discussion facilitation technique. The course could be improved with the addition of more talks from PHd students and more background on their research.",
    "strength: you can actually develop a thesis proposal weakness: not enough hands on research methods"

    "Don't be afraid to speak up and share your opinion, Bill will welcome it.",

    "I would say, expect to have some interesting discussions, and depending on your previous knowledge of science ethics, maybe drive home some important messages. Approach this class as a space to work on your proposal, and anticipate meeting with your advisor to truly develop your 'research methods'.",
    "This course can help you to generate a good research proposal.",
