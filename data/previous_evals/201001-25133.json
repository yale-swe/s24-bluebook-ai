    "Why to do experiments and how to do them. Doing an experiment is a great exercise, but class itself was a little unstructured. Workload wasn't too bad, though the experiment can take a lot out of you. A great thing to know\/class to take if you're thinking of going into the social sciences - this is a growing technique, taught by a couple of the field's leaders. But I wouldn't say it was the most exciting class ever.",
    "Great class! You will learn so much about field experiments. The class will really change how you read journal papers, nearly turning you into a cynic.",
    "Experimental Methods was my favorite class this year. The studies we read are interesting and learning to criticize them has truly revolutionized the way I look at any studies I read for any class. It will actually change your view of political science and give you amazing ideas for poli sci research in the future. The professors are literally the leaders of the field, funny, and helpful. Take it!!",
    "Yes yes yes. Really interesting readings, awesome professors, and you get to do a really cool experiment at the end of the class. I recommend it highly!",
    "Great course! Gerber and Green are THE go-to guys in the field of experimental political science, and you have the chance to take a seminar in which they'll personally help you design and execute your own experiment. If you are at all interested in experimental social science and don't take this class, you're insane.",
    "The class had interesting reading material of a fairly easy amount, and the professors are both obviously top-of-the-field and willing to talk to students (office hours, email, even phone) any time. The whole thing was a bit intimidating, though, mostly because much more statistical knowledge is required than promised at first during shopping. The whole \"no-stats-needed\" was very much a lie and I only survived because I'd taken stats before and was able to teach myself more on the fly. But it's a nice exposure to the more rigorously scientific areas of political science, and a good chance to run an experiment of your own, especially if it's something you think you might be interested in pursuing. I don't regret taking the course, but I'm sure there were others I would have liked more.",
    "Executing an experiment with two of the greatest minds in the field - a pleasure. Indiviudal class sessions can get a tad tedious, but take this class to work with and learn from Prof. Green and Gerber. A great crash course in analytical methods. Make sure to take advantage of office hours - both professors want to help you, so do it.",
    "YES! If you have any interest in doing your own social science research, this class is EXCELLENT. It's truly an \"only at Yale\" course where you get to study with the BEST in the field in a close setting while you conduct your own original research. I got so much out of the class. I would recommend it to anyone interested in serious political science studies.",
    "This isn't a course so much as an opportunity to run an experiment. The class meetings are pretty goofy. The professors assign a few readings per week that they think are interesting, but they're pretty long, and there isn't much motivation to read as one student is assigned to present each reading and that student + the professors carry the discussion. Also, the professors provide very little instruction on statistics, so be prepared to visit the stat lab and\/or their office hours if you haven't taken stats in a while. The problem set and midterm are necessary hoops to jump through, though I wish that the material on them had been presented in a more lucid way. Running the experiment is sorta cool, and the professors make themselves available for students who have the time\/desire to meet with them. It's an interesting and time-consuming process, even if you think that you're running a simple experiment. It's cool to try to do something that involves real people, to jump through real hoops like the Human Subjects Committee, and then to analyze real data. The process definitely gives you some insight into social science as a field, and it's cool to say that you've run a real experiment - definite confidence boost. Guess the course is what you make of it - some students do all the readings, come up with cool experiments and spend a lot of time in office hours. I would recommend coming up with a cool (though not time-consuming) experiment, and spending a moderate time in office hours. I would not recommend doing the reading as it's just not worth it.Take the class if you want to run an experiment \/ want a different kind of class where you don't necessarily have to do the reading. Also, take it if you don't really care about wasting two hours per week in seminar, and want the opportunity to spend time talking with professors outside of class. Don't take it if you can't stand debaters."
