   "comments": [
    "This court taught us how to critically evaluate the bible and really do a close reading of the stories. Absolutely fascinating once you learn the theories behind it.",
    "The bible is a book of statecraft. It's a moving account of how a society of people struggled to find the best way to organize itself. The Bible is morality. The Bible is a pillar of Western civilization.",
    "I learned more in this course than I have in any other course at Yale. It had a little bit of everything: Topical knowledge: What happens in the Hebrew Bible (I had never read it before, and I now feel so so knowledgeable and confident discussing themes and specific stories ). Close Text Analysis: How do we distinguish biblical redactors from earlier stories, narrator's opinion from character's, etc, etc. Sociology: How did these texts affect people at the time of creation\/redaction? How were they used and adapted by later communities? Why did people need these stories? History: How do these biblical stories line up with the general culture and politics of the Ancient Near East? Pop culture: Where are these stories showing up!? (Prof Hayes throws a little bit of this in here and there, to wonderful and engaging effect!) This class had no real connection to my overall professional interests, but I think I will use the knowledge and skills gained in it in every class and field I study in the future. I also learned what an effective and dedicated professor looks like--if I go into teaching, I'd strive to emulate Prof. Hayes.",
    "I learned about the different methods and schools of thought used in modern biblical scholarship, read through most of the Old Testament, and gained insight into the way different religious traditions have interpreted the Hebrew Bible. I also learned about the historical and political events in the history of ancient Israel, and how they may have affected which works were eventually canonized.",
    "The most exciting of skills, biblical exegesis! Also how to work against the stereotypes that characterize our understanding of the Hebrew Bible.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Biblical analysis and criticism. The course deals with the different sources of Biblical writing, different forms of Biblical criticism, the historical context of the writing of the different books and purposes they served in the communities in which they were written, and in later communities.",
    "Obviously, the biggest gain in this class is knowledge of the piece of literature from which the rest of the western canon originates, and thats great. If you are Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, you need to take this class, and gain a proper literary understanding of what your parents, teachers, religious leaders, and communities have been preaching to you, and decide for yourself what you believe. Also gained in this class are very fascinating methods for comparing contemporary translations of ancient documents with archaeological finds, as well as methods for analyzing the origins of the biblical text where no other archaeological evidence exists.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)-- when it was composed, the manner in which it was composed, the origins of the stories, the meanings of the stories, the significances, etc. I also learned how to perform biblical exegesis, a process of examining and interpreting the Bible. It taught me a great deal about critically analyzing texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was taught in a very interesting style. There were flip class room lectures and readings and the class was a mix between a lecture and a seminar. This structure worked well in that it provided a very engaging classroom setting; however, keeping up with the reading and the lectures was often quite difficult.",
    "Exactly the right structure.",
    "Weaknesses: There was sometimes so much reading that I couldn't possibly do all or even most of it. I wish Prof. Hayes had been a little more selective about choosing the most interesting passages in certain books (esp. Samuel and Kings). That being said, she recognized when we might not have been able to do all the reading, and she did a good job in both online lectures and in-person discussions of making sure that we still understood the books if we hadn't read them. Strengths: Really everything else. Amazing professor, engaging material. Great secondary source readings. Great class format: the in-class discussions and lectures crucially and wonderfully supplemented the online lectures. Straightforward and productive assignments.",
    "The blessing and the curse of this class is the sizable amount of reading assigned per week. If one sticks with it, they will have read almost all of the Old Testament by the end of the semester. However, one can get by through just watching the lectures and doing very little, if any, of the reading (at least for the second half of the course, which has very little secondary reading). I wish I had done more of the assigned reading in the second half of the course (I relied almost exclusively on the lectures for most of the prophetic books), but I'm also not sure I could have handled the workload if I had.",
    "I got so much more out of the \"sections\" when Prof. Hayes lead them. The class wasn't actually that large (approx 18 students?) I didn't feel like we needed to be split into three different groups, which could then maximize students' time with Hayes. I understand that smaller groups is more productive, but I think that the relative benefit of smaller groups is actually less than the relative benefit of her teaching (as opposed to the TFs).",
    "Flipped classroom format works very well for the class; it allows for the communication of a great deal of information while also allowing with deep study of the material.",
    "I can't think of any major ways this course could be improved. Professor Hayes has really worked the syllabus down to a science. I left feeling like I had a real grasp of the different ways one can view the Bible.",
    "Unbelievable class, truly.",
    "Strengths: The lectures are online, which leaves more time to discuss in class-- delve further into the readings\/content. You can engage more, ask more questions, etc. It's also nice because there is no need for an out of class section! Professor Hayes is one of the best professors I've ever had-- a huge strength for the class. The TA's for this year were also great! Weaknesses: Cannot really think of any-- the class was one of my all time favorites. Perhaps an easier way to get feedback on the paper\/assessments? There is extensive planning beforehand, though, so I always felt there to be adequate support."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it! really good course to credit D if you are interested in learning about the bible. A lot of work, but really fascinating.",
    "I WISH every student at Yale could take this course. It's FANTASTIC. The Bible is a fundamental pillar of Western Civilization. I now understand so much more about religion in my society.",
    "100%. YES!! A wholehearted and resounding yes. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Hayes is a fast-moving, engaging, dedicated and incredibly brilliant professor. She is so knowledgeable about the field, and she communicates her insights in a coherent, engaging and often really fun way. It was an absolutely incredible introduction to one of the most controversial and impactful sets of texts ever produced (whether or not you agree with it or believe what it says). I had never taken a RLST class before, and this class neither counts for my major nor my distribution requirements, yet I got so, so, so much knowledge, confidence and enjoyment out of it. I personally am not particularly religious, so I was not at all offended by some of the questioning of the \"sacredness\" of these texts. However, I imagine even if I were religious, this class would still enhance and complicate my understanding of Judaism, Christianity, religion and myth-making in a really productive way. The reading is manageable (though sometimes excessive, but you really don't have to read every word to get a lot out of the class). Tests are fair--final is harder than midterm. Also, this class is FUN! I always looked forward to class. I remember in particular a class on King David that had me doubled over laughing. Job was another highlight. The lectures are all online, but don't just watch the lectures without actually enrolling in the class. The online lectures are sometimes mind-blowing, but the real joy is in the in-class lectures and discussions, and getting to hang out with such an incredible Professor.",
    "Absolutely, take this course -- Professor Hayes is brilliant, and regardless of your religious background you're unlikely to get this kind of perspective on the Old Testament unless you're planning on seriously studying modern biblical scholarship. The amount of reading often made it seem like I was drinking from a firehose, but I'm sure many people in the class got by with doing a fraction of the assigned readings. Obviously you'll get more out of the course if you do the readings, but know that its a great class either way.",
    "Absolutely this is a spectacular course. Professor Hayes is genuinely invested in the learning of her students. It's challenging, but you will learn so much! Taking this class was one of the best decisions that I made at Yale. While the material may seem niche, it's actually so relevant; it pops up everywhere. Even the parts of the Bible that you think are going to be boring, like the laws in the later books of the Pentateuch become incredibly compelling when you take them in their Ancient Near East context and consider them the way that Professor Hayes asks you to do. You need to be willing to identify and let go of assumptions that we unthinkingly hold about the Hebrew Bible. Be prepared for wit, irreverence, excitement and many many subversive readings.",
    "Yale's finest. Online lectures, use of classtime, handouts, and reading all down to a science. Professor Hayes is one of those rare professors who actually cares that her students learn the material. She will hammer all the course content into your brain and will make sure that you retain information by constantly emphasizing what is important. If you do the reading, go to class, and watch the lectures, you will look back when you are studying for the midterm and final and say to yourself \"How do I even know all of this stuff?\" Professor Hayes loves students, loves to talk about the ancient world and Judaism, and is very liberal with her time at office hours and countless review sessions for exams and papers. Her ability to teach and engage with students is unmatched. This course is a gem.",
    "I had felt that not knowing the content of the Bible was a gap in my knowledge, and this class filled it. The class was a little dry in the beginning but it is worth sticking it out. The final paper is really rewarding and Prof. Hayes is the best. BUT be warned, there was a final exam and a final paper and the reading can be heavy at times.",
    "I definitely would! I loved the class.",
    "I simply can't recommend it highly enough. This was such a highlight in my Yale career. Must must must take.",
    "Professor Hayes is a FANTASTIC professor. Her lectures are clear and interesting and she always makes herself available for questions. She also sets aside time to go over all assignments. Take this class, you won't regret it.",
    "Absolutely-- one of the best decisions I have made at Yale was to take this class. Professor Hayes is an amazing teacher. I was a bit hesitant about the format, given that the lectures are online. I wondered whether to take the class at Yale or just watch the lectures on my own at some later time. The format, however, worked incredibly well and gave us more time to talk with Professor Hayes-- who is one of my favorite professors. I anticipated every class-- and had many discussions outside of class, with family and other students in the class (which I usually see as a great indicator of the value of a class)."
