    "I would say that the material covered in this class, while very interesting, is very difficult and at times seems very overwhelming.",
    "I would summarize it as a very difficult survey of all the the basics of statistical mechanics. I would recommend it to another student with the caveat that it will be very difficult."

    "Before I took this course, I knew close to nothing about statistical mechanics. Now, I can write a Monte Carlo simulation. Even if I forget the details along the way, Professor Batista's notes are a great resource and have been promoted to the top shelf of my book case.",
    "This course demonstrated how fundamental ideas in chemistry, such as chemical equilibria and ideal gas law, were derived.",
    "I expect that it will contribute to background study of my research area."
