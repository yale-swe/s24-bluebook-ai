   "comments": [
    "A considerable amount of work, but enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course: it's an introduction not only to Plautus and Terence, but to comedy in general. And the Latin texts are fun and marvelous.",
    "An introduction to the Roman Comedy of Plautus and Terence, approached from both a literary and historical linguistic point of view.",
    "It definitely requires a willingness to go beyond ordinary Classical Latin; there's a bit of a learning curve as you adjust to unfamiliar forms and grammar. There is a great deal of reading as well, but that is normal for any classics course. For anyone with good preparation, this is a fantastic course."
