    "Yes. I had basically not read any James before (just a few things) and now I feel pretty confident about the novels I have read and anxious to go read the rest. Course definitely turns people into fans of James... even the way it is structured... starting with The American, which is a pretty easy book to read... I would not have been ready for The Golden Bowl week 1, but by the end I mostly knew what was going on!"

    "Well, just as James is a hugely influential figure for everything that comes after him, so too will he be a kind of reference point in my own reconstruction of 20th century anglophone fiction. Great to feel like I have some kind of grasp on his work. Besides that, I think the paper I wrote didn't end up being as polished or as good as I wanted it to be, but it was still my best idea for a paper I think in my two semesters here. Potentially a blueprint for future papers, chapters, etc"
