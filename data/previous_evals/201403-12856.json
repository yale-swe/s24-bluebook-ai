    "The course can seem intimidating at first, but I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. The texts are not really as bad as they seem. The class is considerable time commitment, so don't take it as a \"fifth\" or as a \"gut\" class, but don't feel that you need to be a French lit buff to take it - the course is accessible to pretty much anyone who has a minor interest in literature and who wants to improve particularly their written French."
