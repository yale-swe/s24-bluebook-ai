   "comments": [
    "If you're in a situation to take this class, its probably because it is a prerequisite for many things. Overall though, its an interesting course an covers much more material than ENAS 151. Be prepared for the course to move quickly. It can be tough but Math 120 is worth it.",
    "Math 120 is similar to a high school math class. It's not too hard if you keep up with the material, but also not the most interesting class.",
    "Great material learned at a fast pace, but very abstract. People in the sciences would be better off with ENAS 151 I think.",
    "I would tell them that this is a very difficult class but rewarding.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who likes math, is interested in math, possibly wants to major in something that requires math 120. It is very interesting class, but not for the faint of heart.",
    "A hard course that's required of many majors, unfortunately. Curve is difficult because much of the class has already taken multi, but if you take it during the spring it's a bit easier (less people who've taken multi). Do your best to stay on top of course material, because it starts to get really difficult really quickly in the second half of the course. You might do well on the first midterm, but usually many people drop out after it and the material gets harder, so don't get too cocky with grades - curve's a lot harder with the second midterm. Also, your experience highly depends on who you get as a prof. I heard Miki's amazing. It's a shame Miriam is leaving because she was fantastic (good at explaining things, very kind, very accessible via office hours) and her class was much easier to get into. I've also heard that Lake and Stefan are decent.",
    "A fair amount of work but what you'd expect from an MV calc course. Your experience will probably depend a bit on your professor, though if you get a good one it can be a really rewarding class (like it was for me).",
    "I would recommend MATH 120 to students who want to learn multivariable calculus having taken BC before. Although there are students who haven taken multivariable calculus in high school already and take this course, I am not one of them, and I think this is a good course after taking BC Calculus in high school. Just be prepared to familiarize yourself with the basic derivative rules and integration techniques you might have forgotten over the summer, because this class is calculation-intensive!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Especially with Dr. Logan!!",
    "MATH 120 is a challenging class, and not always the most fun or exciting one, but it is well-taught (at least by Miriam Logan, who is just incredible) and very sound; expect to learn a lot and to be challenged, but I always felt that I knew what to expect from homework and assessments. It's a very numerically-focused class (rather than conceptual), and you are always expected to come up with an exact final answer, so it's easy to lose a lot of points on little details. But I would still overall recommend it.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this class even to engineering students because it allows you to be able to think in three dimensional spaces and solve such problems. I would also like to be able to visualize real life problems that are associated with our conceptual problems.",
    "The material is pretty intense but once you understand how it can be applied to the real world it is extremely interesting! The problem sets can sometimes be a lot but all the professors and TAs hold office hours, and there are many review sessions before exams. The professors were great, though. It is a rigorous course but if you are a STEM person, you may have to take it! The material is really interesting, though! There are a lot of resources to help with studying as well. I would recommend this course!"
