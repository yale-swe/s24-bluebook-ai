    "This course was an elective requirement for Urbanism\/Landscape so I was able to take it anytime during the course of my program. I would recommend, however, that the course is located later in the curriculum since it is a very self motivated class with a project that needs a strong outside influence. This is better achieved after first year when there is absolutely no time for exterior thought."

    "The course was very well organized, especially for a course that allows the students to choose their own path of research. Beginning with examples of work, similar in breadth to what we were undertaking then venturing into techniques of representation etc and finally working with Professor Hayden and other students to formulate our own work. Very thorough and concise, especially the early paper deadline, perfect!",
    "great",
    "I think the most helpful class involved looking at classmates' titles, first sentences, and first paragraphs. The one thing I was confused about in the course was presenting our research paper orally - were we supposed to read from our notes or present \"off-book\"? Overall, this course focused a lot on researching and writing, but it would have been helpful to learn how to present a paper, as well. Also, because each member of the class was writing about a different research topic, the readings and discussions from week to week were quite varried and non-sequential. I think the course could benefit from a little more structure.Having the draft of our paper be due after spring break was excellent - I could devote several days of my break to writing the paper and did not feel rushed. The deadline of the final paper was also very well placed because it did not conflict with studio deadlines."

    "yes. and prof Hayden was incredibly supportive and thoughtful. A true teacher and mentor. Really appreciate her expertise and investment in teaching.",
    "I produced a great paper and Professor Hayden was extremely helpful in guiding me towards a thesis, even though she was unfamiliar with my specific topic."

    "This course was ideal for continuing my research that ran concurrently with my studio project. Although in the end neither directly benefited from the other to the degree that I had hoped that fact that I was able to investigate themes from my studio project in a different context was incredibly helpful.",
    "Of great personal value. A good course for those already involved in independent research.",
    "This course was extremely valuable to me in my pursuit of a career in academia."

    "Prof Hayden is amazing -- in part because she is so supportive of her students and treats them like adults. It was such a pleasure to take this class, and Prof Hayden is a welcome change of pace from know-nothing 22 year old hipsters who seem to be hired all too frequently."
