    "One of the major strengths of this lab meeting is how interactive and student-driven it is. The informal nature of the lab meeting creates an environment that encourages the workshopping and brain-storming of ideas and problem-solving as a cohesive group. The lab meeting offers constructive criticism in a very supportive way.",
    "I really love lab. I have a possible controversial suggestion, however: I think it would be great if we could explicitly encourage students to *not* do other work on their computers during lab. I often see people sending emails, working on personal projects, etc. I understand that from time to time people may need to urgently get things done, but some people seem to do this every week, and I think it detracts from an environment of engagement that I otherwise love. If everyone were to work during lab, of course, it would be completely useless."
