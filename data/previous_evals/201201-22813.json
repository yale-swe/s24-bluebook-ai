   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend English 120 to another student because it provided me with writing skills I will likely use forever. Professor McCabe is an especially great instructor.",
    "If you want to improve your writing skills, this is a great course to take. Even if you're not a \"writing\" person, you will still learn a lot from this course. That being said, you will have an essay\/draft due each week, which becomes very stressful. Professor McCabe places a huge focus on the reporting aspect of the course, which became very time-consuming because we were forced to do a lot of extra work outside of class. Although I think we all benefited from this, I was forced to spend much more time on this class than I had planned to.",
    "Brilliant. Take English 120. Seriously, just do it. And if you have the chance to take anything at all with McCabe as your prof, do that too. This class was a big challenge for me, but the kind that boosts your confidence in the end. And the professor -- smart, funny, practical, and extremely helpful -- was a huge part of that. Best thing I ever did for my writing.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 120 to a fellow student. The class itself is wonderfully structured. However, the professor really determines your ENGL 120 experience. I have friends who took the same course with a different professor and had a TOTALLY different feeling coming out of the class. This class is really great at teaching you how to deconstruct a piece of non-fiction, and it will definitely improve your own non-fiction writing.",
    "English 120 is a very hard course that I did not find rewarding. I would not recommend taking the class with Allyson McCabe. However, I have heard great things about the course from students who took it other professors.",
    "English 120 in general is a fantastic class. Yep, the hype is true. It does vary a lot between different teachers, and if you have Professor McCabe you might find yourself having different schedules or experiences than other people in ENGL 120, but this is a good thing. Professor McCabe is a tough grader, but you know you really earned every grade you get and she's great about working with you individually. Don't be afraid to talk to her! She emails back immediately and gives helpful yet succinct advice. Take this class, and take it with Professor McCabe, the only teacher who has successfully kept me awake and (happily!) attending every session of a 9 am class.",
    "Yes definitely. Like everyone else says, this is the quintessential writing course to take at Yale before you graduate. Don't opt out to English 114 or 115 instead.",
    "Write as essay or a draft in a New Yorker style every week, have it evaluated. Great class, just make sure you have time for all the daily work.",
    "I'm sure this class could be great, and I loved the readings. I just didn't find it worth it with Allyson McCabe."
