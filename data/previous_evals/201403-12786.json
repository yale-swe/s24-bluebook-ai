    "It's a pretty great class. You get to read lots of good books. Most are available by borrow direct, so get on that so you don't have to buy too many! Professor Ramachandran is fantastic, so if you get into her section, the discussions are really great.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. It's basically reading good books and talking about them in a way that challenges not only the way you think about literature, but also the way you think about life.",
    "This is not a theory-heavy; this is my bias, but to me thats to its (slight) detriment. However, you will read some GREAT books, with (somewhat) wacky (somewhat) and unconventional narrative methods. Just to say, dont be thrown off by the name, this is a pretty straightforward literature class: you read books and talk about them, with some extra attention paid to the craft of narrative construction. The syllabus is totally excellent, and surprising. That is, I didnt expect it to come together as thrillingly, and intuitively as it did.",
    "This is a solid intro level class that is engaging and worth your time.",
    "Although lectures sometimes felt slow, I would definitely recommend this class to another student on the strength of its section discussions and the simultaneous diversity and unity of its readings."
