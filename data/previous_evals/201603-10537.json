   "comments": [
    "I learned much about specific philosophers, and enjoyed dissecting their arguments outside of class.",
    "Thinking about philosophy and writing about philosophy are new skills that I acquired during the class. I never fully understood the purpose of the philosophical and imaginative conversations we had during discussion sections until the final exam when I realized how much I know and how well I remembered all of the material.",
    "I gained a greater insight on how to tackle complicated philosophical arguments.",
    "I developed many skills by taking this course, especially in the realm of writing philosophy essays, a format I didn't even know existed before I took this course, but the most important, I would say, was the ability to understand philosophical arguments. Philosophical treatises were never the easiest thing for me to read, as I tended to start losing focus after a few sentences, but Professor Della Rocca, though the way he drew attention to certain passages and broke down common phrases, helped improve my comprehension.",
    "General survey of Western philosophy through the Middle Ages.",
    "Critical thinking skills, learning how to read dense works and analyze them, deconstructing and analyzing philosophical arguments, why philosophy and the humanities matter",
    "I saw my ability to critically reason improve markedly through this course, as well as my ability to read at a highly analytic level. I got a wonderful introduction to Philosophy and a sort of \"primer\" on how to approach philosophic works.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of and appreciation for early philpapphy, as well as a marginally better ability to write philosophy papers.",
    "This course was very conducive to vibrant class discussion the ability to insert my argument into the discussion in a way that was fruitful and fitting was a skill I developed in this course. As such, much of the learning in this class occurred by listening to my peers and sifting out their relevant points, thus pinpointing the core of another person's argument was something I became better at in this class. Also, as a DS course, this course gave me a lot of practice to sharpen my essay writing skills. Specifically, as our first essay assignment, I learned how to write a formal philosophical analysis, learning how to re-construct and \"close read\" a small section of a specific argument. Our later essays discussed the application of the specific arguments we read to broader topics (some of our options were writing on the series of causation, the role of anger in human life, why we shouldn't fear death, and original sin) which I really enjoyed writing.",
    "I learned how to distill\/talk through a philosophical argument from a text. My ability to evaluate and critique that argument is still somewhat lacking."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Discussions were too loosely based on readings, and often digressed far from the topic at hand. The class was also structured such that it was hard to be sure what one had learned. It lacked the depth of exploration, and firm structure, that I would have liked to see in a course of its nature.",
    "Occasionally I feel that class discussion is stagnated and unproductive. However, in the end, I really learned a lot.",
    "The discussions were its strength, and its weakness was how fast we had to rush through things.",
    "I'm not certain how the course have been improved, to be honest. I enjoyed it greatly, and learned an incredible amount about philosophy. The strengths of the course lie in the combination of lectures covering the broad themes of the works, while the classes were spent explicating the specific arguments. The philosophic argument reconstructions that we did near the beginning of the semester were extremely helpful.",
    "MDR is an extremely knowledgeable professor who generally does a good job introducing the material. The class can sometimes be led into frustrating tangents that seem irrelevant to the actual text, and it sometimes seems as though the class is not grounded in the works themselves and is more free-flowing. However, in general the class is engaging and informative.",
    "The strength of the course was definitely the seminars and the close learning environment they built, unfortunately sometimes the seminars turned into a conversation that wasn't very monitored by the professor and this hindered our learning",
    "Strengths included a very warm, welcoming atmosphere in discussion sections as well as wonderful selections for us to read. Office hours were also extremely helpful. One possible weakness was the amount of times tangents were discussed in section, though I would not fault Professor Della Rocca for that necessarily.",
    "Much of the texts are dense and difficult to crack. Lectures in particular rarely explain the material and instead just pile additional complications onto them. The speed of study meand certain philosophers are waylaid. Studying philosophy chronologically means ideas can get jumbled and concept studies feel uncfocused.",
    "This class is strong in nearly every way, the only weakness perhaps being the sheer rate at which we clip through so many books makes it hard to really absorb\/chew on what we are reading. It would have been beneficial, I think, if we had paused every now and then to analyze the implications of what we were reading and why we were reading it. Beyond this, I really have no complaints.",
    "I really had no concept of what philosophy would be like before taking this course, and that was probably its biggest weakness. In theory, it sounds so fun to talk about whether God exists, and whether we're real, and whether we have souls. But the actual process of evaluating arguments was such a brand-new combination of logical and emotional that I never quite mastered it. I wanted to talk about how weird a certain text was, or how I just didn't believe a certain argument, but I struggled to logically explain those feelings with counterexamples. And most of the time I failed to engage with the texts at a basic level because I wanted to scream \"But that's not actually how humans ever act, so why is this helpful!?\" I got so frustrated and disinterested that I ended up zoning out during the readings and during class. I felt I had nothing to contribute. If I understood one sentence during lecture it was a good day. And I was so exhausted and discouraged that I never wanted to actually seek help or talk through my issues, because I was convinced it was my own fault and I didn't try hard enough. Anyway, that was my feeling during this course, and it could have been improved by a more thorough approach to the basics of philosophy writing and thinking. We got a handout about it, but really, for most people this is an entirely new field, and a handout isn't the best way to learn. Maybe it would be helpful to offer some short practice writing in section--instead of giving a handout with the argument in bullet points, ask people to write it out as they understand it. Then practice choosing one weakness and expanding on it. Maybe that's a very high school approach, and we're trying to be better than that, and let our minds wander free, or whatever. But seriously, it would have been helpful, and I'm not saying we would have to do it the whole semester. It would give section some structure and offer a concrete takeaway. Honestly, reading week was my favorite week of philosophy, because I actually got some breathing room to synthesize and understand what we had been talking about. And what good does it do me if the only learning I do is on my own?"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it as an introductory philosophy course. If the student has already taken philosophy, or lacks sufficient interest in philosophy to spend hours trying to decipher the works of certain thinkers, I would advise against taking this class.",
    "Philosophy is fun and class is amazing when you have MDR as your professor.",
    "If they have a passion for philosophy, certainly.",
    "I would highly recommend DS to another student. I loved most of the works, and the opportunity to interact closely with professors, many of whom are experts in their fields, is not to be passed up",
    "Yes! DS is a great way to start off if you're interested in studying the humanities.",
    "If the student has a general interest in philosophy and wants to learn the basics in an intense and quick paced environment then I would recommend it,if they had a more specific interest in philosophy then I would not as the material was covered very briefly and quickly as opposed to a more in depth analysis.",
    "Yes!! Wholeheartedly. This was an excellent introduction to philosophy.",
    "Yes. It is difficult but worth it for the learning you do gain.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, however, as this is a Directed Studies course, it can only be taken along with the rest of the program, in which students have a very limited ability to pick their professors. I cannot recommend a student enroll in the program solely for one class, or even for two of the three classes even as a Humanities\/Classics enthusiast, the program can be quite grueling at times simply due to the mountain of work that seems to be always looming over you. You really have to enjoy what you're doing in order to make it through this program happily. I think it is absolutely worth all the extra time and effort, but you will certainly need to pour extra time and effort into DS if you want to do well in the program. The benefits are many: I have seen my writing improve so much since the beginning of the semester, and I feel much more comfortable sitting around a seminar table, but I think the largest benefit is undoubtedly the immense wealth of primary references one gains by working through the hefty DS syllabus. What I mean is that all of the texts we read are so foundational to any field of study in the humanities this is not because some elitist system decided it be this way, but simply because the texts we read are so masterful and filled with extremely powerful ideas. Don't let the \"dead white guys\" argument steer you away from DS if you're seriously considering being a part of it the program isn't about who wrote these texts, it's about the ideas inside which have shaped how societies function, how we view order in the universe, and ultimately how humanity views itself.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Only if they have a clear idea of what they'll be getting into. And definitely take the time to ask questions outside of class."
