    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone, but only if they had a strong interest and background in linguistics.",
    "Grammatical Diversity is a great class if you're interested in taking syntactic theory and applying it to the way people actually speak. You will engage with very new research, and have a chance to make original contributions to the field as well!",
    "'Twas an excellent course! It was great practice in learning how to read and assess syntax papers, often one of the most inaccessible forms of academic writing, and how to form and critique a linguistic analysis of a phenomenon. It was also fun because the phenomena discussed were interesting on many levels--from the standpoint of a syntactician, they're interesting because of the insights they provide into the mechanisms of syntax, while to a layperson they're interesting because everyone likes to hear why they're manner of speaking is interesting and unique. I recommend this course highly, though it should also be mentioned that, given the new prereq of Syntax I, the syntactic discussion can get pretty in-depth, so this course may not be for those who are not passionate about theoretical syntax."
