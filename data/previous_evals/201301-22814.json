   "comments": [
    "You study the metaphysical questions of what it means to be the same human over time, and how does one sustain their identity -- in the metaphysical sense -- due to this constant changing.",
    "Fantastic course. Great blend of ethics and metaphysics. Historical and contemporary readings but all engaged with seriously as philosophy (i.e. not just reading the historical articles out of historical interest). Lots of reading, but really great stuff, and should be kept up with. Discussions in seminar are often lively and this can be counted on if Winkler is your professor.",
    "Definitely take this. Probably one of the most interesting opportunities for a course in M&E, and with a terrific instructor.",
    "I enjoyed this course. It is heavy analytic philosophy, but Winkler manages to pick out readings that remain analytic but still offer something to those who are seeking just a little bit more than just rational reflection (Johnston, Shaftesbury, Narrative Identity). I struggled in this course because I generally don't do well with highly rational debates and texts that is devoid of spirituality. I like studying the ethical implications of personal identity better, and potentially even its spiritual and religious aspects. Otherwise, the course is fun. Winkler is a great leader of discussion, keeping it going and focused while ensuring everybody gets a turn. There is weekly reading responses (ungraded) and quite a bit of reading, but not unbearable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN (AND ARE A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR). Without background, I think this would be a very difficult class to follow or get anything out of. Also prior experience with Parfit would be helpful, but I didn't have any and it was okay.This is a totally fascinating topic, and one that every philosophy major should explore.",
    "Don't expect to get any answers or honest attempts to actually solve the problem posed by the seminar. Instead, be ready to point out faults of each argument you read. Bottom-up work.",
    "Really interesting course. Though it could sometimes get a little funky, I really enjoyed the reading. I also liked the heavy emphasis on classroom discussion. Definitely take it.",
    "An amazing class, Personal Identity can't be recommended highly enough. Professor Winkler is among the best professors at Yale. This syllabus is very interesting, and provides a philosophy course you can talk to your friends about but which is also very deep. One of my favorite courses ever.",
    "This was a fantastic class, one that has the potential to change the way you see the world and the place persons (like you!) have in it. Winkler was great. It was a lot of work\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is a lot of reading and weekly response papers, but none of it felt tedious and the response papers I found really worthwhile and helpful.",
    "Take it once you have done some of the reading to make sure this class is for you.",
    "This is a seminar about personal identity taught by professor Winkler. This means that it's a good class. The workload consists of a 1-2 page reading response every week (not graded), a short paper (5-7 pages) and a long final paper (15-20 pages).Winkler is excellent at steering discussions and is a very kind and helpful professor, who's always on top of things.",
    "This course is a tour de force of the contemporary philosophical literature on the problem of personal identity and related issues of human ontology, four dimensionalism, and philosophical methodology. It is hard to feel like I came away with any definite idea of which view (psychological, biological, further fact, etc.) of personal identity I endorse, as most of our discussions were spent trying to just understand each thinker's position and methodology. That said, you do come away with an excellent idea of the range of issues involved in personal identity. The reading list is ambitious, but Prof. Winkler does a great job demystifying the more obscure parts. Overall, I would recommend it, but make sure you can put the time in to really get the most out of it."
