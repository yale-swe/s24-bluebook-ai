   "comments": [
    "You get a good historical understanding of how China and its provinces has been ruled over the past ~1,000 years. It does a really good job of tying it back to the present, which I loved.",
    "literally none. this was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely none. This was a terrible course. When no one knew the answer, rather than telling us, the professor left it up to us to \"think about it,\" when clearly nobody knew. I really don't understand why she gets paid to not teach us. PERIOD!",
    "History skills",
    "None",
    "History of China as well as how it has affected modern climate.",
    "I developed an understanding of the Qing and Ming dynasties.",
    "Comprehensive overview of economic and military history of Qing and Modern China. Decent overview of Song Dynasty.",
    "learned about history of China",
    "I learned a lot about modern issues in China and through a study of the Song and Qing dynasties specifically, was able to garner a greater understanding of the historical context of these modern issues.",
    "I learned about the historical origins of modern China and gained a better understanding of domestic affairs in China. I developed better skills at comparing the biases between sources and the political motives of different news sources.",
    "I absolutely loved this course and learned a lot about the Song Dynasty, Qing Dynasty, and modern China. Professor Hansen is extremely knowledgable about Chinese history (she literally wrote the textbook on it) and is a super engaging\/funny lecturer. The assessments were definitely fair (if you prepared for them), and there are many extra credit opportunities that take you both on and off-campus to learn more about Chinese history.",
    "I learned really great skills about how to think like a historian. though it is a survey course on china, i found the skills that professor hansen taught us, such as how to skim books to find their arguments, what to ask when reading primary sources, how to be careful about the kinds of blanket arguments you are making, very useful.",
    "I learned about China",
    "Chinese history from the current date back to early centuries BC. Also gained a newfound knowledge of how to analyze history through a cultural lens.",
    "I learned more about China's current policy by trends in their past.",
    "Learned about Chinese history in an extensive manner from how contemporary topics relate to the past, from the Qing Empire up to the Kuomintang Nationalist Party, up to the current CCP leadership.",
    "Strengthened my knowledge of modern China, took more of an interest in news headlines in China, and gained some base knowledge on the Song and Qing dynasties.",
    "I learned a lot about China, but in a very disorganized manner.",
    "Gained a new perspective on how historians can study Chinese History (New Qing History). General history paper writing skills.",
    "The course gave me a good understanding of China's history and how it ties to the present. We learnt about both cultural, military and environmental history.",
    "I learned how to consider current issues in China in the context of its past traditions. I also learned how to evaluate primary sources.",
    "I learned a lot about China during the Song and Qing dynasties and how they relate to China today. Of the three units -- family life and culture, economic growth, and territorial disputes and protests, I learned the most in the third. Definitely an eye-opener for people who are interested in China and how its origins may differ from its claims.",
    "History of China",
    "HIST 321 China from Present to Past provided a wide range of learning spanning geographic regions and historical time periods. The readings of the course are drawn from a variety of historical contexts ranging from autobiographical content of the Song Dynasty and Qing Dynasty eras to modern scholarship on Chinese history and development to current events topics pertaining to the U.S.-China relationship, among others. Professor Hansens lectures were made especially engaging by her perceptive treatment of the subjects at hand, enabled by the expertise she has acquired throughout her career of studies of Chinese history and travels to the country. The format of the course entailed class lectures, a midterm examination, an oral presentation, a paper, a timed policy memo assessment, weekly sections, and a variety of optional course activities that took place outside of the classroom. These many opportunities for exposure to primary and secondary source materials and scholarship on Chinese history made the course especially enriching. The design of the course also prompted students to engage with Chinese history in meaningful and collaborative ways, not only during course discussions and presentations but also outside of the classroom in conversations with classmates and instructors.",
    "-a lot of Chinese history, specifically the Song Dynasty (9601279 AD), Qing Dynasty (16441912), and Communist China era (1949present) -Chinese history focused on family life\/demography, economics and the environment, and political protest and territorial conflict",
    "We learned a lot about the history of China during three critical periods as they relate to the present. This course really helped me understand why China is the way it is and why\/how it interacts with its allies and competitors. Prof. Hansen also does a great job of incorporating learning about Chinese culture and geography."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Engaging lectures. Great, great job tying more recent history (post-1700s) to modern day disputes\/issues (especially the New Qing history!!!) Weaknesses: The earlier history really seemed to me irrelevant and disconnected from the later part of the course. The first paper is the prime example of this. I really did not understand why we were studying these individual stories from earlier history. Though it's very possible Prof. Hansen was making these connections and I just missed them, because she did a great job of making the connections with later history.",
    "Honestly? It had no strengths and I am BEYOND relieved I took it credit D. The one time I approached the professor for advice on the paper I was writing, she was incredibly rude and dismissed all my ideas. I felt stupid, and she made it seem as though I was personally offending her by not knowing more about China. My area of study at Yale is European history- I do not study China and that is FINE. It was unprofessional of her to treat her students with such disdain. She also paid absolutely no attention during the final presentations- I could see her working on something else on her computer, and then she had the audacity to provide incredibly negative and dismissive feedback... for something she did not even watch. I hated everything about this course, she shouldn't teach it if she is going to treat her students in this way.",
    "Strengths: none Weaknesses: everything",
    "Interesting! Lots of small activities.",
    "This course is very easy but lacks any real structure.",
    "Weaknesses: The grading in this course was incredibly subjective. I often had no idea how my work was going to be assessed regardless of how much time and effort I put into my assignments. I would spend hours laboring over an assignment only to find that the final rubric did not match the guidelines for the assignment. Strengths: None. This is a terrible class.",
    "Weakness: course felt a little jumbled at times. Perhaps trying to make connections that weren't as strong as they appeared. Hansen also has a very strong anti-PRC bias -- so strong there's not a single student who didn't notice -- but that's good in an odd way because it was so blatant. Strengths: Good and helpful TAs. Hansen is pretty nice when you meet with her individually or with a group. Good class to take when you've got a lot of other life events going on.",
    "very subjective grading with minimal explanation",
    "I really enjoyed the structure and variation of the large assignments of the course (a paper, traditional midterm, presentation, and final policy memo exam). The course was interesting, but not made to be incredibly stressful. I found the modern issues that Professor Hansen chose to focus on to be particularly relevant, and I appreciate having learned about them in a formal setting and now find myself able to talk about these topics in a much more informed way in day to day conversations. I also appreciated the extra credit opportunities, especially the trips to the Bienecke. I thought that a weakness of the course was that I found it to be relatively disorganized. The nature of the class had us jumping around time periods and themes quite a bit, and I didn't feel that there was a strong continuity of what we were learning. It left me a little confused, and I had to do a lot more on my own to make certain connections.",
    "was not super well organized, a bit all over the place",
    "The material is very specific and the course does not gives very little narrative on the history of China.",
    "The course covered a wide array topics and mixed historical focuses with current events. I really liked how the course studied developments in China over the course of several centuries. It taught us to understand the present by studying about how the present came about. The presentations were disorganized and less productive than I hoped. The slides mostly contained questions that were only occasionally answered.",
    "Weaknesses - lectures are scrambled along with the information in the class. There is no clear direction of how relevant any of the material is to the exams. Not a very organized class either.",
    "Strengths: Professor Hansen, pretty chill workload, EC opportunities Weaknesses: Sections could have been more useful",
    "i think sections should be mandatory - that way there is more structure to the course.",
    "Grading super arbitrary",
    "Lecture and extra credits were very interesting and engaging.",
    "First half of the course was too focused towards individual experiences, not macro history events.",
    "Strengths - well organized, clear expectations, a lot of good opportunities to engage in aspects of Chinese history in real-life (Beinecke tours, Yale Art Gallery tours for extra-credits) Weaknesses - less clear picture of how the different components of the classes fit into one congruent piece of where China is heading in its future (perhaps an understanding of the present and the past, with some predictive insights into the future will bridge this gap that I feel is still not apparent)",
    "Organization of course material and assignments is poorly structured.",
    "Strengths: Good stories from Professor Hansen about her time in China interacting with taxi drivers, etc; thematic units (economy, family life, and environment\/protest) all tied in very well with current headlines\/stories about China and Professor Hansen weaved the news into each lecture. I liked how the course was grounded on the idea of learning about modern China based on older history and how Hansen emphasized how much the current-day CCP care about using history to justify their actions; low workload allowed for flexible schedule -- wish I could have done more of the readings, but they weren't crucial to succeeding in the course. Weaknesses: Scattered curriculum -- the course was broken up into three thematic units and we went through first the Song Dynasty, then the Qing, then 1949-present for each, which seemed to jumble all the information. I felt the course lacked a clear road map because it wasn't conducted chronologically. Wish the course was more about older times since I felt we spent a lot of time on modern Chinese history (interesting, but something that felt repetitive since I already thought I had a good sense of 1949-present history).",
    "The course definitely gives you a good overview about China, but the assignments are a bit all over the place and you often feel super lost about where you stand in the class.",
    "I enjoyed most of Prof. Hansen's lectures and found those a plus to the course. Also because there was so much freedom in paper topic this made the one paper of the course enjoyable to write.",
    "I think the course was overall interesting but lacked a bit of organization. The lectures didn't always follow clearly and we skipped around quite a bit. But it was still interesting.",
    "The lectures were interesting and engaging. Section was optional, and I feel like I could have gained more from the course if I was required to attend section.",
    "Lecture vague",
    "The organizational structure of the course gives students an immersion into Chinese history and its present-day significance that is grounded in genuine scholarship and is contextualized within the modern arena of historical and political debates surrounding Chinas past. The intellectual forthrightness of the course is one of its foremost strengths. Great emphasis is placed throughout the course on drawing information from sources of various regions of the political spectrum and on analyzing the motives and biases that influence much of the information available to modern audiences regarding China, its history, and its people. Professor Hansens excellent teaching and the numerous strengths of the course were supplemented by the contributions of the two talented teaching fellows of the course, George Remisovsky and Arina Mikhalevskaya. George and Arina directed section discussions very well and furnished many thoughtful insights during these weekly section gatherings. George gave a phenomenal in-class lecture that remains particularly memorable for its spirited delivery and depth of reasoning.",
    "Strengths - This class felt very foundational for establishing my understanding of Chinsse history. I feel a lot more confident about taking more Chinese history courses in the future. Weaknesses - I don't think I liked the way the class was structured for a few reasons, but also I don't quite know how to restructure it. First, I don't like the disjointed timeline of the class. There's a large portion of history between the Song Dynasty and Qing Dynasty that we ignored in the class. We also didn't cover the transition from the Qing Dynasty to Communist-era China. I think jumping between discrete points of time and attempting to draw connections between such disparate periods of time made me feel like we missed a lot of important linkages in the middle. Second, some part of me wishes we learned each time period separately, as in we discussed the Song Dynasty first, as in family life, economics, and political protest all at once. I know that the class wants us to draw linkages between time periods, which is why we learned about all three time periods in terms of family life, and then revisited all three time periods for economics, then political protest. However, sometimes I felt that we were forced to draw linkages that didn't feel very intuitive (especially in the first paper). I don't know if revising the structure of the course would make the linkages more apparent, but I think the problem with separated units of family life, economics, and political protests is that we cannot fully examine how, for example, economics affects family life and political protests.",
    "The biggest strength is Prof Hansen. She is very approachable, extremely knowledgable and really cares about her students. Her lectures were always engaging and I appreciated that she made lecture outlines every time. I also really liked the additional enrichment sessions that she hosted and the fact that she assessed us in several different ways."

    "Yes. This is not a gut, but it's a course where if you show up to lecture and listen, you'll do just fine on the exams and papers.",
    "hahahahahahah. no.",
    "NO NO NO NO NO NO NO DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. IT IS NOT A GUT. THIS PROFESSOR LITERALLY GIVES ME AGITA. DO NOT TAKE THIS. SHE IS SO BAD.",
    "Yes, good content and teachers.",
    "I would not. Although the course was easy to pass if another student is looking for that, Professor Hansen is so awful in lecture and unpleasant in person that I wouldn't recommend this class to my worst enemy.",
    "Yeah it's fun and informative.",
    "I would absolutely never recommend this course to another student ever. Please do not take this class.",
    "Mixed feelings. As someone who had zero prior knowledge of China, I did learn a LOT. However, lectures were sometimes disjointed, assignments were a little vague. Take this course if you need a chill history class and want to learn a decent amount about Chinese history with minimal effort -- you won't learn the entirety of Chinese history, just about the Song, Qing, and 20-21st Century",
    "no, your grade is entirely in the hands of highly subjective graders who won't explain their rationale to you",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has never studied China before. Knowing very little about China before this semester, I feel like I now have a fairly solid grasp on a handful of important and defining issues in the country and am able to engage in conversations about the country much better.",
    "No, horrible class with a horrible professor. Avoid at all costs.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who just wants a better understanding of domestic affairs in China but not to someone who is seeking a thorough exploration into specific aspects or timelines of China. This course is productive in sparking intellectual curiosity but does little to quench that curiosity.",
    "No, not if they want fair and understandable grading. If you are looking for a good, low-key history class with fun lectures, understandable grading, no judgement, and clear direction of course material, this class is not it.",
    "if you are in need of a fifth class, then yes. it was interesting and i did learn quite a bit of broader, transferrable skills. but be weary that the grading is a little tricky.",
    "Not really, it was easy but grading was unclear. Professors voice is very annoying so no one really shows up. Its a fat gut, really boring dont expect much from this",
    "Yes, if they are interested in learning about China in general",
    "Not really, it was very biased against China (mostly explained Western perspectives on different topics and not that of the Chinese).",
    "Yes, if you have little knowledge or background of Chinese history and want a general historical survey. Not recommended if you want an in-depth view of certain aspects of Chinese history.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in a historical introduction to contemporary Chinese issues.",
    "Yes, especially if you're looking for a fifth class\/already have some interest\/base knowledge of China. Hansen has high expectations, but is kind, knowledgeable and allows for a flexible workload.",
    "I'm not really sure about this class. I was so worried about it for ages, but I ended up doing ok. I think that as long as you put effort into the assignments, you will get an A-. That is, if you're willing to deal with a very disorganized class, in which there is very little guidance. A lot of students were complaining about the class when they were in it to each other. Definitely NOT a gut.",
    "This course is great if you want to learn a little more about China, especially modern history through the lens of ancient history. It's also great to become more familiar with more pressing issues surrounding China in the moment. The course is not particularly difficult and is whatever you make it to be. Not a must take, but enjoyable.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about China's past and important recent events like the cultural revolution.",
    "No, I think the lectures were rather disorganized and jumped from dynasty to dynasty.",
    "Yes. Going to class was fun, not stressful, and informative. There are only four assignments, and as long as you put in effort to do the readings, attend occasional sections, and pay attention in class, they will be fine. Also, Professor Hansen was amazing. She cares a lot about her students and has wonderful insight to share about her studies on the Qingming Scroll and her time spent in China. Just taking the class to learn from her and talk with her after class about China-related topics was worth it!",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely yes. In addition to the superb teaching of Professor Hansen, the course as a whole provides impartial perspectives about China, its history, and the implications surrounding the current events pertaining to the country.",
    "I think I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in studying Chinese history. Chinese history is such a large topic that we still only skim the surface with this class, but the advantage of taking this class is that we are introduced to a lot of terminology and context that can help in further study of Chinese history. However, I wonder if a class that didn't try to force linkages between past and present but instead just taught the class as \"here's a primer on some periods in Chinese history\" might be more helpful. Some lectures (especially those from the Song Dynasty) ended up feeling a bit irrelevant, but only because the class was sold as \"here's how the past relates to the present\", even though learning the history of the Song Dynasty is probably more helpful in learning the history of the subsequent dynasties like Yuan and Ming compared to much later time periods like modern China.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in history\/China\/interational affairs."
