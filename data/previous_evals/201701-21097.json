   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Great overview of some of the foundational works in the field of sociology.",
    "I learned a lot about the topic of sociology. I had never encountered it as a subject and I learned so much that it will shape the path I take at Yale. I learned about great sociologists from history, social psychology, class\/culture\/gender division, and the development of society through processes such as modernity.",
    "The engaging class discussions helped me gain the confidence to speak in a seminar setting, the readings were very informative and interesting",
    "By taking this course, you get a great exposure to some seminal sociological texts. I found my critical reading ability got so much better taking this course. At first, the works were difficult and slow to get through, but by the end of the course, works that had given me trouble earlier on were now much easier to understand.",
    "I learned how to apply foundational concepts of sociology to modern political and societal issues.",
    "This course taught me how to think about history with a new perspective. It taught me to think more philosophically and to make connections between different points in world history. Finally, this class encouraged me to consider how our world continues to redefine modernity over time.",
    "I learned a lot about having meaningful discussions in seminars, as well as gained a great overview of sociological topics.",
    "I gained critical thinking skills from the course and learned to look at readings and modernity in a new light. Initially, the readings seemed very difficult, but I definitely became a better critical thinker and was more easily able to deconstruct each week's readings by the end of the course. I learned about postmodernism, colonialism, and capitalism, among many other things.",
    "This course allowed me to develop better critical reading and analysis skills with texts I had never interacted with before, and often on a more advanced level than I had read before. It also improved my discussion skills as the class revolved around that.",
    "I just learned a lot of interesting material in short. In relation to modernity and civilization.",
    "This course was centered on asking questions and piecing evidence together to get a general idea of what sociology is. Gained basic knowledge of\/exposure to a wide variety of texts, and had a great chance to focus on discussion skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was great in that it covered a large range of different sociological papers from different authors, time periods and cultures. As such it provided a great introduction to sociology as a subject and really inspired me to continue it as a subject.",
    "Strengths: very engaging class discussions, Professor Adams is the sweetest and kindest person, the readings were very interesting, this is a great introduction to sociology even if you have no background\/are STEM person Weaknesses: we didn't have official grades throughout the course so it was kind of hard to judge how you were doing but Professor Adams wants everyone to succeed so I'm sure it turned out fine",
    "The strengths are Professor Adams' super sweet personality and all the important texts you get to read. I personally didn't find the class' lens on modernity to be that interesting of a topic, however.",
    "The course covers a good variety of topics and provides an opportunity for dialogue between students. It would be improved by more variety in how classes are structured.",
    "Professor Adams has incredible insight and helps spark great discussion. The environment of the class is very intimate given that it is in Professor Adams' living room. The course covers a large span of history which keeps it fresh and interesting. Sometimes readings can be a little too long to easily complete in time for class.",
    "This course included very interesting discussions, and I really loved learning about and discussing some of the topics. Perhaps the discussions could be a bit more guided?",
    "I really like how the course is very much discussion-driven, and the readings are fascinating. I also like Professor Adam's engagement with students and enjoyed the freedom with the weekly blog posts and with the final project. I really liked the structure of the course, although the readings could be quite heavy some weeks. I would recommend either having two blog posts per week so that students wouldn't have a very heavy workload due by the Monday that reading responses were due or have a reading response due later in the week, though I prefer the first option.",
    "Professor Adams does a great job of making the course welcoming and engaging; if discussions dwindled, she often stepped in in a Goffman-like fashion to stimulate further conversation.",
    "I feel the course could be improved with a little less reading and a little bit better facilitated discussion.",
    "The course's biggest strength was the variety of texts we covered - I really enjoyed reading everything. However, the course was also extremely broad. Discussions rarely stuck to the texts we read because there were so many directions branching off the concepts we talked about. If the course could narrow the focus, I think there would be a much clearer direction and objective. I enjoyed the class, but sometimes I felt lost because it was so broad."

   "comments": [
    "The sociological imagination is an excellent class.",
    "Absolutely, it was the best class I have ever taken. Even if you aren't interested in sociology (like I wasn't) I recommend you take it, as it will inspire you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this if you want to read a diverse array of social science texts, be engaged in a thought-provoking class discussion, and get to know the amazing Professor Adams.",
    "I thought this was a fun class that promoted interesting dialogue about the sociological basis for modern social and political interactions. If you like free-flowing discussions this is a good fit. The course blog was a good forum for people to connect the material to other current events or to their own lives.",
    "I would reccomend this course to anyone remotely interested in the social sciences. You can learn an incredible amount from Professor Adams and the other students in the class, and discussions are always very interesting. Workload is not too heavy and you can get away with not doi all the readings if you don't have the time.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in getting an overview of sociological topics, and it seems like you're interested in even some of the topics on the syllabus. There was kind of something for everyone, and it was a very relaxed and fun seminar.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings and discussions were fantastic, and Professor Adams is a phenomenal mentor and professor. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in modernity and sociology, regardless of previous knowledge in those areas, as it is a very accessible course.",
    "If you are interested by civilization and modernity this is a class that will lead to many great discussions on those matters.",
    "If you want to have a general idea of what sociology is, read some really cool texts, and work with an amazing professor, this is the course for you!",
    "Yes, even despite the 9am class time discussion were always incredibly interesting and the readings, thought provoking."
