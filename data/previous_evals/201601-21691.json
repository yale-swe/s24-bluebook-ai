    "Definitely recommended. You can see the development of modern poetry and may find it more enjoyable than 125 if you like more self-reflective works of poetry. Take it with Professor Hammer if you can because he has such a deep understanding and love of modern poetry.",
    "I would recommend ENGL126 to any prospective English major, and anyone really interested in poetry. I'd heard rumors that the class was boring and dry, but I was disproven as the term went on. I am not a natural poetry lover but this course made me grow to appreciate it a lot more--don't be deterred by reputation.",
    "A lot of reading and analysis, necessary if you plan to major in English. The poets one is exposed to are hugely important to the canon.",
    "If you already know you like English poetry, this is a necessary course. If you aren't sure about poetry, this may just win you over. This course trains your close reading skills, but also explores why anyone would read and write poetry, and the various forms that poetry can take. (Taking ENGL 125 beforehand is helpful for context, but not necessary. We didn't actually reference older poets much.)",
    "I would recommend English 126 both for improved writing skills and exposure to good poetry. It was a good introduction to the English-language canon but Professor Hammer also encouraged us to question the canonical status of the poems we read. The subject matter was enjoyable, even if I wouldn't have expected that in advance, and the feedback on papers was really excellent -- Professor Hammer is really interested in promoting clearer thinking and writing about the poems. All in all, very much worth taking.",
    "Ah, English 126. I would perhaps say \"eat your vegetables,\" but only cauliflower is as White and tasteless as this course. I only kid; there are, in fact, a number of reasons you might want to take English 126. The most prominent and best among them is that the class has been, is, and perhaps forever will be a prerequisite for the English major. However, if that is your motivation for taking 126, as it was certainly mine, I would suggest that you stop bluebooking right now and go take a look at the full list of requirements for the major. Do your soul-searching about whether the deeply constrictive set of necessary classes fits your vision of a fulfilling education now, not, as I did, midway through the semester, after you are already not very much enjoying English 126. If you are not an English major, I would, quite frankly, opt for a different class. There are moments in the work of each poet read in the class that will make you remember why you love literature in the first place. And if this were a five-day course in which you would receive a whirlwind tour of Milton's meticulously crafted philosophic blank verse, Pope's neatly commodified introduction to modernity, Wordsworth's indulgent but sometimes astonishingly beautiful tone-poem meditations on the mesmerizing power of nature, and the undoubtedly very good work of whichever modern poet or poets your professor chooses, I would highly recommend the class. But ultimately, English 126 is a marathon and not a sprint, and the sightseeing is perhaps not worth the slog. And while I end on a somewhat dour note, I will say that if you must take this course, there is no better professor with whom to read these works than Professor Hammer; if he is teaching, certainly opt for him, as his style is a modest but enjoyable treat, and he will help you significantly improve your reading and writing skills. Good luck, young ones! Be wiser than I once was when I stood in your place."
