   "comments": [
    "Very interesting course. Sometimes the reading can feel like a lot, but with the small seminar environment you really get a lot out of it. Never having taken a WGSS course before, or a course on Asian American history, this was a great experience.",
    "Professor Lui is great! Great help with papers and a great discussion leader. She forced us to delve into the heart of the issue, highlighted relevant parts of our reading, and made class discussions enjoyable. Wonderful crafting of the syllabus.Pros: AMAZING reading list, small class made for great discussions without pressure of larger class, Professor Lui really challenged us to think deeper about the issues, a lot of reading (often time a book a week... but books are great! So didn't really feel like work) reasonable workload: 4 short reading responses, final 20-25 page paper with outline due before T-giving break, short presentation after break on your paper.Cons: A couple overly erudite articles, but necessary in the end, but nothing else! Great class!TAKE IT!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The point of taking a writing seminar is to learn how to think, write, and speak critically and analytically, and this course fulfills that mission that many other seminars fall short of. The syllabus is fantastic, and Professor Lui is a wonderful professor who truly cares about honing your skills and challenging you to ask deeper questions. While the workload for this course may be greater, you are guaranteed to not only learn in this class, but come out with a greater understanding of what it means to read and write history of gender and ethnicity.",
    "Interesting class. Lots of work and readings, but if you do them, you will get so much out of this small seminar."
