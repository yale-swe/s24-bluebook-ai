    "learning about the apocalypse as seen in multiple religions\/cultures...and yes i would recommend it because it's quite interesting with a good professor and a very reasonable workload",
    "I would definitely recommend it, with some concerns outlined below.Strengths: Super interesting readings. It was neat to cover cases from all over the world and different time periods.Weakness: I often had trouble understanding Prof. Wilson because he speaks so softly. It would have been better if he had a microphone or spoke up. Also, we never got any of our papers back before turning in the final paper, so it was impossible to know how we were doing in the class or if we needed to change our writing style. This seemed to be because Prof. Wilson had some health problems. In the future, he should get a TA so this isn't a problem again.",
    "RLST 110 was a class where we basically learned every week about some new, crazy apocalyptic group. The cases that we learned about were so interesting and will make you realize all sorts of wacky things that go on, why they happen, and anything else you ever wanted to know about the apocalypse. Classes could sometimes be a little long and tedious, but the material was so interesting and Professor Wilson is a really funny guy. There were only 2 short papers and then a final paper you could write on anything you want. It's also a great way to fulfill the world religions requirement for the major",
    "Take it. It's really a fun course.",
    "Yes. The readings are very interesting. Not the most interactive seminar though (the class size was a little too big)."
