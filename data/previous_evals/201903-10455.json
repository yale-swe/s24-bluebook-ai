   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the basics of astrophysics including fluids. This class sparked an interest in fluid dynamics for me, and I look forward to learning more about fluids in the future.",
    "This course was all about offering primers in broad topics in modern astrophysics. I certainly gained a better understanding of several subfields and learned about their important questions, as well as which modalities (and software packages) best serve the active research in these areas.",
    "I gathered an overarching understanding of some of the most important and cutting edge topics in astrophysics, and practiced techniques of analysis used heavily in the field.",
    "Very broad, comprehensive and rigorous overview of the physics underling astronomy and astrophysics. The course took three or four courses of material and packed it into one semester"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor was very good at explaining very difficult concepts. I found her ability to explain relativity very helpful. The workload was appropriate too. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the homeworks. My only criticism is the first exam and how long it was for a very short time period.",
    "There are a lot of interesting (and in-depth) topics that are within the purview of this course, but that means that we only get one or two lectures on complex sub-fields like hydrodynamics or general relativity. Were the course slightly less ambitious, it might facilitate deeper learning of the covered material rather than acting as a survey of some of the most compelling areas in (astro)physics today.",
    "Strength: We had a lot of material to consult for self-studying; Weakness: I find that I didn't learn much from lectures except when we did white board derivations. I personally follow a lot better than if I were shown equations on powerpoint slides.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was that it encouraged the students to research topics outside of the classroom, and in fact required this to follow some of the more important derivations. The greatest weakness of a course of this type, of course, is that the depth of study that was required to truly value the subjects to the degree that they deserve was not possible given the time and the sheer number of topics.",
    "The material is heavy, the pace is insanely fast \"a flyover\" of huge amounts of information, and a necessity of many hours outside of class teaching yourself (if you dont already know the material) before you can tackle problem sets. All of this is a deliberate design choice for the course so the key is a prof who can pull it off. And that was not really the case. Prof Natarajan is wicked smart and knows this stuff cold, but her teaching style is to continuously throw a lot of material at us and keep going - we rarely paused to dig into how or why. My guess is that if Prof N would put more time into the course, its utility would double."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. It helped me refresh a lot of math I forgot over the years in undergrad. Also the professor's notes are incredibly detailed and very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that if they're more interested in any one of the topics specifically (and not required to take ASTR 500), they may be better served by taking a designated class in that area, which will assuredly go more in depth. The stated goal of this course, and what it accomplishes, is really to contextualize graduate-level astronomy concepts for people with Bachelors degrees in physics.",
    "I would recommend this to another student, however, for undergraduates taking the course, I would recommend not taking a heavy course load in addition. This course required a good amount of reading outside of the lectures.",
    "If you are going to do astro, you have to know this stuff. But it requires the right prof."
