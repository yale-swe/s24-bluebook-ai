    "I would recommend this seminar course to all students that are interested in lymphoid organ development, lymphocytes trafficking and migration. This course will discuss many mile-stone papers.",
    "I would summarize the course as a survey of basic immunological concepts in microscopy studies of mouse models.I would not recommend the course. The course requires a considerable amount of effort, and delivers very little return on investment unless you are working in the very specific focus area of the course.The grant writing portion of the course was particularly disappointing, as it was the component I thought would be the most valuable when I enrolled. However, the available grant topics were restricted to a scope outside my field. Thus, the grant proposal was of no practical use to me, the critiques only pointed out errors I knew existed, and overall did not provide a learning experience beyond an average undergraduate writing assignment.Given that by the end of the course there were only two students enrolled for credit, the rigidity of the instructors regarding proposal topics was difficult to understand; it seemed more territorial than reasoned, in my opinion."

   "comments": [
    "This course helps a lot for deepen my knowledge in immunobiology and contributes a lot for my thesis.",
    "As I mentioned in my first response, this course demystified several fields in immunology. My understanding of lymphocyte\/lymphoid organ development, trafficking and antigen delivery was at a basic level before taking the course. Furthermore, I had very few opportunities to learn more about these topics. This was criminal given the fundamental role each of these processes play in shaping the immune response.The course provided the framework and time to delve into these topics and I feel that my understanding of my own research and immunology in general is greatly enhanced.",
    "Though I did gain some information that will be valuable to me, overall the course was of little value to my research."
