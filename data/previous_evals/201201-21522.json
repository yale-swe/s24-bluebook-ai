    "I would recommend taking French 140 with Mme Koizim.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 140. It has been an amazing course, and I\u0092ve learned so much. French 140 has built upon what we learned in L1, L2 and L3, and it was so rewarding to be able to read entire novels and watch films in French. It\u0092s a significant amount of work but it\u0092s not unreasonable and also really helped us learn the material (not busywork). Madame Koizim is fantastic and made the course fun and exciting \u0096 She is one of the best professors I\u0092ve ever had. Overall, I can\u0092t say enough positive things about this course.",
    "This course is definitely a lot of daily work, but if you have a good professor and class it's enjoyable. Although takes a lot of work to do well, if you want to proficient in the language this class is necessary.",
    "French 140 was a continuation of French 130, but had a surprisingly serious unit on World War II. There is more reading and a final presentation, but nothing overly difficult.",
    "I highly recommend Fren 140, especially with Madame Koizim. It seems somewhat less intense than 130, but I also think I learned far more about French in 140.",
    "I would recommend French 140 to students who want to continue their French studies after 130 or have placed into 140 and want to solidify their French skills.",
    "I would recommend it! It's a very nice and structured class that will not bring you surprises at the end of the semester. You really learn a lot and I think this class is essential to get somewhere near being able to really communicate with someone in French.",
    "French 140 is great for people who really like the French language. You get a lot of L1-L3 here and L4 really isn't necessary unless you really have a passion for learning to read and speak the language more fluently.",
    "Yes. Take it with Professor Koizim if possible.",
    "This class is a lot of work on a daily basis, don't get behind. Otherwise it is totally manageable and a great class."
