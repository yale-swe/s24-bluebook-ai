   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course. Low workload, smart course, good sources, interesting ideas. But class discussion is frustrating due to teaching-style of professor and there is little to no guidance on the two long papers.",
    "This is a good 5th class--not so much reading and only 2 papers. However because the class meets only once a week and the reading is limited, I think you don't get a continuous history but rather an episodic and jumpy look at history. Nevertheless the class and readings are interesting.",
    "This class is great. Really a break from a typical history seminar. Not much reading is required--instead, the classes are based on a close reading of a couple short primary sources. Professor Perry is wonderful, really cares about and wants to get to know his students. (We went to Miya's for one of our classes, on the Judaic Studies Department.) I'd definitely recommend it."
