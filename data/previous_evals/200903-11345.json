   "comments": [
    "Its great. Take it and learn about humanity.",
    "I recommend this class highly.",
    "Yes even if Spanish literature is not necessarily a particular interest the course provides a context in which to improve spanish reading, writing and speaking skills.",
    "You will read the major works (from the Spanish equivalent to Beowulf, El Cantar del Mio Cid, to more recent pieces by authors that sound vaguely familiar), though in abridged form or only a part of it (like Don Quijote). Reading is a pleasure, though it sometimes feels rushed, and class discussion ranges from simple \"translation\" (not really in English, but rather a discussion of what the author is saying using other words in Spanish) to acting out to actual contextual analysis of society during the time period (the best!)..",
    "I recommend it because it's a great class taught by a great teacher. It is however, a good amount of work, so if you are looking for an easy spanish credit, this isn't it.",
    "Professor Byrne is wonderful, and the class moves at a good pace. Some of the readings at the beginning are a little too difficult for most non-native speakers, but the class gets more enjoyable as it goes on. Take this class if you are interested in the period, and are looking for a lighter load of work and a professor who will really assist you in the learning process.",
    "Yes definitely! Even if you're not that interested in Spanish Literature particularly, it is a VERY GOOD L5 class and its impossible not to become interested in the subject with Professor Byrne teaching it. I took it as an alternative to conversational Spanish and don't regret it at all. The reading load in sensible and the papers are fun to write. The tests are also very fair."
