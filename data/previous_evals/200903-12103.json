   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it! The class exceeded my expectation. The materials are comprehensive not only about Asian American history, but about issues pertinent to everybody's understanding of America.",
    "Yes. This class will change your view on American history.",
    "For content it's a wonderful class. Professor Lui is a great person to get to know--she's so knowledgeable and actually wants to get toknow her students.It's a hard class in terms of grades though.",
    "Great class on more than just historical events in Asian American history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not just to Asian American students or History students, but any student who is interested in the US's treatment of minorities, immigration policy, etc. Really good course. Just be warned though, there's a heavy workload - lots of reading every week and lots to know for each exam. The class consists of two papers (5 and 10 pages), a midterm, and a cumulative final.",
    "This class will push you, but it's definitely worth it. Probably my favorite class in 5 semesters at Yale. All history majors, especially those concentrating in American history, should take this course. It provides an essential perspective on American history, and you'll walk away feeling enriched and challenged.",
    "Absolutely take it. This is a part of American history that is never taught in schools. Professor Lui's lectures are meticulously organized and delivered. It's definitely not an easy course, though.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "This class does a good job trying to squeeze a lot of history into a semester's worth of instruction. Be prepared to digest a lot, but it's well worth it. I recommend this class to anyone who wants to know more about what sometimes seems like the hidden minority in America.",
    "It's a great class that will allow you to learn more about American history even if you aren't really that interested in Asian American history.I would definitely recommend this to another student because it's an area that just isn't studied enough. Not taking this class is like learning about America's great wars without learning about the generals that fought them.",
    "An excellent course covering Asian American history. This was my first history class (I'm a science major) and I loved it because it challenged my way of thinking about race, discrimination, and history in general. Prof Lui is a solid lecturer who presents organized lectures each time, and though there is quite a bit of reading, there is good support available in the form of Prof Lui and the TA (Monica Martinez this year). The grade is spread out over a midterm paper, midterm exam, final paper, and final exam, and the class was overall extremely thought-provoking, relevant, and worthwhile. Take it!",
    "This is a great course to take, even if you think you know about Asian American history. It's awesome to follow American history from a very different perspective. Though we know about the Emancipation Proclamation, we often don't hear about how this changed race relations for Asian Americans on the West Coast. Professor Lui's lectures are great and engaging. The readings are sometimes long, but the lectures give a great understanding of a broad scope of Asian American history.",
    "Definitely recommended. It's a highly enjoyable course and the information presented in class is never elucidated in courses and textbooks studying other aspects of American History.",
    "Excellent course with engaging lectures and interesting and manageable readings. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale."
