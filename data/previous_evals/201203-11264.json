   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it very highly to students interested in theory of mind and related areas as an excellent, thorough introduction to the whole area.",
    "PSYC 671 included a crash course in the basics of theory of mind research, followed by a survey of a number of more specialized topics. I would recommend this course to anyone for whom ToM research is research-relevant, but has not been able to find the time to read the literature in depth.",
    "Yes, the class is interesting, but you have to be committed to doing all the weekly readings.",
    "The cognitive science of mind reading course covers theory of mind *very* broadly. Everything from the history of the field, to the theories about the cognitive mechanisms underlying theory of mind, to development (ontogenetic and phylogenetic), to quite a number of topics that may be supported by theory of mind such as moral cognition, pedagogy, and religion. I would definitely recommend it to another student because it covers a wide range of topics and is an awesome way to discuss these topics with other graduate students."

   "comments": [
    "The topic of the course is quite relevant to some of my research interests, so learning the literature in more depth was extremely useful in tying in to current projects.",
    "The topics discussed helped me gain a different perspective on the topics I am interested in for my research.",
    "This course greatly expanded my understanding of the theory of mind literature and social cognition literature more generally. It was a great opportunity to read foundational papers that every student conducting social cognitive research should read, while discussing them critically with Laurie and the other students in the class. Actually, one thing that was super helpful about the course that I was not anticipating is that it provided a very good introduction to cognitive neuroscience. I had not read many cog neuro articles previously and it was great to have an opportunity to read about this approach in the context of social cognition and actually discuss these methods with Rebecca Saxe. Overall, I think it provided a very good cross-section of different approaches (e.g., cog neuro, x-phi, comparative, etc.)."
