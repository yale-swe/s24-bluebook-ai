    "If you are interested in finance at all, Econ251 is probably one of the few must-takes at Yale. If you like solving quantitative questions or think that you are good at math (high school math, no calculus or linear algebra involved), you should definitely consider taking this class. At the end of day, Financial Theory teaches you the fundamental theories of modern finance, in a much quicker and neater way than reading those finance books on your own.",
    "This is one of those classes that you'll either love or hate, depending on whether you understand the material. Put in the time to read lecture notes and the class becomes significantly easier and more enjoyable.John G. is also a highly engaging lecturer albeit a completely self (and Fisher)-obsessed (but that just adds to the humor really). He goes really fast though, so youre really just left relying on the online notes for guidance.Also, the psets can be really long, hard, and tedious. Same for the exams. But the curve is pretty generous.",
    "No. I gleaned so little information from lectures (which are then supported by literature written by the professor) and sections (which are taught by terrible TAs). Only take this class if you find the first few classes easy as pie, because it will get harder and a lot more time consuming.",
    "Highly recommended, if you want to learn about finance.You will find the course very manageable and interesting if you have good logic.",
    "It's an interesting introduction to finance. I would recommend it if you are very on top of things because getting behind is not acceptable as you will just be completely lost in a few short lectures. If you stay on top of things, the work is manageable and interesting.",
    "The midterms and problem sets are based off of what the lecture notes say and what your TAs tell you - rarely on the lectures, which are much more theory and proof-based. However, the material comes together toward the end of the course well, so that you learn a lot more than it seems as you're struggling through problems. The curve is also very generous; however, do not expect Professor G to explain most of the problems since he has such a solid math background that a lot of what he says is hard to grasp the first few times through. He is very smart, and some of what he says is eye-opening (for example, about social security or the leverage cycle), but he also has a hard time sometimes teaching down to undergrads. Also, a statisticsbackground is recommended, since the second half of the course is based on probability and random variables - we learn stats in one lecture, but this hardly feels enough sometimes.",
    "The material taught is very useful in life and you actually learn a lot in this class.",
    "Financial Theory is a hard economics class, but if you put in the work you should be alright, if you've gotten through the intermediates and want to learn some applicable stuff, take the class. But I don't think Professor Geanakoplos is teaching it next year, so it might be different.",
    "A must-take if you're an econ major. You will learn so much in this class, and it's really cool to have undergone the \"John G experience.\" Problem sets take a while though although tests are not very hard.",
    "if you take it, do it Cr\/D",
    "This is a good course, but its a bit of a grab bag of micro and finance.",
    "I highly, highly recommend it to anyone who derives immense satisfaction from completing a challenging course and wants to learn more about the theoretical basis behind stock& bond markets (arbitrage, Arrow securities, hedging, etc). Though you won't leave this class feeling absolutely ready to jump into sales& trading, it builds a good mathematical understanding of how markets work. Geanakoplos, though initially intimidating, is a great guy and really knows his stuff. Be warned though: the class requires hard work. If you don't understand the initial concepts you will have a hard time understanding uncertainty, and other topics tackled later. All-in-all however, if you enjoy working at it and complete the class successfully, easily one of the best Econ courses you could ever take at Yale.",
    "As a Math-Econ student, I can say this was pretty easy. It's just an application of things you've learned before in a slightly different setting, but nothing too complicated. Now if you're not, then I really don't know, some people find it hard.",
    "The class material is pretty interesting, especially if you have any interest in economics. Professor Geanakoplos is great and the notes are all posted online, but the problem sets are very tedious and take forever. Don't take this class if you don't want to do a lot of math.",
    "The math is actually difficult and having taken stats will help you, especially near the end of the course. The material is quite fascinating especially in light of the financial crisis.",
    "Great class if you're at all interested in the material.",
    "Lot of math, good if you're going into hedge funds",
    "This class is invaluable as far as what you will learn (especially if you are not an economics major). Just hope that by next year John G has developed the ability to say \"no more questions\" when he realizes that he has only five minutes left to cover 10 minutes of material.",
    "I would strongly recommend Econ 251 to students who want to know a bit of the theoretical side of finance. It was a blast for me.",
    "If you're interested in learning about finance, and if you want a more fundamental understanding, take this course.",
    "Cool class overall.",
    "This is definitely a good class, but you have to be prepared to put the time in. To really understand what was going on, I had to attend class, read the lecture notes online, and go to section. Some of the material is a bit more theoretical than you might use in job or internship, but it gives you good background knowledge and makes you more comfortable with financial terms.",
    "Great class that really comes together at the end. From the beginning there's lots of math but by the end you realize how practical the theories actually are. While there's a lot of math, it actually isn't that hard. It gives you a much better understanding behind the theories of finance, and why traders do what they do. The professor is awesome.",
    "I had such mixed feelings on this course while taking it, but at the end, I feel proud to have met the challenge. (Though I am writing this before seeing my grade. We'll see.) The problem sets are ridiculously long and challenging, and admittedly might even have brought me to tears once or twice. The exams are very difficult, mainly because of time restraints. The curve on the second midterm and on the homeworks is very generous, however. And at the end of the day, you've definitely learned something about finance, and it's going to stick with you. Make sure you're good with the basics, though, because the professor goes through those very quickly and it's easy to fall behind. So overall, I'd say take it if the rest of your semester isn't deadly, but be prepared to work very, very hard.",
    "Very good class. Very math-oriented, but still very pertinent. Not math for the sake of math - Geanakoplos is good at presenting the processes and the reasons for them simultaneously. You definitely come out feeling like you've gotten a lot outof the class as long as you keep up.",
    "If your looking for a challenging math course that is interesting then I would recommend it.",
    "everyone should take professor Geanakoplos' class. he is the best professor i ever had.",
    "Lectures are basically spent furiously trying to copy down the professor's very involved mathematical proofs for financial concepts that are intuitively much easier to understand. If you deal well in the realm of mathematical abstraction, take the course. You'll enjoy it. Otherwise, know what you're getting in to. As an EPE major with a good amount of facility with math, I found the course accessible but work-intensive. It's tough because if you don't follow the proofs in class, much of your learning takes place in section. If you don't have a good TA, you're alone with the lecture notes trying to do problem sets. Find a study group if you're going to take this class. This all said, the curve for this class is pretty happy. Your raw score on a midterm (there are 2) will comfortably be in the failing range, but you'll come out with a B+ on that exam.",
    "good class, not necessarily for those who want to do banking but those who want to do financial economics",
    "Do not take this class. The material is dull and very poorly taught.",
    "Financial Theory is apretty cool, math-based discussion of theories that attempt to explain the forces that drive financial markets. If you have any kind of math background it's not too tough - the curve is very generous, and there's very little reading outside of the class. Not useful at all really if you want to go into banking (I don't), but a great class if you're interested in economics and want a deeper understanding of finance. John G is a cool dude and very smart but he is kind of a crappy lecturer, so read the lecture notes if you want to understand what's going on.",
    "Econ 251 takes you back to the good old days of middle school math, the crux of which was problem solving. Everyone talks about how hard the class is, but the difficulty comes from adapting to a new way of thinking rather than the mathematics itself. Prepare to spend a lot of time with your TA. Geanakoplos' explanations in class are a little sketchy and his lecture notes are even worse. He's an entertaining lecturer though his sense of humor (which is in a word, self-aggrandizing) becomes a little grating by the end of the semester. All in all, a class worth taking for all (even non-econ majors). Makes finance seem accessible.",
    "Great introduction to the concepts behind many financial terms and instruments that we hear about in everyday life.",
    "Great class, lots of work, psets will keep you up all night on occasion, but you learn a ton and John G is absolutely the man.",
    "Good class if you are interested in looking at finance from a theoretical perspective.",
    "This course is a basic introduction to real-life financial theory. If you've never seen anything about bonds, stocks, hedging, or equilibrium models before, there will be plenty of interesting and worthwhile information to learn. However, the course is not a walk in the park--many times, the homework is needlessly tedious and your patience will be tested doing it. I also feel that the quality of the TAs' instruction can affect this class immensely. I'd say take it if you're thinking about it, but proceed with caution.",
    "Sure. Econ 251 is an excellent course. We can learn a lot about the financial theory from the course.",
    "If you are a math person.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in finance. It is a challenging course, but at the end of the semester it seemed very worth it.",
    "Take it! Just learn the problem sets and you'll be fine for the (somewhat) easy exams. It's an interesting course and a mind-bender. Be prepared for long problem sets and frustration, but it's quite rewarding.",
    "I would recommend the course for the quality with which it taught and the intriguing nature of the material.",
    "The class gave a nice overview of some important concepts: financial equilibrium, interest rates, dynamic hedging, etc. The lectures were often too fast-paced and hard to follow but I really enjoyed the class as a whole. The problem sets often covered material that had not been covered in lecture -- since there was no textbook, figuring out how to do them was a bit of a challenge. The lectures on the credit crisis were great and I was happy I took the class (even though the p-sets killed me).Make sure you have a background in math and econ before taking this. Geanakoplos will say you don't need a background but you probably do -- otherwise you might be in over your head. The class moves very quickly so be prepared for that.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless a) you have taken intermediate micro and b) you plan to take this course for an econ major. THIS IS NOT A COURSE FOR NON-ECON MAJORS. Please take note of this.",
    "Memorize 20-30 particular methods for solving particular problems, without enough depth or grasp to modify them for anything else.",
    "If you are an Econ\/Math guy definitely take it, otherwise not because it is very specialized.",
    "I would recommend it. Sometimes I got that uneasy feeling that I wasn't really understanding the material fully, but I don't think that's unusual for this class and I did learn quite a few thingseven after having taken Financial Markets. I wasn't very knowledgeable about finance to begin with -- I probably still am not -- but the course, I think, did give me some familiarity with the big things."
