    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT IF YOU GET IN. After eight semesters at Yale, I can say with confidence that Vikram has been the professor most dedicated to my academic and professional development. From the beginning of the semester, Vikram treated us as peers, not only as students, with incredible humility. He let us, as shoppers to the class, discuss and choose who should be in the class. Since then, he has been invested in our development at every stage of the class. He offered incredibly detailed and thoughtful advice, both on how to navigate my last semester at Yale, and about my future career plans. He has always been eager to discuss my plans and thoughts with him, whether they were related to class or nothe is probably the most accessible professor I have ever had. Vikram not only motivates his students to give their best work, but he is also a constant source of inspirationboth in the academic and professional settings. He carefully plans each seminar to discuss intricate business ethics problems and its policy implications, making everyone in the class feel welcome and respected.",
    "A class you have to try to take before you graduate! Absolutely incredible!",
    "Definitely take the class if you can get in. Probably credit\/D if possible. The grading seems a little random. Each week, a different speaker is brought to class to talk about their line of business and an ethical question of some sort. It's great to talk about different career paths and learn about things that are actually relevant to the real world.",
    "Definitely, if you can get in! The speakers every week are incredibly interesting and have many important things to share.",
    "If you can get it, take it. Best class at Yale. This is the only class I have taken at Yale where you deal with tangible business issues on a weekly basis.",
    "The highlight of this class is the guest speakers. Someone new comes to class each week to talk about a different aspect of business; the connection with ethics was strong some weeks, but weaker others. The speakers were, overall, excellent. I wish there had been more opportunity for class discussion, as the guests tended to speak for much of the class (usually fine because what they had to say was interesting), but there wasn't as much chance for us to develop our own ideas. The lunches at Mory's after class were, needless to say, a nice perk, and a great way to talk further with the guest in a more colloquial setting. I would say this class offers breadth over depth. So, if you're looking for a seminar where you will think and discuss business\/ethics deeply, this is not that course. But still worth taking!",
    "This is simply not a traditional Yale academic experience. It is great for juniors and seniors who are thinking about their careers more and more seriously--I would not recommend it for freshmen and sophomores, since you will just get so much more out of it if you take it as an upperclassman (and you probably won't get in either). I would definitely recommend the class. It is an amazing opportunity to hear from people who are at the top of their fields, and change your perspective. Take the class if you can!",
    "This was a one of a kind seminar experience where you got to speak to amazing guests from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. I was genuinely excited to go to class each week and what you learn is extremely relevant to building a career.",
    "I would hesitantly recommend if you want to learn about different industries and meet neat people. I would 100% recommend if another professor were teaching. It's hard to get in if you're not EP&E or a senior, but if you don't get in, consider it a blessing in disguise. You can learn similar amount of knowledge by reading a few articles online. In Vikram, you will meet an interesting case to study of someone who believes ethical responsibility in business means making money in the longterm; the justification for including women in the workforce is not for equality, but because it adds diverse opinions that increase profits.",
    "If you can get in, you should absolutely take it. The first class of getting in is a bit hunger games style, but you feel that much more accomplished when you do get in. The speakers are really cool, the lunches are a great opportunity. Vikram knows a lot about business ethics and can give you great career advice if you ask."
