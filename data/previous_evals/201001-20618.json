    "good course for the basic bioinformatics",
    "It is a good course. If you are a CBB student, you definitely should take it.",
    "very broad introduction to the topic of bioinformatics.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who values their time. It does not cater to any one discipline and does not go sufficiently in depth into any one area to be useful to anyone. Half the time it seemed like the professors were deciding the direction of the course on the fly. This course needs to be redesigned and retaught.",
