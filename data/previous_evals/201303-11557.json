   "comments": [
    "It's a great way to get research experience! 10 hours a week is definitely doable, although it can get tough in busy weeks.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to others. Everyone should do research. This is an open ended way to explore, and the experience of writing a research paper is instructional. The motivation that one has when working on a personal project is far beyond the motivation from classes.",
    "Research for credit, pretty straightforward. Just make sure you choose a lab with a topic that interests you AND a pleasant lab environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in research. It's a great way to get close to a PI and graduate students, and you learn a lot about how to conduct experiments and analyze data. The project that I worked on way completely original and my own personal project, which was very cool that my PI trusted me so much from the beginning. It is a fair amount of work (often to really conduct research, you'll have to be in lab more than 10 hours most weeks),but it was enjoyable to put in more time because you get tangible results for your efforts. Definitely take this class if you're curious about research or want to pursue a career in a research related field.",
    "you conduct research for often more than 10 hours a week. make sure that you select a lab that you enjoy. i think it's best to do this for two semesters versus one. it's just hard to get enough data in just one semester. doing the two semester meant that i didn't have too much to do during finals time this semester."
