    "This class is very interesting and important to understand how different legal systems work around the world.

   "comments": [
    "I know my suggestion could be logistically difficult, but given the amount of content in the course, I would expand the duration of the seminar. Maybe having one week with Prof. Lye and then several weeks with Prof. Robinson, combining schedules for when he teaches in Yale College. It is just frustrating to have such a huge ammount of reading and not enough time to read it, or digest the readings even.I would have discussion sections with the TA all along the semester to have an higher engagement in the readings.",
    "One of the instructors (Robinson) seems significantly more Knowledgeable than the other (Lye). Important to include instructors directly familiar with civil law or from a civil law country.",
    "Some readings need to be sorted out and be placed under the correct heading. Quite confusing.",
    "I wish the course could be extended for a longer period of time, with the readings spread out between more classes.",
    "I felt like some ideas we covered needed to be covered more in-depth and have more time for questions from students. However, it was difficult to fully engage because the class goes by so quickly (two-week intensive instead of full semester).",
    "It would be ideal to have the class distributed in more than 2 weeks, through conference calls in order to grasp more information."
