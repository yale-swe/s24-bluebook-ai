    "This class will give you a rough overview of the history of the English language, as well as arm you with lots of English-related trivia that you can impress your friends with. You will learn to appreciate how the English language developed over time and understand the influences that helped to shape the English language and make it the unique language that it is today.",
    "History of the English Language is a fascinating course that takes you through all the major developments of English, starting with Proto-Indo-European langauges and finishing with Internet-speak. Anya and Professor Frank are wonderful teachers! Lecture was a joy to attend. The workload is about average--don't let the quizzes or papers scare you off. The class is also geared slightly more towards linguistics majors than English majors, but English majors can still keep up!",
    "Amazingly interesting course with a focus on overall concepts instead of memorizing minute details and information.",
    "This a relatively easy and interesting class which I would recommend. Thr professors really make the class",
    "A course that offers a good introduction to linguistics and provides supplemental information that could be useful in other history or English classes. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in the quirks of English vocabulary, grammar, or syntax.",
    "The History of the English Language was a fine course. The first half is definitely more interesting than the second half once you get back into Middle English and Old English. The class can be boring at times, and there may seem to be a good amount of work, but the work is not too hard and it is easy to do well if you pay attention and put some work into the homework.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. ENGL 149 was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale and especially within the English department. The course was incredibly interesting, rewardingly challenging, and perhaps MOST important inclusive. So many of the english courses I have taken revolved specifically on old dead white men, to the point that I had given up hope english could ever reflect the diversity of students taking its courses, but this course made it a point to include the ways that the English language reflected the diversity of English speakers. Not only did we look at Old English but the beginning of the semester focused on different dialects and the politics of language. We looked at AAVE, at different creole languages, and heard a perfect balance of theory and in-depth analysis of literature and read both scholarly views on the english language and Kendrick Lamar lyrics. All the assignments also allowed for creativity which made the class very engaging, and also Professor Frank and Professor Adair are just the best professors in the world. This course not only deeply enriched my understanding of english language and literature, but also renewed my faith in the possibility of diversity within the English department pedagogy. Everyone should take this class and every professor should take notes on how to structure their class from this course!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in language in general, or different periods of English in particular. I think it's especially good for people without prior in-depth linguistic knowledge, and highly enjoyable for anyone.",
    "This class is great! The workload is beyond reasonable, and the subject matter is compelling. In every single class, there will be a moment that makes you think, \"Oooooh, so that's where that comes from!\" or \"That finally makes sense now!\" If you need an extra credit on top of your course load, this class is a great option; or, if you're just really interested in the English language and the ways languages develop in general, it's an awesome opportunity. Professor Frank and Anya are remarkably awesome teachers.",
    "Excellent course taught by passionate professors",
    "I would summarize the course as an overview of the English language from even before its beginning and stretching to modern day. The course covers a lot but not everything in detail, since it is only a semester long class. I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "A solid historical overview of the English language in addition to an exploration of different modern dialects. Anya and Roberta do a great job as a team. It's a pretty light class, and the readings\/videos are pretty enjoyable. The homework and essays are up to you to choose what to focus on, so you get to learn more detail about the areas you really enjoy. The class goes in reverse chronological order so you don't have to jump immediately into Old English. Anya and Roberta also do a great job of including different perspectives of gender and race in language in the course as well.",
    "I loved this class so much. Workload is light, material is fascinating and useful--if all my classes could be like this one I'd be honored.",
    "A fantastic class for anyone interested in English as a language.",
    "If you are really interested in this take it but there will be a lot of reading super old texts",
    "If you have even a little interest in linguistics, take it! It was my first linguistics class ever (Cr\/D), and I learned so much. It's amazing how large of a time period the class is able to cover (Modern English back to Old English and even a bit before that). And it was fun! Roberta is great, and Anya is straight-up amazing. And hilarious.",
    "This is an amazing course. It is a great intro to Linguistics and a really really interesting class. Take it. I loved this course. It was comprehensive and engaging and I loved every minute of it.",
    "Ever wondered why various spelling oddities and irregular verbs in English exist? The origin of closely related terms like go, depart, and exit? Or the various untold norms of discourse present and past, especially relating to politeness and gender? Take this course! It sweeps through the entire history of this unique and fascinating language, from the present day back to the hypothesized Proto-Indo-European. While doing so it not only reveals aspects of the language but also of the cultures that produced it. For a first-time course, it was surprisingly well-organized. The professors were engaging and passionate about the material. And the workload was light and open-ended -- not difficult at all. Overall, a fun class if you're interested in the topic.",
    "ENGL 149 is a comprehensive overview of the history of English. It goes from present to past, such that we can trace the language backwards, learning the skills and terminology to do so along the way. I would certainly recommend this to a student who has an interest in the subject matter but is not too serious about it. It's a great overview and I found it fascinating, but it's not very in-depth (which was fine by me!).",
    "Highly recommend",
    "This was a fantastic course in the linguistic history of English. I strongly recommend it.",
    "AMAZING. Anya & Roberta are both fantastic professors, and their styles were very complementary this semester. We worked backward through the history of English, from modern Internet English to Proto-Indo-European. I took the course for the Pre-1900 English major requirement, and ended up loving it. Readings are very interesting but non-essential to understanding the material or doing well in the course. Low work, high reward.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in the topic, with the note that it is what it says on the tin -- a history-heavy course. If this is a topic they're interested in, the class should be wonderful for them!"
