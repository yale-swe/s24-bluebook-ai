    "Better writing skills as well as an introduction to writing English research papers. I learned how to use critical texts in my writing as well as more ways to better analyze texts.",
    "Plot\/theme analysis, structuring an essay, enhanced research skills, clear and concise development of a thesis, development of an effective writing\/reading schedule",
    "I learned how to efficiently and eloquently compose a paper at Yale through vigorous examination of literary texts.",
    "This course helped me improve my writing and analysis of critical texts. I was also exposed to a variety of novels that genuinely interested me.",
    "The central feature of the course was to improve writing. This succeeded in its mission and was very helpful."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: constant verbal engagement with the texts\/peers and lengthy in-class discussions, detailed and extremely helpful feedback on paper drafts\/final revisions No weaknesses",
    "The level of the majority of literary texts were very high and only helped me improve the speed and quality at which I am able to analyze complex pieces of work. The only weaknesses were that sometimes the texts were not of the same high caliber as the others.",
    "I enjoyed our in class discussions on the readings and the activities that we would do in class about the readings. I also felt that feedback was helpful. However, I think that our paper workshops could be reworked to make them more helpful.",
    "Its strength is in its ability to rapidly improve your writing and critical reading skills in only a semester. Its weakness is the irrelevancy of much of the reading you do for the course. We generally had two books to choose between to write every paper about, yet were made to read both. Several of the novels I read and discussed I never had to write about."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if the student is interested in reading about different types of journey narratives as well as talking about or analyzing them.",
    "Yes, my writing abilities have vastly improved over the semester, and the skills taught in this course are very widely applicable to other concentrations.",
    "For anyone who is looking to improve their writing quality through writing workshops and through looking at other examples of high quality writers, I would suggest they take the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others because the topic of journeys and how they are constructed in literature is interesting and discussing it in papers makes the idea of longer papers less intimidating. I also found this class to be fun.",
    "Absolutely, Julia was willing to spend lots of time one on one to improve writing skills, and the reading for the course was challenging, engaging, and super fun. Class discussion was also fantastic."
