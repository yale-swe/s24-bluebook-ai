    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Take Intermediate Macro instead. This class was confusing, unstructured, poorly taught, uses the MIT Intro Macro textbook, and is overall just a really bad class. You're not going to get a more math based, proof based macro course here. You're just going to get 15 weeks of dread, stress, and overall unhappiness.",
    "Yes! Hard, grades might not turn out how you want them to, but an enjoyable, rewarding class.",
    "I would take it if you want a rigorous introduction to macroeconomics. I definitely learned a lot, but it was not easy.",
    "Good course. Very, very difficult. If you're planning on majoring in econ because you want to go into finance or because you don't know what else to do with your life, don't take this course. If you're planning on majoring in econ because you genuinely love econ and, perhaps, want to be an economics professor, take this course.",
    "The final was challenging, but certainly recommend over intermediate macro. Prof Tony Smith builds up the models in a systematic way, and having a mathematical basis of these models certainly provide a stronger understanding for how the macroeconomy works as compared to the hand-waving that other macroeconomic courses lean towards. Psets are fair and the math isn't particularly difficult (even as it can be tricky at times), put in the time (5-6 hrs a week) and it will certainly be worth it.",
    "There is a lot of theory, but if you are ok with that, an amazing course",
    "This class also caused me physical pain studying for the final it was so poorly taught. I am sure Professor Smith is a good economist. I am sure our TA Fabian Eckert is a good economist. But their atrocious teaching have caused me to switch my major to statistics. They seemed simply unaware of how upset, frustrated, and stressed the students were due to the unclear and convoluted nature of the course. Solutions to problems sets and exams were always confusing, if they were even available. I would recommend considering changing your major or plowing through Econ 122 instead of taking this course, even if it is completely redesigned. Even if you were guaranteed an A by taking this course (which youre not, Professor Smith is not miraculously a Good Guy Grader) I wouldnt take this course it is so detrimental to your mental health and your stress levels.",
    "Excellent course!",
    "A more mathematically rigorous version of the intermediate macro core. If you thought intro macro was easy, definitely take this over 121!",
    "A great macroeconomics course for those comfortable with derivatives and systems of linear equations. Not clear how to apply the models to real-life situations, though.",
    "ECON 126 is a strong course offering in intermediate macroeconomics with a much more mathematical foundation. The course does an excellent job of starting with basic concepts and building toward more complex topics while maintaining a dependable (but never overwhelming) pace. The course includes introduction to many of the macroeconomic subjects covered in more advanced courses and does focus on theory. The mathematics involved are primarily basic multivariable (partial derivatives, linearization, and Eulers theorem). The course has the added benefit of being a small lecture, in contrast to intermediate macroeconomics. I would strongly recommend taking this course for those studying macroeconomics with an interest in mathematics.",
    "A good mathematical macroeconomics course---you'll understand both the models and the intuition behind macro. Less rigorous (and conceptually coherent) than ECON 125, but that might just be the subject. Not a lot of work, and the exams are fair."
