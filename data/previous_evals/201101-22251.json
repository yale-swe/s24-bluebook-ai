   "comments": [
    "Not too much work for a 400 level econ class. Decently interesting.",
    "Yes, but you will have to motivate yourself to do the readings - the class is pretty low pressure (2 psets, 1 presentation, and a final paper).",
    "Definitely not- don't think any of my classmates would either. This is bottom of the barrel for an advanced Yale econ class.",
    "there are 4 assignments. 2 homeworks worth 25% each. a presentation worth 20% and a paper worth 30%. it was pretty awesome",
    "Pretty easy class. Costas is super enthusiastic and always willing to help you out. Definitely worth it, though 9 am could be a struggle sometimes.",
    "You will learn about international macroeconomics. You will learn some of the basic models that explain why countries run deficits\/surpluses, why some countries trade more than others, and a basic understanding of how the world economy works.",
    "ECON 407 really is what you make of it. You can get away with not doing any of the readings and waiting until you get the first (of only 2) problem sets before actually learning anything, but that's a waste of waking up at 9 am twice a week. Costas is really interested in working with students, so you should take advantage of that.",
    "A bit of a disappointment compared to how interesting the course looked from the syllabus.",
    "This class was surprisingly easy, but if you're interested in the subject, there is a lot to sink your teeth into. I'd recommend it to anyone.",
    "It is an interesting topic, and a class that you can get away with doing no work. Costas is a really nice guy, who makes the material easy to understand. You really don't need to go to every class or do any of the reading to do the 2 problem sets, presetnation (30 minutes with a partner), or final research paper.",
    "Yes. Its a good course about International Economics.",
    "I would recommend this if you are thinking about graduate school in economics but not if you are thinking of going into finance (slightly misleading course title). Also, don't expect much help from the professor on your papers. And definitely consider 406 as an alternative.",
    "Take it; it is a solid econ seminar and you will learn a lot of current material on the topic of international finance and trade."
