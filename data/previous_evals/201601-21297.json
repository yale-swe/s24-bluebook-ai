    "EENG 203 is a review and more in-depth analysis of the concepts learned in EENG 200 and EENG 203. I would recommend this only if the student needed it for their major, because of the amounts of prerequisites there are and the amount of work that goes into it. It's a very enjoyable, challenging class, but I don't think anyone but other engineering majors would get much out of it.",
    "This is a much more laid-back version of EENG 200, mostly focusing on the application of LaPlace and Fourier transforms to the circuit concepts taught in EENG 200. The lab can be a little tedious, but overall pretty low workload. I don't know why you'd take this class if you weren't in EE major, and if you are en EE major you have to, so I don't think this review is going to change who decides to take this course. But if you're an EE major just know that you can take some tougher electives at the same time and not really have to worry about this course.",
    "This course uses a lot of EENG 200 and 202 knowledge and builds up on them. Really interesting, not too much work. The final 2 labs were super cool",
    "good introductory course to frequency domain circuit analysis",
    "Straightforward course that teaches the mathematical tools (transnfer functions, Laplace Transforms, Fourier Transforms) you need to do circuit analysis, but not the most engaging beyond that. Labs don't take too much time, fortunately, and you get the opportunity to learn to use Digilent, which is pretty cool.",
    "You'll only be taking this if you have to. You're in a tiny classroom up in Becton with your ~10 EE cohorts. It's taught pretty well, but the material kind of sucks no matter what, so the best advice is to start your problem sets early (even though they're very short) and go to office hours. The labs can be a drag, but you get good at banging them out and the last two are fun.",
    "EENG 203 is a great introduction to systems design. It covers many frequency analysis concepts involving RLC circuits as well as more complex analysis techniques such as Laplace and Fourier transforms in a very clear and useful manor. Professor Xia is a great instructor, and I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in an in-depth introduction to circuit design.",
    "Fast paced and detailed overview of important topics in Electrical Engineering. High variability in time for problem sets (2 to 10 hours). Labs were reasonable, especially enjoyed the last 2 hands-on ones (Radio and Motor Controller).",
    "Capstone introductory course for EE. Need to take it or the major"
