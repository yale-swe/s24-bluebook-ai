   "comments": [
    "Knowledge about ww2 in france diversity of the francophone world Speaking and writing",
    "Organizational skills",
    "This course greatly improved my ability to read French and to understand spoken French. There was a huge emphasis in this course on comprehension of complicated topics in French, which resulted in my skills in the language improving.",
    "More grammar, more vocab. Definitely improved my listening and reading abilities.",
    "I can communicate all of my ideas in French that I want to after having taken this class. French L4 with Mme Ruth was one of the best experiences I've ever had at Yale because coming to class is simultaneously a fun and exciting experience while being one of the most informative 50 minutes of your day.",
    "I learned much about French culture, grammar, and a lot of vocabulary. Specifically, the unit Diversit was amazing because we gained insight into the struggles faced in many different cultures.",
    "Large-scale review of French grammar, then delving into a large amount of idiomatic expressions and lingual tendencies. My writing in French greatly improved over the course of the semester, and I feel much more confident in my ability to tackle real-life French language situations. Also explored French and Francophone literature and cultures as well as French history, with a focus on World War II in the latter case.",
    "French! Grammar is tough but I feel like L4 grammar is less \"picky\" than L3 grammar. The vocab you learn is much more useful for everyday life as well as the compositions. I feel more comfortable speaking French now, and my ability to understand it is even better--I feel at ease watching the news without subtitles, although movies are a bit harder.",
    "This course was a great continuation of the French program at Yale. I further developed my French grammar skills, reading level, and speaking abilities.",
    "I greatly improved my French this semester. Through presentations and more class discussion, my speaking and listening skills improved. I can now watch French movies without subtitles!",
    "I gained skills in speaking and reading french, in addition to basic grammar.",
    "A much better understanding of the french grammar, a better grasp of speaking skills, and better study habits"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is a ton of work, but you get a lot out of it if you put in the time and effort.",
    "Weakness: very old movies. I wish we had more contemporary french moviesor documentaries to watch.",
    "The course balances class verbal and written participation well.",
    "The novel at the end is a bit overkill.",
    "I think the French department at Yale is very strong and has a great set of courses that build a strong foundation for students in the language. The significant amount of reading and listening exercises definitely helped my French improve rapidly. I think more speaking exercises might be helpful, however.",
    "Heavy workload, but not as bad as 130. Probably a better level, kept me busy and in touch with the material but took up less time.",
    "Strengths are that there are lesser audio exercises than in L3. Weakness is that there still are a few that feel didactic and unhelpful. Tests are very well designed and if you know your French, you should be able to score very well.",
    "STRENGTHS: teaching style (madame koizim), combined audio + grammar helps a lot, revision before the final, engaging subject matter WEAKNESSES: la symphonie pastorale was boring",
    "I often felt that the course went too slowly on the teaching of some topics and made up for it by obligating the students to do \"busywork\" (i.e. banal exercises and worksheets); however, as I am not a foreign language teacher, it is possible that this could be an integral part of the experience in order to ensure concept reinforcement. When viewed in aggregate, however, the difference in my French language ability from last semester to this one is quite evident, and I greatly appreciate the amount of work I did in order to retain the course material.",
    "Strengths: The amount of basic French literature as well as exposure to French movies and \"Francophonie.\" Speaking is much easier. Weaknesses: The focus on grammar is good for some people, but it is still viewed as the prime way to learn a language, and it can be really difficult for those who do not have previous grammar exposure. That being said, it's DEFINITELY NOT impossible. Just pay attention.",
    "This course had many strengths. Koizim was a great instructor, and her energy and passion for the material made the class very enjoyable. The material was very easy to follow and the books were interesting. The only weakness, in my opinion, was that the class was on the larger side, so we didn't get as much of a chance to practice our speaking abilities as we would have in a smaller class.",
    "A strength of this course is the fact that students are encouraged to use critical thinking to engage with the material. Rather than just learning the language, we talked about social issues and history in french. I loved this class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes: foundation for apeaking well",
    "Yes, but it is very difficult",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is serious about learning another language and is willing to put in the time. I think this course would be particularly helpful for someone interested in literature (and who wants to be able to read French literature without translation) because of the heavy reading assignments.",
    "I definitely haven't mastered French after 140, but I'm much better. It's a good learning experience. Not easy, but not too difficult.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are taking it for your language credit OR if you have a burning desire to learn\/practical reason for learning French. As previously said, the course is undeniably effective.",
    "I would, if you are serious about speaking French proficiently. L3 is good, but L4 solidifies your French speaking and comprehension skills in a way that L3 does not. Be prepared to keep up with homework and tests. The tests are somewhat challenging, but if you study they're perfectly fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The course material and the instructor were great.",
    "If you want to gain proficiency in French while also learning about intellectually stimulating topics, I would highly recommend this course. Take it with Ruth Koizim!",
    "Yes--it's hard, but worth it if you want to learn french"
