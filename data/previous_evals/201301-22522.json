   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to explore digital animation! The material is fun and no prior experience is necessary.",
    "Definitely a great class to take! No computer experience necessary and a basic knowledge of math (high school level) is required. It's a bummer though that there aren't any follow up classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if you're interested in computer graphics and animation. The course begins with an introduction to computer graphics (color, image processing, lighting, texturing) and moves in to object modelling and animation. For the final project, you create a 30 second animated film. Maya, the software used in the course, is a lot of fun to work with. The lectures are interesting but--at times--can be dry. Likewise, assignments are fun to work on but--at times--can be tedious and frustrating. Ultimately, if you're interested in the material, definitely take the course!",
    "A good intro to animation, digital imaging, etc...not too technical but not an easy A either. There is a ton of help on problem sets (Patrick, the TA, will totally make sure you know what you're doing even if you know nothing) and everybody who goes to office hours (which is most of the class) does really well on psets. The quizzes are pretty hard and should be called a midterm and a final. Overall, if you don't understand the material too well you'll still do well enough on the project and psets to get a B+\/A-. Enjoy the final project! Applying everything you've learned is actually kind of a blast and the final product is something you'll watch over and over again and be like...\"I made this. Go me.\" Take the class if you want a QR or just a cool new skill.",
    "Computer Science 079 is basically an introductory course about graphics. You get to model and animate objects you create. I would definitely recommend this course because it is so fun to work with the Maya software. I'm not much of an artist but I was really proud of my final project.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I was exposed to a lot of things I never would have even thought about otherwise.",
    "You'll walk away from the course experienced with computer modeling and animation through Autodesk Maya, which is some of the most sophisticated (and sometimes hard to deal with) software out there. Look up some Maya tutorials on YouTube (how to make a soda can, how to model a strawberry, how to model a human torso with moving joints) to see if this is the kind of work you think you'd enjoy putting a few hours into each week.The material in the course, what you have to study for and do homework on, will probably be more interesting to you if you're into math and computer science, but don't let it deter you if you're not since it's not altogether too difficult anyway. Do it for the fun of making videos and being as much of an artist as you want to be!Finally, yes, it's not the most social of freshman seminars. You are not required to talk to anyone else in the class so if you stick to yourself you won't meet anyone. If you want to make friends in the class, though, then just talk to your neighbors! Everyone is dealing with the same problems and homework in the class, so it's easy to find common ground and make friends.",
    "Not much of a seminar but a really small lecture once a week with labs the other meeting of the week. Learned basic elementary Pixar kind of things. Final project is an animation.",
    "In this seminar, you will learn many new applicable skills, and even learn how to make your own animation!"
