    "Great class! Wang Laoshi is so kind and brilliant and she makes the class fun. It was a lot of work though-- be prepared to spend 1-2 hours on homework everyday, and maybe more on the weekends. But you definitely get what you put in to it. I'm surprised at how much my chinese has improved because of this class. I ended up becoming fairly close to all my classmates and getting lunch with them outside of class, as is expected in a 8 person class that meets everyday."
