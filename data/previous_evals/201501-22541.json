    "A very unique course - shop it and see what you think. The ideas can seem very strange and cryptic at first - in particular, you'll realize that many of the ideas are difficult to convey in English - but by the end of the semester, I found that many of the texts really resonated with me and broadened my perspective on a lot of issues. Reasonable workload.",
    "Solid course that will teach you a lot about Eastern Philosophy. Take it if that's what you're into.",
    "It's a very, very broad overview. If you have little experience in the area, but are interested in expanding your knowledge of philosophy, it could be a good class for you. Workload is on the less demanding side, especially for a philosophy course. Unfortunately, it wasn't very well taught my year.",
    "The class is a good exposure to some classic texts in the Eastern tradition of philosophy. Since the subject is such a broad one (we touch on different strains of Brahmanism, Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism), the readings can feel a bit scattered, and it can sometimes feel like we're not pausing long enough to get a really clear sense of what's going on in any individual area, but this is a bit inevitable considering it's (as far as I know) the only class in the philosophy department that touches on the Eastern tradition at all. The work is light, and the lectures can be a bit confusing sometimes but are overall pitched in a way that's engaging and not overly abstract. The focus, unlike in other philosophy classes, is not so much on arguing as it is on trying to understand what the authors are saying and why their context might have led them to say it."
