   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to anyone seriously interested in taking a Japanese literature course where you read the works in the original. This was the only course I noticed for the semester, and although some of the readings aren't the most compelling, I think it's a good choice.",
    "I recommend this course to a student interested in discussing modern and contemporary Japanese novels, generally chosen from beyond the best-known selections. Students who enroll should be prepared to participate in discussion, as the class is set-up to run based on what the students contribute.",
    "This seminar does not attempt to cover canonical works of postwar Japanese fiction and instead expects that students are already familiar with such works. Instead, it introduces less well-known contemporary authors or less well-known works by well-established authors.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course, and summarize it as a demanding reverse chronological journey through a variety of Japanese texts from the present day to the immediate postwar, including several works of criticism."

   "comments": [
    "Through this class I feel like I was able to sort of peek into a profession that I had already decided to not pursue, but the experience was useful nonetheless. I really appreciated how frank Professor Treat was in his commentary on scholarship and what it means to be studying Japanese literature in institutions that are still largely dominated by the West. I was able to see his personal biases, for instance when he was really sympathetic with discussions about how Japan has no sense of the 'transcendental' (which I remain suspicious of as a claim still), but I think Professor Treat was also pretty open minded to ways of exploring Japanese literature.",
    "This course introduced me to several authors with whom I was not previously familiar, and class discussion brought up important issues concerning the postwar period which will help me frame my own research in the future.",
    "This course gave me exposure to various postwar texts with which I would not have otherwise engaged, and therefore forced me to confront issues and problems in postwar Japanese literature that I had not considered."
