   "comments": [
    "Reading a whole music theory journal a week gives an insight into the politics of publishing, musicology, theory and academia in general. It also increases one's ability to read critically: to question the statements made while also discovering the motivation behind these statements. It teaches how to interact with footnotes and what implications citing has in general. Simultaneously the course also addresses a broader musico-theoretical or analytical skill.",
    "It was great surveying the recent writings in the field of music theory.",
    "At the outset, I should clarify that these comments are from the point-of-view of a Theory student. The largest takeaway from this class, for me, is a snapshot of the field of music theory at a particular point in time. Each week, we read an entire issue of a different journal in the field of music theory. By reading an issue of essentially every major English-language journal, I not only have an impression of the current state of music-theory scholarship, but also an impression of the different approaches of the journals, their editorial perspectives, typical content, and so on."

   "comments": [
    "The strength is its breadth and how that increases one's awareness of the field of music theory ing general.",
    "The course was very well organized and structured. I enjoyed the special assignments and the singing sessions.",
    "As a theory student, I found that the \"survey\" model of this course gave me an incredibly useful heuristic for the current state of the field. I believe this might have been a strategic move on the part of the professor. By radically orienting this course to the present, the class avoided traditional (and increasingly less relevant) discussions of Schenker, set theory, and positivist music theory (what, ironically, one could call \"Yale-style\" music theory) that are usually found in surveys of the field. Dr. Harrison reminded us time and again that the discipline of music theory is not a \"thing\" but rather an accumulation of the work of individuals, a point that is very well-taken. However, for non-theory students, or students who had not taken graduate or upper-level undergraduate courses in music theory (which I believe was about half of the class) I would imagine that this approach might have engendered some confusion. By reading only the newest work, I think that students without a strong background in theory miss out on a sense of either the context or motivation for some of the articles, leaving the nature of the discpline a little bit opaque, despite the wide survey. Personally, I think the class might have been improved by occasionally having assignments where, instead of reading whole issues of journals, we would read and discuss a handful of \"canonic\" articles, in order to gain a sense of the history and historical \"problems\" of music theory. I understand that the class sessions were partitioned in two, and that some of the \"canon\" of the field was covered in the first, lecture-style half of class meetings. However, many of these lectures did not engage with the field itself, but rather with meta-theoretical issues (which was incredibly helpful, and not a problem in itself!), which left very little time for non-theorists to ask questions or get inside the historical \"core\" of the field. Additionally, the volume of reading (some of it highly technical) meant that articles were rarely discussed in depth, since student discussants had to try and cover 4-6 articles in a 50-minute span. It felt at times like the class was rushing to see everything there is to see in the contemporary state of the field. I would have liked to see this balanced by some weeks where we relaxed into some larger trends and important sub-disciplines."

    "I highly recommend the course to anyone who is going to be involved with music theory and analysis in an academic setting.",
    "Certainly a helpful course for those entering the field of music theory.",
    "With the understanding that this is a required course for all Department students, I would nevertheless recommend it to all of them, even the non-theorists. Despite my above criticism, the approach of the class did essentially put theorists and non-theorists on a level playing field when it came to class participation, which was an excellent feature of the class\/professor."
