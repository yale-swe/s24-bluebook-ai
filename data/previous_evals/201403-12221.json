    "TAKE ANY COURSE WITH PROF LEVENE. She's incredible. Brilliant, nice, warm, you name it. The only thing i'll say is that her grading is somewhat harsh and that you should look at how she calculates grades. Be ready to get the grades you deserve...not some inflated version of what you deserve. Take this class for the incredible readings and for the incredible professor. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a class that focuses on reading a small amount of texts very closely. If you really want to dig your teeth into one author and start to get a real grasp of his thoughts then you should definitely take this class. Levene is incredible. However, how much you will get out of the class really depends on how much you prepare for discussions before hand.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to improve their writing, has a specific interest in the material being taught, and who does noting a slightly heavy workload in terms of the reading.",
    "This was one of the most productive courses I've ever taken. The texts worked together beautifully both because they engaged the pressing questions of the course (What\/where is the origin of the self-conscious subject? When\/where does guilt emerge? What is a sovereign will and how does it relate to freedom? and several others) and because they shed a brighter light on the tradition in which Nietzsche moved. The biggest strength of the course was Prof. Levene's teaching style. She took great care to 1) have everyone speak, 2) have everyone clarify their points, connect them to what others said, and thus advance the discussion, 3) have everyone stay close to the text, 4) keep us focused on the overarching questions by developing schemas on the board of what we had said as the discussion progressed. Prof. Levene also deeply cared about the questions and texts we were discussing, and that care really carried over during class. She managed what only stellar instructors can do: she helped us find access to and delve into difficult texts without dumbing them down. Instead, she opened them to us in all their richness. Absolutely take this class. If you care about engaging with a text in a deep, meaningful fashion, you can't go wrong with this one.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class! I learned a lot and found the discussions very compelling. I would encourage people to take the class Credit\/D because, while I think the class is really rewarding, I think that it is very hard to to well given that there are only two grades for the whole course."
