    "This class is a lot of information, starting from the 2nd semester of pchem and then going really in depth in to perturbation theory, spectroscopy, and NMR. Take it if you want to put in a lot of work on the problem sets. It's also super early in the morning, which is much more difficult than you would think.",
    "A lot of work, but worth it. You will come out of this class understanding spectroscopy more than anything else, but you will also be familiar with a lot of the quantum mechanics required for any sort of real-world application.",
    "MolRad is a unique applied, problems-based quantum mechanics and spectroscopy course. It quickly goes over highlights of basic p-chem quantum, but its most important aspects are in symmetry problems and spectroscopy, especially NMR. MolRad will teach you why we care about quantum mechanics (besides its beauty), and how to think about real quantum chemistry problems. Expect to spend a lot of time on problem sets and reading lectures outside of class. I'd recommend the course, especially for motivated undergraduates with a strong math background hoping to go into physical chemistry. If you're less interested in physical chemistry research methods, I'd recommend a more theoretical course than MolRad."
