   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in the region. Although it may help to have some knowledge of economics, I did not (save for intro micro\/macro) and I could still contribute to the discussion. Do keep in mind that class discussion is weighted heavily.",
    "Yes, it is a good class and the discussion in the classroom is very interesting every week.",
    "Yes, the workload is fair. It's three short papers; if you write a senior essay, your essay counts for 75% of the grade. The rest is participation. Thachil is willing to meet during his office hours, though you will need to sign up on Classes V2 beforehand in order to meet with him. Just plan ahead, try your best, and you should be fine.",
    "A truly excellent course. Professor Thachil is a deeply caring and gifted teacher who has put so much thought and effort into making this course superb. From the first day of class, it was obvious that Prof Thachil expected so much from his students, and he held us to a very high standard. He made me realize how intellectually rigorous and enjoyable the social science can be-- he scrutinized every comment, found the best in it, and showed us the logical twists of complex arguments. The course's strengths are many: - excellent class discussions, expertly led by Prof Thachil, that substantively engage reading then go beyond them. - papers to critically engage readings that were always fun - phenomenal readings (though some of the chapters and research articles seemed unduly focused on more minor details [defining poverty and some ISI readings come to mind-- perhaps trim from here) - great starts to class, in which Prof Thachil asks us to think about something new (ex., India's new digital ID system). Overall, this was a an excellent course, entirely because of a very dedicated professor.",
    "A good amount of reading weekly that is necessary to participate and it is very much expected that all of the reading was not only read but read closely. Three five page papers spread across the semester and that's it. Great class, great professor, and very interesting.",
    "A class with equal weight to the political, economic and social side of development with perhaps the most weight to political topics. Readings were heavy but interesting. Low workload generally but requires you to be alert during every class session. No background needed; you'll come away with a good sense of development in low income countries generally, not just South Asia.",
    "Wonderful class! Professor Thachil is great, and discussing issues in Indian development are fascinating. Reasonable workload as well.",
    "It was a great course that gave an in depth overview of the way that political scientists can think about the relationship between democracy and development in India and Pakistan. The professor only touched on poverty and women's rights in the last few weeks and I would have found it more interesting to introduce those topics earlier on and to spend more time discussing them. The course was also almost exclusively about India and Pakistan and it would have been nice to talk about more of the countries in Southeast Asia. Not too much work either and Tariq is a really fun and engaging professor! Discussion in seminar will never be dull.",
    "Take it. Don't think over this one. The class is titled Dev in South Asia, but while there is a south Asian focus, I think the class is more a discussion on comparative development. Irrespective of your background or what you hope to major in, you will gain something from this class. The prof is awesome and makes seminar totally worth your time - I wish the class met more often!"
