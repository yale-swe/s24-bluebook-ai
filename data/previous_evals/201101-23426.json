    "Grading can be harsh and arbitrary. Cr\/D recommended.",
    "You learn how to write profiles, kind of, but really just explore different ways to explore writing about things. That's a little vague, which was a shortcoming of the class, but I recommend it. Professor Zarin's a great resource.",
    "Very solid, but not exemplary.",
    "Be prepared to work hard in this class if you want to do well. It's a lot of writing, and the final profile, if you want to do a thorough and good job, requires a lot of planning. You start by writing about a natural object and work your way up to actually profiling a person in the conventional way. The assignments, on the whole, are inventive and fun.",
    "A fun workshop that revolves around essays submitted every two weeks or so. Prof Zarin is an excellent, creative mind; it is worth taking the class in order to get to know her."
