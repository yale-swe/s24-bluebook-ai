   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Of course this will be lab dependent, but any research experience will likely yield similar knowledge, skills, and insights. If you want to work in your own lab, go for it--the experience in this course is almost unaffected by the official course enrollment (aside from the assignments, which are fair and honestly satisfying to do). If you're already doing research, you may as well get credit (unless you want to get paid).",
    "I continued to develop as a scientist in the same lab I had been working in over the previous year. I had practice writing a formal lab report in a publishable format through the final paper.",
    "I learned a lot of new content and methods by starting out in a computational chemistry lab for the first time. By doing research for credit, I was able to afford spending more time with my mentor just learning about the field, and being forced to do write-ups gave me an incentive to dig into the literature to get a more solid foundation.",
    "How to conduct independent research. It was good practice on writing proposals, research reports, etc.",
    "I developed laboratory techniques involved in my research project. A lot of my time was spent on troubleshooting meaning that I got to really master individual techniques. Further, I was given opportunities to practice broader research skills, such as drafting a research proposal and a journal article-style final project report. Ultimately, I got a taste of what it is like to be a grad student or a professional researcher, because I got to take complete ownership of my project."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It seemed to me that my PI didn't fully understand the nature of the course and his role in evaluating me. However, this isn't his responsibilty to figure out, it's both mine and the instructor's responsibilty to explain. So perhaps more throrough information could be provided to the research supervisors?",
    "One of the strengths of this course is the freedom allowed to students to conduct their own research in labs they have chosen. I appreciated the hands-off approach the professors had. There was also great feedback given following submission of the research proposals that was helpful in guiding the course of our projects.",
    "I think it is the right amount of oversight\/requirements and freedom. It's good to have the proposal, final paper, and presentation as milestones in the course, but also nice to be able to take the project in any direction with the mentor and not have to check in with the course instructors very frequently. However, 10 hours\/week in lab was really a lot of time, and I don't think I can afford to do it again. This is probably partly because I was in a computational lab, but still it's more than I spent on other classes.",
    "There was poor guidance by the instructors in the beginning and throughout the course. When they offered feedback on the proposal they were quite harsh.",
    "It's very dependent on your PI, so find a good one."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to do research.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone majoring in MB&B. I have learned much more from working 10 hours in lab than I could in class. Plus, the majority of you are already working in a lab so might was well get a credit for it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any MB&B major. It is an excellent way to receive credit for lab work that many students would already be doing anyway.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to be able to work in a lab during the semester along with other classes. I think it's a good way to get more prolonged and more active exposure to research and a lab environment.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are trying to get into a new research field, because you can get credit for spending time in lab just learning, and the pressure to only be there to complete projects on your on time or for pay is not there.",
    "Only if you already have a extensive or strong research background. I did this with only 8 weeks of research experience under my belt and I suffered A LOT.",
    "If you're interested in learning how to actually conduct research, yes",
    "If you made it this far, you should take at least one semester of this. It's a great way to build your research skills & your resum. At the end of the semester, you will have a final project report, which is something tangible you can go back to when you're applying for grad schools \/ research jobs \/ etc. Having said that, it might be quite challenging if this is your first research experience (if so, you will want to make sure that you have a post-doc \/ older grad student \/ researcher who can help you). This project is entirely in your hands, so be ready to take the responsibility and have fun! It does suck not getting paid for your work though, so you should really try to work no more than 10 hours a week. It's really easy to fall into working much more than that, but your time matters! The course requires 10 hours a week, so try to stick to that when you design your research project. Also, you have to stay very organized and constantly think about the next steps, because it is really easy to lose momentum and you have limited time. Your PI can make or break this course! Choose wisely."
