    "I learned about phonetics and etymology.",
    "I developed a detailed knowledge about historical linguistics of Spanish and its varieties. I learned Medieval Spanish phonology and its modern counterparts. I learned about dialectology and examined some of the most representative Spanish variations, both in its phonological and historical details.",
    "I gained an understanding of the evolution of the Spanish language, from its origins in Latin and other languages, to its evolution from medieval Spanish to its modern form. I also learned how the phonetic identifying characteristics of the different dialects of the language.",
    "Taking Professor Martns History of the Spanish Language class enabled me to acquire comprehensive, intertextual and interdisciplinary knowledge and understanding about the Spanish language and its linguistic and cultural implications."

   "comments": [
    "The class was interesting. I wish that there had been an alternative that focused on the history of Portuguese for the students who are more interested in that area. I also think that students who have already taken etymology\/linguistics should be able to waive the course. Personally, as one of the only students in the class who had never taken linguistics before, I found it really challenging to be introduced to this field in a classroom where everyone else seemed to have a grasp of material that for me was really complicated.",
    "The main strength of this course is the high proficiency that I acquired on historical linguistics. As it is usual in this field, the course expounded the history of Iberia and its correlate language change, while the American varieties of Spanish were studied for a briefer period of time. This had the advantage of analyzing some Medieval language changes that help explain more recent ones. I learned how to use many invaluable tools for historical linguistics, both online and in print. Given the eminently technical character of the material covered, the acquirement of proficiency oftentimes came from overlapping the assignments' topics and also from a multiplication of assignments. In this way, the proper jargon was indelibly acquired, as well as the most relevant historical events of the studied periods. The course was composed of lectures and mnemonic techniques, such as commenting homework or taking frequent quizzes.",
    "I think one of the strengths of the course was the variety of the kinds of projects (group work, individual). I think the course could be improved by perhaps synthesizing some of the projects so there would be fewer, but more in depth.",
    "The semester-wide engagement with diverse texts and media, such as David A. Pharies linguistics textbook and the video recordings of distinct types of the spoken Spanish language, enabled a truly empirical and comprehensive experimentation of this language."

   "comments": [
    "It's mandatory.",
    "Yes. If a student wishes to have a thorough introduction to both Spanish phonology and language change, this course is perfect.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student interested in philology and the evolution of the Spanish student, but would not advise it to undergraduates because I think it requires more prior knowledge.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues, since they would be able to acquire multifaceted, interdisciplinary and intercultural understanding about the Spanish language."
