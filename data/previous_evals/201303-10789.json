   "comments": [
    "Take it cuz it's a generally good class and is required for more literary analysis type classes. Expect to work hard though.",
    "A really slow easy class that will maintain (but probably not improve) your Chinese level, with the bonus of Zhou laoshi being the nicest person ever. It's still a fair amount of work even though its just 3 days a week now, but the tests are very straightforward and Zhou laoshi makes the class really nice. The pace is pretty slow and class can get incredibly repetitive though, it got a little bit boring.",
    "CHNS154 is a great course. I enjoyed coming to class every day, and I thought it was a fairly comprehensive combination of grammar and discussion, though I think the class could have included a few more opportunities for speaking and practicing oral skills. I also think the class was among the more lax Chinese courses I have ever taken, which can be both good and bad: on the one hand, students aren't really punished if they have a bad week and aren't able to study as much as they would like, but on the other, students have to be extremely self-motivated in order to reap the full benefit of the class.Also, I think the readings we do could be a bit more advanced, as a lot of the vocabulary overlapped with vocabulary we had learned before. If this class placed an emphasis just on reading newspaper articles or other forms of advanced shumianyu writing, we would have learned the most. Currently, students returning from summers abroad in China will find the class too easy to be intellectually stimulating.",
    "Yes, its a great class. There is definitely a lot of busy-work and depending on how much people you have, you might not get to speak a lot, but the topics are very interesting and Zhou Laoshi is the best.",
    "This is a great class to take if you have spent some time in China and want to develop a more formalized vocabulary. Not that much work, and a great professor.",
    "This is a typical Chinese class at Yale, but there is a LOT of work. Even though the class only meets 3 times a week, there was more work than previous Chinese classes I've taken at Yale. If you're looking to continue with Chinese, I would still recommend the class. You'll learn many new characters and grammar structures, and Zhou Laoshi is sooo nice!",
    "I would say this is a great class because its not as difficult as the intro Chinese classes because you already have a good foundation and it is based on discussion and understanding new and interesting topics in Chinese society.",
    "Yes, fairly easy class and Zhou laoshi is great. The way that the material is taught becomes a bit monotonous and the curriculum used some of the same chapters studied in the HBA summer program, which is frustrating. Regardless you'll need to take this class to get to the higher level electives.",
    "Chinese 154 is frustrating because most of the students are sort of burnt out with Chinese and don't want to put that much effort into the class, but at the same time get frustrated seeing that their Chinese isn't really improving. I took this class to maintain my Chinese with the understanding that I probably wouldn't make huge strides in the language, and I think I achieved that goal. Zhou laoshi is really nice and supportive, but the class was sort of uninspiring overall.",
    "This course is very similar to other classes I have taken in Chinese, so that it might not be one of the most engaging ways of approaching the language. The format is basically the same as in Chinese 150\/151, which means that there is a main text which is supposed to be read before class, and the vocabulary associated with it that has to be memorized. There are daily tests that focus mainly on dictation and character writing. Other than that, there also are few oral presentations, including skits. The workload is probably not as heavy as third-year Chinese, so one probably spends less time with homework. I personally think the homework assignments from the textbook were on the more tedious side, but the compositions were rather interesting. I would recommend this course for those who want to keep up with their Chinese, but next semester I am hoping to take something different."
