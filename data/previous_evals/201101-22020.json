    "well u have to take this cuz it's required but anyway it's a good class. difficult HW. difficult exams. be ready!",
    "Pretty standard E&M course. A lot of the material was review from previous physics classes, but it is information that every physics major probably needs to know. Material-wise, E&M is a lot less interesting than other courses like quantum or stat mech. Professor Werner was a nice guy, though, and the problem sets and exams were not unreasonable.",
    "The lectures are 95% directly from Griffiths. Fortunately, Griffiths is a good book. The problem sets can be a little tricky, especially if your TA is not helpful. Overall, not that much work though.",
    "Taught. Directly. From. The. Book.No point in going to lecture, really. It's all in Griffiths, even the examples he does in class. All the problems on the problem sets? From Griffiths. The questions from the midterm and final? Also just problems from Griffiths. Because of this, everything was easy to prepare for. Just read the book!",
    "Do you like Electromagnetism? This class was honestly a little boring, but you should know what you are getting into by this point.",
    "Standard course on electromagnetism. The textbook (Griffiths) is very good."
