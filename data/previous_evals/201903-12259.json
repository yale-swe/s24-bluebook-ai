    "I learned how to read in a manner that wasnt just superficial, to gain understanding that extends beyond the actions of the play.",
    "Well, it was a strange semester since Professor Bloom passed away halfway through, which was really very unfortunate and tragic. Fortunately though, Professor Kastan stepped in with aplomb and he's a gem. I just wish it wasn't in such unfortunate circumstances."

    "I thought it was great! It would be nice if 100% of your grade wasn't riding on the final paper though.",
    "An obvious strength was how seamlessly Professor took over from Professor Bloom, and made the best of a terrible situation to continue to make the course engaging and fulfilling. It feels irrelevant to comment on weaknesses as any issues were fairly unique to this one situation and unavoidable.",
    "I thought it was difficult to discuss and gain a deep understanding of the plays when there were two or even 3 a week.",
    "The passing of Professor Bloom halfway through was unfortunate."

    "Yes! Professor David Kastan took over the course and breathed new life into it. It was superb! I learned so much about the plays we covered.",
    "Yes, take any class you can with Professsor Kastan. His understanding of Shakespeare is unparalleled and yet he remains approachable and accessible if you need feedback or support.",
    "I would recommend it as long as they had an appreciation for Shakespeareits fun when you like reading his plays and discussing them.",
    "Yes."
