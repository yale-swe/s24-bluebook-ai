   "comments": [
    "This is a really interesting class. There's a lot of reading and grading can be harsh, but it's definitely worth it. I've learned a lot from this course and would definitely take it again.",
    "Yes. Take it!!! Great class and a fun time. Very relaxed and I learned a lot about the criminal justice system.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class especially if you are interested in the topics (as identified by the title). It's a solid course that will throw a lot of interesting information at you but in a good way.",
    "A little confusing- not sure what the focus of the course was.Interesting material- a few weeks on identity theory, then the rest of the course focused on race and the criminal justice system.Motto was genuinely caring.",
    "A great class on the criminal justice system, with extensive focus on identity and race relations in the process (predominantly African-American).",
    "If you are interested in how Identity relates to crime then this is a good class to take. There is not as much focus on justice (so far as in what happens after the criminals are in the system) so the name is a bit misleading, but all in all it is a good course.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in Criminology, race and America, and\/or the prison system.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in dabbling in a variety of subjects related to identity, communities and policing. I enjoyed the comparative aspect of the course--looking at the issues in both the United States and the United Kingdom helped me gain a better understanding of some of each country's strengths and weaknesses related to policing and identity and communities. Some of the readings are a bit dense--makesure you leave lots of time to understand the technical terms in them, because they will come up in class.",
    "This seminar was great. The readings are very interesting. I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in sociology, criminology, or race relations. The reading is kind of heavy, but its not too difficult to finish in time and be prepared for discussion.",
    "YES! Terrific class! A bit difficult, but worth the work. Michael will really challenge you with your ideas both on papers and in class discussion, but if you are prepared for it, go for it.",
    "Yes definitely take it! It's an amazing class.",
    "This is a course focusing on the who of crime--the criminals and all the things that play into defining them--and then even twisting into who decides who or what is crime. You have to lead a discussion section, and write some papers, which can be quite fun and interesting if you choose a week which has subject matter that really interests you. Discussions tend to get a bit philosophical as the subject matter tends to prompt more big picture thinking as the session goes on, and abstract ideas come to light after the more practical discussion opens up new avenues of thought. I would recommend this to anyone after an introductory criminology course, since it is sort of helpful to be able to place this course in context, but this could also be the first So credit. Sociology tends to loop around in content and authors, so even if a student has never taken an So, this should not be too intimidating, although this does make at times tedious reading when similar material gets reiterated by multiple authors."
