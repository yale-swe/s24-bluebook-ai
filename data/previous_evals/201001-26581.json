   "comments": [
    "Adequate.",
    "The course was well sequenced.",
    "In a simple answer, YES.",
    "I wish the urban issues addressed in the course were addressed prior to the 4th semester urban design studio.",
    "It is important that this course comes after Theory I. There were many concepts that overlap from the first semester. The students who took this course before Theory I were not able to contribute to the conversation as much as those who did.",
    "It did.",
    "It occurred properly.",
    "I think this course is very helpful and crucial in the curriculum. As a general introduction to modern and contemporary theories, this course did a good job and is also capable to touch on several issues in depth.",
    "Yes, it did.",
    "This course occurred within proper sequence.",
    "This course might be a fundamental course to be a Yale graduate. Throughout the semester, this course showed me the role and intentions of Post-Modern, which Yale deeply was involved.",
    "Yes.",
    "I don't think this should be a required class. The fact that it is required I would assume limits the range of texts that can be covered, because critical texts of the past must be included (even if they are becoming more and more irrelevant to this generation)",
    "I think this course would be better positioned in the second semester of the first year. It feels a little late to have the first contemporary theory class in the fourth semester.",
    "yes.",
    "for the MED program, this course is well positioned in between the two years of research",
    "I am a Post-Professional Student, and during my undergraduate education I had already taken Theory for three academic years. In the beginning I felt that the course would be a repetitive experience without a lot of new information to offer, but I found the seminar extremely engaging and revealing in its academic intent. The possibility to engage in a disciplinary theoretical discussion with my classmates has been an essential part of my Yale education thus far.",
    "Hard for me to say, took it out of sequence.",
    "Yes, this required course follows the Arch Theory 1 class from the previous semester.",
    "Yes, I believe it happened in the proper sequence.",
    "This course certainly occurred within the proper sequence.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes, it was great.",
    "it might be useful to start the theory sequence immediately after eisenman's class in the spring of the first year. that means this class would be in the fall of the second year, allowing classes such as petits and eisenmans seminars to occur after the theory sequence.",
    "I do not think this course should occur as a requirement within the School's educational program. The course does not teach an objective, academic subject. What it essentially is, is an inculcation into the deconstructivist philosophy. While I believe that being immersed in a subject can be beneficial, the lack of any critical evaluation or discussion of the subject will turn the course into a cult. Religion for religion's sake should not be taught in a secular university and I believe this course reflects badly on the apparently heterogeneous philosophy of the school.",
    "I found the architectural theory courses much more instructive and significantly better organized than the modern history and the history of urban planning courses in the first year. I think I would have benefited from taking the theory courses in the first year. I see theory as being an integral part of my studio development, and I found that aspect really lacking in my first year at Yale.",
    "It would have been nice to have this course in the first year.",
    "Yes, although I did take the course one year earlier.",
    "If a larger amount of students are registered to take the course (i.e. if first years decide to take the course in place of something else), then the school should pay Ariane to teach more small sections. There should be no more than 12-15 students in a section."

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "I found it really tough that so many of the lectures were rescheduled to times that conflicted with other classes I was taking.",
    "The courses division by lecturer and topic was mostly effective for me, and I was glad to hear a variety of speaking styles and ideas. The different guests embodied one of the classes main lessons, that different ideas are bound to different people and schools.This diversity also had its downsides, as it might have been nice to develop a more consistent or continuous narrative across lecture weeks. Also,to be honest,some of the lecturers were less impressive or well-spoken than others, and those weeks were always a disappointment. It seemed that some of the out-of-town visitors were not entirely aware of the course's lineage and spoke primarily and what it was that interested them (at the deficit of the curriculum in which we'd all been developing).The syllabus was great, the readings were interesting, and assignments were pleasant and minimal. I liked Ariane's organization by scale as the weeks passed.",
    "The only adjustment I might make is to put Alan's lecture in the first week, as it summarizes and frames well much of the discourse in the first half of the semester (Ariane also acknowledged that this might be worthwhile).Also, it would help to put some excerpts from Kwinter's \"Architectures of Time\" onto the required list, perhaps in the first week or the last. Broadly, the way in which he describes the transformation of time from a linear absolute to an immersive field seemed to background much of the seminar's discussion as it related to politics, urbanism, rheotric etc.The syllabus and assignments are both fine.Even for a short, 10-page paper, it would be good to introduce an extra benchmark, even before midterm. Writing and research unfortunately often gets pushed to last on the list, in the face of studio.",
    "As my first thorough theory course, I really appreciated the guest lectures and wide variety. I felt it was a solid survey of the seminal texts in 20th century theory. Great job.",
    "There were several lectures that were rescheduled for times when I had another class. I was unable to attend these lectures and I feel like I missed something from the course. The lectures that did happen at the assigned class time seemed disconnected and often unrelated to the readings assigned for the week. The short weekly responses were not unmanageable, however being held responsible for understanding and commenting on all the readings for the week is difficult. It would be nice to focus on one reading that could really be understood rather than trying to know just a little about everything.",
    "The readings for each week seem to have many articles outsid of architecture. It would have been more interesting and have more students invovled in the discussion if the articles focused more on architecture.",
    "Everything was good. Especially, requirement of posting comment was good opportunity to communicate with others.",
    "The syllabus is very clear and we keep everything on schedule and they all went very well. Readings for most of the seminars are very good and conveys a lot of information. Very diverse discussions are generated and I learned a lot from both Ariane and fellow students.",
    "A broad overview of theory today, it was very enlightening. But it did bother me that all too often, various readings were presented as academic papers and then re-assessed as power-generators. ''Wigley's paper may not make much sense, but it sure has gotten him a lot of fame.'' Maybe I'm naive, but I do not think that that's adequate justification for a piece being in an academic course. But this problem seems pandemic, so maybe that is just the nature of too many theoreticians.",
    "I really appreciate Ariane coordinated many lectures presented by many professors from other institutions. They were all eye-opening and enjoyable.",
    "The only thing concerning about the course was that it seemed to be geared almost entirely toward the Eisenman \"school,\" and those associated (largely current and ex-Ohio State professors) and opposing pedagogies were often not presented or written off as irrelevant. Surprising that VSBA, Tschumi, etc from postmodern theory were barely touched on.",
    "The selection of reading material was a bit disappointing; while it is interesting reading, the assemblage of texts amounts to a limited\/limiting theoretical reading, and one that is very apparently biased to the history of Yale. The last readings were more eye opening and more pertinent to the questions the current generation is facing. It also seemed to be of particular interest to the professor, and would have made for more beneficial discussion.",
    "The lectures were a bit erratic and could have benefited from so overview lectures by Ariane or Marta, just to wrap things up. Otherwise it was interesting to have the lectures from outsiders they just need to be put in to perspective better.",
    "The use of 'primary source' lectures was extremely exciting. The reading response forum was very productive and helped make sure that everyone had a voice in the discussion the next day. The mood in discussions was very good and produced wide-ranging discussion from multiple students.The readings were great as well - wide ranging, but topical.",
    "Three main components of the class were reading, written responses, lectures, presentation of reading, discussion, and final research.This wide range of assignments and seminar discussions of works on contemporary architectural theory is a very challenging material to comprehend. The lectures following the reading assignments always helped to sum up the reading and usually presented the main ideas of the reading in a very clear form. Often they were delivered by the authors of the written works.Discussions sections that followed lectures gave us opportunity to present out own understanding and interpretation of the work and compare various opinions with the helpof our section leader.In all, I think that the structure of the course is very efficient.",
    "I found the syllabus very intensive and despite the fact that many of the readings are of a relatively high importance, I'd suggest the instructors to reduce it or to make it more selective. Since the course is a course on theory, I believe that details in the different formulation of architectural theories are more important than having a vague but overall picture. The papers, at the other hand, were organized in collaboration with instructor Peggy Deamer. I found the papers extremely challenging and in the process of making them I found them helpful to understand texts from the syllabus in relationship with my own thesis project, developing hence a subjective position on the matter. I found this process very positive",
    "The material presented by the syllabus of the course has been extremely diverse. In one hand, this has been a very good aspect of the class, as themes of an incredible variety have been debated and thought through. In the other hand, more concentration could have been placed on more serious parts of the recent theoretical discourse, but I imagine this to be one of the main difficulties of organizing a one-semester theory course: there is only so much time to discuss the incredibly wide spectrum of critical writing of the past four decades.The lecture series has been very interesting, as well. I think it is very important to have an active presence of lecturers in an academic theoretical context, as this allows for a more active debate.",
    "the weekly response were extremely productive and produced better discussions.",
    "Content was well suited for theory taking place after modernism.",
    "The sequence of material covers diverse discourses in theory, and yet builds on itself as the semester goes along. The organization of the material contributes to the ability to understand the many disparate theories presented.",
    "Great readings, well arranged.",
    "I thought the material was interesting and useful. I enjoyed all of the readings and discussions.",
    "The sequence of the course made sense.",
    "Although Ariane loves French thought, which is great material, I really think more American intellectual material would be better. Unless one understands the context of much of the material we read, it can be difficult to situate, and as students tend to have a bit more familiarity with their own history I believe more American intellects need to be represented.",
    "The reading assignments and the syllabus were really well developed and did focus on very interesting topics. However, the sequence and relationship between the different weeks was more difficult to grasp. There was not larger over arching focus which I think would help in tailoring the seminar more for the students.",
    "The implementation of online assignments has been very beneficial, especially when compared to Theory I, because that way everyone is persuaded to participate in the discussions in written or spoken form. The content of work was amazing, same as the mandatory readings and the recommended readings (which I hope to have the chance to read during the summer).",
    "the online forum for discussions is a great tool. Please keep using it. We should use it more often in other courses.",
    "a bit all over the place but the speakers were quite good. john mcmurrough was a great end to the class.",
    "I enjoyed the guest speakers. It was helpful to bring in experts on the various themes we discussed. The lectures were informative and mostly entertaining.However, discussions sessions were much much too short. It felt like we never had time to properly discuss the material. If certain students dominated the conversation, it sometimes felt like there was no time to discuss or reply. Presentation\/lectures should be an hour and discussion seminars should be the standard 1hr 50 minute class. The readings were so dense and so important. The lectures didn't really illuminate the readings so I looked to the sections for that but was often disappointed.",
    "The course attempted to cover a very large breadth of theoretical writings and inevitably ended up glossing over many of the topics and readings.",
    "I thought this semester's syllabus, even more so than last semester's, was very well organized as there was a very clear conceptual thread that tied all the lectures together, especially following spring break. I wish this had been true of the other required history and theory classes (mainly the modern architectural history and urban planning history classes).",
    "I didnt understand the sequence of material presented, but, then again, the material covered was so diverse i dont know how it would be organized.",
    "Everything was very well organized, the readings covered a wide range of topics, and I especially liked the reading responses on-line, which I thought encouraged students to think more closely about the assigned readings and participate in the discussion sections.",
    "Posting comments on V2 the night before class was extremely helpful. It gave us time to digest the readings and it encouraged us to engage in conversation with our classmates. I think this V2 system could be applied to Theory I."

   "comments": [
    "My knowledge of theory has grown but not in a very in-deptht way.",
    "I learned a lot during the course but would have appreciated some sort of greater narrative linking the weeks and their topics together or, in some instances, opposing them. If not a teleology or chronology, then maybe some sort of alternative map or something.",
    "I expected more of a discourse of history and built work since 1968. While there was a lot of this, there was more discussion on political and social motivations than I predicted (this is fine, and well interwoven with history and theory).It was difficult but refreshing to have readings more in the fields of politics, social theory, globalism etc. than in architecture itself.",
    "i was given an introduction to the more contemporary issues of architectural theory and i can safely say that i am all the better for it. credit to the course for its wide scope but focused attention on each of the topics in such detailed fashion. discussions during ariane's sections were very informative and enriching.however, since this course is for the whole level and is not a specialized class for theoretical discussion, one would ask that dicsussions during sections \/ seminars are at least kept to a level at which a beginner to theory can grasp and understand. that said, the level of discussion was very high and extrremely enriching, albeit incomprehensible to some of us who have only recently entered the world of theory.",
    "The course went pretty much as I expected. I felt the workload was bearable and the discussions were rich.",
    "I expected the course to be another mandatory hoop to jump through as I do not approach design with theory in mind. It ended up being more than instructional in forming a project for the urban design studio.",
    "I was hoping to get to more contemporary architecture rather than several weeks of Post-Modern Architecture.",
    "I expected to learn how to apply architectural theory which happened before to current architecture field. Since discussion and lecture tended to include present issue, my expectation was met well.",
    "This course is even better than I expected. Reading load is quite intense but manageable, lectures and seminars are also interesting and well organized.",
    "I did not expect to learn much, because I thought I had had a solid education in theory. I was definitely wrong. The course gave an amazing overview of architectural theory from 1968-present.",
    "I was hoping to be exposed to a larger range of theory; so the expectations were partly met.",
    "This course by it definition had to be selective about the material that it covered but in the end i think it did a good job. I think there could be a way to rethink the paper so that it isn't such a mad dash at the end. Maybe four 2-3 page position papers spaced out over the course of the semester that the students could get feed back on and then rework.",
    "As many courses in this school, this class was very new to me.In my previous education we didn't study contemporary architectural theory that thoroughly. If not for this course I wouldn't have got to know some of those important works.Thus, the course opened for me a very important part of architectural knowledge, which I had had less understanding of. Now I feel much more knowledgeable and professionally confident.",
    "My expectations for this course were to develop an understanding of current theoretical and ideological trends in architectural practice, as my previous academic exposure had been limited in regards to the context of recent disciplinary debate. I felt that themes from the current architectural discourse were constantly present and widely discussed throughout the course of the semester.",
    "I expected to learn about contemporary discourses in the field and how they were influenced by broader socio-political happenings. The course met and exceeded this expectation by presenting relevant texts written not only by architects but by leading thinkers from many other disciplines that influenced the overall architectural discourse.",
    "My expectations were to gain a better understanding of current architectural theory. They were met, and I am pleased that the course covered the place of architecture among and amidst other academic fields.",
    "My expectations for the course were that it would be a bit more organized than it was.",
    "I knew i was going to learn an enormous amount - Ariane is incredible.",
    "I had taken a theory course with Marta previously and this already set me to work hard from the very beginning, knowing that beyond writing the paper, the discussions were going to be very demanding.I feel I was able to produce the paper I wanted and also that my participation in the forums and verbal discussions had always being active and constant, meeting all requirements to pass the course in a satisfactory way.",
    "I am very pleased with this class. I liked very much how Ariane invited guest lecturers and I appreciate her bringing in readings from outside the discipline. The class actually exceeded my expectations. I learned a lot from the readings and I think it was extremely helpful that she required we post a response online, as it really forced the students to do the readings and come to class already with some thoughts in their head.",
    "The course fulfilled all my expectations. As I mentioned previously, it covered a whole variety of topics, as I expected, and exposed me to new ideas.",
    "I became much more familiar with contemporary architectural theory, but I still have a hard time keeping certain theorists and their ideas straight. Could the course develop some kind of cheat sheet? Emmanuel Petit did a great job in Theory I of giving cliff notes of important people\/ideas in his Power Point presentations. Maybe something similar could be done here?"

   "comments": [
    "For many students I think it was quite repetitive. It felt like the same discussions were happening week in and week out in section meetings.",
    "I read a lot and learned a lot. This was certainly a valuable experience.",
    "The course was very valuable to me. It filled in a lot of gaps in my familiarity with architectural theory, which until this semester was heavily biased to Modernism.What was missing, at least in this course, was sufficient discourse on the dramatic effects of digital design and fabrication on contemporary thinking. Greg Lynn was scheduled to lecture during finals week, but never did, which is a shame. Given the variety of incredible machinery right here in our own sub-basement, one week of class devoted to this subject would have been immensely helpful.The course was successful in undermining the aging model of the solitary creative genius designer. There was an emphasis on an architecture of flexibility and humility. The collaborative enterprise could have been discussed more as a model for today, one pulling together young talents from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines.There was a facet to this course that was disheartening. It did not leave me with the impression that any work of value is being produced today, which is not true. I also did not have the impression that the starchitect model was a positive or necessary one. There was little, if any, indication that architecture relying heavily on geometry, material treatment, or effect was a viable approach today, which it is. Designers with talent have leeway to attempt to make capricious and totalizing statements, independent of concerns about what audience their workserves. I do have a bit of an aftertaste of architectural theory as something which is as nagging and self-righteous as it is agile and anticipatory",
    "i was given an introduction to the more contemporary issues of architectural theory and i can safely say that i am all the better for it. credit to the course for its wide scope but focused attention on each of the topics in such detailed fashion. discussions during ariane's sections were very informative and enriching.",
    "While I very much enjoyed the class, I feel it should be an option course for M.Arch II students. As Post-Professionals opting to head back to school, it seems each student should be able to guide their own curriculum. That being said, I think the course was very valuable and would have taken it regardless. Arianne was a great professor and I feel like I learned a greatdeal that I would have missed had I not come back to school. I remain quite critical of most of the readings, but I suppose that is the point.",
    "I would have rather taken a seminar where I could focus on one historical architectural theory and not be expected to make connections on the course of all theories that I am unfamiliar with.",
    "From this class i have achieved more understanding architectural thoery which convinces me that it is a valuable course to take.",
    "Through many theories which basically happened in the past, I could reconsider current situation of architecture and some aspects for the future.",
    "This course is very valuable to me since I'm both interested and quite ignorant about contemporary architectural discourse. The readings lead to some further books and essays that I'll try to scrutinize in the near future. Ariane has always been a kind and intelligent professor and it is always nice to be in her seminar.",
    "To be honest, I disagree so much with the present architectural discourse that I do not know if many of these theories will help me design at all. But they have helped me understand the position of many architects--and even how many architects ascend to positions of power--which is useful in and of itself.",
    "This course is essential to understand the role ofmodern architecture and the position of architecture today. Even though I am not still sure, where architecture is shifting to, the course showed me the hints and taught the importance to foresee the movement of architecture discourse.",
    "High in value in familiarizing myself with one segment of contemporary theory.",
    "This course is very valuable both as it's own thing and as a supplement to studio courses.",
    "In my understanding, theoretical knowledge is extremely important for an architect, because it forms basis for his professional credo and enables one to advocate his point of view.The fact that I have now significantly extended knowledge of contemporary theory, will definitely strengthen my projects and make me a more powerful architect.",
    "I found the conversations with my classmates to be very informative, as I could clearly understand the way that the academic and professional community around me is developing, and the paths that it has chosen to follow. I am personally very interested in and dedicated to the agency of writing in architecture, which is something I want to develop in my future career as a professional architect, and the opportunity to write, under the instruction of a serious and well informed professor has been invaluable in this semester.",
    "The course is extremely valuable, whether the student pursues a trajectory that is more theoretical or practice-based. Having a base understanding of the evolution of the profession, and all of the outside forces that impact the contemporary discourse is necessary to formulate a well rounded design methodology, and to be able to speak confidently about one's profession.",
    "I loved this course, and I think the ideas and questions it allowed me to formulate will be very useful in informing my future design work. At least I hope this will be the case.",
    "I felt this course was very valuable, although I wish that I had had more time to work on the paper.",
    "ENORMOUS!",
    "This course allowed me to explore the subjects of image and representation, which had been of interestto me for a long time. In addition, reading and writing, which we were performing constantly throughout this semester, will always have great value for my career as an architect.",
    "Very important course for learning about more current trends and topics in architectural theory.",
    "I can definitely say that this class has incited latent interests within me and pushed me to explore them in my final paper.",
    "it was extremely valuable.",
    "I found this course to be very valuable. Not only I learned a lot from the assigned readings and lectures, but the discussions among the peer students were informative and exposed me to the way students thought about architectural topics and current issues regarding our profession.",
    "Very valuable."

    "Ariane was kind and smart and most importantly, so excited about the course topics and material. She remembered and referred to our online posts directly in conversations, became so invested in some of our class discussions, and was flexible with deadlines and helpful generally. I wish I could have gotten to know her better.",
    "Ariane was a great lecturer and section leader. She kept discussion, which was always vigorous, on topic, even as it veered wildly. She was constantly focused on reaching big ideas via careful reading and dissection of text. Her selection of speakers is diverse and noteworthy.The TA was punctual in posting readings and sending course updates.",
    "ariane lourie-harrison was tremendous in leading the class with her exceptional lectures, much welcomed guest lectures, and tremendous energy during her seminar sections which only contributed to students' enthusiasm.Matthew Zych was very very very helpful to his fellow classmates in answering questions and going out of his way to aiding them in their work and papers. He is tremendously motivated and I would recommend him as an ideal TA for any other class he participates in.",
    "Arianne and all the guest lectures were fantastic. My one critique would be to try to keep the lectures and sections on time. Both routinely started late and went substantially late. It isn't a huge deal, but it would be great to stay a little bit more on time.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of the course and the list of guest speakers that came frequently delivered interesting perspectives week to week.Marta was very good at helping students understand a particular reading\/ author, but I cannot pinpoint why the seminars were frequently student presentations rather than discussion. She was a great source of knowledge and was especially helpful in clarifying paper topics. She has an organized mind and was able to spot student issues.",
    "I think the course would have been more effective if Ariane and Marta would have given more of the lectures. They could have helped us make clearer connections. In section Marta often gave open ended questions that did not lead to good discussion.",
    "The course is well organized in both lectures and discussions. Having uguest critics to give out lectures was very interesting.",
    "Since instructor is knowledgeable on many topics, I could learn various aspects from her. Also she was always trying tocombine various aspects, which was helpful to consider deeply.",
    "Ariane is a very intelligent critic and a helpful teacher. She is able to organize outside speakers, sminars, readings and online discussions in a very integrated way that encourages students to think independently and critically.",
    "While I liked the structure of the course--having various teachers lecture on topics that they were experts on--I found the actual lectures of little use. The speakers were often turgid and boring and would simply re-state what was in the reader. If students had simply read the readings and attended the discussions, they would have learned as much. That said, the readings and discussion sessions were very interesting, but the lectures really need to be strengthened.",
    "Ariane is an extremely knowledgeable and approachable professor. She managed students well to discuss the topics, and none of the discussion sections were boring at all.",
    "The professor was extremely knowledgeable, very encouraging and engaging. Ariane did an outstanding job with tough material and a very inquisitive class of students.",
    "Marta is a very good section leader who asks difficult questions and is able to keep things focused. The online discussion was also great and allowed us to expand the discussion in a more time relaxed setting.",
    "I enjoyed working with the Professor Harrison and Professor Caldeira.The lectures were very clear and well-structured. I even chose to make an audio recording of them for future use.The sections were great. One of several valuable aspects of our sections was that our leader encouraged not only effort to understand the ideas behind each contemporary work, but also reinterpretation and taking a critical position towards it. This enabled us to produce original thoughts ourselves.",
    "I was in the section led by Ariane Lourie Harison.Ariane has been an amazing professor. She has been a very dedicated and involved instructor throughout the semester. She has always been available to meet and willing to discuss my ideas with me, both about my writing project for the class and my concerns as an architect at large. Her knowledge of theory and the wide culture of critical writing that concerns architecture is incredible. As a result, her references and critique during the semester has been invaluable in my ongoing research. I look forward to continue my conversations about architecture with her during the length of my studies here at Yale School of Architecture.",
    "Discussions were a nice complement to the reading. Online forums is a great idea to jumpstart the thinking process.",
    "Ariane and Marta are fantastic instructors. Both convey the challenging material with great clarity and challenge the students in return to dig deeper into the material with questions and theories of their own. For those less comfortable with the theoretical side of architecture, their approach is accommodating, and they seek to provide each student with a complete comprehension of the material presented. Despite not always getting passionate participation from our end, discussion sections were helpful in further elucidating the lecture material, and in challenging the theories themselves.",
    "I had never been super interested in theory, but I am after taking this class. They presented the material very well and led good discussions.",
    "Ariane is a great professor. She is very approachable and answers emails incredibly fast. She encouraged (often fierce) discussion in section, and knew how to get her students excited about the subject material.",
    "The course lectures were interesting and well arranged to reinforce the readings. Marta was my discussion leader. She is one of the best teachers I have yet encountered at YSoA. She is interested in listening to student's ideas and offering timely and useful feedback. In discussion she is always able to draw out the salient points from student observations and the sometimes dense theoretical readings. This helps the content of the class make sense in relation to architectural practice.I thought the discussion forum website was a great idea. It's a good way to communicate with other members of the section and really see how others are interpreting the information.",
    "I felt the discussion sections were valuable, although I felt that often the conversation could have been more grounded either in the reading or in actual examples of architecture.",
    "Wonderful, there arent words to describe how dedicated both Ariane and Martha are. They are truly wonderful people, wonderful professors, and most important they genuinly seem to care about their students.",
    "Both of the instructors were encouraging and provided great advice and comments during lectures and seminars.",
    "Mart Calderia is a tremendously clear, direct and knowledgeable person, who has been always available for mentoring and advice. The way she directed the course and the discussions, from a series of questions to a more substantial-final question maybe the most important lesson I\u0092ll carry with me.",
    "I think a format with weekly lectures by invited speakers is pretty successful. It keeps the course more interesting from week to week. The discussion sections were a successful complement to this, and Ariane's thorough knowledge and great interest with the subject greatly enhanced the liveliness of the discussions.",
    "Marta was a great section leader. she was very thorough and a great supplement to the lectures.",
    "The discussions could have benefited from more focus.",
    "I really like Marta and think she is highly knowledgeable and an eager professor. Although I do think she needs to work on her methods of encouraging discussion. I know it is not entirely her fault, as we architecture students are constantly tired and overworked, so at times our energy levels are lagging and we can't quite participate in the ways we would like... But I do know that we all have opinions on the readings and if encourage in the right way, we could have extremely productive discussions. I think her calm, neutral demeanor, although soothing, does not really have the effect of jolting us into a heated debate.",
    "i liked that this course wasnot taught by one instructor but by many visiting lecturers.",
    "Since I have not had Ariane as my discussion leader, I cannot evaluate her in terms of her teaching abilities. But as I mentioned before, the class was very well structured, and I found the incorporation of on-line responses to the curriculum very effective. Also, Marta (as my discussion leader) was always very well prepared with a brief synopsis of the readings for each week and questions that would encourage, and many times challenged, my own thinking about the particular topic we were discussing.",
    "Marta is an amazing teacher. She was extremely patient with our quiet class and was very diligent to read and remember the comments we posted on V2 the night before. She worked very hard to propel conversations forward. My only suggestion is that the section could have better time management. Class often started late because the previous section went over. And because of this, the person presenting the last reading in our section got cut off.Ariane did a great job organizing engaging speakers. I really looked forward to lecture every week."

    "As mentioned before, maybe consider a more heavily emphasized narrative thread linking the course topics and lectures together. Smaller section meetings would also have been useful, I think.",
    "(see above)",
    "Perhaps more of an integration of theory paper topics and class discussion. Perhaps each student could prevent a pecha kucha of their topic at miderm.Thanks!",
    "more active dialogue between students in class, somehow.",
    "The V2 forum was a useful addition to the course this semester.",
    "There should either be less guest lecturers, or the lectures should all happen during class time.",
    "The discussion session is too short to discuss everything. Either or the readings should be shorter or the section leader should put more effort to organize time.",
    "Although I know it's difficult, it would be better to have smaller group session.",
    "Better lecturers, less of a narrow focus on linguistic theories on architecture.",
    "We didn't have enough time to address the texts at the end of the semester. An editing of the readings and perhaps a focus on the more contemporary questions young architects are faced with today would make the class more effective. I think readings should start with the texts from the second half of the semester.",
    "Two things, first the paper could be tweaked in order to avoid the end of year portfolio rush into maybe four shorter papers throughout the semester. Second, there needs to be an effort to pull things to together between the lectures by outsiders. Maybe every other lecture is a summary by one of the two instructors. Otherwise it was well done.",
    "This year MED students were divided in two groups for the reading seminars. I'd strongly recommend to avoid this in the future, since it's a very productive chance for the development of the thesis and the fostering of the team-building, foreseeing other MED team activities such as the symposium and the colloqium.",
    "Perhaps the course should be broken into two separate courses. The first one would cover theory from 1968 to the recent present, while the second one would be focused in analyzing and debating disciplinary critical trends of the present, their context and their development. Yale, in the end, is a school that is strongly focused in the teaching of architecture history and theory, and as such, it should have an even stronger focus of present architectural debate.",
    "This course seemed to require a lot of background knowledge in theory - it was difficult to keep up with trying to make broad connections between different readings across the semestermarta was very tolerant in trying to encourage the class to participate, although the conversations tended to focus too much on the broad links between readings and across time periodsit was frustrating that the lectures were rescheduled or canceledit would be helpful to structure the paper more - require along outline or rough draft after spring break to keep students focused",
    "In retrospect it is unfortunate that there are on theory courses like this in first year. Not only was it a way to expose important ideas and thinkers, but it also changes how one thinks about and how one reads theory. it is valuable.",
    "The course was enjoyable, however, some of the rescheduled lectures were inconvenient, and forced many students to miss certain lectures due to commitments to other classes, etc. While the rescheduled lectures are undoubtedly not the fault of the two instructors, perhaps a greater effort could be made to confirm the many disparate lecturers, whose contribution to this course is both essential and extremely valuable.",
    "Perhaps a bit more focus on the history behind the theory studied. It seemed we focused on the writings themselves without knowing much about the historical context.",
    "People never had very many questions for our lecturers. I wonder if a few students, perhaps the ones presenting that day were asked to prepare a question for the guest lecturer as well, if that would help spur discussion.",
    "I wish that there had been more focused succession of topics than what simply seemed like a cobbling together of available lecturers.",
    "Tough question seeing as how its an Intro course.",
    "The forums are a great way to engage the class. However I wish that the end of the semester paper was more integral in the actual course. One possibility is to chose paper topics earlier and restructure sections to tailor not only the lectures and required readings but also the individual research of each student. Possibly a required class presentation on research topic in the beginning and in the end of the semester??",
    "The presentations by invited lecturers were good, I only wish some these were able to commit to the initial dates specified on the syllabus.",
    "There should be more discussion sections added. There are too many people. Consideration should be made that 10-15 1st year students who waive some other courses will take the course each year, as there are not enough elective spots available to 1st year students.",
    "The sections had to many students and prevented the possibility of in depth discussions.",
    "I was very happy with the selection of readings this semester. Again, my main complaint would be that I wish the discussion sections had been more lively...",
    "None.",
    "If there are guest lecturers--and I agree that this is a terrific idea--it would be necessary that they lecture during class time (and ideally talk about something relevant to the week's reading). It is unfair to us to not have a dependable lecture time each week and lectures that we cannot attend based on scheduling conflicts. Class times are established in order to resolve such conflicts, so it'd be great if you could get your guests to stick to them. Regardless, I applaud the effort to bring them in. Thanks.",
    "Just a couple things:- Having the outside lecturers was great, when it happened. Keep working on that - it's a very strong part ofthe course.- Marta: In discussion, you have a tendency to want to talk about something very explicit and directed. While your opening statement (mini-lecture) is always well thought out and articulate, it's a bit of a discussion-killer. Try to find ways to be more encouraging of open discourse. You're right; people do have ideas and thoughts, but it's very difficult to bring them up when it constantly feels as though one is trying to say the 'right' thing, rather than their impressions. I think you'll find that having the class simply bat around ideas will generate more enthusiasm and interest, and your role should be to gently direct that conversation at key moments.- Why do we have to talk about Peter Eisenman all the time? I realize that man has inserted himself into every major architectural discussion of the past 40 years, but it feels more like a big wad of taffy stuck in architecture's craw than any kind of valuable or relevant discussion."
