    "Music 210 is fantastic. It's a very smooth continuation from 205. You do a good deal of analysis - by the end of the semester, you'll be able to take a score and take it apart piece-by-piece, which is a very cool feeling. Rick is a great professor, as well. He'll make the class seem fun and laid-back while still keeping a rigorous agenda. Take it!",
    "Highly recommended, especially if you have any interest in writing your own music or learning how to harmonize for a cappella or anything else.",
    "Good class -- although there is a lot of overlap with 205. The main benefit of this class is the opportunity to test one's skill at composing.",
    "A great class! I would definitely recommend this to others. You will learn a lot about voice leading and classical chord progressions, and will apply these techniques to your own compositions. Problem sets (at least in my section, with Prof. Cohn) were challenging, but the material was interesting and overall you will gain a lot from the course."
