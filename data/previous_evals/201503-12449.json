   "comments": [
    "A lot of waiting around, sometimes interesting, sometimes not interesting at all. The grading seemed arbitrary and I still have no idea how I did in the class. Weekly lab write ups were time consuming. Don't leave them til the last minute.",
    "Neuro lab is a really fun lab and you learn a lot about neuro techniques. The lab generally runs pretty long (can be until 6pm) so plan to have the whole afternoon for the lab, but the grading is not hard and very fair and the workload is very manageable (just reading the lab manual before the lab, and a one-page free-form report afterwards). The instructors are very knowledgeable and provide a lot of help, and I really enjoyed it even though I'm generally not big on labs. Felt that I learned a lot",
    "I highly recommend taking this course if you're taking the neurobiology lecture. The labs are interesting, although they sometimes run over time. Compared to other lab courses, the workload is fairly light. There are quizzes before most labs and three times throughout the semester notebooks, with notes from the labs plus a one-page write-up for each lab (or sometimes a one-page write-up for a pair of related labs), are graded. The best part: no final! Easily the best lab course that I've taken at Yale.",
    "A very interesting lab course, especially compared to a lot of the lower level lab courses in the MCDB department. If you get most of the lab-work done during lab, it is not so difficult afterward as the lab reports are cumulative.",
    "Take this lab--it's the closest approximation to real lab work in the course catalogue.",
    "A great course overall. Lectures at the beginning of the course with Wymann are extremely lengthy, but get better in the latter part with Keshishian. The hardest part of the lab was getting the equipment to work or the apparatus properly set up, and because of this often went on until 5 or 6, so be prepared for long hours of frustration. Lab reports are due every few weeks, but don't be deceieved- they're extremely time-consuming, so don't put them off until the night before, and be sure to include pictures and insight in all the reports. Despite this, the course was a great introduction to the field of neurobiology, and would highly recommend to anyone interested in neuroscience."
