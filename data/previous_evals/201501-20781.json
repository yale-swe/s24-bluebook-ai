    "And non-traditional introduction to the central works of modern critical theory that not only presents their overarching themes, but also a nuanced interpretation of the themes that lie beneath. I would absolutely recommend this course, not only for its development of a strong theoretical foundation to critical theory, but also because of the freedom it provides its students to deconstruct our own cognitive frameworks and consider the possibility of more fruitful alternatives."

    "It so happens that several of the theorists we looked at were French. As I'm a graduate student in the French department and my primary focus is 20th-century French literature, this course was especially helpful. That said, I also really appreciated the opportunity to look at theorists and works from other traditions."
