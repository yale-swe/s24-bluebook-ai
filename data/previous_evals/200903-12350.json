   "comments": [
    "This course is a look at many different apocalyptic works over many genres (plays, books, movies, poetry, etc.). I would definitely recommend it; it's fun material.",
    "This class was really good. The topic is interesting and the works we read were great. It was a lot of reading (borderline too much), but I was able to get it all done, and I liked doing it. The written assignments are very reasonable in terms of number and length (one short, one medium, and one long paper), and you get to write about anything that interests you. Also, Professor Berger is great. He has great insights and facilitates discussion well. Highly recommended.",
    "Take it if it's not early morning again, that killed us.",
    "This is a really interesting class that covers a subject no other class at Yale does. You will see America and the West in general in a completely different light afterwards. It gives you a lot to think about. I never before understood how central apocalyptic thinking was to every aspect of American life. However, the seminar was torture. THe reading list is beyond intense (a novel or two a week. Fun reading! But still a lot). Prof. Berger basically lectured the entire time, and the students were the definition of an awkward silence. But this might have been just that one class. It was the first year it was taught. If the course has been restructured, I would definitely take it.",
    "If you enjoy sci-fi\/fantasy works, absolutely. If not, it would be too much.",
    "This is a good course with a great reading list. The amount of reading can get quite heavy, but was almost always enjoyable. There are two short papers and a final paper, so the workload is pretty similar to most seminars. Readings range from Revelations to poststructuralist theory, making it both a good way to expose yourself to a wide range of topics, and at times a frustratingly topical survey of a wide range of subjects. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course. Topics of personal interest can be explored on your own through the papers.",
    "We covered multiple approaches to apocalyptic storytelling, from Biblical to science fiction. It was a mixture of movies, novels, and literary theory. There was some emphasis on the political and historical situation of the apocalyptic stories, and also an examination of the evolution of apocalyptic narratives. It's got a fabulous syllabus and the potential for great conversations. I would definitely recommend the course, but with the caveat that the weekly workload is heavy.",
    "I think this was a very interesting course. For someone looking to read more modern texts and learn about our fascination with the end of the world, I definitely recommend it. It is a lot of reading, but for the most part it is all interesting reading.",
    "This was an interesting class. Take it if the topic interests you, but expect to do much of the detailed analysis on your own. Also, if you are not very motivated it is easy to let the reading slip."
