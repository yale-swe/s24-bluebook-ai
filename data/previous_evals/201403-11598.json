   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Challenges you to learn using more hands-on learning via SAS and challenges you to understand entirety of biostatistics as opposed to broken up skills.",
    "Really a excellent course for biostatistics starters.",
    "I appreciated that the pace of this class was slow enough for people who have never taken statistics before to follow. I never felt rushed with the lecture material. Lab material was rushed--I think that only an hour was too short and that the intro Powerpoint took away from the class. I loved how enthusiastic and available the TAs were, and although the first two homework assignments were long I thought they were valuable (I would still maybe take two questions out of the first two assignments).",
    "Lab, handouts, classnotes, and hws weren't always in sync.",
    "Material was presented\/explained well, and the textbook is great, but lack of consensus among TFs\/prof made it difficult to understand what was expected on graded assignments",
    "The class itself was great in that I learned a lot. It being held at 8:30 in the morning is quite early but the material was important and relevant. There was a lot of material but Dr. Claus made time to go over everything with us in class.",
    "Very logical flow of the dissemination of information. Thorough explanations presented in lecture with appropriate examples. Oftentimes lab sections were one week behind lecture, it would have been nice to have applied what we learned in lecture the same week in lab rather than the following week.",
    "The strengths of this class: it starts at a level that everyone can understand; it is thorough; it covers fundamental concepts crucial regardless of future path; it proceeds at a steady pace. The weaknesses: the TAs provide inconsistent guidance for problem sets and labs. It would be helpful if they had an answer key so that they could all provided consistent suggestions; it could be very confusing if you spoke to more than one TA with regards to a problem, and sometimes got a problem wrong if a different TA was responsible for grading it. The lab assignments are vague - it is unclear, especially in the beginning, what the final product should look like, how the answers should be phrased, and what should be included.",
    "A strength is the SAS component because it taught us something unique but this is also a weakness in that I may never use SAS again so I do not know if it was the best use of time.",
    "Dr Claus is an extraordinary teacher for introductory statistics -- this is the clearest exposition of these concepts that I have seen.",
    "The material was difficult to understand in class but the labs were good.",
    "The biggest issue with this class was that there was no standardization between the teaching fellows. Every week during lab, every TF had their own instructions for the labs, which were different from all the other TF's instructions. I lost points that were exactly what my TF said to do, but differed from the grading TF's instructions. That is unacceptable.",
    "The lecture style was not conducive to learning. I found it more prudent to spend the time not going to class and instead reading the book on my own.",
    "I think the course was taught well. Professor Claus is an excellent teacher and obviously passionate about the subject, which makes learning it a bit easier. It's just extremely hard to focus at 8:00am",
    "Strenght: Proficiency of the instructor Methodology (combination of labs and homework)",
    "TAs were great during office hours, but very inconsistent in their teaching during labs, as well as their grading and expectations for assignments.",
    "Teacher's lectures are confusing to follow at first, but they get better over time. I found the only way to be successful at the beginning of the course was to take advantage of TA office hours, as I didn't find the lecture content to be sufficient. The TAs for this course are amazing!",
    "More time should be provided for hands on application of material in the lab. Lecture was difficult to follow and ineffective. Very few resources were placed on the classes V2 website.",
    "It was taught as if students had a background in biostats, which a lot of the students did not. Proffesor's hand-writing is not legible.",
    "The course is far less effective than previous statistics courses that I've taken, and the way the lecture material is covered is not helpful.",
    "Lab TAs need to be on the same page about what is required. Literally every TA has a different perspective on EVERY lab. It is REMARKABLE how out of alignment they are.",
    "Does not adequately teach the concepts - the format of the course is not conducive to concept-driven learning; rather, it is an exercise in looking through the textbook and applying things for the homework, and quickly forgetting the concepts after.",
    "Strengths: provides an effective overview of basic statistics and hypothesis testing Improvements: Incorporating SAS is a fantastic and welcome idea, but I don't think a 50 minute lab once a week was enough to familiarize myself with the program. I would like to have seen a little more focus on SAS.",
    "The class is necessary and I appreciate that but the method of teaching used by the professor is lacking severely.",
    "Not being a quantitative person, biostats was completely intimidating - but if you do the readings BEFORE class, the lectures flow quite smoothly and are very helpful to know what to focus your attention on. I do wish the stats chart that was given on the final day of class was given on the first class! It absolutely put things into perspective and helped me to understand the bigger picture.",
    "This course was solid. There was nothing that stood out to me that was a glaring weakness. I appreciated having an open books\/notes test. This made sure we understood what was happening in the class and how to answer statistical questions, but it lowered the actual stress level going into examinations.",
    "Overall a strong course (and quite useful). The biggest weakness was administrative--from communication with other students (as well as meeting with various TFs in office hours) it seemed as if the TFs were not always on the same page in terms of expectations.",
    "Well organized course. Instructor's handwriting was for the most part illegible, though. Making the course 8:30 a.m. I think discouraged a lot of students from attending. Could be improved through showing more real-life (i.e. publication-based) examples.",
    "I thought this course was great - especially the lab portion. I think the only part that could be greatly improved would be the implementation of PowerPoint slides in the lecture - especially when evaluating a SAS output file - to make it easier to follow along, and read back in my notes about later.",
    "Lab times should be longer. My TF spent 45 minutes going over the powerpoints. Most class times we only had 10-15 minutes to work on the lab\/ask questions which isn't enough time at all. Powerpoints in lab weren't very good to begin with. Increased content on the slides in the middle of the semester made them better.",
    "I waived this course.",
    "should have more interactions",
    "strengths: homework and class was taught in a manner that effectively conveyed the information needed for the course weaknesses: I would prefer for the review sessions to focus LESS on what will be learned next semester and more on what was learned this semester. Some concepts were briefly taught and glossed over instead of focused on in class.",
    "I never felt like I was learning SAS but just going through the motions.",
    "The textbook was sometimes confusing. I think a textbook that shows step by step how to solve the problems would be more helpful as it was sometimes difficult to understand from this text how to actually solve formulas. Many students did not attend class because they did not feel the instruction was helpful. I felt there were some things that were helpful in the instruction, but often felt confused during the instruction.",
    "The way this course is taught is not helpful. The huge class size, and the way Claus writes on the overheads is not helpful! I ended up using the slide shows from the summer session (different instructor with slides) as my primary way to learn.",
    "Strengths - prof moves slowly and is sensitive to the fact that this may be the first math course students have taken in a long time Weaknesses-prof penmanship is illegible, lectures don't follow a clear outline and are sometimes hard to follow",
    "The course was a good introduction to the topic but taught differently from my undergrad course. Retrospectively, I should have waived it because it was too much review, although I am happy to have learned a good amount of SAS. In one semester of undergrad, with no prior stats experience, we got through all of this material plus a few non-parametric tests, Wilcoxon rank, Kolmogorov Smirnov, etc. I attribute this to that class being only 20 students, however. Overall, a necessary course if you haven't yet had a powerful statistics course.",
    "very good",
    "I think this is a class that if you want to get something out of the lecture, you have to attend class and be attentive, which can be difficult at 8:30 in the morning as the semester goes on. It was a little bit of a change from other classes that the notes are only by hand, but I think this forced me to attend class and take notes. I took a Biostatistics course in undergrad so I had some basic knowledge of a lot of the concepts we covered, but in my previous course we did less calculations by hand and I had not used SAS. Even though you only \"learn\" SAS in lab, the discussion of SAS outputs in lecture is actually really important in my opinion to your understanding of using SAS. Even though I had take Biostatistics I think I got things out of this course that I hadn't learned or didn't remember. I thought the exams were fair and that homeworks were graded fairly, but I wish that the solutions to the homework questions from the book had been made available because corrected homework assignments did not have the correct answers written. With the graded lab assignments sometimes it was difficult to understand what should be included. Also different TAs said a lot of different things about the lab assignments and what was expected and this was confusing as everyone had different understanding of what was expected.",
    "I do not feel like I have a good understanding of how to code in SAS despite having spent a whole semester on it. I also feel like I taught myself the material - I did not find the lectures particularly helpful.",
    "The homework was long, but helpful in making sure that we stayed on top of the work. It may actually be more useful if homework questions were separated, so due more often but less is due. The jumping back and forth between book information and SAS during lecture was frustrating and difficult to follow. Instead of going back and forth, it would be more helpful if all the book stuff was done first and then SAS was all done together at the end of lecture. The SAS labs, particularly the ones in the beginning, would be much more useful if we walked through it all together as a class. We did this for one of the labs and it was much more helpful in helping us understand the output.",
    "Good course. BIS505 lab expectations should be clearer from the start. All the TAs were very helpful during office hours!",
    "I think there could be more consistency among the SAS lab instructors--it was not always clear what they wanted on the homework and the labs themselves were pretty difficult to navigate through. I did well on all the assignments but I honestly don't think I can do anything on my own, which I feel is an area that could be significantly improved upon.",
    "I think the way we were taught and assessed overall was fair. I would have preferred the class to have been held later than 8:30 am! Early classes are brutal, and I feel I could have paid better attention if the class were held a little later in the day.",
    "I opted out of the course, so I only went to the labs.",
    "Teaches you the basics of statistics and programming. Labs need improvement because the directions are not always clear, sometimes even the TFs had difficulty parsing the points of a question. The grading for labs is also always different because the instructions given for them (attach tables, graphs, or include special analysis) are not uniformly disseminated. Rather, you have to have been lucky enough to have been in a TF's section when they're the grader for that week's homework. However, the course itself is slow and comprehensive enough that if you seek out help and take your time to understand the material, it's not impossible to do well.",
    "I didn't like that notes were handwritten and shown using an overhead projector - they were often difficult to read. The book presented information much differently from how it was presented in class. Dr. Claus was a good lecturer, though.",
    "Strengths: Tutors were helpful; SAS labs fit into material nicely Weaknesses: Extremely hard to follow.",
    "I felt the class was well taught. The only weakness I perceived was our SAS lab .The structure of the lab and the time constraint made it difficult to understand how to properly use the software to complete our assignments.",
    "It was a great introduction to biostatistics. It had everything needed to start running and understanding basic statistical tests that would be applicable to our research. The tests felt like accurate assessments of the teaching. Occasional questions on the homework assignments did not feel relevant (such as the one question regarding the Poisson distribution), but for the most part they were straightforward as well. The workload was very manageable but still educationalI feel as though I've learned just as much in this class as I did in others with more assignments.",
    "This class has a lot of challenges attached to it. Not only is the material hard to understand when first presented, it is difficult to learn in a lecture format and just reading a book. The best thing that could be done is to not have a second lecture each week and have some kind of discussion section that would cover practicing the homework problems etc. If the schedule was more one lecture, one SAS lab and one discussion section or workshop, I think the subject matter would be better understood for a lot of us. There are plenty of TA hours but they can range from so many topics that people share and are repeated over and over. That could be addressed in whole with discussion sections.",
    "Overall this course was very good. It made difficult materials approachable and integrated SAS into the course material very well. Homework, tests, and lab assignments were always appropriately difficult. Grading was fair but weighting was not always appropriate - lab assignments should be weighted individually. In the current set-up, one easy lab from the first homework has equal weight in terms of overall course grade as 3 more difficult labs from later in the semester.",
    "I think the material was important but could have been structured more clearly for the greatest real world benefit. Possibly more examples with more thorough explanations of the analysis.",
    "The class was good at introducing basic statistics concepts, and I really enjoyed learning SAS. The lab and lecture component were balanced pretty evenly, and we linked class concepts to lab assignments well.",
    "",
    "The class was a good introductory statistics class. More concordance between the labs, lectures, and readings (in particular the SAS readings) would have helped with clarity. The SAS readings typically didn't have any relation to the labs. Also, there was little consistency between lab teaching assistants such that students were often left guessing what was expected of them on the lab assignments.",
    "It was just taught in confusing order. Teaching SAS during lecture was not very helpful, but at the same time our SAS labs weren't super helpful in learning SAS either.",
    "I received an Honors in the course but can't even tell you when it is appropriate to use certain analyses. I learned how to calculate things but don't understand their utility. For me, this means that the course was a failure. I think it would help if one data set was used for the entirety of the course to be able to see which data needs which types of computation.",
    "Attending office hours was helpful for clarifying concepts from class.",
    "Having examples where the concepts were applicable to public health definitely helped to understand why this class is important (lecture and SAS lab).",
    "I learned pertinent concepts and feel prepared to utilize them in a professional setting.",
    "I was satisfied with this course and how it was taught. One suggestion I have would be to improve communication to or among teaching assistants. I often heard directions about SAS labs from students in other sections. We were not provided with the same information and that was frustrating.",
    "I thought the course did a good job of providing an intro to SAS.",
    "Poor handwriting of the professor made it difficult to re-read class notes. Overall god class though with good structure and TAs.",
    "The textbook gives excellent explanations when you can't follow along in lecture. Unfortunately, Dr. Claus's handwriting is abysmal, so much so that even when you're in class, following along, if you don't keep up and try to go back in her notes to see what you missed you'll spend most of your time trying to decipher what that word is.",
    "It would be helpful to work with SAS output a little more.",
    "This class was an amazing and useful class to take. I understood the instructor's lectures and found her style of teaching engaging. The only limitation to this class was the SAS lab section. It would be helpful if the SAS lab was given more time beyond 1 hour. An hour is insufficient to complete the SAS exercise; this makes it harder to grasp the concepts we are supposed to learn during the lab session.",
    "Weakness: Too focus on formula. Need more information why and when to use the formula.",
    "I think that the course could be structured in a way that is more conducive to student learning. Smaller but more regular homework deadlines would help students keep up on the concepts. It also might help them to have a better idea of how well they know the material and what portions of the material are giving them problems. The lecture material and course homework was also not clearly aligned during points of the semester and this was confusing.",
    "This class will provide you with a broad overview of statistics, which is important. I felt that while this class did a good job of teaching us how to read SAS printouts, it did a very poor job of teaching us how to actually code in SAS. While some SAS labs were fairly straight forward, many were very difficult because we simply did not know the code to run the program. I was even told by a TA that this class teaches you how to read SAS, but not how to code and that we would learn that in other classes, which was extremely frustrating considering our assignments were about coding and then reading the printouts, not just reading the printouts. Additionally, I do not think the tests were very representative of what we knew, as they often did not cover what we did in the homework, but were instead multi-part questions related to one concept. This was especially true of the final exam, which didn't really cover any of our homework #3 bookwork.",
    "Strengths - SAS labs are very helpful (Veronika Shabanova was my TA and she was great! She explained the codes easily and thoroughly.); exams are reasonable (no \"surprises\"). Weaknesses - Posting book problem answers and SAS labs answers (i.e., ideal response to questions) online would help us review the ones we get wrong; the required textbook for SAS programming is not necessary (I never opened it); notes written on overhead slides are hard to read.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the teaching in that the concepts are conveyed in a meaningful and clear way, where I know have confidence in my statistics skills. The greatest weakness I would say is the note-taking during class. The notes were difficult to refer back to at time, but at that... not a huge weakness!",
    "Cover lots of material in short amount of time. Good experience in labs learning SAS. Lectures sometimes are fast paced and difficult to follow completely.",
    "I thought this course was well taught. The lectures were straight forward and the concepts were explained in a systematic fashion. The homework was very applicable to what we were learning and was a good way to enforce that the students were practicing the concepts learned in class. I also appreciated that the tests were open note- the evaluations were fair. However, the 8:30 AM class time was brutal. I made sure to make it to every class, but I would have been much more alert and ready to learn if the class time had been later. Other negative was that grading was pretty harsh for the first few computer lab assignments.",
    "Frustrating, in general it felt geared towards people with a math background. The SAS labs were either very, very simple, or ridiculously hard.",
    "I appreciated how the concepts of the course built on each other, but I sometimes felt like the material was repetitive. I think the way that SAS inputs\/outputs were explained in class were helpful, and I'm very glad that SAS was integrated into the lecture course. It might be helpful to run the program on the screen in class though, instead of just looking at the output, just so we better see how each step of the input relates to the output. Also, I think SAS lab could be improved by extending the lab periods by a half hour. It would be nice to be able to get through more of the lab during an allocated time where a TA is accessible.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed the class. I came in with very little statistical background, and I felt I walked away with a lot more understanding, both conceptually and in an applied sense. Strengths of the course include a good pace for going through the material, repetitive examples that help reinforce the information, course material is reviewed in SAS labs, which were also good, and TA availability was very good, also. Weaknesses included sometimes conflicting messages between different TAs and Dr. Claus regarding assignments and ways to report our findings for labs, lack of emphasis on one type of problem versus another type (ex. we learned a lot about 2-sided t-tests, but one-sided got less attention and remained confusing without further study), and some topics not being covered in sufficient detail (ex. the power calculations and knowing whether to use a positive z-alpha and positive z-beta each time you calculate power, or do you use the negative z-beta and positive or negative z-alpha depending on the one-sided test being performed, etc.). Otherwise, additional strengths included the use of hand-outs for learning and lecture (extremely helpful) and the open note\/open-book mid-terms and finals were a blessing. I got a lot out of the class. In terms of class improvement, I would say the best improvement would be to make sure the TAs and Dr. Claus are on the same page about what they want as far as the SAS lab write-ups are concerned and as far as what is covered in lecture. That got to be confusing when we would learn one thing in lecture and a TA would tell us a slightly different fact that we either hadn't heard before or even seemed to contradict what Dr. Claus taught.",
    "It was a good course. I wish the classroom was in different format and more time spent in explaining the theory and reasoning behind these equations. I think writing those equations in the transparency were not enough for us to understand the concept. I had to read different books and ask friend and a statistician to be able to understand.",
    "Biostatistics is a foundational course in public health. The format of the course is not conducive to student learning. The only strength of this course is that tests are open-book, open-note, which given the teaching style is the only way that a student would be able to pass the exam. Weaknesses include: tests based on the professor's teaching style rather than the book, making it difficult to study; homework assignments that were graded without explanation and that was returned to us after an exam (limiting our availability to use the homework to study); class notes that were inconsistent with the book. I was disappointed to hire a private tutor at such a prestigious university. The lab sessions were poorly organized. As a student with no experience in SAS, this lab did not help me learn. Notes were read off the projector and did not in any way help students learn SAS.",
    "This course had very fair exams and a fair workload. Lab was not very helpful and I felt as though SAS was not taught very well. In lab it felt like we were just copying what was off the powerpoint instead of learning how to do it ourselves.",
    "I was not a huge fan of this course. As a student who has not had a statistics course before, I don't think that the course was really designed with beginner statistics students in mind. This was exacerbated by the fact that many of my classmates had taken a stats course before and were already familiar with the material. Consequently, I think many assumptions were made about our level of understanding. This lead to logical leaps and shortcuts that made sense to people with a working knowledge of statistics, but left me often feeling like I missed a step. Frequently I had to review my notes with classmates who had stats experience just to make sense of them and to ensure that all of the steps were included. I spent a lot of time using the textbook and other outside resources to piece together the correct problem solving steps. I do not think that only having four problem sets over the semester was good for those of us learning statistics for the first time. It did not give us a chance to assess whether we fully grasped a topic before moving on to another. Further, many people didn't do the homework problems until the week they were due, which eliminated any reinforcement of the material that we were learning as material may have been learned up to three weeks prior. Also, because we turned such a large volume of homework at a time, it took a while to get homework back and sometimes did not get them back until a few days before an exam. I did not find the incorporation of SAS particularly effective or useful. While I did learn about how SAS can be useful for analyzing statistical information, many of the labs were repetitive. Further, I found myself more often reusing code from previous weeks and just changing the lines that were needed to get the answer, especially for initial import, formatting and data steps. As such, I don't think I really learned what each piece of the syntax does or why it is necessary. Similarly, when incorporating SAS into class lectures, it eliminated some of the understanding of certain statistical tests since we didn't learn the theory behind the tests.",
    "Good introduction to biostatistics. I wish the TFs were on the same page. Every week different TFs would teach the SAS differently and provide students' conflicting answers about test content, homeworks, and lab assignment. Additionally, I wish second-years were not TFs. It often was a conflict of interest when people were friends and roommates with TFs.",
    "I learned most of the course from the textbook and found the lectures not particularly useful.",
    "Overall a good general overview of statistics. The TA's were phenomenal, and Veronika taught me most of what I learned in the class. I don't it's helpful to teach SAS code in a big lecture.",
    "This course allowed me to learn SAS more in depth. It also allowed lessons from Epidemiology course to be further affirmed as calculations we learned made more sense as we understood the reasons for why we calculate things the way we do. While this course as a whole helped me with SAS, I do not believe a one hour lab is helpful for students to completely understand what needs to completed for the lab. A 1.5 hour lab would be better sufficient for this lab. I was also very happy with the format of the exam as a whole.",
    "Overall I found this to be a very useful and valuable class, and I enjoyed gaining a stronger foundation in biostatistics and certain quantitative skills. However I was very frustrated with how inconsistent the different TAs were in providing information to students. I'd hear information regarding problem sets or labs from friends in other TA sections that I hadn't even heard of in my own. I think in the future, there should be greater standardization of teaching among all the TAs.",
    "Seems to be a great introductory course for biostatistics. The homework is extremely helpful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture. SAS labs more or less correspond with the lecture material.",
    "I have taken a statistics course before and did not learn nearly as much in that class as I did in this course. Good teaching, and helpful homework assignments. Good feedback on the homework. I appreciated the open-note tests, in that studying for exams involved organizing and intensively reviewing notes and problem sets, without the pressure of excessive memorization.",
    "Some of the lectures\/lecture notes were difficult to follow. It seemed like we didn't learn basic SAS programs\/language before labs and it was more guesswork to finish assignments.",
    "A more thorough instruction on SAS is required.",
    "Although the instructor was very charismatic and clearly knowledgeable, I did not find the lectures to be very helpful. I had learned most of the material previously but was not allowed to exempt, so I just read the book instead of attending the lectures. The homeworks were useful, but the quality of the labs sometimes depended on your TA. I would really encourage that all sections receive the same information regardless of their TA in the future. Also, I really hope Dr. Claus switches to PowerPoints instead of the overhead."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: The professor is very patient and attempts to explain any misunderstood concepts in several ways to improve understanding. Professor is also aware of the difficulties students face and adjusts lessons accordingly. Weakness: Sometimes notes are not organized in a manner that can be easily understood.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: Professor's logic is very clear. weakness: It's hard to recognize the notes made by the professor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was extremely personable and as enthusiastic as someone can be about statistics, which made her fairly engaging to listen to. I felt like she really cared about us as students as well. My only issue was with the second SAS lab assignment. It was too difficult to be the second assignment and the instructions were not clear enough, but (and this is hearsay) she seemed a little stubborn about relaying the clarified information to the whole class. Other than that, great!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof is experienced in biostats and in teaching it, but her style of answering questions and reexplaining concepts was unhelpful for me.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Explains concepts well, sometimes projector notes are difficult to decipher, but it's great that problems are worked through step by step during lecture",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I love Dr. Claus! She's so sweet and friendly and awesome. The fact that she teaches this course on the side in addition to her surgery duties makes me in awe of her. I appreciate her willingness to teach and help us when we need assistance. However, I can't help dozing off sometimes because her voice is so gentle.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very clear and articulate, responded to student questions, was available and helpful during office hours. Told corny jokes that made it worth waking up early to attend class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is experienced, patient, and thorough. She manages to keep the class interesting despite its early hour, and patiently answers all questions. I enjoyed coming to class and learning the material from her. Dr. Claus presented the material in an extremely clear fashion.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is a very knowledgable and experienced person. Her only fault is that she doesn't seem to care much about how well we do or if we invest anything in the class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr Claus is an extraordinary teacher for introductory statistics -- this is the clearest exposition of these concepts that I have seen.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The class was so large that Dr. Claus really had no interaction with the students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She structured the course well but I don't feel like her teaching style was conducive to learning. Her notes were not very easy to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0she's fantastic! Attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, passionate",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very qualified. Excellent attitude with students",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Explains concepts very well in class, easy to understand and learn from. Would be helpful to have more legible notes to review after class, like typed or power points, rather than copies of the overhead projector notes.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is very knowledgeable in the subject matter, and you can tell she's been teaching it for years! Therefore, she tends to gloss over some concepts that might still be foggy for students. BUT, she is a GREAT teacher and is willing to give further insight if you approach her individually. I have no complaints with her.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Writing on transparencies during lecture was extremely difficult to follow. These slides were scanned and placed on classes v2, but essentially useless after class as they are extremely difficult to follow. Recommend using typed powerpoint slides that students could reference later for studying and homework.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Did a good job. Could write more legibly. She could also do a better job explaining the concepts being taught.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus cares about students succeeding and learning stats. Its refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Wonderful instructor and mentor - always available to answer questions, and really cares about her students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Excellent, patient, and attentive instructor. Her handwriting is difficult to read, so I wonder if there is a way to make her lectures and class notes more legible for next year.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is very disorganized. She refuses to use powerpoint and her hand writing is ineligible. We cannot take notes because the way she teaches statistics is very confusing and we have to choose between writing down everything she says without understanding or disregarding notes to comprehend what she is actually saying. Additionally she chooses to turn the temperature all the way to zero right before every class. This makes the room nearly as cold as outside making it even harder to concentrate. Please find a better professor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus makes the material sound so clear and simple during lecture. She is also accessible when those moments of clarity fade and you find yourself in a panic, convinced you're being asked to decipher the impossible.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Claus is a very intelligent instructor and is extremely familiar with the course material. That being said, sometimes her explanations in class and notes written on the overheads were a bit disorganized or did not contain full explanations of the reasoning needed to complete a problem.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very intelligent instructor and engaging. Incorporation of SAS into lectures was very helpful. Exams were very fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Teaching could be improved through writing more legibly.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought Dr. Claus overall did a great job, but again, the use of PowerPoint slides would be helpful for this course in the lecture. Also - sometimes it felt like we got information that was unnecessary for the course, about other courses or topics we weren't going to cover, etc - so honing in on what we actually need to know for this course would be helpful. Finally - for the sake of time and grading purposes, sometimes we used procedures that were slightly altered from what you would actually do in a real world application, and contradicted the book, which I think caused confusion among students. To me, if we aren't learning something applicable to our future careers then learning it incorrectly is a waste of time.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I really wish I could provide more constructive feedback, but I am not sure what advice I could give because I really can't figure out why I struggled so much to learn\/understand the material in this class. Perhaps, it was just the early time and I wasn't mentally awake. I think the book was excellent, and I really found it helpful for my learning. I also liked that you did the SAS examples in class and went over the output.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I waived this course.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Sometimes the lectures seemed a bit scattered and not organized.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor is very difficult to follow. I have taken statistics before and this course made it much more difficult and confusing than it should be.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was available to students during office hours and was willing to answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Claus is funny and very nice. However, the way this course is taught is not helpful. The huge class size, and the way Claus writes on the overheads is not helpful! I ended up using the slide shows from the summer session (different instructor with slides) as my primary way to learn.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is obviously brilliant and very considerate of students in almost every way with the exception of the legibility of her notes",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a great teacher with a sense of humor to boot, especially a 8:30 am. My only complaint whatsoever is that many of the class notes are nearly illegible. Perhaps this is just me but I find it very difficult to go back after class and try to understand what is written. Dr. Claus answers in-class questions very effectively, too.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0excellent, responsible and inspiring",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Gives very clear explanations of topics and goes at a pace that makes it very easy for students to understand.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I think Dr. Claus is a good instructor. I think her teaching style forces you to come to class if you want to learn, but I thought my notes were helpful (sometimes) in doing the homework problems in the textbook, with the textbook chapters as a reference, and very helpful in studying for\/doing the problems on the exam. I think she was very responsive to student questions and we knew what to expect going into the exams.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0A more concise explanation and better organization of the material would have helped me.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is very knowledgeable and willing to help her students. However, the handwritten notes during lecture are very hard to follow. It is difficult to follow or to try to interpret the notes afterwards without a context given for any of the examples. She may want to consider moving to powerpoint for the notes, and then switching to handwritten notes for examples. Setting up problems and explaining why we are doing something are often missed because we are just trying to write down all the notes before she moves on.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very knowledgable. I appreciated her corky sense of humor during class. Very professional in her lectures and it was very helpful to have printed handouts to follow along with SAS instructions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I absolutely love Dr. Claus. She is very caring and charismatic. Her handwriting, from time to time did stump me though. Other than that, I'm very happy that she was my instructor this semester!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus knows the material very well, but her class notes are very unclear. It would help if she presented using powerpoints, because when I want to refer back to anything she said in class to review for exams, I find it very difficult to read her hand-written notes. Otherwise, I think she is a very good instructor and is responsive to questions, etc.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0At times her writing may be a bit difficult to read but she really repeats the material to make you understand. She also explains concepts enough that if you keep up with the course by reading the book and taking your time with the homework problems, that you will understand the course material.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: I enjoy Dr. Claus' humor. She seems absolutely brilliant. Weaknesses: Extremely hard to follow. Most of the time, I had no idea what was going on in class. During one particularly hard to follow class, I left in tears because I didn't understand anything. She writes on an overhead projector, and her style of writing is jumbled and confusing. She really knows her stuff, but for people who are new to statistics, it was sort of like learning physics from an astrophysicist- it doesn't work. She spoke as though we already had a background in statistics, so most of the time it was over our heads.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I liked Professor Claus' teaching style for the most part. My notes were mostly clear and concise and easy for me to understand when consulting them for assignments. My only suggestion would be to maybe have some of the notes printed and ready to go before class and then go through some of the calculations using the overhead projector.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was fairly effective at providing information to us in a coherent way. Her summaries were the best part of her teaching. For someone with no statistical background, a lot of the information we were learning seemed disconnected. I found it most helpful when we got straightforward summaries of when to use what types of statistical tests, as that seemed most applicable in real world epidemiology. However, some of the classes in between summaries seemed disjointed or unrelated, which caused a fair bit of confusion. Her handwriting was also slightly problematic at times, though that was usually rapidly clarified. I would've personally preferred the use of the chalkboard over the transparencies that were used, but it was convenient to see the handouts being marked.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus did well to take what can be a very dry subject and putting some life in it. Her commentary and humor were helpful in keeping us awake for an early morning class, which in itself is a challenge. I think the lectures sometimes moved too quickly though, and a lot of information went over our heads. One other thing Dr. Claus could do is give more uniform instructions to the TAs. Often times they were giving different expectations for assignments to students and everyone had conflicting information. The notes in class can also be difficult to read as well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus' lectures were informative, though her notes were difficult to interpret when reviewing them online. I appreciated her focus on conceptual understanding of the course material rather than detail. She also was diligent about pointing out the practical relevance of the course material and how it would be applied in the real world.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor to this course was very nice and supportive. Sometimes she jumped in the material in ways that made it difficult to follow or learn.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0While Dr. Claus is a very smart woman and knows what she is teaching, she teaches very slowly and does not go into depth about the concepts that we may need to employ in our homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very smart. Dry sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an extremely clear lecturer and introduced material at an appropriate pace for an introductory class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: I appreciate the numerous examples Dr. Claus goes over during lecture. Weaknesses: Class notes were a bit hard to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Having a more structured lecture could help people to understand the concept easier. The concepts seemed a little disjointed in the first half of the semester. It would have also been helpful if you explicitly said what you wanted\/expected us to know (for the test) in class, not just in office hours. There were small details that were mentioned through the grapevine that cost some of us points on the test. Having the SAS print out was helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus' teaching technique leaves a lot desired for. Her notes are practically impossible to read or understand. I did not miss one lecture the entire semester because I knew relying on her notes was not an option. She was also combative towards critique during lecture if the class saw something mistakenly written.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0she's great. Her pace is slow enough and she repeats concepts over and over to make sure we understand.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought lectures were very clear. I appreciated her sense of humor too!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought she did a good job of introducing the SAS program",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Poor handwriting but she was generally friendly and easy to talk to. Also very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She's very knowledgable and good at simplifying hard concepts, then building upon them.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an amazing teacher! She conveyed the principles and practical applications of Biostatistics in a relatable way. Her reviews of the semester's work were helpful and allowed me to crystallize the concepts she taught the entire semester.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Too focus on formula. Need more information why and when to use the formula.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good! Following her lecture notes (even while in class), was sometimes a bit difficult.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She seems very nice, however, I wish she had a better handle of what was going on behind the scenes in her class (or if she was aware that she addressed the issue). This mainly related to the SAS labs. Each TA was responsible for grading one set of labs, but there was no answer key for these labs, so if you asked three separate TAs the same question, which I did several times, you were likely to get three different answers. Additionally, on one of the sets of labs there was a great deal of confusion. I wrote out all of my labs and was then sent an email by my TA saying this is what material is needed, so I changed all of my labs, only to receive another email after these changes saying different material should be included, as she was not the one grading the labs. I think Professor Claus should provide an answer key to the TAs, as labs often became more of a struggle of what are we supposed to turn in, rather than do we understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Overall, I think Dr. Claus did well. This course was very basic in terms of concepts because it's an introductory class and so I acknowledge that it was hard to make it fun and interesting. I appreciate Dr. Claus for taking on the course and re-establishing a solid basis of biostatistics for me. In the future, she might want to consider making her notes in another format. I noticed that her hand-writing on class handouts are easy to read but not on the overhead slides--perhaps because the overhead pens are much thicker and just harder to read in general. Given that a statistics course inevitably requires the instructor to write as he\/she lectures, I would suggest writing all her lectures\/notes out on paper and scan that to upload to Classes V2. And during the lecture, we could use the writeboard, which is much easier to read than the overhead.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Awesome professor! Professor Claus made this class very painless and very accessible. I was engaged each lecture and appreciated her clarity and sensibility in explaining concepts.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very smart and has lots of real world experience. Great knowledge of biostatistics and it's applications. Great knowledge of SAS. I think because of her expertise, some topics not fully explained and could be difficult to understand with no background in statistics.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus was a great teacher in the sense that she taught in a systematic and straight forward way. She was thorough in her explanations. However, her hand writing on the projector was sometimes hard to read, which made it hard if you got a little behind in your notes. She was also not very personable or easy to talk to when questions came up, especially about grading.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I feel like her lectures were geared more towards students with a math background. As someone with a humanities background, I was often fairly confused walking out of class. I did feel like she went at a relatively slow pace, which was appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I appreciated Dr. Claus's patience with the students in the course and her dry sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I found Dr. Claus to be very approachable, willing to help, and an entertaining lecturer given her subject area is biostatistics. Strengths included availability, providing good problem sets and examples for SAS lab and homework, being consistent in what she taught, assigned for homework and tested on, and willingness to work through multiple example problems. Weaknesses perhaps included forgetting to zoom out on the projector (ha, not a big deal), and sometimes not covering a topic in detail enough (ex. one-sided t-tests, the power calculations, the confidence intervals found for linear regression analysis using SAS, etc.). Otherwise, I give great reviews. Enjoyed the class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The professor speaks very quickly while writing unclearly on a projection screen. Often while teaching, if a student needed the professor to slow down to copy notes, she would say that she would return to the notes but never would. It is impossible to copy the notes she posts online as her writing is incoherent. I learned nothing from this professor in class. I learned everything from the book and a private tutor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I felt as though the instructor could have been more organized with her lectures. Both the overall structure of each lecture as well as her handwriting\/notes were disorganized. It was hard to keep the big picture in mind during her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0While it is clear that Dr. Claus is very smart and knowledgeable about statistics, I got the impression that Dr. Claus was not really invested in teaching this course. She uses transparencies to take notes and her handwriting is pretty illegible. She wasn't the best at answering student questions and explaining things in a way that made sense for an introductory class. I don't think she is good at explaining statistics for beginning students and probably would be better at teaching a more advanced class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very smart instructor and a good teacher. I wish her lectures where just more clear. If she wrote a bit more clearly that would help a ton!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I was disappointed in Professor Claus. While I am sure she is smart woman her lectures were horribly unclear and often confusing. It does not seem like it would be difficult to craft better lectures that are interactive and clear.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0A good instructor. Sometimes very rushed even when material was new making it difficult to understand and forcing students to rely heavily on TA's.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The professor was a great teacher but I do wish she had spent more time in class doing additional examples. She spent quite a bit of class time going over the same type of examples over and over again. This was a bit frustrating as when it came time for her exams, it would have been helpful to know how she asked questions so we can better be prepared for the exam questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very understanding in that she doesn't seem to want to overburden us with work, yet she gets the lecture material across through lectures and homeworks. Her handwriting is a bit tough to understand and she uses an overhead projector, which at first is a bit difficult to get used to.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus did a good job of explaining and tying together new concepts. I appreciated her sense of humor and clear answers to student questions. One of my only criticisms would be that class notes were often difficult to read, but I appreciated that they were posted online, to review afterward.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus does not do a good job on introducing new concepts to students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is very funny and smart, but I stopped going to her lectures because I didn't find that they added anything to my understanding of the topic. In fact, I often felt more confused. It's great that she posts the notes after class but they are quite hard to read (a lot of shorthand is used) and sometimes out of order. I really wish she would change to PowerPoints, which would probably be easier to follow and actually less work for her."

    "Useful for learning SAS and intro stats. Lab and class\/exams are somewhat separate.",
    "Good overview of statistics, fair workload for the difficulty of the material, sometimes logistically not well organized. I would say to test out if you already have a background in biostatistics.",

    "I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a helpful survey on a crucial aspect of public health. It proceeds at a steady rate to ensure the material is thoroughly understood.",
    "Necessary introductory course but the real knowledge I think will come in additional courses. Be prepared to teach yourself. Good introduction to SAS.",
    "This course is great for those who haven't programmed before, and once you overlook its early time, it's actually very interesting and useful.",
    "Hard yet good course.",
    "Class assignments were time consuming and a lot of work, but overall a good learning experience.",
    "It seems like a lot, but it is more than doable. You just need to commit to it, and reading the text book does help!",
    "I would recommend this class for obtaining a basic foundation of biostatistics. I think it could have been helpful to have more time to complete SAS labs, it was often difficult to learn the code and finish the assignment within the one hour lab period.",
    "difficult, lecture is hard to follow, book homework and lab are most helpful",
    "Don't need to go to lecture if you have a biostats background. Make sure you ask for help early.",
    "I would not. Like previously mentioned, I found this statistics course far less effective than previous statistics courses that I've taken. Many times, the lecture is not valuable to go to, and even more confusing than just teaching yourself from the book.",
    "Not very good for learning the concepts of biostatistics. If it were redesigned, it could be more conducive to learning the actual concepts as opposed to looking through the textbook and applying formulas that we do not fully understand, given the way the course is organized.",
    "Yes. It's a very helpful overview of basic statistics and provides a decent introduction to SAS.",
    "I would recommend it only because I believe statistics is important to being a public health professional. If there was an alternative professor, I would advice them not to take Professor Claus but someone else.",
    "Extremely useful and empowering for those who do not have a quantitative background. It left me feeling much more confident that I can keep up with the research literature and analyze data for myself, rather than just hopping to the conclusion and having it summarized for me. Stressful class - but the material is very useful!",
    "I would recommend this course if you have not taken statistics before and would like to learn basic statistical analysis methods. I enjoyed the applications to public health, and am now glad that I know how to use SAS (in the most basic sense). The tests were also open book\/open notes which took the focus away from memorizing formulas and gave me more time to focus on the reasoning behind certain methods.",
    "It's a required course, so yes I would recommend taking it. I had taken a stats course in undergrad, so considered exempting, but I'm glad I ended up taking it, mainly because I did not have any SAS experience. (It's possible to exempt and still audit the SAS lab, but I would recommend taking the course because many lectures incorporate SAS code\/output and I found this to be very useful.)",
    "This course was a great refresher\/introduction to statistics and the SAS programming language. If you are interested in learning statistics and how to apply it to the real world or your own research, this is a great course, although it does have a public health emphasis, which is something to be aware of if you are a non-public health student. I highly recommend this course.",
    "I audited SAS lab and found it a valuable tool to learn.",
    "Exempted out of course and audited lab",

    "strongly recommend",
    "I think even if you have some statistics background if you are new to SAS this class is helpful to understand some background statistical concepts and how to interpret SAS outputs and what they mean.",
    "You may have to teach yourself, but once you do, it is interesting and rewarding. It is a required class.",
    "The course is a good introduction to biostatistics. However, it is not particularly helpful in learning SAS because the SAS explanations are too intermittent.",
    "Good class that teaches you the basics of BIST",
    "Yes, I think it is very helpful learning all the content but the SAS labs are pretty stressful.",
    "This course is required for MPH students, unless you can exempt out of it. If you do take it, stay on top of lectures and actually come to class. If not, it will be near impossible to decipher class notes that Dr. Claus puts online. I think it is very possible to do well if you put the work in, and exams and homework assessments are fair. I got a good introduction on how to use SAS for various things and a good introduction to the basics of biostatistics. Overall, this class isn't so bad and you do learn a good amount!",
    "Even if you sort of took statistics during high school or undergrad, chances are that you're a little fuzzy on the concepts and the specifics. It is a bit of work, but so is any other class, so I would recommend that you take this class if you're serious about research, and even if you're not. You really feel more confident about your abilities to engage in future research projects with this course and it really gets you excited for continuing on in your studies here at the school.",
    "I would summarize this course as incredibly confusing and frustrating. I took biostatistics in college (about 7 years ago) and got an A. In this class, I was barely scraping by to pass. I had to hire a private tutor for 6 hours total in order for me to pass the final. I would not recommend the course to another student.",
    "This course was a solid introduction to biostats. I feel like I learned a lot. Though I felt a bit lost at the beginning, by the first homework I was more comfortable with the material.",
    "Since this class was required, I don't know if I have a choice to recommend it or not. However, it was definitely a valuable learning experience, learning the essential biostatistical tests needed to conduct and understand epidemiological public health research.",
    "As a required course, I would just say do all the homework and talk to the TAs as much as you can. Everything eventually makes sense and is actually helpful in understanding all of the research you will encounter at YSPH.",
    "I believe more structure would be helpful and more specific examples. Particularly using SAS I would have benefited from more specific instructions.",
    "For a student who has not taken statistics before, the class is solid in introducing the concepts. I would recommend this class as it provides a fundamental understanding that will surely be used in epidemiological analysis in later classes.",
    "Definitely learned a lot. Exams are fair.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend it if you are looking for a deeper understanding of statistics.",
    "This course is a requirement. It is helpful if you want to analyze data but if there is another Statistics course at Yale that you can take that will satisfy the requirement, I would take it instead of this one. The teaching will most likely be better and you will walk away with a better understanding of the material.",
    "Good introduction to biostatistics. The amount of information covered was sometimes overwhelming, but with time, the concepts began to make more sense.",
    "Yes. Very relevant course and it gives you a good introduction to the topic.",
    "Just make sure you go to lecture... I would recommend the course. It was very informative and I feel like I learned so much in just one semester.",
    "I certainly will recommend this course to another student. It is a class that gives you the necessary skills set and practical applications to analyzing research data and understanding research publications.",
    "I would not recommend if a student has a statistic background.",
    "Go to lecture!",
    "This class covers a broad range of statistical methods. I think this class is important, as it introduces you to SAS, which you will need during the second semester, but I wish they did a better job teaching SAS coding.",
    "Summary: This is an introductory biostatistics course. Many, if not all, of the concepts we learn are familiar, but set in the context of public health. I would recommend it. It re-established a strong foundation of statistics for me, after being away from statistics for more than two years since undergrad.",
    "This course is a great overview of biostats and also a great introduction to SAS.",
    "Very helpful skill-building class. Highly recommend.",
    "I thought this course was well taught. The lectures were straight forward and the concepts were explained in a systematic fashion. The homework was very applicable to what we were learning and was a good way to enforce that the students were practicing the concepts learned in class. I also appreciated that the tests were open note- the evaluations were fair. However, the 8:30 AM class time was brutal. I made sure to make it to every class, but I would have been much more alert and ready to learn if the class time had been later. Other negative was that grading was pretty harsh for the first few computer lab assignments. I would recommend it, especially since you have to take it. Even if you didn't, stats is an extremely important thing to know how to do.",
    "n\/a as the course is a requirement.",
    "An introduction to biostatistics, likely more applicable than an intro statistics class you've taken before, and one that integrates SAS knowledge",
    "Overall, this course was very useful for a novice in biostatistics to gain a basic understanding and grow in competency. My grasp of biostatistics is much better now, and it has helped me tremendously in terms of translating research findings in the literature. Dr. Claus is a very good teacher, and the workload is sufficient for learning without being too much to handle outside of class. The labs help reinforce the lectures, and the lectures help reinforce the labs; so it is a nice blend in structure. Given the course is required for most students except those who exempt, I would encourage students who do take the course to know that it is do-able and rewarding if they will put in the effort, as well.",
    "it is below average course. I had to work harder almost giving 50% of my study time to this course in order to understand the concepts behind all these equations",
    "Biostatistics is a foundation course for public health. I would not recommend taking Biostatistics with Professor Claus because she is not an effective teacher.",
    "This is an introduction to biostatistics, very similar to any intro statistics class you might have taken in undergrad. You begin to learn how to use SAS both during lecture and class. The workload and exams are both fair. I would recommend this course as an introduction or re-fresher to statistics.",
    "This is a very self-directed course. You need to be on top of the reading and its a bit of a self-taught course. Go to as many office hours you can because that is the only way you will know what is going on. Take your own notes because Dr. Claus' notes are completely illegible.",
    "Good information, lots of extra work to learn SAS, unhelpful teachers except Yasmmyn Salinas.",
    "Meet with the TA's every week as if office hours were also a class. It can be very difficult to digest all of the stats info along with SAS without help outside of lecture and lab.",
    "I would recommend it since this course helps you get started with the SAS program.",
    "I would advise anyone thinking about biostatistics to take this course. It seems to be a great introduction - it doesn't get into what seem to be the scary details of statistics. It gives just what you would need to have a sufficient understanding of statistics in public health\/medicine.",
    "I would recommend the student to study biostatistics because it is vital to public health, but the way this course is taught is not very clear, and most students had to teach themselves by reading the text book, hiring private tutors etc. It is clearly not the most well taught course at YSPH.",
    "Exempt out of it if you can, but you'll definitely need to take it if you can't. It's an incredibly useful and important topic, plus you don't really have any other options."
