    "Take it, especially if you're not sure about your major yet. It's a fun class despite the serious flaws with the project paper layout.",
    "I would recommend it. It, along with BIOL 103, provides a much more exciting part of the module.",
    "An exercise in frustration. Truly the biology sequence peaked with BIOL 102. Filling this out during reading week, I don't think I've ever felt less prepared for an exam and more frustrated with the course setup. The project (an evolution computer simulation) is overly ambitious. Too much emphasis is placed on scientific creativity when this is fundamentally curbed by programs that haven't been updated in years. The \"writing intensive\" designation is absurd. While there is writing involved, writing is certainly not developed as a skill and therefore this course should NOT count as fulfilling the skill requirement. Alternatively instructors could do more than tell students \"visit the writing center\". The TFs grade wildly inconsistently and project expectations are never fully clear\u2013different rubrics claim different requirements and ultimately none of them will be totally correct. While grades are supposedly curved by section at the end, distributions are made available only for the class as the whole. Consequently you never really know how your doing in the course until it's too late to reach out for help. And when you do reach out, don't expect to get what you need easily. Apart from Professor Mooseker, I've found nearly all the other professors uninterested and not-understanding when students find themselves in tricky situation.",
    "For a class that covers material that is probably uninteresting to most of the students, it was actually alright. Professor Buss does a good job of keeping everyone engaged and I was impressed by his depth and breadth of knowledge. However, the homeworks and class project felt completely separate from the course material. They didn't help you learn the course material and took up too much time. Have problem sets that actually help with the material and everyone will be much happier. Also, the required trips to the Peabody and Marsh Gardens were a waste of time. People already know about these resources and forcing them to go just wastes their time when they could be, again, learning the course material. Take this class because you have to or are interested in EEB.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not a very hard class.",
    "Take this class if you have to. There is no need to go to lecture.",
    "The class is very different than the other modules. It wasn't my area of interest, but it was still interesting.",
    "Would definitely recommend as a really nice introductory course. The material is fun, interesting, and relevant, and I enjoyed the material, instruction, and field trip.",
    "This is a fascinating class! Want to learn about how we arose from the primordial ooze? Then take this class. Leo Buss is an amazing lecturer, and you will learn more about the details and intricacies of evolution than you ever could have in AP Bio. I'm very glad I didn't try to skip it. The lectures are very different from the homeworks, section, and final project, as all of the latter assignments are focused on the three evolution simulators that you will explore a question with. But that's fun too! I didn't feel this class was too difficult or work intensive. Take it if you want to learn about evolution (or seashells)!",
    "Bio 104 is a very different approach to evolutionary biology than you may have previously experienced. Go into it with 101-103 in mind; it will really help you to make sense of what you have learned from a molecular to cellular to physiological level. Make sure you keep up with the material; there is a lot of material that's covered, and if you don't consistently review, the course material may not come together for you. And that's definitely what is tested on the final (i.e. bridging concepts together, not memorization).",
    "If you're thinking of taking this course, it's probably because you have to. No one really decides to take it out of \"pure interest.\" Given that you have to take this course, there's nothing you can do about it.",
    "104 is a decent module. The project is excessive but it's probably not going away any time soon, so PLEASE get started on it early. Professor Buss is pretty interesting and generally understandable, though he does tend to go off on tangents that are not particularly relevant. Overall, take it if you have to and be thankful that it's better than 102.",
    "Pretty standard evolutionary biology course where you'll learn the timeline of life on earth, how the first eukaryotes formed, what prompted the rise of different types of life, and other evolutionary topics. I'm not terribly fascinated in this sort of stuff but the class was definitely bearable, even engaging at times. The paper is a lot of work on the front end, but as long as you stay on top of it it's not so bad, and a good effort on the paper will almost certainly secure you a good grade in the course. Most of the work in this course happens in the first half (reading responses, psets, paper draft) and then in the second half you'll just be working on refining your paper. The final is only 20% of your final grade, which really alleviates a lot of pressure.",
    "Definitely my favorite of the bio modules. Prof. Buss is a very entertaining lecturer and class feels like more of him just telling interesting stories of Earth's history. Class was much more enjoyable than the other modules because I never felt like I was struggling to understand the material. Decent amount of work with the project and final, but the weekly quizzes were very easy and the reading responses weren't bad at all.",
    "I would. It was informative and intriguing.",
    "Bio 104 is interesting, and a feels like a pretty good culmination to the rest of the modules. It is kind of complex for an intro course, but not overwhelmingly so.",
    "worst of all 4 modules, tons of excessive and mindless work. you have no choice but to take it (for which I'm sorry) which makes it difficult to stay motivated and go to lectures",
    "Honestly, if I didn't have to take Biol 104, I wouldn't. But not because it's not interesting--just that I never had too much passion in evolutionary biology. However, aside from being a required premed requirement, this course is jam-PACKED with fun knowledge and info that just can't be beat anywhere else!",
    "Yes- especially if pre med",
    "If you're thinking about it then you probably have to take it so it doesn't really matter",
    "It's not all that bad",
    "Bio 104 is your intro to the history of evolution and evolutionary biology! It was my favorite module because Professor Buss was a really great lecturer! This does have more of a geological history feel to it, but it's still really great because Professor Buss takes you from the origins of the Earth to all of the evolution to the present Era! He also coats this timeline with a really refreshing philosophical perspective on science. Beware of the project though; it's a major time commitment and should be treated as such from the get go. Really do yourself a favor here, save yourself some sleep, and start early. Please.",
    "BIOL 104 is a great class that is very different from the other modules. You get a really nice, useful history of the Earth and life on it from 4.5 billion years to present. Leo is also an incredible lecturer; on the first day, you'll find him eccentric, but as the module goes on you'll find he's very thoughtful and eloquent. I would recommend the course to another student but strongly advise them to do the readings while the class goes on; it's immensely helpful.",
    "Really interesting course that teaches the basics of evolutionary biology. Basically a mix of geological history, evolution, physiology. Lot of work.",
    "Probably my favorite out of the four bio modules, but definitely the most work.",
    "Learning a lot about Evolutionary Biology but not in very integrated ways. It's almost like you're taking two separate classes. One with section and the Biology 101 project. The other involving lecture.",
    "It's the best one four modules, but also the most work out of all of them. The work isn't even that helpful. You learn a lot a fairly basic information, mixed with many details about things you are not responsible for later. You probably have to take it for Bio, so do, but don't expect to love it too much.",
    "pretty useless. if you really want to learn evolution, take a course that actually teaches it",
    "DO NOT TAKE.",
    "if you don't have to do not take this class. if you can get signed off for a higher class then do it. i would only suggest this class if they chill on the writing credit aspect of it bc i've taken science classes that are writing credits that try to teach you how to write a paper and provide actually feedback section by section as well as examples and lectures on how to write each section. THIS IS NOT THAT.",
    "BIOL 104 was okay. I feel like the way it was structured was very confusing as it was happening, but at the end of the semester in retrospect I was able to piece the information together in a way that kind of made sense. The final research paper is serious and should be started early - it is a big pain to do, and you have a final exam. But if you have to take it, then you've got to do what has to be done.",
    "Least favorite of the modules, really specific things to memorize and not a lot of concepts to grasp. Annoying sometimes. Project felt like busy-work",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Buss is very passionate about the subject and the lectures were all very eye-opening. You learned a lot about all aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology and you\u2019d be surprised how much you thought you knew that was wrong. It also definitely provides a good overview of the history of the earth and changes your perspective on the world around you. From writing the final paper, you really learn about how to write a research paper well, something that every student who wants to go into should be introduced to early in their academic career. The weekly in section quizzes may sound like a pain, but they are graded so that 7\/10 is full credit so this forces you to review the material each week as the course progresses, making sure that you actually retain the material while it\u2019s still fresh in your mind. All in all, this is a really great course and one of the better bio modules!",
    "Bio 104 will teach you a lot about the basic concepts of evolution, but you get out of it what you put in. If you regularly attend lectures, study well, and get excited about your final project, you'll truly enjoy the class.",
    "Many lectures were very boring, because I was not interested in the history of the Earth, but you'd like this if you're into Geology. Some lectures were interesting, especially the one taught by Professor Chandhoke on sexual selection. Project is a huge portion of your grade but the benchmark and draft make it more manageable.",
    "The lectures are great. The project is fun. Putting them both together, though, not so much. If you take the time to do the project well, your grades that are based on what Buss talks about in lecture will suffer; if you do all the readings and pay attention in lecture and read through the study guides, your project will suffer. Try to find a balance between these two largely unrelated components of the course, or it probably won't work out all that well for you.",
    "Basically this class is the best and worst of bio modules. Best because Buss lectures are engaging interesting dramatic and in the end some of the best I've heard at Yale. Worst because the project is absolute garbage. I understand the motivation behind the project but in the end assigning 50% of your course grade to a subjective assessment by your TF is just stupid. The exam was great and forced you to apply class concepts to new ideas; I learned a lot just from the exam. If this class had the 2 exam structure like 102 it would be the best module by far.",
    "Take bio 104!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously 101 and 102 are a drag, but 104 makes it worth it. You learn a TON and it will change the way you see a lot of things in your daily life- evolution is everywhere!!! And Buss is awesome too",
    "Great course! The research projects are frustrating and probably my least favorite part of all of the modules, but the rest of the course is excellent.",
    "Bio 104 was an introduction into evolutionary biology. I would recommend Bio 104 to someone who needs a biology background for their major or are pre-med.",
    "I would summarize this course as a great introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the subject and some cool facts about animals, history, and evolution.",
    "A good intro to evolutionary biology--interesting lectures! Recommended.",
    "Often people say in these reviews, \"blah, you have to take it anyway.\" Buss is a compelling lecturer who made the material fascinating and fun. I would recommend this class to anyone! The field trips made it interactive and awesome!",
    "Great class! Definitely my favorite part of the bio sequence. The term paper helps you understand evolution in a much more thorough way, and Professor Buss is wonderful.",
    "Bio 104 is a mish-mash of evolutionary biology for beginner biologists. I would recommend the class if you need a half credit or a biology course.",
    "A great finish to an essential course. Bio 104 is a nice way to end the intro sequence--like all the others, it covers biology essentials, but it's more engaging than the previous modules (again, as a EEB major, I am somewhat biased). Not too much work as science courses go, not ridiculously difficult--the final project is big, but they make a point of getting you to start early and actually plan it.",
    "Take it!!! I enjoyed it a lot! Overall, I really enjoyed the 101-104 bio sequence!",
    "12\/10",
    "This is the worst module of all 4. Professor Buss is a pretty engaging lecturer and most of the people around me enjoyed his lecturing style. If you like ecology\/evolution, you'll love this module. I hated those topics so I hated this module. The quizzes are finally fair and easy. However, the project is hella annoying and takes up so much time and I really don't think you learn that much from it. Also, be warned that the final is really random and out of left field. It's also weird that they choose to base the grade of this class on pretty much one project and one final. Very stressful. Don't be afraid of taking it though. He's a pretty nice dude and you might just end up liking it better than I did.",
    "THIS CLASS IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!! I would not wish this course on my worst enemy. I honestly feel that this is such a poorly organized and taught class for so many reasons. 1. First of all, there is no standardization between teaching fellows. One teaching fellow runs their section one way and grades ones way and allows extensions and another teaching fellow does not. Professor Chandhoke will tell you not to worry and that she standardizes all the grades at the end of the term so there should be no discrepancy between different sections but this also affects students during the semester, not just their final grade. There definitely needs to be more standardization between sections. 2. This course has WAY to many modes of evaluation, meaning way to much work for this BIOL module. In addition to a final paper that is 50% of your grade, the course has a final exam, weekly quizzes, problems sets, reading responses, and mandatory discussion sections. That is literally every possible mode of evaluation being used in one class. This results in a very stressful course environment in which something is always due, and the course has the most harsh and unreasonable late policy ever. The reading responses were completely unnecessary and graded very harshly for no reason (especially since at the beginning of the class the professor said that the point of the reading responses was just to make sure that students were doing the reading so grading the reading responses harshly makes no sense if that was their purpose). The problem sets were tedious and not helpful as well. Also, the professor of this class needs to decide between having a final exam or a final paper (you cannot have both, sorry, it's just unreasonable). 3. The information presented in lecture by Professor Buss has nothing to do with the project or problem sets. I literally could have done the project and problem sets without being in the class because listening to lecture was not helpful or relevant in any way to doing the project or the problem sets. This class is poorly organized because lecture should be helpful to the students in some way, and this lecture absolutely was not. 4. The reading response, problem sets and assignments leading up to the final draft of the project were all turned back to the students way too late. My TA would give comments on my reading responses but only turned them back to me after I had already submitted all of my reading responses so I had no ability or opportunity to improve and use the comments to better my reading responses. Please tell me how that is useful to anyone? Same goes for returning graded problem sets. THE ASSIGNMENTS THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO TURN IN STRICTLY ON TIME NEED TO BE RETURNED TO THE STUDENTS BEFORE THE NEXT ASSIGNMENT IS DUE SO THE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO LEARN AND IMPROVE FROM THEIR TAs COMMENTS!! Otherwise, grading at all is pointless and useless. This was the most frustrating part of this course. My TA never turned back my assignments on time or even in a timely manner and this ended up hurting me and my grade in this class, because I did not benefit from any of his edits or advice at all.",
    "Definitely one of my favorite modules. Most of the grade depends on the project, so work hard on that! Other than that, there aren't the weekly quizzes, so stress levels won't be too high.",
    "too much extraneous work, esp for an 0.5 credit class. I felt that that the final project had nothing to do with the final subject material. Also, the final was picky and not comprehensive...it undermined the importance of all the potentially interesting material Buss' was trying to teach.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, if just for the lectures. Professor Buss and Professor Chandhoke are great, even if the project is not so great.",
    "This class is so much more writing than you would expect. But it the content is really interesting! It has helped me understand where humans came from and how life works. It almost feels like a philosophy class as much as a science class.",
    "It's a prerequisite, but I did enjoy this module more than the others.",
    "Take it--it's a good course that's really hands-on.",
    "Yes. Best out of the 4 modules, very interesting material",
    "One of the better modules in the Bio sequence. If you make it past first semester in the sequence, you might as well do the second semester because it is more interesting.",
    "More exciting than advertised, in spite of the silly evolution simulations. Professor Buss is a terrifically interesting lecturer, and if not for the final paper, this class might have been my favorite of the four bio modules.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it was very interesting and fun to take.",
    "I would reccomend 104, and describe it as a intro class to thinking about evolutionary biology.",
    "This module had a more constant demand of work, from psets to reading responses and the final paper. Lectures were interesting, although there was often an excess of information, but having lecture outlines helped narrow down what you should focus on. Because it's a writing credit, be prepared to put effort into the paper, and especially get as much feedback as you can for the rough draft.",
    "It's a great intro bio course! I definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely. Professor Buss's lectures are funny and brilliant and make you think about things differently, and the way topics are presented is fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this module, it was my favorite of all four! The material is really interesting, you get to go on a field trip, and if you have Ben as your TA and Surjit for Enrichment, you are set.",
    "It was my favorite out of all the modules because it was more of a story than the other three. This could be in part because I am more of a humanities person, but I thought the information was interesting and relevant and was on more of a macro scale.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Do not take this course unless you have to. Also, I hope you're not dissuaded from going into biology because of this atrocious sequence. It's tedious, boring, and a lot of work that you don't want to do. Best of luck if you have to take it, and thank me later if you were thinking about it but decided against it!",
    "It's a good introduction to the history of evolution.",
    "Easy, quite interesting subject, and very well organized.",
    "This is one of those courses, similar to Intro Psych, that is useful for any student in any major, considering any field. Evolution is so relevant to our current intellectual and even popular discourse, and this course provides a way to dialogue knowledgeably about it, as well as clear up common misconceptions about evolution. It is well taught, and you get a lot of \"bang for your buck\" in terms of time commitment vs. lasting benefit to you.",
    "This is definitely a survey course. I enjoy evolutionary biology, and despite some interesting concepts that were brought up, I was pretty disappointed with how dispersed the material was. Also, the project is graded very harshly, so make sure you follow instructions as closely as possible!",
    "I would recommend Bio 104 over the other 3 modules (except maybe the 3rd - I really liked that one as well) in a heartbeat. It's a nice change from the strictly hard science courses that most science majors\/pre-meds take at Yale, and it's even half of a writing cred (which sounds useless, but there is another lab that offers half..). If you don't need it, don't take it, but after suffering through the other modules, you'll find a hidden gem in this one for the end of the year."
