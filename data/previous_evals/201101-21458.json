   "comments": [
    "This course is THE course to take if you can devote the time (9:25-11:15 every day, this semester) and are serious about learning Spanish -- no one takes an intensive course if they're not truly interested in learning the language. And if Professor Safille is teaching it, there's really no excuse NOT to take it (she's SO DEDICATED and awesome). Professor Safille always shows up to class early so I recommend showing up a few minutes early, too -- to chat, get to know this amazing woman, before classes. You won't regret it.The workload is reasonable and not humanly impossible (unlike FREN 145), but it does take constant effort throughout the semester. The class formally is worth 2.0 credits but in my opinion should be worth 2.5 or even 3.0 for the intensity of it all. That quibble over credits is really my only complaint about this class, but it's fine, really, and I only mention it so you can get a better idea when planning your own schedules.",
    "Yes, absolutely. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale--really useful!",
    "Yes, take this class (and try to take it with Barbara Safille!). SPAN 145 is a lot of work, but you will have proficiency in Spanish by the end of the semester. Not a bad deal. It meets 5 days a week and has daily homework, as well as a few quizzes, tests, oral exams, and presentations.The readings and movies are very interesting and will help you expand your vocab. If you have a good group of classmates, like I did, class discussion will be fun and the two hours will go by very quickly. If you can take this class with Barbara Safille, do it! She is an extraordinary professor--great teacher, a lot of fun, and reasonable\/fair. One of the best at Yale.",
    "It's a lot of work, but if you want to learn the language, this course will do that.",
    "This was one of the best educational decisions I've ever made in my life. First of all, Barbara: Barbara is the best professor I have ever had. I will miss her so much. She is so good at presenting new information, pointing out probable traps, answering questions, being supportive, articulating subtle differences and just being an all around wonderful human being that I will probably take another spanish class just to have her again. Second, I placed into L3 out of high school then waited to my junior year to take this class. It was PERFECT in how it balanced review and new material, and it got my entire language req out of the way in one go. Yourspanish will genuinely improve by leaps and bounds in a way I doubt you would get if you took non-intensive. Seriously, though: Barbara Safille should be all the reason you need.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 145, especially if Barbara Safille is teaching it (although I'm guessing it's hard to come bya bad prof. for this course). It does get repetitive after L1 and L2, but I think it's the best way to do L3\/L4, since it's all one course and you get it done in the semester. The syllabus is weak, but I think it's marginally better than the two syllabi for the individual L3 and L4 courses, so I would recommend it. But if you do it, make sure you get the most out of it and pay attention to what you're learning.",
    "It is a hard course but if a student wants to learn Spanish and is willing to put a lot of effort into it, I do recommend they take this class."
