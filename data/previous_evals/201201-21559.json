    "One of my favorite classes at yale. don't miss the chance to observe at one of the most well run daycares that you'll find anywhere. Professors are awesome. Small seminar style class. journal entries are fun and rewarding to write.",
    "Great class to get away from the Yale environment and work with children",
    "Yes. absolutely take it. wonderful. you learn so much. if you want to be a parent, doctor, better citizen : take it",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to others. It is a great opportunity for anyone interested in early childhood education and development. I learned so much more than if I had just read a book or two and feel that the opportunity to observe a preschool class, with specific subject-matter focuses was an invaluable experience.",
    "Great class. A great overview to language and literacy acquisition and how play is an important medium of acquiring language and literacy. I would definitely recommend the class. Strengths were in the diverse students in the class, phenomenal professors, and the various observations (not just at Calvin Hill but also in other early childcare settings). Weakness was that (sometimes) there was very little room for discussion after the guest speakers.",
    "Take it! This class is amazing, perhaps one of the best I have taken at Yale. I thought going into it that having to go all the way to Calvin Hill would be awful, but it is really not that bad (blue line drops you in front of Calvin Hill). In fact, you get to enjoy it after some time, because every class you learn so much and the observations are just incredible. You get to observe little kids and see how the theory you are learning in class applies in practice. Also, Calvin Hill is an amazing day care, and just being there you learn so much from the teacher and everyone else.",
    "If you are interested in teaching this class is amazing...if you are interested in child development this class is absolutely brilliant...if you are interested in language development this class is outstanding.Although it is a long trek to class, it well-worth the effort! Reading material and lectures are interesting, but the best part of the class is the observation period. For two hours every week, you will be asked to observe in a preschool or Kindergarten classroom. Each week, students write reactionary journals discussing what they have seen and supporting their thoughts with the reading.The pace of the class is totally consistent. I never felt overwhelmed.Carla and Nancy are amazing resources! They are totally approachable and have amazing insights. All you have to do is ask!Among my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale!",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale. Fun class, observations are better, and not too much work.",
    "This is a very good course. The observations, especially, are fun and rewarding. Calvin Hill is quite a trip, though; you'll have to make sure you catch the bus on time.",
    "YES, if you are interested in and like spending time with children. The lectures are interesting and the observations will become one of the highlights of your week.",
    "Language Literacy and Play is a very unique Yale psychology course, and I would say is essential for anyone interested in developmental psychology. Waking up early was tough, but worth it. The work load isn't too burdensome, and it clearly relates to what you are learning. The teaching is fantastic, and you learn a lot in the observations. I recommend it!",
    "A wonderful introduction to the role of play (and language and literacy) in child development. Promises to have great students as well as great professors. Nancy and Carla are expert teachers and take feedback seriously. Don't be afraid to talk to them!"
