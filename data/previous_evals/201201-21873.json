   "comments": [
    "Sure! As an introductory course it clarifies many current debates in Political Science. Good material, papers are not so difficult and you learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about global politics and political theory. However, this is not a current events class-- there is a lot of conceptual information that will be boring to people not truly interested in it. I'm happy I took the course and hope to take more classes with Prof. Simon in the future.",
    "your classic intro class. overall very informative, if you put in the work you will definitely gain a lot of very valuable knowledge",
    "This is a basic Poli Sci class; you certainly get out of it what you put in. There are opportunities for you to further explore topics that are discussed in class in the three papers. It you are interested in the topic you choose, they are interesting to write. I would recommend the class to a student who has not yet taken a Poli Sci course at Yale. If you have, most of the class will be review.",
    "Comparative Politics is an excellent introduction to foundational political science ideas, and is an good complement to International Relations. Lectures are actually rather interesting, and the work load is on the lighter end. Many of the topics are very accessible to current events. Prof. Simon is very invested in making sure that you succeed and the TAs were wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This class is quite chill, an interesting overview of a field quickly growing in popularity. While not the most rigorous or challenging class (an understatement), it's a great 5th class or Cred\/D option, and Professor Simon is an engaging lecturer and a sweetheart. Highly recommend.",
    "Political science 116 is a good course for anyone interested in poly sci. I would recommend it to anyone interested in political science or who needs another course that's not too difficult.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. Even if you dislike politics and anything having to do with it, you will find this course worthwhile.",
    "I got a lot out of Intro to Comparative Politics. The readings were fascinating--both the textbook readings, and the scholarly articles. Prof. Simon is incredibly knowledgeable about the field. The paper assignments really helped me understand the process of comparative politics. Once you get to know his style, Prof. Simon's lectures are interesting and often hilarious!",
    "Take this course.",
    "This course covers a wide variety of topics and is very manageable as far as workload goes. It is a good introductory course if you want to better understand political systems in other countries and so I would recommend this course for someone with little to no knowledge on the subject.",
    "I would summarize the course as a very good introductory course to the subject of comparative politics. I would definitely recommend it to another student."
