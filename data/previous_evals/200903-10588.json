   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with very different and challenging perspectives compared to the usual biases of my discipline.",
    "I found the course very useful in several aspects:- As I am interested in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th century, it was a good to become familiar with this eminent modern reading of Kant`s and Hegel`s Aesthetics.- Trying to understand\/ understanding Adornos \"\u00c4sthetische Theorie\" also helped me - if it is allowed to say so - to develop a clearer understanding of dialectical thinking.- Moreover, the seminar has strenghened my ability in reading philosophical texts in general."
