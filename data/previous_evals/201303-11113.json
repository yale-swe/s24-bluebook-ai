   "comments": [
    "This class is a great way to work on Moroccan Arabic, and no matter your level, Professor Elbousty will tailor the course to fit your needs. I would recommend that you should be fairly comfortable in Modern Standard Arabic before coming to this course, since a good understanding of Standard Arabic grammar will make it easier to adapt to Darija and understand whereit is similar and where different. The cultural element of the class is also wonderful, and this semester we ate Moroccan food and Ustadh Youness brought us Moroccan tea one day, which was wonderful. It's a very fun class, and if you put in the effort, you can get a lot out of it.",
    "Moroccan Arabic is a very student-specific language. It has few practical benefits unless one has some connection to Morocco or hopes to lie there. However, I would also recommend this course to those who are interested in linguistics since Moroccan Arabic is a linguistically unique language.",
    "I would recommend Arabic 193 01 to another student. I learned the basics of Moroccan Arabic, and after taking this class, I would feel comfortable traveling to Morocco and communicating with native Moroccan speakers. It is probably necessary to have some Arabic training already as the class moves quickly and not much time was spent on learning Arabic letters, though Professor Elbousty would definitely go out of his way to help anyone who was interested in taking the class that may be a bit behind in Arabic knowledge.",
    "While the Moroccan Arabic course certainly has a few kinks to be worked out, I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student. The opportunity to learn the Moroccan dialect is a great opportunities for students of Standard Arabic to enrich their Arabic experience with a spoken dialect, especially as Morocco increasingly is becoming one of the few Arabic-speaking countries it is practical for Americans to study abroad in.",
    "I would say take this if you've been to Morocco\/have interest in going, you should take this class. The Moroccan dialect of Arabic has such a unique influence of French and other languages that it's hard to miss out of this opportunity if presented because since it's an oral language, it's hard to pick up on a visit."
