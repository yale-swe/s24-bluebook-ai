   "comments": [
    "This was a good course. It is assumed that you are familiar with the basics like conjugations already, so the course jumps straight into actual grammatical rules. As someone who didn't have a super rigorous Spanish background going in, I found the material to be pretty nuanced and specific (in a good way) but not overwhelming. There is a fair amount of work - there's stuff due every class - and it could use some streamlining: there's usually an online component, a few exercises from the textbook, possibly a worksheet from the course packet, and occasional bigger assignments like compositions. That being said, I think this is a good option for students who are looking for an L5 Spanish and would rather focus on the language itself rather than, say, medical terms.",
    "This is a good course for someone who wants to do L5 Spanish without having to read intensive Spanish Literature. It really improves your writing and reading abilities, and helps your speaking although to a lesser extent. This class is a natural extension of L4 or AP Spanish Language, and is really not too difficult for an L5 class. There is a lot of work but its never really too difficult and is mostly graded for completion.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to improve your Spanish grammar and are willing to devote significant time to it.",
    "It's a good class and there is a lot of work to do day-to-day, but it is worth it because I definitely left with a better understanding of Spanish grammar. It's not always super fun but you'll learn a lot especially if you have extra time to put into it.",
    "The class requires a lot of work to mastering all aspects of the spanish language, with regard to grammar. If you keep up with the work, you will learn a lot and do well. I would definitely recommend this class because although it was quite tedious, it was very helpful and not overly difficult.",
    "This class is essentially a rigorous look into Spanish grammar, and our professor was very upfront about the workload and what it would take. If you enjoy that sort of thing, then this would be the course for you. I did enjoy the portion of the course where we talked to partners at another university from Ecuador, which I believe improved my confidence speaking and allowed me to be more careful about my grammar. This class is not a gut by any means, and may be one of the hardest Spanish classes out there, but it is good for improving core Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student looking to improve their Spanish, but only those that are willing to work for it. There are lots of assignments but it is worth it.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn more grammar and become very good at nuanced parts of the language. However, there is a LOT of work and it is not just an \"easy language class.\" You also don't learn that much vocabulary."
