    "This course was a great crash course in the Middle East and in how Muslim societies struggle to reconcile the traditions of their faith and the pull of modernization.While most of my classmates had far greater knowledge about the region, I learned a lot from both them and the wonderful Professor Erami.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a lot of work but very rewarding because you learn a lot about Middle Eastern culture through ethnographies and you don't need any previous experience studying the middle east",
    "A fantastic course. The ethnographies, articles, and films were are spectacular and helped me quickly familiarize myself with the Middle East on a specific and personal level. Overall, an amazing, eye-opening course. There are no weaknesses in my opinion. Dr. Erami - what a wealth of knowledge! Professor Erami is a wonderful teacher, always warm, welcoming and willing to help. Her understanding of the Middle East - especially Iran - and of philosophical\/anthropological\/political\/economic discourse in general was so valuable, and I hope every student has the chance to interact with and learn from her. Some peers felt her lecture style to be less effective, but I think it was more helpful to be able to interact with the professor during class, and it seems like such interaction is just part of who Erami is as a teacher. Brava!",
    "Very very interesting readings. Rare opportunity to get insight into the Middle East on a more personal basis through reading ethnographies rather than discussing politics, history, and religion generally. You write a lot of papers. They're short (~5 pages), but there are 7 of them, though at least there's no final, so you'll have a stress-free end of semester if you can space them out well. The professor is really sweet and very interesting when one-on-one. However, she is not a great lecturer to say the least because she can seem very timid and not entirely sure of the things she is saying even though in reality she does actually know her stuff. While this might not seem like such a bigdeal, it actually hugely affects the quality of class. The most interesting unit was on Iran because her confidence with the material came across the most. I wouldn't recommend the class, but I would def. recommend talking to the professor because she's pretty cool.",
    "The course involves the in-depth consideration of six ethnographies on various topics and countries of the Middle East, focusing particularly on Muslim societies within the region. This means that every two weeks, a new country and corresponding issue is brought up for discussion, which keeps the course very interesting. A paper is written to correspondwith each book, allowing for development of writing skills. It is also fascinating to see how the books connect with each other as the course progresses and student knowledge of the region expands. I would highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a nonconventional approach to increasing their familiarity with the modern Middle East, beyond the usual historical or political survey courses.",
    "A good ethnographic overview of the Muslim Middle East; one book every two weeks with a short response paper attached + 2 papers at the end. Definitely take the class for a Wr as it's fun, topical, and the profs and TAs are great. At ~30 people, it's a good balance between seminar sized and huge lecture. If Kinga is TAing this course again, definitely choose her section, she is the best as is Professor Erami!!!I think that Professor Erami made the class. Unlike most professors, who are uptight or unsure about how to relate to their students, I always felt comfortable in her class. A nice consequence of liking your professor is feeling bad when you miss class, which is always a good incentive not to do so. I thought Professor Erami wove cultural, historical, and linguistic elements well together, and I arrived at a better understanding of Muslim societies that will likely stay in my brain better than a laundry-list of facts would have.I think, if the class were to be improved, I would recommend one final paper on a book or movie of one's own choosing (5-6 pgs) rather than 2 papers at the end; although they are supposed to be short, I found them really stressful - I also wanted to write about a different country that we hadn't discusses and I think that that woud've been a nice space t do so.",
    "A great way to enlighten yourself about Middle East culture in case you were so obliviously ignorant as I was. Work consisted of 7 1000-word essays on the books we read in class and on a film and some event you attend. This can be either very easy for you, or if you struggle with writing, (like myself) very hard. You are never given a thesis and most always come up with your own.",
    "Don't take this! It was a ton of work -- 7 papers and reading 6 250 page ethnographies. The lectures were disorganized and sections were even worse. Grading seemed arbitrary. If they turn this into a seminar, it may be worth taking. If not, please skip it.",
    "Do it!",
    "Great class especially if you are interested in middle east politics and current affairs. The assignments are also flexible and allow a good balance between directed and independent research.",
    "I loved this class. I would recommend it highly. It is not a survey course on the middle east but I still feel like I got a ton out of it. And, Professor Erami is fantastic.",
    "Section was good. Kinga was very willing to meet with us outside of class and help us with our writing. She gave good feedback and discussions in section were interesting.",
    "Interesting class. Study 6 different regions of the middle east reading 6 ethnigraphies about each region. Recommended!",
    "It's a good course if you're looking to learn about different regions of the middle east, however, I would recommend looking at the books you are going to read for the course before you decide whether or not to take it, as it may be too theoretically dense. Overall, a very interesting course, with a very enthusiastic and knowledgable professor."
