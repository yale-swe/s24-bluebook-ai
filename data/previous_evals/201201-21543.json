    "i was a great class and i definitely reccomend it to anyone",
    "Interesting subject matter. not the most exciting lecture but at least its not dull. the reading is a lot, split it with a class mate. other than that the day to day is really easy. block out a good chunk of time to study for the midterm and the final.",
    "Great material. Really straightforward. Easy to to well if you attend lecture, take good notes and study for the midterm and final.",
    "It's an incredible class! Really interesting material and accessible to anyone (not just Sociology majors). Definitely take it if you have any interesting in learning about crime.",
    "This was a great class-- reasonable amounts of work, broad range of topics (all very interesting) and you leave with a good understanding of the sociological process of researching these topics.",
    "Easy class, good for sociology basics.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is looking for a fairly easy class or trying to get a credit out of the way. At the same time, this is definitely NOT a gut class. The work load is very light -- two articles a week, each 20-30 pages long, and you can get the basic gist sufficient enough to know for tests from skimming the intro\/conclusion and headings. However, when the midterm and final roll around you will be expected to memorize literally everything you heard in class, seemingly small details included, and regurgitate it. Don't expect any help from class slides, which are so sparse and unorganized that they are more confusing than clarifying. While the course material is not all that compelling, it is fairly interesting and Professor Smith is a good guy, too."
