    "French 150 is a great L5 course that will help you to improve your proficiency in reading, speaking, and writing. Students read a few short literary works and an engaging mystery novel, watch a few films, and write five essays, each about three pages in length. There's a decent amount of work, but it's by no means oppressive. If you are interested in French and want to improve your skills, then it's an excellent class to take. Madame Hoffmann is very dynamic and a great professor.",
    "Take this class! You really become much better at reading, writing, and speaking French by the end of the semester. The class is fun too, with a lot of interesting texts\/films. At first the class\/workload can be a bit intimidating if you haven't taken French at Yale before, but don't worry, you get used to it very quickly and then the class is great! Do be advised that there is a decent amount of work, but it is definitely worth it. I particularly recommend taking Mme Hoffman's section - she's extremely nice and a great teacher (and from France!).",
    "It is a great and manageable L5 course. The literature is easy to grasp and you get a good introduction to French literature and a fairly laid back environment. You also have the opportunity to learn a great deal from your peers. I would definitely recommend this course as a precursor to advanced French study at Yale.",
    "Analysis and discussion of French novels, films, and plays. Grammar is mostly review\/polishing of topics that students have probably already learned. Several essays\/writing assignments. I would definitely recommend this class! Although it was very challenging, I think my French improved tremendously. The books and movies we watched were interesting.",
    "Good class. It was pretty difficult, however, in the beginning. All students come from different backgrounds, so it can be truly intimidating when freshmen who have been speaking french for 9 years are sitting next to you. But the class is done pretty well. Most of the short stories, novels, and movies are interesting. Madame Hoffmann is truly a great teacher; if you are having any problems go to office hours and explain your situation and she only wants to help! The oral tests are easy, honestly. Just prepare a speech for thefirst part and use a lot of vocab. The \"surprise\" questions are always easy. There are 4 essays and 4 tests; the essays are fine but can be graded strictly. You are expected to write at high school french level, which was difficult for me since I had only been taking french for one year.My problems with this course lie in there french department:1. The way the department tests vocab is absurd. They make you write a short essay on each test in which you must correctly use 20 vocab words (without list). You are graded on grammar, vocab, and quality of essay. I always lost lots of points because \"the vocab seemed forced.\" Obviously! It is impossible to write a good essay in a short amount of time and spew out all these vocab words in a coherent essay.2. More poetry!3. Would have days where no homework is due, and others where we would have to watch a 2 hour movie and write a 4 page essay. The department needs to evenly spread workload, or cut some.",
    "French 150 is basically a review of what you learn for the French AP test in high school. The format of the class is a self-guided one, in which you teach yourself the grammar outside of the class meetings and then discuss the literature or film currently being studied during the section. I recommend this course if you are interested in pursuing further French classes; the course itself is not the most exciting offering at Yale, but it is an avenue to higher level class offerings in the French department.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course with Professor Hoffmann! She's really sweet, and quite helpful. There is a lot of essay writing involved, but the readings are interesting. The grammar work is mostly done by yourself at home, so it's more review than learning new material.",
    "This is a good class to take if your foundations in French need refreshing or if you're coming out of a high school AP or IB preparation (as was the case for me). Don't be frustrated if there are upperclassmen in the class;the teachers accommodate everyone and parts of the grade are based on participation and effort, which helps. Not the best selection of literature or films, in my opinion, but we are taught well and what we were promised. It was more work than I expected, but all within reason."
