   "comments": [
    "Beware if you've never taken a language before: this course is FAST paced. You learn about 8 verb tenses and probably over 1000 vocabulary words within the course of a single semester. It's easy to fall behind or forget what you learn as you go along. It's pretty demanding workwise: you have a quiz and a test almost every week as well as an essay and rewrite due every week in addition to homework from the textbook every night and workbook at the end of the units. I wouldn't say the class does a particularly good job in teaching speaking skills but that's probably to be expected in an intro course. Anna is honestly one of the sweetest women you'll ever meet and you can really tell how much she loves the Italian language and Italian culture-- and she wants YOU to love it, too. She made the course bearable.",
    "If you are looking for an easy language credit, this is not the class for you. Italian 110 02 takes a lot of work and dedication but by the end of it you will be surprised with what you know. The Italian department is great and excited to teach new students. If you are genuinely interested in learning the language and about Italian culture, this is definitely the class to take.",
    "Honestly, this class is a lot of work as you are looking at around 1-2 hours every night. However, if you are like me and quite interested in learning Italian, I can't imagine there is a better person to take the class from than Prof. Iacovella. She is extremely nice and supportive. If you are willing to do the work, then you will be rewarded as Italian is a great language to learn!",
    "Yes. The work was enough to get me to learn the material, but never so much that it seemed pointless, as can happen in language classes.",
    "Yes i would recommend italian for someone to fulfill their language requirement. it is easy to learn.",
    "Great intro class, take it if you want a language you really want to enjoy.",
    "Italian 110 02 is a course of great grammatical depth aided by the instructor's great familiarity with both English and Italian. The course does not always develop the vocabulary or speaking skills of the students as much as their grammatical skills, but it sets up a great grammatical foundation upon which vocabulary and speaking skills can be built in further classes.",
    "Good introduction to Italian. There's a fair amount of work, much of it busy but not too many difficult concepts if you've studied foreign language before. Anna Iacovella is very nice and knows what she's doing, but doesn't always give the clearest explanations of ideas in class."
