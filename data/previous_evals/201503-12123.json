    "Best class I have ever taken. I can hardly think of a better academic preparation for life in a globalized world.",
    "Debates in Macroeconomics is a survey of different macroeconomic issues to which you apply the theory you learned previously. I highly recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class, but be forewarned, you will be cold called, and the professors will know (and point out) when you don't know what you're talking about. Great professors and fantastic discussions. The reading list is insane though, and the HW is reasonably hefty.",
    "It was a dry Econ course that I had to take for my major. Having 2 professors kept things more interesting. A lot of the same China stuff repeated over and over again.",
    "It's a valuable class that lets you go deep into the latest research and developments in economics. It, however, requires the following, which may be deterring factors for some: 1) a deep interest in economics, and a solid foundation to accompany that. Knowledge of things like the Philips curve, neoclassical theory etc. is necessary (or at least needs to be picked up on the go). 2) a willingness and ability to speak up in class - prepare to be cold-called, and prepare to give thought-out and reasonable answers (it is not as scary as it seems initially; I was extremely intimidated at the start, but it got a lot better as the semester progressed) 3) an ability to synthesise a ton of information right before the midterm and exam. And it's a lot! Prepare well, give yourself enough time to go through all the research papers discussed... :( 4) tolerance (?) at being in the same class with a lot of outspoken and opinionated people... :|",
    "This is definitely the best class I've taken at Yale so far. It's a lecture that's treated as a seminar; the workload is really light; and you learn a ton. Don't be intimidated by the readings (or by your fellow classmates!). They are hard, but you only really need to know the main ideas (i.e. read the abstracts). Reading the full papers is definitely worth doing though. They also go over all of the major papers in class\/section. Aleh and Roach are really personable folks and will invest a lot of personal time in you if you ask for it. A good chunk of the class stayed after every day and just asked them questions. The homework is effectively a debate case for both sides of an issue, so if you did that in high school or college, it's a breeze. They're also really invested in improving the course. After the midterm, they send out an evaluation and change the class based on your feedback. It's a lot of fun and you'll come out ready to discuss the major topics in economics with current research to back up your arguments.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning more about the global economy. It can be daunting at first, but it's really not that bad once you get into it.",
    "Great course to help develop a framework about macroeconomic policies, across many important issues.",
    "AMAZING class. Take it, take it, take it. This will not only teach you about a wide array of topics in macro with the most important\/most recent world-class academic research, but it will also build your confidence in expressing opinions as Prof. Tsyvinski cold calls on everyone.",
    "Take this class if you want to be able to have an educated conversation about macroeconomics and econ current events. Awesome professors who put a lot of time into making a unique top-notch educational experience!",
    "An excellent course on the current economics topics of the day. Whether you are in the major or not, take this class if you are at all interested in the subject.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're interested in economics and looking for something beyond the theoretical core classes offered at Yale. I took this class as a sophomore after taking Intro Micro and Macro my freshman year, and although it is intimidating at first, I ended up learning a lot.",
    "A lot of discussions. Review of many complex Macroeconomic concepts in practice.",
    "Excellent course if you are interested in macroeconomics and economic debates. Provides a great overview of the literature on the 'hot topics' currently being discussed and provides very practical knowledge on important economic topics - you don't have to be an expert on each topic, but this opens up an avenue for you to read in more detail material on the 'hot topics' and develop a more critical opinion on 'mainstream economic discourse'. Very interesting readings, a lot to learn and simply a very fun course to take if you are into economic debate, whether via media or general public discourse.",
    "This is one of the most unique classes I've ever taken. The opportunity to have two compelling, intelligent and accomplished professors who take opposing positions on most issues in macroeconomics really gives you a well-rounded understanding of topics. It will definitely make you challenge your previous conceptions within economics. Stay on top of the essays, midterm and final, because those compose the majority of your grade and it can be easy to get complacent. The readings are sometimes too dense to do (they're al detailed econ papers) but give it a go at understanding the gist of them and you'll be fine."
