    "Doug is awesome. This course is awesome. The discussions were awesome. Very theoretical. Great to get an idea of what the heck is going on in climate policy, brought down to earth, but also analysed at a high level. As an FESer i was a little intimidated by some of the detailed law discussions that occasionally broke out, but Doug does a great job of breaking it down to basics and keeping it tangible for everyone."

    "The Professor is fantastic!! The lectures are great and the discussion was always interesting and inspiring.",
    "Professor Kysar. He's a staggeringly intelligent yet humble and compassionate guy - all with the mind of a philosopher. I really enjoyed listening to him and only wish I'd 'gotten' more of it...",
    "- Good theoretical foundation to the topics of the class - some economic theory, legal stuff",
    "way of thinking",
    "Instructor, great discussions, flexible final deliverable, great readings (though some were frighteningly long), only a final paper\/project, no midterm crap.",
    "This course is of obviously constantly evolving, given the subject matter, and Professor Kysar did an amazing job of making sure that the readings and discussions were pertinent debates of the day. It was particularly helpful when Prof. Kysar extrapolated lessons from past climate law and policy experiences, such as those in CA, to things that can be improved upon in the current policy experience. The readings were just the perfect amount - never too much, and shockingly manageable for daily completion (very much appreciated) - and Prof. Kysar's subject matter insights were always very keen and helpful for clarification (though sometimes he could have expanded upon opposing viewpoints and why they took the positions that they did).",
    "DOUG KYSAR! Doug is so much fun! He is brilliant, and gives amazing lectures. He also is not afraid to get up on his soapbox and share his opinions; I like that. He has got to be one of my favorite professors from my time at F&ES.Kysar was a little depressing this semester, and he critiqued himself for that, but I think it is to be expected--between the debacle of Copenhagen and the collapse of US cap-and-trade legislation, the first half of 2010 was a depressing time in the climate change world."

    "More class discussions.",
    "Structure of the lectures. Sometimes, I left the lectures inspired and feeling like I'd just learned something new. The debates we had in class were great - allowing students to riff off of each other, question beliefs assumption etc - all wonderful. More time should be allowed for those discussions.Often, though, I walked out unsure about what I'd just listened to. I think I lack the fundamental legal framework knowledge to follow along with all that Professor Kysar talked through - I didn't get a lot of the references to obscure political philosophical concepts or figures. It was a bummer because I wanted to! At times, I felt like I was just in the wrong room - like I wasn't quite smart enough to be there to be honest!",
    "to those who are not from the Law school - provide more layman explanation to some of the legal terms and processes that lawstudents take for granted",
    "N\/A",
    "I just didn't like the time it was at! My brain sucks and I struggled with the 10:10 start time, was either way early or late. It would also be nice to have access to the Grove Street entrance to the Law school, since the class was right on the other side, but we had to walk around to Wall Street to enter the building, then all the way to the back. That was my only complaint about the class!",
    "While there were many opportunities for debate in this course, I feel as though there could have been even more chances to engage in student discussions, especially putting people on the spot a bit more re: readings\/lecture material.",
    "-Domestic climate change law in the US is nascent at best. But it is much more developed in Europe. There should be a class on climate law in Europe. I realize this isn't an area where Kysar has expertise; that's fine. Please find a guest lecturer for that day--let's get some real European expertise by bringing in one from Europe via video conference!-I love the way that Kysar goes off on massive tangents. That said, sometimes it was a problem, because we wouldn't get to key things we needed to talk about. Sometimes we came back in other weeks, but often it was dropped.-For the final paper, we struggled with the legal research sometimes. An optional session with a Yale Law research librarian should be scheduled (not during class time of course) for FES students to learn more about legal research tools and get authorized to use the databases."

   "comments": [
    "Very good.",
    "Professor Kysar is a wonderful guy - always available, always open to feedback - a sensitive, compassionate guy. He's probably my favorite lecturer at Yale. The only bummer again, was that I felt like I was just a bit behind on some of what was referenced.",
    "great responsiveness",
    "great",
    "Great help when I sought it. They are all brilliant, I was honored to be privy to their discussions.",
    "Prof. Kysar was always available to discuss paper topics (or seemingly anything else) when you requested office hours, which was great and very welcoming. Though a final exam was offered, it seemed a bit like the Prof. Kysar would look down on choosing the final vs. writing a paper on a topic of one's choosing (I mean, it was really great to have that kind of paper freedom), but I was unclear as to why the final was offered, given that perception, even discussed among a few students(and if there was no bias against the final vs. the paper, perhaps that should have been more explicit).",
    "Doug Kysar was always available to meet and help, and had a lot of useful insights to share. (Aim to there early when meeting with him though; you will get lost trying to find his office.)The TAs were also very helpful and easy to talk to. They also came to most classes and sometimes even participated, and I always liked what they had to say."

The final projects are very interesting and there is flexibility if you have an idea of what you want to do.",
