   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course, and a wonderful experience that challenges and provokes the mind. The workload is entirely manageable, (only five essays) and the selections are perfect. Alastair Minnis makes the poetry come alive, and is clearly a master of the English language and the major poets in its tradition. He is very helpful in his critique of student writing, and not too dismissive of the points raised in discussion, though he has a way of guding the discussion to the most meaningful topics and ideas, without dominating the discussion.",
    "I would summarize by saying that it (along with 125) is a good way to get a picture of the progression of English poetry through the centuries, and to gain context for what is being written today. As a whole, I am glad I took the course. It is an excellent way to begin an English major.",
    "A wonderful sequel to ENGL 125. Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and a modern poet of the Professor's choice (usually Yeats or Eliot). This course is fabulous - the poetry is divine, and if have the chance to take it (or anything else) with Prof. Minnis, kill for it! Prof. Minnis is a glorious, wonderful human being, warm, friendly, thoughtful, and an absolute genius.",
    "English 126 is a great cross-section of English poetry, the second half of a yearlong course. (I haven't taken 125 yet.)To repeat what I wrote above: I loved the class. The readings were manageable, so I could really read them thoroughly. The poets are great--Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, some Yeats and some Heaney, and Eliot. I do think I understand the trajectory of English poetry better now. And Prof. Minnis was fantastic. He is approachable, funny, and knows an incredible amount about English literature. He both adds a lot to the discussion, and encourages us to speak as well. One of the best teachers I've had at Yale. Definitely take this course.",
    "If you want to read a lot of great stuff, take it. Although, you're probably an English major and so have to.",
    "A fun class! Obviously it's a requirement for the English major, which is why I took it, and some of the reading can get a little heavy (like Wordsworth, but that may just be because I'm not a fan). The class has 5 essays and we read Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Yeats, and Eliot. Professor Minnis is really great -- super helpful and very chill. If you can, try to get in his section.",
    "English 126 takes you through the later poets- Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Yeats, and Eliot. Throughout the course, I learned how to analyze and interpret poetry, whether through my in class presentations or my essays (we wrote 5 over the course of the semester). It's a prerequisite for the English major, but, aside from that, I found that it was a valuable learning experience!",
    "I was really disappointed that every single class was based around a presentation. It dominated the class when the Prof clearly knew more about the books than we did. Some students clearly did not prepare and that ruined the entire class for that day. Instead if we kept presentations to five minutes and then had a discussion about some pieces of the book that were ideal, instead of feeling like we had to get to every bit, then we could have had more sustained discussions.",
    "An excellent introduction to major English poets from Milton to Eliot. Professor Minnis led us through the works with skill and good humor. A perfect course in which to learn how to read a poem closely."
