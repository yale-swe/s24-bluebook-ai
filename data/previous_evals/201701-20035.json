   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Excellent discussion facilitator, knowledgeable of the material and consistently makes himself available for questions and extra assistance if needed.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin is an excellent teaching fellow, really knows the material, and interacts well with students.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Charles did an excellent job as a TF. Our sections were always well organized, clear in their objectives, and Charles was clear in explaining the material and in the organization of his thoughts. Due to the somewhat lacking structure of lecture, his effectiveness as a section TF was extremely helpful for me.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0He understood the course and was very much helpful during discussions. He gave space for students to question and answer, he created an atmosphere for learning.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Absolutely excellent. Comments on paper were very helpful and constructive. Teaching in section was focused and illuminating to the lectures and course materials.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is a good teaching fellow and organized sections well and fleshed out the more important details as were necessary for the class. He was always more than willing to help students if time permitted, and is a great asset, and will remain a great asset, going forward until his graduation. Perhaps more concise and occasionally more concrete details or background could suffice, but on the whole, Justin was a great teaching fellow that we all benefited from having.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Though Justin is not a medieval scholar, he took the time to think carefully about the texts we read-- and it certainly showed. Our section discussion was definitely the best part of the class. Justin posited helpful questions which guided us to engage the texts more specifically.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Great feedback, great leading of discussions. I can envision myself taking a class with him, if he was a professor.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin did a good job in our section to bring out key points, but was often hampered by not really knowing in advance where the lectures would be going. This made it hard for him to reinforce core points from the lectures, or to plan ahead about what to focus on in section. Even so, he was able to keep our group in order and lead an effective discussion. We were blessed by two experts in our group--one on Dante and the other on Augustine and Scholartiism and their contributions were exceptionally helpful to all including to Justin. Justin approaches the subject with enthusiasm and works hard to present the material and engage. I think think doing so was a difficult class because the lectures themselves didn't provide sufficient traction.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0- very welcoming, kind, supportive, fair - very well structured and a willingness to help us clarify complex ideas - true listener, aware of the needs of the students",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was great",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0EXCELLENT! I believe that I would have been completely lost (and possibly would have dropped this course) were it not for your section. You have an incredible ability to facilitate discussion and synthesize information from our lectures. It was an absolute pleasure working with you.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin Crisp led very informative and engaging section discussions. Not to dismiss his apparent deep knowledge of the subject matter, he was very effective in energizing individual participation. This section had several very experienced members who added value. However, Justin was careful to encourage those with less experience to risk their reputation and contribute to the group discussion. Through group discussion Justin was a good consultant as he helped us untie challenging theological knots, such as Anselms reasoning in Cur Deus Homo. I looked forward to each of Justins section discussions and came away better equipped in theological understanding.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin did a great job of synthesizing the material and giving it context. He was also very good at teaching the material and making sure we understood it. He was very friendly and encouraging of questions too which was very nice.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0I really enjoyed the deep dives into the material. It helped me realize I got more out of the readings than I thought.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was great and very helpful in pinpointing the main issues for each week. He was very helpful and available for paper writing help. I would have appreciated a more concrete review session from Justin or Kolbet.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is an outstanding mentor, and a thoughtful teacher. He brings into the classroom, with his tremendous brain, his pastoral sensibilities. He cares about the ambitions and dreams of his students. He listens carefully, guides insightfully, and is simply quite easy to get along with. Is if procisely his humility, his intellectual rigor, and his deep care that demands respect.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was an incredible TF. He did a great job facilitating discussion in section. I always felt that the sections really helped me understand the material. He was always willing to meet outside of section if we needed help. I really can't say enough good things about Justin.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was a great TF. He was well-read, prepared for the sections, and friendly. He encouraged discussion and questions and led us through the specific theology of these authors in well-organized sessions."
