    "Take English 120 for the opportunity to break the monotony of academic papers, and venture into the realms of creative non-fiction instead. The readings are a delight, although class discussions are not always productive. Margaret Deli is a very fair grader and a helpful and approachable instructor, so take the class with her if you can.",
    "English 120 is a great class to take if you need a writing credit, want to get a little better at writing, and enjoy participating in class. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student -- it's not a lot of work, and I legitimately found it to be a helpful and enjoyable class. Also, because the grading is based on essays throughout the year, there's no final!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking English 120. The consistent schedule of papers helps you really get into a rhythm of writing, and it is a great way to improve your own writing and skills without giving too much of a commitment.",
    "In English 120 you improve your non-academic non-fiction writing by reading example works, analyzing them by discussing them in class, and then practicing the learned techniques with five essays with different topics. I would highly recommend the class, as I feel it has improved my writing very much. It is also an interesting class, because of the student-led discussions - other students often have insights that you would not come to yourself. A very work-in, work-out class, the professor I had and other 120 professors I have heard about are open to meeting with students individually to discuss and help with student essays.",
    "would totally recommend it, even to a non-freshman.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone who likes writing creatively. The continuous, intensive writing is an invaluable exercise, especially accompanied with the comments and criticism of the instructor. It also allows you to explore your mind as a writer, find a writing voice and try to polish it.",
    "An introduction to writing essays that could or would be published in today's magazines or papers."
