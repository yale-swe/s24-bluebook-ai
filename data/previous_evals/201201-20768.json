   "comments": [
    "Once students got used to the format (or lack of one) in the class, it made for fun and flexible discussion over a whole range of themes, so yes, I would recommend.",
    "It's a greatest-hits list of the Northern Renaissance, and everyone should take it.",
    "Good overview of the Renaissance and Reformation. Good chance to read the classics.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend Intro to Renaissance Studies (the Northern Renaissance) to fellow students because its syllabus assembles such a tantalizing array of authors (almost all the primary texts, rather than secondary material), and the discussion in class, led by amazing professors, helps very much to synthesize the readers and round-out the students' understanding of the works. Student participation in class is enhanced by the presentations given by small groups of students in each class on the assigned reading for that week, and such presentations give quiet students an opportunity to hone valuable lecturing skills. The course is also excellent for students from very different fields, from music to government, as the reading list and the flexibility to write your final essay on seemingly any topic of your choosing makes for a course from which a very wide variety of students will benefit."
