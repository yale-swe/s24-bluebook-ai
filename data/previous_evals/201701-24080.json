   "comments": [
    "This was definitely a more intense art history class filled with more art history majors. However, I learned so much about looking at a work and taking it to another level of understanding. We looked at one artist but I was able to develop my analysis skills and visual thinking abilities. We got to meet the Van Otterloos and understand how collectors and museums work together. It was so much more than just art history.",
    "I learned a lot about how to interpret and contextualize Rembrandt's paintings, as well as that of his contemporaries. But more importantly, I learned through this class how to look at a painting, how to construct my interpretations from that close looking, and how to share that interpretation with others.",
    "This class was an excellent way to juxtapose a text with an image. I really liked the visual juxtapositions drawn in class and developed a recognition of Rembrandt's visual vocabulary.",
    "The most crucial skill that I have learned is to differentiate between my natural interpretational approach to studying a pairing and a clear argumented visual analysis of a given work."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this class is its two-instructor approach. That kept conversations moving forward, and we never got bogged down in a lecture-like approach - which some seminars run the risk of. The narrow scope of this course was another strong point, allowing for an exploration of much broader topics through a very focused set of examples. One of the weakness was the density and length of the weekly readings, I believe, combined with the expectation that the in-class discussion would stem from them. I got the sense that many students hadn't done the readings, and thus getting conversations started in class was sometimes difficult.",
    "The trips were fabulous! Although I think the final project was successful and have no complaints regarding it, it might have been even better--at I would have felt I had the opportunity to be more creative--if the project allowed for working with multiple images rather than concentrating on a single artwork in a more thematic approach. I liked all the reading for the course. There could be even more of it! Although I'm sometimes disappointed when a course concludes with student presentations, as it can be anticlimactic, the student presentations for this course were great! I learned a lot from them! The only comment I have is that there were a couple that were a little repetitive, both from the general coursework or when students focused on the same artwork. Although I would not argue against devoting classtime to the presentations, if so much classtime is going to be devoted to them, I'm wondering if it would be possible for the projects to be a bit more regulated, something possible if students sign up for an artwork to avoid doing the same one and perhpas are required to do ones that have not been a major focus during classtime. I thought the team-teaching was very successful!",
    "It was an indispensable experience to work with two professors at the same time and I am grateful for the opportunity that I was given"

    "I definitely recommend this course. You have two amazing professors who genuinely want you to become better at looking, describing, and analyzing a work of art. You will learn so much and you get to go on two trips to Boston and New York. I like that there is emphasis on really looking up close at a work to understand it.",
    "Yes, I would. This class is the type of seminar I wish every art history major could have. It is focused enough to be manageable, with broad implications that taught me a lot. Plus, awesome field trips!",
    "This was a fantastic class--one of the best I have taken at Yale. Professors Suthor and Walsh are incredible scholars; it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to learn from them. If you have the chance, take this class!",
    "Great class. For sure take it if its offered again. Two super fun field trips, 1-2 readings (not so long) each week, and only two papers. Suthor and Walsh know like everything about the topic and will challenge you to think about why you interpret certain things in a given work of art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my peers"
