   "comments": [
    "I learned about the structure of viking society and government. I also learned about the development of christianity and other aspects of viking society.",
    "I learned a great deal about not only Viking history, a subject completely foreign to me beforehand, but also about more general skills, such as how to write effective, scholarly essays and how to analyze diverse sources to determine their value. Overall, the class helped develop a newfound passion for history and a newfound confidence as a student writer at Yale.",
    "I knew almost nothing about Viking culture and society before this course, and now I feel like I have an in depth understanding of Scandinavian society during the Viking Age. My writing skills and analytical skills have improved as well.",
    "Learned a lot about Viking history, also greatly improved my writing skills",
    "This course forced me to make my writing more concise and it also opened my eyes to biases of all sources.",
    "I developed an insight into medieval history in Scandinavia and England through reading many sources on the Vikings. From this I learnt how to evaluate different sources for credibility. I learnt lots of interesting facts about the vikings and beyond."

   "comments": [
    "I don't think this course could really be any better than it was. It was truly informative, conveying anything and everything I had ever dreamed of learning about the Vikings, as well as well-paced and structured. Every class was engaging and there were never assignments that seemed out of place or unfair. It was truly a great experience.",
    "Strengths: Vast array of topics to be covered, professor knew his stuff, feedback was helpful Weaknesses: focus on developing writing skills was a little lacking",
    "The course is very interesting because it is extremely diverse. I can think of no ways in which it could significantly be improved; I found the format and content ideal.",
    "The instructor was easily the greatest strength of the course",
    "The class is very interesting and not overwhelming. It improved my ability to write a research paper.",
    "I enjoyed the seminar structure of the class and the class discussions. I also enjoyed going to the Beinecke library and having items brought into the class. I also enjoyed using the professors book for reading but found some of the other readings very long and hard to understand."

   "comments": [
    "yes, I thought this class was very interesting. If they had no interest in Vikings then I would not recommend it.",
    "Yes I would. I think it is a great primer for any writing or historical analysis one might be doing during his or her Yale career, and just a fun, informative class on an interesting topic for those who will not be taking any future English or History courses.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It gives a lot of insight into the society that it seeks to examine and I learned how I should analyze and interpret historical sources in the context of making an argument.",
    "Absolutely! The Viking Age is a period in European history that is often misunderstood and this class helps students gain a deeper understanding of this complex time.",
    "Yes, it is an amazing course",
    "It is an interesting class, improves your writing, and is not overwhelming.",
    "Yes the professor is great and I learnt a lot both about vikings and also bits of other medieval history."
