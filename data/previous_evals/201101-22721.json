   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a really interesting, worthwhile class. The readings can be tricky, but Professor Stern being great and the high level of class discussion mean you always get it by the end.",
    "The class is an excellent grounding in recent social theory concerning the nature and effects of secularization on religious and political discourse. We cover a wide spectrum of topics from engaging authors, guided by an excellent professor. I would definitely recommend the class as a way to explore another side of modern religious and intellectual development.",
    "i probably would recommend this class, but with a few important reservations. most importantly, it's basically a lie that you don't have to have taken any philosophy or religious studies before. i hadn't taken either and couldn't participate in or sometimes even just follow the conversation because people would just be referencing things or analyzing things through the lens of texts i had never read which was very difficult and frustrating. also when i took it there were a ton of grad students, which just exacerbated the problem--often the discussion would devolve into a conversation between the professor and a grad student or one of the religious studies majors about things that were only marginally related to the book we'd all read and that you couldn't follow without extensive background (and not just preparation-even having read the books carefully it was often difficult to understand what people were talking about).that being said, the material was really interesting and prof. stern is obviously beyond brilliant. but just be careful with who else is taking the class and what sort of background you have- if you've takenreligious studies and philosophy before, you'll absolutely love it. if not, you'll still learn a ton, but will probably be frustrated a lot of the time also. it'll also probably be better in future years when prof. stern understands more the expectations of an undergrad class--this class seemed to expect way more both in terms of background and amount of work (especially on something like the term paper) but also in terms of the level of our analysis than anything i'd taken before or felt prepared to take.",
    "Very interesting class. For most of the semester, I couldn't have said what the class was about, but I thoroughly enjoyed the reading and the class discussions. Elli Stern is awesome--really engaged, eager to help, and curious and thoughtful. There was an interesting mix of grad students and undergrads in the class, too. It's a fair amount of reading, but it's mostly really fun, and not really stuff I'd thought about before. This was definitely a class worth taking.",
    "This class is fantastic, and Elli Stern pulls off the rare feat of being simultaneously erudite and plain-spoken. If you're even faintly interested in the subject matter, take the seminar with him, you won't regret it.",
    "I would if they are good at working on their own and are very interested in the material.",
    "Yes, I would enthusiastically recommend RLST 235 to students interested in religious studies or history generally, and especially those interested in the overlapping categories of modern, secular, and religious. This is not an easy class - the readings are often quite challenging - but incredibly worthwhile in providing a body of works seeking to make sense of this modern moment."
