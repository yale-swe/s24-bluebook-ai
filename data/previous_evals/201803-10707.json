If you are dedicated and interested in your project, you'll learn a lot, especially because you might try several different approaches using a number of different methods. However, if you slack off and half-ass your project, you can probably get through the semester without learning anything."

    "Yes, I recommend taking this course. But take it seriously and do something you're interested in, because a semester working on something you hate will be a grind."
