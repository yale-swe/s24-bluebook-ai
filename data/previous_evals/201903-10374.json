    "This course explored a wide array of topics related to the study of lithic technologies including but not limited to, cognitive development, social and political structure, trade and communication between ancient societies, and the analytical methods used to study stone tools. The class had workshops that engaged students in actual flint knapping, offering insight to the difficulties and challenges of the skill. This was helpful in developing an understanding of the type of analysis that can be done based on flake scars and debitage."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very interesting and each class was focused around a theme which enabled a better understanding of the papers we read. Articles were designated to specific people to lead discussion which was useful in keeping conversations active and allowed for a more in depth look at each paper by specific people rather than a cursory look by everyone. The course could have possibly benefited from a bit more discussion on the basics of lithic analysis and studies as read about in the textbooks as this could have cleared up any confusion from those books and allowed for a more structured connection between each weekly topic."
