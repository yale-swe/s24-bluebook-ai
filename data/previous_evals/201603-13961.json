    "I was able to develop the context for music that I have been listening to my entire life, in addition to expanding my horizons by reading and analyzing Shakespeare's plays.",
    "I learned about historical aspects of Shakespeare's works, especially the music used as well as the many adaptations including operas.",
    "I further developed an appreciation for both the plays of Shakespeare and for their musical adaptations. I learned about the history of Shakespeare's music and discovered my musical taste (in opera, specifically), which will inspire me as I pursue a future in music.",
    "I learned a lot about opera culture and the background of Shakespeare's creations. I also developed a new perspective about music in Shakesperean plays and adaptions as well as in popular culture.",
    "I learned some basic things about music theory, a subject to which I had no prior exposure. I also learned a lot about the use of music in Shakespeare's plays, about the staging of Shakespeare's plays, and about considerations that go into using music in any theater production."

    "I have no complaints about this course -- its content and structure went hand-in-hand!",
    "The small class allowed for discussions about many topics.",
    "A more structured syllabus might help the course, but overall it was very informative and enjoyable.",
    "Strengths- material of course is extremely interesting, field trip is very engaging, class discussions are stimulating Weaknesses- a lot of independent reading and listening",
    "This course did not have a very heavy workload, for better or worse. It was a relief not to have to do too much work for this course when many of my other courses had very heavy workloads, but sometimes a little more related content (readings etc) would have been nice to supplement what we were learning in class. Otherwise, this class was very strong in its use of multimedia (listening exercises and movie clips). The field trip at the end of the semester was a lot of fun and seemed relevant to the course material: the show we watched was much easier to appreciate after having read the texts that we did."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! What I loved about this course is the ability to apply the concept to contemporary cultural phenomena.",
    "Yes, I was hesitant to take the course because of my knowledge of Shakespeare, but it was taught in a way that was accessible to me and I felt that I learned a lot throughout.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. It was fun and relaxing, but still a valuable intellectual experience for me.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to students at Yale as you learn about a new culture in essence.",
    "Yes, I would! This is definitely an interesting course if you're interested in Shakespeare, in music, or in both. I'm not a musical person at all and I got a lot out of it. Also note that this class does not involve a lot of in-depth textual analysis of the plays. A lot more focus is placed on production and the overall plot points. There are lots of cool field trips, not a lot of work, and lots of interesting info that you've never learned anywhere else."
