    "Take this class if you want to write and learn about ethnography and the study of culture.The class was wonderful and you make it what you want it to be. Your final project can take many forms but it is well analysed ethnography (in writing or with video) that looks to the methods of inspection that make up the ethnography more than the ethnography itself. Enlightening class, rooted in post-structuralist theory that is continually thinking of issues of inspection of the ethnographer and the other.",
    "If you are an anthropology major, I would highly recommend the course. Narges Erami is a great new professor and is very interactive. There is no busy work--everything is pertinent and very interesting.",
    "Amazing class. It's almost a must take for anyone interested in doing ethnographic fieldwork. The material is very interesting, the workload is fairly light, and most of the assignments consist of doing fieldwork, which turns out to be really fun."
