   "comments": [
    "I would definitely take this class, even if you don't know Korean.",
    "Korean Is a great course that I'd recommend to anyone! You will love Angela Lee Smith! She is reason enough to take this course. I've only heard good things about the other professor as well. It's well taught, and manageable.",
    "Introductory language class that moves quickly, but provides plenty of support and assistance.",
    "East Asian Language classes at Yale are amazing, especially Korean. I highly recommend taking this class during any year (I took it as a senior).",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it because it is a very interesting and fun course to take. It is a good language to pick up because the alphabet is easy to learn and the phonemes are relatively easy to pronounce.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to start a foreign language, and especially to students with a background in Japanese, as the languages are quite similar in grammar, with overlapping vocabulary.",
    "By the end of the semester, you'll be able to read and write Korean proficiently and have basic speaking and listening skills. The professor is effective, funny, and pleasant to be around. If you want to learn Korean, I don't see why you wouldn't take this course.",
    "Korean 110 was what I expected. I went in not knowing much about the Korean language, perhaps only knowing minimal hangul (Korean alphabet). After this semester I am able to converse about everyday situations (small talk, directions, ordering...etc). I also learned basic grammar (tenses, formalities, etc.) Like all L1 courses it meets 5 days a week. For me it was a lovely way to start the day. However, know that Korean like other East Asian languages has daily quizzes. These are manageable but should not be studied for 10 minutes before class, not a good idea. Overall, if you are interested in Korean culture\/language definitely take this class. Definitely try to take it with Angela Lee-Smith."
