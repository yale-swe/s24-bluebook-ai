    "Yes! Definitely take this class. I was wary of all the theory on the syllabus, of the reputation of WGSS classes, etc. etc. having never taken one before. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of our discussions each week; Stewart-Winter and Reid led them remarkably well. It is probably one of the most productive seminars I have had. My one criticism is that the grading on the reading responses felt a little bit random, but by the end they were being more reasonable and I'm sure will be in the future.",
    "If you're interested in analyzing the theory behind LGBT identities, this class will be great for you. The readings were really fascinating (though at times there was a lot of it), and our discussions were very good. Our professors became much better discussion leaders throughout the semester. There is, however, a decent amount of work; with eight response papers due, with 1-2 pages each, I found I was writing pretty much one paper a week. There's also a final paper due at the end. Doing the readings and the papers took out a pretty significant chunk of my time.",
    "It was totally great. I learned a ton, and so will you. Also the workload is legitimately manageable, which means you can do all the reading and think about it too. Our teachers were awesome. I think the teachers for this course change pretty frequently so I don't know how helpful that is. But the readings and assignments were really great learning opportunities and those are probably more constant from year to year. So yes, you should absolutely take this course.",
    "If you're interested in the material, take this class! Although I think the professors change every year, so it could totally be different next year. Prof. Stewart-Winter and Prof. Reid were both great, although very different. There was often a lot of reading each week.",
    "WGSS 296 is a great introduction to LGBT Studies. The class is very discussion-focused, and there's quite a bit of reading. Although the readings get pretty dense and theoretical at times, they are usually balanced out with lighter or more easily tangible selections.I would recommend this class to anyone interested in LGBT Studies, and even more so to those who have never given it a thought. It is an excellent foundation in the field, as well as an enlightening look at the history behind today's LGBT movement.",
    "I had a great experience with this class because of the great reading list and great professors, but also great classmates. We had a cool mix of people in the room that I got along well with. I could see a situation where a student doesn't have a good experience with this class because the classroom dynamic isn't as good."
