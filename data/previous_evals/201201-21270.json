   "comments": [
    "It's definitely a class for the academically mature. I found the course rewarding because it drew from my entire academic career, and I think without that foundation I wouldn't have truly been able to appreciate the content and discussion.",
    "Definitely take it if it's still offered.",
    "It's a wonderful class that certainly textured the way I think about capitalism, but check who's teaching it first. Professor Bilakovics determined much of what was positive in my experience and I'm not certain another professor would create the same class atmosphere",
    "Incredible class! An unassuming title, but it is a great intro to thinking about the consequences of different perceptions of 'freedom' and 'fairness' on the issue of money and the economy. Prof. Bilakovics is great and helps everyone to think more deeply in forming their opinions. The readings offer a wide cross-section of thought. They are average in length but very enlightening in content. Take this class!",
    "Yes. Unfortunately he won't be at Yale next year.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Professor Bilakovics is great and the material is both manageable and interesting.",
    "This course is a broad overview of some perspectives on capitalism, some of them quite obscure. You also read a few works that pre-date capitalism, really, but through a new lens. The scope of the material is fairly broad, but you also have time to get fairly deep into each work. I enjoyed the class, and would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "Capitalism in the raw form of thought.",
    "PLSC 321 is a solid course. It draws on sources as far back as Plato (and later Hobbes, then Weber, and others), showing how relevant some of the concerns of the past are still very relevant today. Capitalism is an integral part of modern society, and this course can thus offer a useful perspective and food for thought.Overall, the class was solid. I would definitely recommend checking it out during shopping period.Assignments: 2-3 reflection papers, midterm paper, final paper."
