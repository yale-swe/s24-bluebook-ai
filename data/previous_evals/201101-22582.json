    "Intro French class--get Ngame. Please, for the love of all that is bonne. L2 is a test every Monday, a quiz every other Friday, a composition once or twice every two weeks and a final. I learned a lot, but I think it was because of my professor. It's an intro language, after all. That said, it's pretty tough but a lovely and fulfilling way to finish the language req.",
    "French 120 is a continuation of French 110 and equally as fantastic! Through the French in Action videos (like a soap opera with either 1 or 2 new episodes you watch each week), you\u0092ll learn French quickly and immediately be learning words and phrases that are useful in everyday life. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn French! You\u0092ll learn SO much and it\u0092ll be fun too.It\u0092s a work-intensive course, especially since there are weekly Monday tests, but it is manageable. The workbook exercises can be tedious sometimes but in general the work is helpful and the videos\/storyline make it fun. You\u0092ll have to work but you\u0092ll also enjoy it and you\u0092re guaranteed to learn a ton of French. You\u0092ll be amazed at how much you know by the end of the year!Overall, such an amazing course! I began the year knowing no French, and after taking L1 and L2, have learned so much and really enjoyed the experience. Now I can speak with friends who are fluent in French, listen to French music, watch French movies, and more. The course stresses speaking, and I feel as comfortable speaking French after just one year as I did speaking Spanish after taking it for four years in high school. We learn French that is immediately applicable to everyday life, and the small seminar allows us to get to know our classmates well too. In class, we have fascinating discussions in French and learn how to express ourselves in French about almost any topic. It is a class that I really looked forward to each day. Cannot say enough positive things about French 120!",
    "This course is my favourite course of the year, as Professor Ngame is awesome and I have developed a liking to the language!Definitely take it with Ngame if you wanna learn French well!",
    "If you want to learn a language really well and are willing to put in the work on French, take this class. If not, take something easier like Italian or something.",
    "The course provides an excellent introduction to French. Definitely take French with Professor Ngame if you can. I can't really imagine a better language teacher. Go to his office hours too. He is incredibly nice and helpful.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a wonderful course. Professor Ngame is a great teacher and with his help, French is not only fun but also pretty easy. As always, you get out as much as you put in, but the lessons are brisk and helpful so that you get a real sense of progress!"
