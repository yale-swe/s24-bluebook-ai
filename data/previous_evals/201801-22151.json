   "comments": [
    "I think the course was too big. To try to tackle slavery, dependency, and genocide in the entire premodern world was simply too much for 13 weeks. However, there were some good discussions that arose from the thematic weeks.",
    "Strengths: Two good professors, a solid group of knowledgeable students with well thought out discussion times and topics. Weaknesses: Not many. Maybe provide a bit more background information for each reading group. It was difficult to situate readings inside a history that we are unfamiliar with.",
    "I think it was a very strong course. It was very well organized by the professor who also were very generous with their time with students."

    "Absolutely. This course has gifted faculty and solid material. It will challenge you to think on your feet and try to dig new pieces of information out of old readings.",
    "Yes. The study of ancient history and western classics should be considered for problematizing the present and being able to do critique in the humanities and social sciences."
