    "I would recommend this course to whoever is interested in reading and understanding poetry.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to other students. I think it is useful but not necessary to have a background in German idealism and romanticism.However, Prof. N\u00e4gele explains all of his references carefully, so even if someone hasn't read all of Hegel's \"Phenomenology,\" he or she will not be lost in the class.Even for someone who isn't focused on the elegy as a genre, this class raises interesting philosophical and poetic questions that can be applied to other texts as well.It is also a good background for those interested in literary modernism, since it traces the genesis of the elegy from the classical tradition to its modern adaptations."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course gave me a better grasp of the philosophical and aesthetic issues that poets such as H\u00f6lderlin and Goethe were struggling with. It certainly substantially deepened my knowledge base of their poems, but at the same time, it provided me with questions and ideas that can easily be applied to other texts and literary movements as well. One of the interesting angles of Prof. N\u00e4gele's analysis is that it consists of a series of close readings, which can be applied in many different contexts."
