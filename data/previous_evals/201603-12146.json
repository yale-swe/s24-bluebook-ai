    "Definitely provides a solid foundation of accounting",
    "I felt really confident using standard accounting methods on financial statements by the end of this course.",
    "As someone going into finance, this course provided insight into the language and practice of accounting that will be very relevant.",
    "It's a challenging course that opens your eyes to how difficult accounting can be. That being said, it is extremely enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "I learned about discounting and time value of money, as well as how to do double entry accounting, which I think will be very useful in the future.",
    "This class does a good job giving an overviewing about how businesses create financial value, how money flows through a business and the basically of how accounting is done. This gives a pretty good foundation if you are interested in investment, accounting or just business in general.",
    "I can read and prepare simple financial statements now.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "the course works I don't think it's aspiring to anything bigger. It's a staple necessity.",
    "Good topics, bad lectures",
    "the professor should walk the class through the actual assignments instead of going off on tangents about semi-relevant concepts",
    "Boring lectures, bad textbook",
    "Lectures were somewhat of a flipped classroom in that Professor Antle spent most of the time going over concepts we had to go over ahead of time to complete quizzes due at the beginning of class. I learned very little from the lectures.",
    "Very important content, but can be taught too slowly at times.",
    "SO disorganized and frustrating to be a part of this class",
    "Lectures were very slow and didn't help with the homework. I wish I could have learned the concepts in class then done the problem sets. I think that would've helped me a lot more in learning accounting concepts. Instead, we went backward, and that system was not conducive to learning. Please reconsider the design of the course.",
    "The course has taught me a lot of accounting, but the structure of the course does not necessarily help people learn it better. There is a lot of small busy work assignments, and I think that one bigger assignment per week would be better. But the material is fairly interesting, and Rick makes lectures interesting.",
    "I felt that the course was structured very well to learn accounting. The material made sure the student kept up with the material.",
    "Stay on task a bit more when lecturing",
    "given the format of doing homeworks then learning the material in class, there were occasions where I had absolutely no idea what I was supposed to be doing.",
    "strengths: focused approach to learning intro accounting experienced professor weaknesses: a little dry; could use some higher energy.",
    "It was hard to find motivation to actually learn from the assignments because most of them were only graded for completion, not for correctness.",
    "Strengths: good overview of accounting and valuation Weaknesses: Oftentimes throughout the semester we had to turn in homework on topics that we had net yet seen, but would go over the next day in class. This was very frustrating for something like account, which is less about problem solving and more about learning rules and conventions; things that you really cannot figure out on your own if you haven't yet been taught about it. The daily homeworks and quizzes ultimately don't count for much, but it is still frustrating.",
    "In class I Feel like we go over the previous nights homework, instead I think we should go over the homework before its due",
    "Not much to improve, solid course",
    "The lectures were engaging but the class material was a little dry.",
    "He asks us to read textbook and do problem sets before coming to class. The textbook is very convoluted and doesn't touch on what is referred to in problem sets. So it takes a lot of researching by yourself. The strength is that it is low stress. You are guaranteed to get a B+ and above.",
    "The lectures could move through samples problems more efficiently."

   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want to be super comfortable during the accounting technicals in a finance interview. Otherwise why would you need to know accounting",
    "Yes, but learn on your own.",
    "yes. good course to take credit D",
    "no",
    "No -- even if you think accounting would be useful, I don't think you will take anything out of this course. Do not waste a Yale credit on it.",
    "This is a course for anyone specifically interested on learning accounting skills.",
    "No. You think it will be worth it. It wont be. This class is so frustrating.",
    "If you're interested in business, this is a great class to take. But be wary of learning a lot of things on your own and doing the problem sets before you even learn the actual concepts. Most people never show up to lectures because they're pretty much useless and unbelievably slow.",
    "The course has taught me a lot of accounting, but the structure of the course does not necessarily help people learn it better. There is a lot of small busy work assignments, and the structure of the course is that if you finish all the work, you can get a B+, but you have to take the final exam in order to get a higher grade (but it won't hurt you). The material is fairly interesting, and Rick makes lectures interesting, though it's not always in a relevant way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they're interested in improving their excel skills as well as interested in learning how to create the financial statements. It's a very useful skill to have in general, especially if you're interested in going into investment management, investment banking, or finance.",
    "If you're willing to put in the work, take the class. It takes a while to get the hang of it.",
    "Good class to develop some important skills.",
    "the class was an introduction to accounting, focusing mainly on the construction and analysis of the 3 financial statements -- balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Workload was light to moderate. Grading method is unique (see syllabus). Professor is experienced and generous. Good to know for one heading into a finance oriented field post graduation.",
    "This class was fine - it wasn't too exciting but it was a good way to learn accounting. I think the skills I learned will be useful in future internships and jobs.",
    "If you are interested in finance or business, this class is a gives good foundation for understanding how businesses create financial value and how money flows through a business. I am glad I took the class, but the having homework due pretty much everyday and oftentimes doing homework on topics we had not get seen was very frustrating.",
    "Highly recommend. Professor Antle is very entertaining and very good at teaching as well. A very useful class. I recommend taking it sophomore year at the earliest.",
    "If you need to learn accounting it is good, but only if you are willing to dedicate a lot of time",
    "Yes, definitely an important course to take",
    "Yes because I think the concepts taught in this class are very important.",
    "I would recommend it CR\/D\/F. You're better off reading other textbooks by yourself.",
    "You would be a fool not to take this course. The material is incredibly important and the professor is excellent.",
    "If you want to learn some basics of accounting, valuation, and excel then take it."
