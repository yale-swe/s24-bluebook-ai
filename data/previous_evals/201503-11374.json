    "Take it!!!",
    "The course has fairly basic undertones and can be nicely straightforward--the drawback lies in the very exacting (and, yes, slightly tedious) nature of the experiments. This is general for most chemistry labs, though, so may not pose an annoyance for some.",
    "Even though this is a half-credit course, it is definitely a larger time commitment than you think. You must complete the lab for four hours, turn in good data sheets, type the report, and then study for the quiz for next lab\/write the purpose and procedure. You must also have patience. Lab can be a very slow process, so for more active and fast-paced learners, this may not be the course for you. However, anyone needing a lab credit course should definitely consider this course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want an introduction to how labs and reports should be carried out, and all of the different materials and procedures used in a lab.",
    "Very recommended! It is a great class. Dr. G and the TAs are very helpful and you will learn a lot from the class. Topics thought may not be very connected with what you are doing in your chemistry class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it challenges you to be precise and accurate.",
    "CHEM 134L is A LOT of work, especially since it gobbles up 4 hours (in the lab) plus 3 to 7 hours more outside of it for pre-lab and lab reports. I would recommend to students who've had little experience with lab work in the past.",
    "Do not take unless you have to. You have four hours to complete an inordinate amount of reactions which takes all the fun out of chemistry. The colored reactions were great but that is about the only lab I enjoyed. You use instruments you would never use in a modern chemistry setting (ie those volumetric pipets). Grading is not consistent and clearly outlined. Most labs are not especially interesting. Dr. G's love for chemistry is contagious though.",
    "CHEM 134L is an introduction to very basic lab procedure and some very rudimentary experiments that will be loosely tied to the material that is being discussed in lecture, however if you are in CHEM 163 there will be very little overlap in material. I would recommend this class to other students who would like to know more about lab procedure or very basic experiments associated with General Chemistry. Unfortunately this lab is unavoidable for many students who would like to be pre-med or major in the hard sciences, and thus these students must deal with the fact that they will be putting in hours of mindless busy work and yet only receiving 0.5 credits for the class. With more substance and less pointless labs, this class would be worth the full credit that it requires and the students deserve.",
    "Writing the lab reports will keep you up really late the night before your lab day, until you learn to do them earlier in the week. Once you learn how to finish the reports a lot faster and know what to expect\/how to prepare for the weekly quizzes then you'll be able to enjoy the class a lot more. After the first couple weeks, what you do in lab is actually interesting enough, and the time won't go by that slow.",
    "It's an intro chem lab, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for an elective. It's kind of just a class you take because you want to do more advanced things in chemistry or biology.",
    "Its a necessary evil if you're premed. Just suck it up, and it'll be over soon.",
    "Exactly what'd you expect form a typical lab course. Very straightforward and literally every procedure is laid out in the course packet or during lab. There are clear examples of how to do lab reports and labs are clearly explained in the course packet, in the prelab lecture, and by the TA. Pretty hard to mess up if you do the stuff you're supposed to do.",
    "If it isn't required, then no. It doesn't focus on learning chemistry, it focuses on the neatness of your information presentation.",
    "Good Intro Lab Course Very Tedious",
    "CHEM 134L is a class you take to fulfill a major or premed requirement-- it's not a \"fun\" class that you take to broaden your worldview or make you a more knowledgeable person. You learn lab techniques, such as pipetting, using analytic balances, titrating, etc. These are valuable skills, but tedious to learn. Try not to get demoralized when you realize that what you're doing in lab is not related to your career goals or how you would like to be spending your time. You just gotta get through it so that you can become a doctor or major in your desired field. Try to have fun with it by getting to know the other students in your lab and your TA.",
    "This is a good introductory lab course. It is not very challenging and you learn the basics necessary for upper-level lab courses. The pre-lab lectures are really helpful and prepare you for the weekly quiz and lab. Labs are very long, so be prepared to spend up to 4 hours a week on science hill.",
    "It does not have an excessive amount of work to go along with it. The lab reports aren't as bad as I expected them to be. I really enjoyed the class overall because he chose experiments that are fun and interesting and not too difficult. I would definitely recommend this class because it's fun and not too heavy in work.",
    "This course is a very helpful lab course and essential for going farther in lab sciences. It is no doubt a lot of work and takes time to do well, but it is worth it. It may seem tedious and time consuming, but at the end of the course it is not as bad as you thought it was, and people generally do well on reports and the quizzes each week.",
    "I would only recommend the lab if it is part of a prereq, while it is not very strenuous, it does take a decent amount of time every week for doing the lab and writing the report and it is not interesting.",
    "You have to read the lab procedure the night before and write a brief description of the main idea. When you get to lab, there is first a pre-lecture for about 30-40 minutes and then a short quiz. Usually the lecture is tailored to help you on the quiz, so pay attention! After that you head to the lab room and do the experiment, taking notes in your lab notebook as you go. I always finished early and my work was accurate, so don't worry about being there for the whole time. Usually you'll be out after two or three hours! The lab reports are not too bad. The first several were kind of long and difficult but they got very easy after the first few weeks.",
    "I would recommend this class only if it is necessary to a major you plan on pursuing. It is helpful in developing lab skills but due to the very introductory level mostly consists of re-doing experiments other people have done in the past. It is not very interesting therefore and the lab reports can become tedious.",
    "The lab is four hours long which can be long but you are active the entire time. It is usually not boring but it can be tiring. The workload is not too bad you just have the lab report to do each week. They vary in length so sometimes there may be a rush of work, but in general the work load is not bad. I would take recommend taking this course along with gen chem.",
    "This course was extremely rewarding and fun at the same time. Although it is a time consuming course, it is worth the time it takes.",
    "This class has much busy work and requires a lot of time outside of the lab. However, it is certainly worth the trouble if one would like to pursue laboratory work. The teachers were also fantastic. So, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this course for people who are pre-med or who plan on majoring in a science like chemistry or physics. It definitely offers a basic understanding of (slightly tedious) lab procedure and will be helpful to students who are interested in continuing to do research in the future.",
    "Chem 134L was a slight challenge, but I definitely learned how to apply basic concepts from lecture to experimentation and improved my lab technique. I would only recommend the course to another student if the student was wiling to put in a lot of work for half a credit.",
    "If you are planning on doing premed or any lab work, take this course. It will teach you basic skills that will be necessary. There is a weekly lab report, but it is prewritten and for the most part, not a lot of work. The final is a practical and if done carefully will result in an A.",
    "This is a lab course with different experiments that involve chemistry. I would only take it if you need it for a requirement.",
    "CHEM 134L is a very necessary part of learning lab skills. It is taught well and is very organized. I felt very prepared for each of the labs and my TA was wonderful.",
    "CChem 134 L is your basic genchem lab. You start with basics and go over basic lab procedures. It was tedious, but not too bad.",
    "Yes, definitely take CHEM 134L, it is well-structured and reasonably paced. Some labs will require more time put in than others, but all are reasonably manageable, and you will have a lot of fun! Don't be put off by the long lab hours; most people who budget their time well are done half an hour to an hour early, depending on the particular lab that day.",
    "I would not recommend CHEM 134L to another student if they do not need it for pre-reqs. I would summarize it as a frustrating experience for all involved.",
    "Although Chem 134L is not the most thrilling lab sequence, STEM students should take it if they are planning to pursue higher studies in chemical\/biological sciences. It is important not to procrastinate on lab reports, and to come prepared.",
    "A good general lab course. A lot of work but worth it.",
    "Straightforward and informative, just as promised. Be prepared to work hard on lab reports, but otherwise the course isn't too heavy of a workload.",
    "I do recommend it!",
    "CHEM 134L is a lab course teaching basic laboratory techniques such as measurements and analysis of chemical reactions. Students are expected to read the lab manual before each lab section (it's not too much reading) and listen to Dr. G's pre-lab lectures, before taking a 15 minute quiz on the material presented in the lecture and lab manual (pay attention to the lecture, he always covers everything you need to know). I would recommend this lab course if you need it for your major. You walk out of the course with a basic understanding of laboratory technique.",
    "The labs were tedious, unnecessarily long, and reports were graded unnecessarily harshly depending on which TA you were assigned. Only take this course if you need to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is essentially a course that prepares a student for any future science lab. It followed along well with chemistry and I would highly recommend taking it alongside the actual class.",
    "If you're taking the matching lecture course and are a science minded person (or willing to step out of your comfort zone), I would absolutely recommend this lab. Of course, many students need to take the lab for major requirements and don't have a choice, but it's an enjoyable class whether you take it for fun or as a requirement. If you're a humanities-minded person but are taking the lecture, I wouldn't call this class mandatory. It's great, but it doesn't relate much to the lecture course, and might feel like a waste of time if you'd rather be reading a million books for DS or other humanities courses.",
    "A required class for pre-med: not sure why you would take it if you aren't. It is ridiculously time-consuming. It is four hours per week all at once, plus the lab reports are lengthy and take hours. Someone told me it is \"half the credit, twice the work\" and I could not agree more. And I often felt that the work wasn't even helping me to learn anything of value. Much of the reports involved tedious calculations.",
    "Take it if you need the credit.",
    "It's lectures, quizzes, lab reports, and actual experiments. Lab reports are sometimes unnecessarily long, I wanted advise taking this class unless you either love chemistry experiments and lab reports or are on the pre-med track.",
    "Great class to sharpen lab skills, especially titration.",
    "A moderate amount of work given how to class is set up. If it a requirement, you should take this course. If not, it seems to be extra work.",
    "This course was an introductory course to basic chemistry laboratory procedures. I would recommend this course because I feel like I have now had considerable laboratory experience and my lab skills have definitely improved. Besides that, we got to do some cool experiments!",
    "It is a very boring lab course and the reports range from high difficult workload to easily manageable. Do not take this course if you don't have to. It has convinced many people to drop premed.",
    "NO not unless you absolutely need to.",
    "If you have a choice, don't take this class. The experiments are fine, but you will be miserable writing the lab reports and you will lose points for significant figures at every step of the way. Take this only if you have to.",
    "The class is tedious at times, and the lab reports require a lot of work, but it's something you need to take for certain tracks. As a pre-med, a chemistry lab is required, but as the labs suck away an entire day of the week, I would recommend being SURE that you need the measly half credit.",
    "I would recommend Chem 134L to another student because the course sets good ground rules for anyone who wishes to pursue a academic profession in the sciences.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 134L to another student. It is a low-pressure way of gaining basic laboratory techniques. The workload and content is manageable and provides an interesting introduction to chemistry and the laboratory.",
    "Chem 134L is a lot of work, but it is very interesting. I would recommend Chem 134L to anyone who has interest in chemistry.",
    "This is the lab that apparently goes together with Chem 161 and 163. I did not see much of a connection to Chem 163 and this lab though. The experiments are fairly easy to do, just make sure you come prepared to each Lab- the quiz is extremely easy if you just read ahead.",
    "Chem 134L is a good lab course. It introduces a lot of techniques that would be used in any lab science and was fun because we got to work with partners a lot of the time. I would recommend it to another student for these reasons.",
    "It's a decent intro lab course. The workload is manageable, but the grading scale is slightly higher than in other classes. It's not too difficult to get good scores, but grading varies based on your TA.",
    "CHEM 134L was really long and pretty painful to go through just because it was so long. If it was shorter it would be pretty nice. I thought the experiments were fun for the most part though. I really enjoy hands on things and seeing chemistry in work in the lab was fun. I would recommend it if you need lab credit or if you really like hands on things. It should be considered a full credit given how much work you have to put in every week, but it is what it is.",
    "This is a basic lab course that will familiarize you with the lab, and is a necessity for all chem\/bio majors. Nothing special, but also pretty helpful.",
    "I would recommend this to other students if they are interested in pre med. It is very well paired with General Chemistry 161, and is a good way to learn more about different parts of the chemistry through a different point of view",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Even though it is only 0.5 credits, it is a valuable addition to any introductory Chemistry course.",
    "The labs are usually pretty straight forward but sometimes the new equipment we faced was a little difficult. I thought working alone was better than working in pairs. I almost always made a big mistake when working with a partner. When I worked alone, I paid a lot more attention to what was happening and understood a lot more. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "It was a demanding course and very useful. As useful I thought it was, I also thought thay this course may more focus on the broader topic than just making fewer topic more stressful.",
    "Details details details. You will spend more time than seems fair for a half credit",
    "The work load is pretty daunting at the beginning but the weekly lab reports get easier as the course goes on.",
    "It should be worth more than .5 credits but overall is a good start",
    "I would summarize this course by saying that every week you must come prepared, by having read the lab manual and written the pre-lab paragraph, and once you come to section, you take the quiz, do the experiment, then during the next week you do the lab report, and the weeks to follow you do it all again for each experiment. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they have never taken an intensive lab course before.",
    "Like a gen chem lab at any school, it was boring and tedious at times but necessary.",
    "The lab reports can take a while to complete, and you shouldn't leave them to the day before to complete. The final exam isn't bad at all :)",
    "I recommend taking this course while taking CHEM161. Not only does it fulfill lab requirements, you also get much better as lab techniques, and Dr. G makes it fun to learn!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is very fair.",
    "A fun and challenging way to actively learn and supplement the coursework in Chem 161.",
    "If you're premed and need to take this class just take it and be done with it. I don't think the class is too demanding work wise as long as you don't wait to do the lab report the night before.",
    "The class was more work than expected considering it was only half a credit. I would not recommend taking it unless one was required to.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 134L to another student because essential laboratory skills are learned, and the class is quite interesting and fun.",
    "I recommend Chem 134L only for those who love chemistry or need it as a prerequisite. The class takes up lots of time considering that it is only worth half a credit, and is often very tedious.",
    "If a student is serious about the sciences and willing to put in the time (the 0.5 credit is deceptive) for this course, then I'd say the course is worth it. However, if a student isn't serious about sciences, then I'd say don't take it. The class became a little tedious at points during the year, but I found the experiments interesting and I learned a lot about working in a lab from taking this course.",
    "CHEM 134 is exactly what you expect it to be: a basic introduction to chemistry lab technique. If you're a fellow pre-med, you can't avoid any of the lab classes that engineering students often opt out of, so you're in the lab sequence for the long haul. The weekly lab reports can be very long and tedious, but they aren't difficult in the sense that you don't know what you're doing. It's the length that makes them a pain. With that being said, plan ahead and work on them earlier than the day before, and you won't have such a love-hate relationship with labs.",
    "It's a straightforward class. Follow directions and complete work on time and you should make a good grade. It's a great compliment to your general chemistry course.",
    "Time consuming. Labs are long and lab reports take a long time but the experiments themselves are interesting. Additionally, my TF was great.",
    "Pre lab lecture followed by a quiz that was sometimes easy and sometimes hard. Then a long lab that was usually boring followed by a lab report that was sometimes easy and sometimes very tedious.",
    "This Chem Lab is for students to being to feel comfortable in the lab environment and using lab equipment. I thought the course was great but more than anything because my TA was very helpful.",
    "Chem 134L was a good lab to take as a first lab, because you learn how to use all of the tools and how to write lab reports. It can be very time consuming and tiring, but it gets better as you improve throughout the semester.",
    "Overall a positive experience. I would only recommend this class to someone who requires it for their major or program, because the lab sessions are long and the class only counts for one half credit.",
    "CHEM 134L is much like AP Chemistry lab. The basic broad experiments and straightforward lab reports. I would recommend this for those going into premed.",
    "CHEM134L is one of those classes that barely anyone takes because it's exciting. If you're a premed student like me, you have no choice but to take this class. If you're a chem major, you sort of need this to do other things in your field. If you're anyone else taking a chem class, STAY AWAY. The stuff you do in this class might be a low-key type of fun you enjoy for a couple of classes, but be warned: the amount of work you put into this class is about equal to what you put into your chem class if you are in CHEM 161. The labs are fine but the lab reports are just tedious papers you have to write every single week. You submit your lab report feeling good about it, working hard on all the calculations, only to find that next week you get 3-7 points off for fairly random things like using the first person once by accident or for not adding one extra significant figure. The way the grading is set up is not in your favor. The TAs are told to find ways to mark you off. So you can get the hardest majority of your stuff done right only to get marked down heavily for fairly silly mistakes. So a couple of tips on labs -START THE DAY YOU FINISH THE LAB. Don't be lazy or you'll pay. -If you leave it off until the night before, expect to have time to do nothing else that night. -Find a good friend so you two can help each other discuss what the lab is truly about. It helps because some of the phrasing is difficult to understand -Look over your work just once. I never did this but it seems like something that would help, especially considering how messed up grading is. -NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER use the first person. You will be burned at the stake for your sin. Passivity is your friend... Good luck fellow premeds and chem majors. May the odds be ever in your favor.",
    "It is a very long lab that requires a lot of hard work. The in-class component took a long time as well as the lab reports.",
    "It's a lot of work. Labs can be stressful and are always very tiring, but you get a lot out of the course -- I felt as though CHEM 134L helped significantly improve my laboratory technique.",
    "I would describe the course as challenging and a lot of work for the amount of credit it is worth. I did not love Chem 134L, but understand that it is an important part of the chemistry sequence at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students taking chem 161.",
    "An introduction to chemistry in a lab setting. I would recommend this course if you have never taken chemistry.",
    "For a student with little to no chemistry lab experience, this course is a good place to start. For students like me, who have had a year or more of experience in a chemistry lab, the skills taught in CHEM 134L seem superfluous, and much of the work of the course was not in learning, but in catering to a style of lab report preferred by any given TA.",
    "It's a good first lab to have, the reports take some time to complete and you might need to go out of your way to get help when you are lost. But overall, not impossible to do well in!",
    "Chem lab is not as bad as everyone says it is, it's just full of a lot of premed students who like to complain. If you need to take this lab for your major or just have a general interest in chemistry, it's pretty easy and self explanatory and worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone else. It is a decent amount of work, but it is very manageable. Lab skills are very important, and this course very much helps to develop them.",
    "Lab reports can be graded harshly based on the T.A., the weekly quizzes are relatively easy, and the lab experience is ok, although I struggled to finish certain labs in time.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to take it! Otherwise, probably not",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another students. I would summarize it as the most basic introductory lab Yale offers. If they have limited lab experience, or feel that AP Chemistry did not prepare them when it comes to lab, this is the good fit for them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. It provides students with skills that are helpful for really any major and it really solidifies all that is learned in gen chem.",
    "This course focuses on basic laboratory procedures and experiments related to chemistry. It is a good introduction to working in a lab and will provide a basis for future lab courses. I would recommend this course to any student pursuing a degree requiring general chemistry lab or those who are genuinely interested in chemistry. Lab reports take a long time to complete and may take up a good portion of one's week; this is why I think only students who need to take it should take it.",
    "I would say it is a long, tedious lab experience that has some interesting experiments. I would not recommend this lab unless it was required because otherwise I do not see the point in taking so much time out of your week to do this.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who wish to take an introductory course to start understanding lab techniques.",
    "It introduces students to the procedures followed in a chemistry lab, albeit in a somewhat repetitive way.",
    "Unless you have to take this course, I wouldn't recommend it. Four hours\/week for .5 credit is not worth it, especially with how hard Dr.G grades. Some labs are easy, while others take hours to complete.",
    "This lab does help you with lab techniques which are quite useful if you intend to pursue a STEM major. Writing lab reports can take much time, but the class itself is not very difficult at all, especially if you have taken AP Chemistry in high school.",
    "This course is okay. If you pay attention to the experiments and do your reports properly, you should do well in the course. I would recommend it to another student, because you learn valuable lab skills.",
    "It's time consuming and pretty basic, but it'll teach you what you need to know for other labs.",
    "Tedious labs but not too difficult. The lab reports ARE INSANE. Some were impossible for me. They took me hours and days to complete. They did not make sense sometimes.",
    "Chem 134 is a great supplement to Chem 161. they should definitely take it in conjunction with 161.",
    "A good deal of work, lab write-ups can take a long time. Don't take it on a whim, but a good introduction to lab work.",
    "It will take a lot of time, but it will not be extremely difficult to accomplish.",
    "I think that this class is worth your time. It teaches you proper lab technique and how to conduct yourself in a laboratory environment. The workload was fair and generally not exceedingly challenging; however, there are a few lab reports that take much more time than the instructor predicts. Overall, I loved this class and am excited for lab next semester as well.",
    "Chem lab is not going to be a breeze for anyone, but it's actually a fun class and I would recommend it to anyone. The lab reports are sometimes very tedious and take time, but the experiments are very cool and you actually do learn chemistry concepts. That being said, don't wait till the night before to do lab reports because you will regret it at 2 in the morning when you are doing them.",
    "Chem 134L teaches you basic laboratory techniques in an effort to prepare you for future laboratory courses. I would recommend it because of this purpose.",
    "Chem 134L is a good course. It is demanding (especially for half a credit), but it is educational and helpful, particularly in tandem with its counterpart Chem 161. I would recommend the course to others because of its manageable but difficult workload and its hands on approach to learning.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it teaches many useful lab techniques and there are many interesting and educational lab experiments that help us better understand retain chemistry topics.",
    "Some labs will be a bit boring, but you have to go with a mindset that it is a GENERAL lab course.",
    "I think that this is course is valuable for learning basic lab skills. It's a lot of work, but it does help you better understand General Chemistry.",
    "Be mindful of the extensive work, which sometimes takes a lot of your time. It is exhausting and hard, especially the lab reports, although it is very rewarding in the end. Take it if you are serious about chem or STEM.",
    "A great way to practice lab techniques and etiquette. Would definitely recommend if you went to a high school that didn't have great labs or chemistry teacher(s).",
    "CHEM 134L is a great introductory lab course. It does have more work than you would expect for a 0.5 credit class, however.",
    "Chem 134L is generally a good introductory laboratory course. I would recommend taking this for science majors to get a grasp on proper laboratory techniques.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 134L to a fellow student. The workload is fair, experiments are manageable, but time consuming, and the instructors are helpful. The class overall was a good introduction to chemistry in a lab setting and would recommend it to any student who has never worked in a lab or is new to chemistry.",
    "Recommend. Good for learning basic lab skills well. (Pipetting, reading buret, using analytical balance, etc.)",
    "Chem 134L is a good intro to a lab environment. I would not take it unless STEM major or premed because it was a time consuming course.",
    "CHEM 134L will allow you to use some of the basic techniques one may encounter in a chemistry laboratory and enables you to combine previous chemistry knowledge with laboratory applications. I would recommend this to another student who may be interested in seeing how a basic chemistry laboratory would work. It was interesting and a good introduction.",
    "CHEM 134L was a good introduction into the basics of chemistry experiments. The labs provided opportunities to get comfortable using apparatuses such as volumetric pipets, volumetric flasks, and burets to perform quantitative and qualitative analysis of various chemical substances and carry out an array of simple reactions that illustrated the points being taught in the companion lecture course, CHEM 161. Therefore, it's best to take this lab course at the same time as the lecture course.",
    "Not a particularly hard lab -- just a big chunk of time to spend each week in lab. It is organized well and really could not be improved upon.",
    "The lab was very helpful in finer tuning my skills on using lab equipment but I thought that the final exam was rather harsh in its grading curve. Take this course in order to secure a job in a lab in the future as it will help finer tune your basic lab skills.",
    "Chem 134L was not really a necessary class. I wouldn't suggest taking it if it isn't required for your major. It seemed like a lot of busy work and calculations with not much payoff. There were some cool moments, like calculating Avagadro's number experimentally, and getting very accurate values. However, the lab write ups and 4 hours a week of in-lab-time wore on me very quickly.",
    "Chem 134L is a once-a-week, four hour lab section. We have to write a lab report every week, which can be very work intensive. I would recommend it to another student because I think I gives meaningful insight into lab work.",
    "A basic chemistry laboratory class for students that have had little or no prior exposure to chemistry experiments. I would recommend it as the concepts are not difficult to understand and the material is interesting.",
    "The course is moderately helpful in introducing you to chemistry laboratory techniques, but I do not feel like it increased my knowledge of chemistry at all. The large amount of time spent both in the lab and working on the lab reports was not very useful for me and I did not feel like I benefitted very much from it. I felt like I could have learned what I did end up getting from the class in a much shorter amount of time than you are required to be there.",
    "Chem 134L is the basic lab accompaniment to the first semester of gen chem. Don't take it if it's not a prereq for a major you're interested in, as the lab reports can be a time commitment depending on your comfort with the lab topic. If you have to take it, don't wait until the last minute to either do your lab report or ask questions.",
    "CHEM 134 L is a great introductory lab course that helps students learn about a variety of chemical properties, measurement devices, and lab techniques that will be helpful in the future, especially for students continuing in chemistry or biology. Overall, very interesting labs and excellent teaching. Put effort into lab reports and be careful about details on lab notebook\/data sheets - points are taken off for smallest things such as not having TA's name on the page and for smudging due to carbon copies. Although it is intended for all students regardless of chemistry background, it is extremely helpful to have taken AP Chemistry in high school before taking this course. The later quizzes test content that general HS chemistry often skips but AP Chem covers. Most lab experiments correspond to similar AP Chem labs. I recommend this course for students with a good background in Chemistry.",
    "Chem 134L was a good lab, especially as a companion to Chem 161. The concepts in lab were in line with the lectures in 161 which really helped my understanding. I would recommend this course to anyone who does want hands on experience with chemistry. Try to do the lab reports early though because they can take a long time.",
    "Lab isn't bad (you shouldn't have any problems with your grades as long as you follow instructions and pay attention during the pre-lab lecture), but it is a LOT of work. Except for the final examination, most of the time I got out of lab between 4:30 and 5:00. The lab reports also take a very long time; if you wait until the night before lab, you'll probably be up until at least two or three in the morning finishing it. Occasionally the lab reports ask questions that aren't really gone over during the lecture or the procedure, so I would recommend looking at the report sheets BEFORE that week's lab so that you know what questions you need to ask after the lecture, as well as what you need to pay attention to\/write down during the experiment. If possible, check the lab day you are considering with the test days of your chemistry lecture course; I didn't and ended up having lecture class, discussion section, lab, and the tests all on the same day.",
    "really fun and educational",
    "It is the introduction to applying science learned in the classroom to real scenarios and problems. I would 100% recommend this to a student",
    "I would recommend it for the basic lab skills.",
    "CHEM 134 Lab I would recommend. It is a very good class to learn basic lab skills and equipment.",
    "You're probably taking this course because you have to get it out of the way, and get it out of the way as soon as possible. I would recommend the class only if you have to do it. In general, I (academically) had an amazing first semester, and this was the one class I really didn't like. Partially it was my uptight TA. Partially it was that I had a full schedule and treated this like my blow-off fifth class (never has good results). If you don't have much time to prepare for the quizzes, just skim the protocol, look at the \"On the quiz\" section at the end, and memorize the reactions involved. Don't spend much time on the first report as it's not for a grade. Stay out of Dr. G's way as he is also uptight and a bit weird, though if you have a quick question he is good about answering emails (I can't really blame him though, I would also go crazy if I had to head this class). Try really hard to get a laid back TA, though they might not let you pick. They really do take off neatness points on the lab sheets. Though they say you can neatly cross out mistakes in your lab manual, Dr. G often takes off points for this. If you care about neatness points, forget to put the divider in, and stuff bleeds through to the next page, copy your work onto a clean page. If you're confused about calculations on the reports look in the lab manual as there is usually an example. The final practical is not bad."
