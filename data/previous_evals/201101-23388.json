   "comments": [
    "Fantastic readings!",
    "The teaching style and the synergy between the instructors, which made the discussions very fruitful and enjoyable.",
    "The discussion which was very pleasant and interesting. The instructors made sure everyone got to talk.",
    "Needed a readings based course like this to get a better base of environmental thought.",
    "The enthusiasm of Professors Tucker and Grim. They are truly committed to teaching. The breadth and depth of their knowledge is impressive. This course is also valuable because it allows students to explore their passion for the environment through the written word. This class is about the poetry, about the awesomeness of nature. It's a great complement to the science heavy curriculum at FES.",
    "The reading assignments.",
    "Some of the readings exposed me to environmental writers with whom I was previously unfamiliar.",
    "The readings were the best part of the course. They were an excellent selection of the best and most important environmental writers\/thinkers.",
    "The professors! They are gifted with a beautiful sense of pleasantness, kindness, insightfulness, and care. They are literally the best professors i have had at Yale so far, and perhaps even throughout my whole life -they are certainly gifted. I have taken a course with Dr. Grim last semester, and having taken two courses under him and one course under Dr. Tucker, i can honestly say that they are one of the greatest assets of F&ES, if not the university altogether. I believe we can all learn from them."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "More tightly organized class time - stay on point and on schedule to get through all readings.",
    "I wouldn't recommend any improvements.",
    "I wanted more \"great books\" typesof readings with a much stronger historical thread. It was more of a sampling of various ideas and movements, but not necessarily in a historical context.",
    "The class would benefit from fewer but deeper readings or, if not that, discussions that focus on one or two authors instead of all the reading we did.There also seems to be an emphasis on values as opposed to history. This may be because the professors are scholars of religion so values are extremely important to them.Too much emphasis on worldly wonder.Though I can't imagine this would be an issue in years to come, the over-emphasis on the film produced by the professors was a distracting turn of events during the course. The persistent effort to make the course about the film hurt our efforts to deepen our understanding of environmental history and values. It was also uncomfortable, and even unethical, to be asked to provide reviews of the film.",
    "Journey of the Universe was interesting but it received too much attention in the second half of the semester. It was interesting to talk about for one class but became a distraction to the other material.",
    "Too superficial of a course. We read tiny excerpts from great works by environmental writers, philosophers, poets, activists, etc., but were assigned too many each week. It would have been so much better to have read one full work per week and to discuss in detail with historical context. The class was fairly light on history.",
    "It is critical to have less students in this class. We had too many students and it hurt the discussion. It might be worth not having undergrads in the class. Many of us wished we had more lecture time from Mary Evelyn and John, and less open discussion. ME and John seemed more interested in making sure everyone spoke than guiding a productive discussion. Discussions sometimes felt all over the place. After three hours the discussion would be dried up and become tedious at times. Perhaps it would be better to have two 1.5-hour classes each week - one would be a proper lecture by the prof's and the other would be open discussion. Mary Evelyn and John are such amazing thinkers -- I wanted to hear more from them. I wanted to hear more about the actual HISTORY and context of these writers, and less from students about their personal opinions regarding the books\/writings. I think it should be made clearer that there will be a lot of religion\/philosophy discussion. Lastly, the course sort of fell apart right when ME and John were launching their film Journey of the Universe. They were clearly consumed by the film project. Although the film was never marked as required material for the course, it DOMINATED class time towards the end. How can we give honest and open critique\/discussion of the film when it's clearly the baby of the professors?",
    "Perhaps a field trip for next year would be fun to have.",
    "Very unprofessional to emphasize your film project so much and to make it a basis for a final question.Also, you should not accept so many undergrads into the class. Made the class discussions shallow, boring, and unproductive."

    "This course directly relates to my overall program. Dr. Tucker and Dr. Grim bring something very unique to F&ES, and i am very grateful that we have such wonderful classes on religion and ecology or american environmental history and values available to us at F&ES. Indeed, their presence at F&ES has changed my trajectory to something i feel much more connected to. I strongly recommend more of a F&ES focus on things to do with what Dr. Tucker and Dr. Grim teach."

How did these trends coincide to events of the time? Can we use this to better understand why we are facing the problems we are today?",
    "I wanted an opportunity to read these amazing authors\/books\/writings.",
