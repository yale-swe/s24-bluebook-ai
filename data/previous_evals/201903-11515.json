   "comments": [
    "Logical thinking is widely applicable to crafting a persuasive arguments.",
    "Learned about how logic works, which was good overall, but I felt like some of it was easy stuff that was made more confusing than necessary.",
    "I learned logic, which I found very interesting.",
    "I developed I much better sense of how to evaluate arguments. By constantly learning new methods to prove different arguments valid and invalid and \"translate\" them into the different \"languages\" we learned in the course, I was able to gain a much better sense of what features of arguments to pay attention to and contest. Also, through conceptual focus on the nature of syntax and semantics, I gained a stronger understanding of how languages function internally and relate to the real world.",
    "I learned two major systems of logical thought, of determining the truth and falsehood of arguments: Truth-Functional Logic and First-Order Logic as well as other modified\/fuzzy\/modal logics! In the class I learned critical thinking in constructing proofs and expansions and evaluating the validity\/invalidity of arguments.",
    "Ability to translate English sentences in the language of first oder logic. Knowledge of Truth Functional Logic and First Order Logic.",
    "Understood the mechanisms of a proof, first-order logic, and its philosophical background.",
    "The biggest take-away from this course is that an argument is logically \"valid\", EVEN if it is inconsistent and still ultimately untrue. In this vein we learned formalized Logic, meaning we began with translating English into \"Logic\" then using these Logical symbols to create proofs, and evaluate arguments, finally use these skills in evaluate larger arguments in the formalized language",
    "I learned to cross apply logic to other courses I was taking, including math classes. The process of formalizing logic helped me think through problems.",
    "A clear understanding of logic Insight into metatheoretical topics beyond the scope of the course An insight into the broader relevance of logic in philosophy It actually made me a better writer, in that I became more focused on the minutiae of logical implicature",
    "Doing logical proofs, philosophy is still developing",
    "By taking this course, I was able to focus on developing my critical thinking skills and more actively apply logic to mathematical foundations.",
    "I learned how to use TFL and FOL both for translations and for derivations. I learned the importance of identity and the characteristics of different types of logic.",
    "Intellectually stimulating, but maybe not worth spending a whole semester. Maybe for those who intend to pursue higher-level logic or philosophy could benefit from this introduction course, but for students not as invested, PHIL115 may feel a little out of touch.",
    "Deep understanding of first order logic, truth functional logic, and deviant logical systems.",
    "We learned truth-functional logic, first-order logic, and proof strategy.",
    "I learned all about various forms of truths and logical systems which can be used to prove and derive these truths. I really enjoyed this pure discipline as it was unrelated to anything else I had studied before. I gained a better understanding about how various channels of searching for philosophical truth can interact with near-mathematically precise systems of logic like Truth Functional Logic and First Order Logic.",
    "In theory, I learned about First Order logic and how logic is used towards proofs. The material did not seem to be able to stick in my brain (this is a me problem), but I can imagine that the course would feel very satisfying if it had.",
    "Intro level logic & psets",
    "Introduction to formal logic.",
    "I ventured out of my comfort zone and was able to take a class completely out of my normal interests.",
    "Thorough understanding of first-order logic--theory and proof strategy.",
    "This class taught me to how to produce proofs in the languages TFL and FOL.",
    "This course was a great introduction to logic and helped me think through philosophical arguments analytically!",
    "how to use truth functional logic and first order logic; how to prove invalidity and validity in these logics; how to translate English sentences to these logics",
    "Although I might not use the specific rules and language of First Order Logic on a day to day basis, this course helped mold my mind in such a way that it is easier to articulate a linear, clear argument.",
    "I learned how to translate arguments into symbolic logic, how to derive solutions from logical premises, and a bunch of other ways to understand the validity of arguments.",
    "This course melted my brain into goo and then reshaped it completely. I don't think any other class I've ever taken in my entire life has ever had a more profound impact on the way that I think or the way that I approached problem solving. I never realized before how profoundly illogical I actually am. This course has made me embrace interests that I was previously embarrassed of--astrology, homeopathic medicine--because it has made me realize the hopelessness of actually reaching a state of logic and objectivity in real life. The first section of the class (TFL) absolutely destroyed me by being so much more difficult than I expected, or that it seemed (because the first chunk of material is deceptively intuitive). The second section, FOL (and worse...FOL with identity *shudders*) destroyed me because of how undeniably hard it is. And then, after all of that, the final three or four lectures dealing with further topics in logic, fuzzy logic, etc. absolutely broke me because of how insignificant it revealed to be all of the material that had been so challenging for me all semester. The worst part is that some people find logic to be really intuitive. Half of the class seemed to breeze out of the lecture at 10:15 with a skip in their steps while the rest of us had to peel ourselves, shell-shocked, out of our chairs. If Professor Winkler weren't the single kindest, most thoughtful, most compassionate, most encouraging professor I have had since coming to college, this class would have broken me. All of that said!! I am a philosophy major (probably), so I took this at the same time as another philosophy class that was more writing-based. I found reading and writing analytically in that class to be a breeze because of the tools I learned in Logic. I was also taking this class at the same time as a computer science class, and I found that the type of thinking I was called upon to do in logic helped train me to think analytically for computer science. Overall, First-Order Logic was highly useful and highly worth it.",
    "Proofs, translations, tests, and theory of first-order logic.",
    "I learned the basics of logic as the language of thinking.",
    "I gained a strong foundation in first-order logic. I also developed a better ability to evaluate arguments and to think about problem-solving in new ways (such as working backwards from the solution, etc.).",
    "I learned a lot about logic and the different languages and how to conduct proofs.",
    "I learned how to think more critically, and this course helped me improved my approach to problem-solving.",
    "I received an introduction to logical thinking--primarily with regards to symbolizing English arguments in truth-functional logic and first-order logic, and determining the validity of such arguments through deductive proofs. From taking this course and enjoying it so much, I also discovered that I am immensely interested in philosophical logic and hope to take more related upper-level courses.",
    "Concepts, translations, and proofs in truth-functional and first-order logic. In particular, learning how to translate English sentences into TFL\/FOL taught me to distill sentences to their essential meaning.",
    "I learned how to do proofs in TFL and first order logic, as well as background about the the theory relating to the two languages.",
    "The course gives an overview of basic logic: truth-functional and first-order.",
    "very interesting",
    "I learned how to derive (with truth tables, syntactical analysis, and FOL) true or false claims of a statement based on its premises and desired conclusion.",
    "A solid introduction to First Order Logic and its advantages and disadvantages as a system of reasoning.",
    "Ive gained knowledge of First-Order Logic which allows me to present logical statements and arguments as well as prove and disprove them. I imagine it will also just help me know how to clarify complex arguments, their strengths and their flaws to myself and others. Its enhanced my ability to do and think logically and my general capability to think about philosophy. I imagine that the skills and aptitudes I learnt from this class will translate into increased quantitative reasoning abilities and comprehension of the English language (particularly arguments.)"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures weren't very helpful in learning any of the material well. It's really just in the psets and homework that you get any practice. The psets are only graded for completion, which is good because most of the time no one had any idea how to do them.",
    "The first half of the semester felt unnecessarily stretched but the second half extremely condensed.",
    "The professor certainly knows his stuff. As someone who already had a good logical sense, I didn't learn a ton from this, and I can't really say how easy it would've been to \"learn\" logic if you didn't already have a good grasp of it. Just not a very difficult set of topics. But I do wish some things were explained a bit more clearly--I think sometimes the professor gets a bit bogged down in theory (and assumes that we have, too), and some more real-world examples would help us to understand a bit better. Also I wish the differences between truth-functional, logical, different types of truth had been made more explicit: I still don't quite understand why the difference is relevant in practice, and I wish there had been a clear, quick explanation of the differences. Also it would be nice if there was a bit more time for each exam: I think most people who did poorly could've done better if less rushed.",
    "Not sure.",
    "The last few weeks of this course were simply covering material that wasn't going to be tested on at all. I appreciate how it is supposed to help us have a better learning experience, but because we didn't cover final material more thoroughly, I think my final exam grade suffered as a result.",
    "Strengths: very clear expectations about what would be covered, what work was expected outside of class, and what material would appear on exams; lots of incredibly helpful review material and availability on the part of teaching fellows and Professor Winkler outside of class; Professor Winkler's lectures were SO engaging and he struck a wonderful balance between the material necessary to learn\/on exams and helpful anecdotes\/how the material related to the history of philosophy\/the real world\/our lives; really fast turnaround with grading exams and psets Weaknesses: perhaps could have moved faster at times",
    "Strengths: The class does a great job beginning with dividing content; introducing the foundations of logic through truth-functional logic for the first exam, and then amping it up to first-order logic by the second, and then marrying the two with the addition of higher-level concepts such as identity for the final made a lot of sense. Weakness: The course could be improved if there were more (ungraded) problem sets. Believe it or not, I felt that they were a bit infrequent.",
    "The lecture is engaging, though it can sometimes veer in a direction that is not applicable to the tests. Once a week section was always helpful. The course could spend some more time talking about the applicability of the language of FOL to thinking\/philosophizing about the world.",
    "Professor Winkler is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. His dedication to his students is incredible (he hosts office extensive office hours multiple times a week, offers comprehensive exam review, and knew everyone's name) and he made the subject matter very interesting. I think the class could benefit from being 50 minutes 2x per week plus section. Also, it would be great if the files on the Canvas site could be organized into folders.",
    "S: Kenneth Winkler is a wonderful teacher and obviously enthralled with the material, and his excitement spreads to the Class. Logic is a niche subject I did not expect to really enjoy, but he convinced me otherwise, when I am sure a different professor could have turned me off from it entirely W: Feedback varies greatly by section TF, and section is apparently mandatory, but I found it not helpful for my needs, so I needed additional office hours with KW, rather than my TF to help my studies.",
    "Lectures were engaging and interesting, and the number of exams was reasonable although the final exam could have been incorporated as a third in-class exam.",
    "There are no weaknesses - Excellent structure - Very clear explanations - Accessible office hours - Extra material beyond the scope of the course to contextualise the importance of material within the course - Prompt and clear marking of exams and problem sets",
    "Interesting lecture, sometimes hard to figure out how it lined up with the readings",
    "This course was very well-structured. The precise regiment aided me in the learning process very much. Each time I came to class, I knew exactly what to expect. This allowed me to study the material that would be covered for any given day beforehand in order to better prepare for the upcoming lecture. The only true weakness of this class was that it met early in the morning.",
    "The strength of this class are the lectures. The weakness is the nature of the content of the calss which a lot of times is mechanical and not interesting",
    "Professor Winkler is THE BEST. He cares so much for his students, and actually takes the time to get to know every one of us (and we're a fairly big lecture course) and that we are doing well. He's an amazing professor and I really enjoyed getting the learn the materials of this course!",
    "The greatest strength is that professor Winkler is amazing. He is always open to help students individually during his office hours. One weakness is that I don't think a large portion of what I learned would necessarily be applicable in my day-to-day life. It's something worth knowing, though.",
    "Professor Winkler offers a lot of opportunities to visit office hours for help, especially in the week before a test. This class is conceptually hard, but the professor and TAs all genuinely want you to succeed and are willing to provide the time and resources to help you. The only downside to this course would be towards the last third Professor Winkler began to discuss topics that would not be on the final, but ended up mixing them with topics that were included, so it was hard to keep track of what to learn and what was extra.",
    "Strengths: Professor Winkler Weaknesses: None",
    "This course felt like it wanted to be a seminar, or at the very least a smaller lecture.",
    "Not all section TFs were equally helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed the low stakes on homework assignments and problem sets. Because of this, I could focus on current topics to ensure I understood lectures, and then drill old problem sets and and homework assignments I had shaky understandings of before. Doing this proved an effective system of preparing for in class exams. I really appreciated how Professor Winkler provided review sessions for our exams and worked with teaching fellows to compile study guides and lists of topics for impending exams.",
    "The class is well organized, with the ungraded PSETS and the three exams well spaced out. It moved a bit too fast for me, and required a lot of time practicing outside of lecture and assignments. Towards the end of the course, Professor Winkler introduced concepts that were not on the exam, which was interesting, but I could have used more review of concepts that were on the exams instead.",
    "Strengths: winkler is such a gem, so available to students, excellent QR Weaknesses: midterms are too easy - hard to understand which students really understand the material\/one silly mistake puts you below average, moved slowly",
    "Moves very quickly.",
    "The strength of this course was that there were a lot of examples provided for examinations, but a weakness was that the course was extremely grade reliant.",
    "Kenneth Winker is an amazing instructor, and his passion for logic (and for philosophy in general) was infectious.",
    "The strengths include Professor Winklers excellent lectures, the organization of the course, and the clarity of assignments and assessments. I can think of no weaknesses!",
    "This was awesome, not sure how it could be improved",
    "strength: extraordinarily well taught with many opportunities for questions and practice; weaknesses: none",
    "Winkler taught the course in the most engaging manner possible. Although the material itself might seem dry since it is hard to apply it directly to one's life, the underlying mindset I developed while studying logic helped me in all of my humanities classes as I found it easier to express and argue my beliefs in a straightforward manner. I highly recommend this course to students taking Directed Studies as well since it is not writing intensive and its material makes understanding philosophy works much easier.",
    "The course is set up very logicallywhich makes sense, I suppose. You learn a lot, and you learn it in an understandable sequence. The problem sets are graded on effort, which is incredible; you feel obligated to try hard, but you don't have to spend that much time on them (which is perfect for someone looking for a QR credit). The biggest weakness of the course was that it was a 9am lecture. That was brutal. Also, first-order logic itself is pretty dry (Winkler does a great job at making it interesting), with the extended logics being much more interesting but also way more interesting. It was tough because none of the extended material was on the final, making it a commitment to try to learn the extended logics. Also, the nature of proofs is that there are many ways to do them, and TFs had some trouble agreeing on answers and methods.",
    "Not much material and a lot of repetition. However, what was taught was taught well. Perhaps more time was spent on technical skills than was necessary, and the teaching of theory sometimes suffered.",
    "The early morning lectures were a struggle for many students including myself, and I had a hard time focusing and following the content of the lectures as it was presented. Thankfully the textbook and discussion sections were well organized and very helpful towards mastering the material.",
    "All of the materials online were insanely helpful. Thank you so much!!! It really made a huge difference in my ability to understand the material.",
    "The book \"forallx\" is great, but I think the small supplemental book was at times confusing. Maybe we could just stick to forallx.",
    "This course is great! Prof Winkler is an amazing professor and explains things well. However since he said that most of what we learned after the second midterm wouldnt be on the final, it was hard to pay attention and take class seriously after that.",
    "Strengths: This course is intellectually challenging, and interesting. However, the material is not that hard to learn with practice. Weakness: Tests are worth 90% of the grade and it is very easy to complicate your grade if you do bad on one.",
    "Overall, this was a very well-structured course that facilitated beginners' learning of logic. Particularly, I felt that the textbook selected for this course was very clear and helpful, and well supplemented the weekly lectures. Attending section was also immensely helpful in helping me build my logical intuition and gaining guidance on how to tackle a variety of proof-based questions. Following, the exams that we took were also very fair (related to the lecture, textbook, and section content) and graded in a timely manner. Because the course was well-structured, I felt that I developed stronger critical thinking skills as a result of learning logic and working with deductive proofs. There aren't many weaknesses to the course, but there are two minor ones that stand out. First, I would say that the last two to three weeks of the class was less structured than the many weeks leading up to it and could benefit from restructuring. Specifically, in the last two to three weeks of the course, we covered difficult content (i.e. non-standard logic) that went beyond what the textbook covered. This content was mentioned in lecture, but not covered in section or tested on the exam. I found non-standard logic to be very interesting but because the course wasn't structured to facilitate students' learning of it, felt that I didn't get a good grasp of it. If the course in future years will continue to provide an introduction to non-standard logic, I hope that it will be more structured (covered in section, assigned sample homework problems, tested on exam, etc). Otherwise, as of now, this unit did little to meaningfully increase my understanding of logic besides knowing that non-standard logic exists. Second, p-sets were assigned and due in 3-4 days--I wish that we had more time to do p-sets. Granted, p-sets are not graded but I found that 3-4 days was too little of time for me to adequately digest and ruminate over problems before turning it in and going over the problems in section.",
    "Kenneth Winkler is engaging, funny, and kind. He is always willing to help. In a large lecture, he remembers everyone's names. I wish the powerpoints were organized into units and made available online. That would make the syllabus much clearer.",
    "Great course, cans think of much weakness. Ken really explains the material clearly and does a great job addressing questions. He and the TAs also do a great job setting up review sessions for the exams, which help a lot.",
    "The grading system comprised of three exam grades and a participation grade. Of course, it depends whether it will be like that on the future instructor, but keep it in mind if you don't like a lot of pressure on how you perform during exams.",
    "The course moves and builds very fast, so students should be prepared to read and attend all the lectures. I think the sections are a great idea, especially because many of us ran into personal interpretational problems that could be fixed only in-person, so that was a huge help.",
    "This course was fascinating and engaging. Its (re)kindled a love of logic and, more broadly, philosophy that had died down over the last year. Theres a level of depth that is easy to lose at Yale. This class gives you the opportunity to do that, develop that skill without it being arduous or uninteresting. The course materials deserve a special mention. They were comprehensive without being long-winded and provided really clear, succinct information. Moreover, I found they were really interesting and that I was constantly learning and developing as I read. As course materials (particularly textbooks) go, those of this one were worth their weight in gold. The weaknesses of the course were that there was a lot of theoretical knowledge which you didnt actually have to learn or know. Particularly, in the final third of the semester. The lectures were basically optional and you could tune them out if you could get a good grounding from the textbook, problem sets and teaching fellows. There were one or two unclear sections of the textbook, however, with a textbook 100s of pages long cataloguing almost the entirety of pertinent information in learning First-Order Logic notably concisely and clearly, its hard to be annoyed about it. Finally, a touch more information about clear practical applications of this course could have been brilliant. I can see how the skills can apply to law, decision-making, writing and more, however, some case studies or discussion of examples would have been great. Of all areas of philosophy, logic is one where there is really ground to dispel the myth that philosophy has no practical or real-world value. Just some mentions in course materials or in lectures about how what were learning can apply to life would have been great."

   "comments": [
    "If you put in more work than I did in this class, it would probably be relatively easy to get a good grade. It's not very math-y for a QR credit, which would make me recommend this to other non-stem majors looking to fulfill the requirement.",
    "I wouldn't tell someone to avoid this course, but I wouldn't recommend it either. The material was interesting but doesn't really influence any of my later career\/major decisions, and I don't find all the content readily applicable.",
    "It depends. If you're looking for a QR and don't already have these skills, they are definitely good to learn. Unfortunately I think the process of learning them in this course is made murkier than it needs to be. But it's a lot easier than most math classes here, and it's pretty easily graspable, so if you're looking for a good QR, then sure. If you're a math student like me, this will be a very easy Yale college credit, which is worth something senior year or when you have an otherwise busy schedule.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! If you are all interested in philosophy or logic but don't know where to start, this is a great place to do so! I'm not a humanities major but wanted to take something related to philosophy, and was very happy with this course. Logic is more of a problem-solving class than a theory class, but Professor Winkler made sure to imbed the more stereotypical philosophy tropes (convoluted quotes, issues of existence - that 'meta' stuff that makes you really think) in this class whenever possible, so we didn't lose touch of the Philosophy portion of the course. This class can be challenging at times, but the kinds of problems we work on are interesting, fun, and rewarding.",
    "YES: wonderful way to fulfill my QR requirement and learn so much about a subject I previously had minimal exposure to; highly engaging throughout and I found the material so fun and unlike any of my other courses! I also found that gaining a stronger understanding of logic made my writing and thinking much clearer",
    "Yes. Absolutely. First-Order Logic is a great venue to explore the mathematics of thought and the formation of strong arguments. As a humanist, I was looking for a less traditional way of studying quantitative reasoning, and through logic, I have found that the methods which we use to form well-constructed proofs can be easily applied to improve analytical\/persuasive writing, as beneath good writing is a calculably-tight formula, which effectively reasons.",
    "This can be a difficult QR class and does not always come easily or naturally. If you have taken calculus, however, and are familiar with proofs I imagine it would come easier. That being said, if you are willing to work there are tons of resources available! Professor Winkler's office hours were multiple times a week and were always helpful. Also, because of the nature of the lecture, you can raise your hand and ask questions during class. This is huge in terms of getting instant clarification!",
    "Yes!! Professor Winkler is AMAZING, and the material is super interesting and made me think about language in so many new ways!",
    "Yes, I think it's a great foundation not only to proofs but also to understanding effective arguments.",
    "Yes if you're interested in the construction of formalized arguments (Legal types, Computer Science adjacent, Open-hearted-people who don't understand pretentious debate-camp-types and are interested in doing the emotional labor of trying to understand how they think) AND you need a fairly straight-forward QR, this is a good course for you! I'm being honest, I did not expect to enjoy this course, BUT I truly did learn a new mode of thinking\/debating and it will help me in future discussions to clearly organize my thoughts and assumptions. That being said, the proofs came easier to me I believe because I am more comfortable with mathematical formulas, and creative problem solving. The translations were difficult to me, because there is no single way to correctly translate a sentence, and a lot of the steps there are route memorization. It's been a good course, and I was pleasantly surprised.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. Logic is topic-neutral and applicable to any area of study.",
    "Yes, even as someone who didn't do particularly well in it. It was my favourite course this semester.",
    "Yes, stem or humanities, doesnt matter, its math but no numbers so everybodys happy on at least one of those counts",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I would especially for those planning on being a math major. The content covered in this class, truth-functional logic and first order logic are essential tools in any mathematician's toolbox. Together, these fields underlie the mathematical foundations which help to formalize how different mathematical structures can be made more precise when described using the English language.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in logic. Expect it to be dull at times as this is the nature of the subject but if you are truly interested it should be fun throughout the semester.",
    "Yes! If you're a non-STEM major looking for a QR credit, this is a great course to take. Keep in mind that it's not a gut however, the materials are not hard to learn as long as you put in consistent work and practice.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in logic puzzles or are okay with broad philosophical questions, otherwise it might be better to get your QR credit from a different course. This class was enjoyable and wasn't too heavy on homework, but at times was conceptually overwhelming.",
    "Yes!",
    "It is a straight-forward QR credit for non-mathy brains.",
    "Definitely. I really enjoyed the course's subject matteralthough I may never directly access it after this courseand liked how the class was run and the syllabus planned out. I'm not sure I'd call the course a gut, but it is totally doable and enjoyable if you are willing to make sure to drill questions\/proofs you have messed up in homework or problem sets as practice before assessments.",
    "If you are looking for an easy QR, then I do not recommend this course, especially if QRs are something you struggle with. This class absolutely took over my semester (because it made no intuitive sense to me) and was very challenging. It is an interesting way of thinking, if you are not driving yourself crazy with frustration....",
    "excellent QR for humanities kid. basically all of DS gathers in a different lecture hall. it's not a gut bc the material isn't that easy, but it is a gut in that if you study you will do well. very much like geometry",
    "Not at all a simple class. Be prepared to do some work.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students interested in philosophy and mathematics.",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a QR and you have any interest in philosophy (and you're also willing to take time to figure out the strategy), it's a great course.",
    "Definitely! Professor Winkler is great, and the class is surprisingly fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Professor Winkler is amazing, and the class is really fun and interesting, and taught slowly and engagingly so you never feel left behind.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding arguments and how to prove\/disprove them. It seems like this course would be great for people planning to go into law, but I am not. I still think this course is great for anyone who wants to practice thinking about arguments.",
    "yeah take it is lit dawg!",
    "I could not recommend this course more to another student. The workload is very low, and the class moves slowly. In spite of these, I was very engaged and learned way more than I expected. It was one of those easy classes which changes your life.",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a QR credit or if you want a solid foundation in logic, which is important for a philosophy major or anyone interested in analytic philosophy or the philosophical side of compsci. I'd think twice if it's offered at 9am again, though; make sure you can get yourself up and pay attention that early.",
    "Yes. First order logic teaches extremely useful skills. However--if you're a humanities or social science major and you're looking for a gut QR--THIS IS NOT IT!! DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A GUT! This is the fakest of fake guts in the coursetable. Don't listen to your math or math and philosophy friends who say this is easy--it's possibly the hardest course you'll ever take in your whole life. That's also the reason you should take it! If you can, credit D this class. I wish I didn't need this for my major and I could have credit D-ed it, because the workload is not that high and the material is so valuable to know but my oh my were the exams hard.",
    "It's a good QR credit for humanities majors, and really helpful to philosophy majors. Applicable to other phil classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who either wanted to learn logic or needed an easy QR credit. This course is not easy, and does require more work as it goes on that should not be underestimated, but as far as a QR goes, it was great for a student who is not particularly comfortable with mathematics.",
    "Yes! It is fun and encourages you to think in new ways.",
    "Yes! Prof Winkler is great and will help you if you need help. This is a good course for non stem majors looking for QR. there is a learning curve so you have to pay attention the first few weeks.",
    "Yes. This course is very helpful in allowing you to think of problems critically.",
    "Highly recommend- Professor Winkler is a fantastic instructor and this course strengthened my logical thinking. I would warn, though, that this is not a \"gut class\" as some may have said--at least for me, I have spent significant time trying to build logical intuition and working through proofs.",
    "This course taught me a lot: I got a new perspective on logic concepts and learned to deconstruct sentences and arguments in life. I would recommend it if you are willing to do the work. I wouldn't really say this is a gut - you learn an entirely new set of skills, and getting accustomed to the minutiae of techniques for translations and proofs can pose a challenge at times. The skills you gain are cumulative, so if you miss lectures or become unengaged, it can be difficult to get back on track. On the other hand, if you go to all the lectures and sections, do all the readings and homework, and go to office hours with Prof. Winkler for the psets (the most valuable thing you can do), the content is entirely manageable. One thing I noticed about the course is that some people got the concepts pretty intuitively, whereas others really struggled with the basics. If, during shopping period, you have little difficulty understanding lectures\/readings and you enjoy them, then this course is for you.",
    "Yes. Its well-taught, not too tough, and it actually pretty fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to the people with interest in philosophy. After the course, one has a better grasp of what Russel, Wittgenstein, Frege, etc. meant in their works.",
    "Yes",
    "This is fundamentally a quantitative course, and math students should do very well. Humanities students with weak math backgrounds will probably struggle (I did) and it is essential to visit office hours to go over the fundamentals from the beginning. Otherwise, it's impossible to complete problem sets.",
    "I had to take this as a requirement, but honestly, I would've taken it just for fun. It felt like a semester of solving puzzles, which I love. Also, the fact that most psets were graded on completion really lifted any stress I might have about screwing up and allowed me to just have fun with the material and see what I could figure out. A lot of the time, proofs and translations were almost formulaic and straightforward, and writing them out was meditative and satisfying (which I can't say about any other psets I've ever done). However, those few times where I just couldn't figure a proof out were almost more fun because I knew there was an answer *just* outside my reach and I just needed to find a way to get there. If any of that sounds appealing to you, you'd probably enjoy the course and not have any trouble with it. That said, I know some people really struggled and it's not for everyone.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you can think logically (i.e. can think along the lines of a QR or make effective and diligent arguments), this course is interesting, informative and fun. If not, it still seems to be one of the easier and more accessible QR credits. This course is fundamentally a game of, how do I turn these concepts into these concepts (i.e. derivation), with a bit of learning of and translating into a simple language without any irregulars involved. It wasnt a great challenge or very time-intensive. I found that the lectures werent very important which is good (attending them is rarely critical) and bad (you may have some time wasted.) The course does require you to be quite analytical and make sure you that you really know the content youve covered instead of lightly skimming it. You cant really do vague or wishy-washy. That required far less of us than we expected, however. They certainly wont let you fall behind, however. There are ample opportunities and resources to use to catch up and understand whats happening. The professor was kind and loved his topic. Lectures were almost like what your 12-year-old self might have expected from watching the movies. That said, I found they could be unengaging at times. If you are one of those people who knows the importance of being careful about what they are saying in an argument or the logical relations between concepts and statements, youll love this course. If you arent, youll learn a good amount of facing up against those people who do."
