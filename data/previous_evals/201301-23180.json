    "Focused on reading ethnographic and theoretical work related to congressional politics, with amazing discussions to supplement the texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend. It is a very smart class, mine was a majority BA\/MA and Grad students, so for a regular major like myself it was a great chance to learn from a brilliant professor and thoughtful students, and the work was significant but manageable.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Congress - where it has been and where its going and what political scientists and historians have to say about it.",
    "IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT UNDERSTANDING CONGRESS THEN YOU WILL TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Theorizing about Congress is essentially a class for political junkies to talk about various theories about how Congress operates and how things will change or stay the same in the future.I would only recommend the class to individuals who are seriously interested in Congress. Personally, while I liked and enjoyed the class I felt as though the course was too intense for me. I was expecting to focus more on the history of Congress. However, this is not the intention of this class. Theorizing about congress is primarily about discussing theories of how Congress operates."
