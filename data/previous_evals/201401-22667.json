    "I initially thought this would be a how-to-do-it course for applied economic research, but I was probably wrong to assume that. The course spends most time on theoretical proofs and derivations of least squares models and extremum estimators, which I think is a bit overkill for applied economists but insufficient for theorists. Moreover, I don't think I developed a solid econometrics background for applied research from this course, and probably still have to rely on independent reading to understand most of the applied econometric techniques.",
