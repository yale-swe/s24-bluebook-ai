    "MUSI 210 with Eve Poudrier is a fantastic class for people who are interested in music theory or who play instruments that may require an understanding of theory. The class is pretty challenging, but frequent assignments and assessments ensure that students learn the material in enough depth.",
    "Music 210 is a serious course that treats music as an academic subject, and it has the workload and difficulty of most other humanities courses. The subjects of part-writing (for counterpoint and figured bass) require a lot of practice in the form of homework assignments. Casual musicians looking for a fun class beware. However, if you are interested in music theory, analysis, and composition, take it!",
    "This is a great class for people who are interested in learning music theory. Be warned that although there are not many concepts that are expected to be learned in comparison to a science course. Depending on your musical background, the time that it takes to absorb this information may vary. For most people I believe that they end up spending a lot of time on their homework. Especially seeing that there is a high standard for excellence and 60% of the final grade comes from graded homework assignments.",
    "For any serious classical musician, and even those who wish to gain a better foundation in chord progressions and sequences for the sake of jazz\/rock composition, this class is extremely recommended. Not an easy A though, so be warned.",
    "210 is a great class if you want to set your music theory knowledge in stone. Be prepared for a decent workload, but you'll learn so much from it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to a fellow student if they already have a strong interest in 'classical' Western European music, as this is all that is covered in the course. Whether that is by design or simply a result of preference on part of the professors involved, it still stands to say that it is possible to feel a bit of alienation if you know little about the style in which you'll be working for the rest of the semester. Additionally, this class is completely theoretical analysis and can sometimes feel like it exists in a vacuum, at least for those who have little to no experience of knowledge with 'classical' music. However, if you are into this style of music and this type of analytical work, this class is definitely one that you will enjoy and find beneficial."
