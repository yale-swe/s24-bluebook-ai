   "comments": [
    "If you liked 200 take this. It's more or less a continuation of 200, with a little more math this time around. The labs are more involved, and can deviate from the material learned in class, but they aren't impossible. Take it with Hong if possible, he's a great lecturer.",
    "Solid course on circuits, good follow up to 200.",
    "This course covers basic principles of analog circuits including filters and amplifiers. You learn a lot about how to build and test circuits in the lab setting. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning about analog circuits.",
    "203 was an interesting class that I learned a lot in. The class covers the various approaches used to help simplify the analysis of AC and DC circuits. There was a slight disconnect between the labs and the classes but the TA's did a fantastic job in helping us bridge that gap. Between the class and the lab, I feel that I got a much greater exposure to electrical engineering. ProfessorTang and the TA's were very understanding, which helped greatly. There were a few problems with the textbooks, as some of the answers in the back of the textbook were incorrect. Overall, pretty good class but takes up a lot of time when you factor in homework and labs.",
    "Only take it if it's required.",
    "EENG 203 is a good course that builds on eeng200. The lectures and material are straightforward, prof. Tang is a good lecturer, and the homework assignments do not take too long. The problem with this class is the lab component, which requires learning of extra material to be able to complete the lab reports. All in all, the classis a good foundation for circuits analysis and the workload is very manageable."
