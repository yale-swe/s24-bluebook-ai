   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the medical professions this is the class for you. Great exposure to vocab. and doctor protocol in Spanish. It's also really easy if you are simply looking for an l5 spanish credit.",
    "Very easy class. Just turn in 1 page responses every class, one presentation, one final paper of 5 pages. Mercedes is very nice and does not want this to be a class you have to stress about at all.",
    "Yes!",
    "great class. not much work, but learn a lot",
    "Such a great class! I brushed up on Spanish and learned a lot of medical knowledge I didn't know before. Prof Carreras is GREAT.",
    "Definitely if you need a good 5th class.",
    "Yes -- great course, easy workload, nice professor, helpful information.",
    "Spanish 225 is a course in which a student's improvement depends on their involvement. The more a student is involved in the class and engaged in the readings, the more they will learn. I would certainly recommend this class to other students; even if they don't grasp a full master of the Spanish terms, they can still learn a great deal about medicine and how the body works.",
    "SPAN 225is a great class if you are interested in medicine. It is important as a doctor to be able to communicate with patients that speak other languages, especially spanish. This class gives you the tools and vocabulary to be able to do so.",
    "Definitely take this class, especially if you're pre-med--it's interesting, and it's not that much work, just 2 paragraphs per week and a 5 page final paper.",
    "I would recommend it if they want to learn about medical vocabulary.",
    "Covered a vast number of disease and ailnesses in Spanish with bi-weekly homework paragraphs and class lectures. There were no quizzes or exams which I almost didn't like because quizzes reinforce vocabulary for me. There was a group presentation and final paper as well but I felt like the emphasis of the course was written skill as opposed to speaking or reading. I would have liked to see all three incorporated more. Consistent and transparent workload and not too difficult.",
    "A very, very relaxed class. If you need credit towards a major definitely take it. Or if you just want an extra class.",
    "Professor Carreras is absolutely one of the nicest professors I've ever had at Yale. The class is fun and not too much work- just daily 1 page homework assignments. I felt like the class was about becoming comfortable with spanish medical terminology and improving your writing in spanish, rather than memorizing a bunch of vocabulary. She actually canceled both our midterm and final exam, and replaced it with a final paper, which was really nice. If you're looking for a fun way to improve your spanish, and like biology and medicine, I recommend the course.",
    "SPAN 225 is a great course for everyone, but especially for students just starting in L5 and for those interested in science\/pre-med. Carreras is an amazing professor, the course doesn't demand much, and you learn a lot of useful information."
