   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course has a lot of potential, but the instructors set the bar so low that students are not really motivated to do their best and really learn the material. Nobody really feels the need to do readings for class, which makes class discussions boring, and then even motivated students lose their motivation. The instructors presented a lot of useful information, but I somehow wish the course were more comprehensive and rigorous, because I thought that by the end of the course I would come out feeling like I had more hard skills than I do. Teaching us more about how to design survey questions or use qualitative analysis software (in-depth, not just a quick presentation) would have been useful. The pace of the course is fairly slow, and I feel like they could pick it up and cover more material in the same amount of time without making the course too difficult. I do like that they had us partner with an organization to create an evaluation plan, because that gave us practical experience. I also like that they invited someone from IRB to come give a talk. The midterm exam for the class was frustrating, because it felt like an exam for undergrads. If every question can be answered via a quick Google search, then why do I have to memorize it? I would rather they tested us on concepts and ideas rather than on details.",
    "The content of this course is extremely important and that came across. However, the teaching felt very disorganized which made it difficult to learn.",
    "Good course for developing a broader understanding of what methods are available and how to put them into play for an actual evaluation. The class is taught in lecture form, but with frequent shifts to discussion, small group work, and role play, which is helpful for keeping us focused. Appreciated the real-life examples and case studies, and the fact that we were evaluated in a number of different ways (a short paper, an exam, presentation, group paper, and participation). Would be helpful to have a better space with smaller tables so that we could talk among each other without taking 20 minutes to reset the tables. Workload is average (or maybe a little lighter than average), and I would recommend this class to anyone going into program development\/management, evaluation, or community-based organizations -- very useful info to know, even if you don't plan to be running the evaluation.",
    "The skill set I learned in this course was valuable and will be beneficial to my future work in public health. I sometimes found the readings to be a bit redundant and think there could have been different methods to present some of the information. I did not think the focus group exercise was an efficient use of time, however and think it may have been more useful if the topic had been something students were more familiar with and not making up information, but in the format it was in, as a participant, I did not feel as though I learned much, if anything, from the activity. I also wish we could have gotten more feedback on the stages in the evaluation.",
    "I really enjoyed the skills gained in this course and am pleased to have taken the course during my time at Yale. Although I enjoyed working with both professors, at times it was challenging to learn in the classroom with two professors teaching.",
    "Strengths: Profs knew their material well. Genuinely cared about the students' progress and improving the students' assessment and evaluation skills. Weaknesses: Slides were outdated and borrowed from old sources. Slides were too cluttered, with too many words and bullet points (impossible to study or learn anything from, e.g. 40+ slides every week with 5-10 bullets on each slide, with huge sentences for each bullet..). Teaching style matched the slides- very redundant, not succinct\/focused, wordy to the point of not learning any important concepts (because they are all drowned out by the humongous tide of other irrelevant points being made).",
    "I think program evaluation is a great skill to learn. The professors did a great job of covering the basic topics and of guiding us in our final project. At times the course was highly unorganized and some information didn't seem relevant to the topic at hand. I think this was epitomized by the final presentations - due to time management issues, we were not all able to present during the class time. The case studies were useful.",
    "It would have been great to have received grades back on the different components of the evaluation plans. This made it hard to determine where we stand grade-wise throughout the class.",
    "i think that the lectures could have been done better. with one particular lecturer it felt less practiced and more on the fly which was a little distracting. it would have been better to cut out some of the readings. some of them are helpful but making them a requirement while simultaneously preparing our project throughout the semester for class was very strenuous. the quiz focused a little heavily on rote memorization but was ultimately a fair showing of if you had gone back through the lectures.",
    "The course should be more structured. there were too many things going on at the same time which often left me confused.",
    "I thought the course was a good introduction to program evaluation, in terms of imparting the basic tools and terminologies. I was quite happy withe the final program evaluation document my group and I were able to put together at the end of the semester and felt that we did learn some concrete skills in evaluation, especially as far as knowing what questions to ask and how best to measure progress. That being said, I think I would have benefitted from being exposed to more evaluations--I enjoyed the case studies that we discussed in class, and I actually think they might have been more helpful if they were treated as \"homework cases\" in which each of us had to do a write-up about the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. I also felt that there was little feedback during the semester on the projects; and while I understand why this may have been difficult given the size of the class, I think having a mandatory 'office hour' for each team to come and discuss their progress might have been helpful.",
    "This course is a great way to learn the basics of program evaluation. I think this is a really valuable skill, since not only is it a major part of public health work, but it can also help you think about better ways to design your own program, since you know what an evaluator is looking for. However, this class did not necessarily teach these skills well. Lectures felt disconnected and unorganized, and I was often more confused about the material after lecture was finished. This is probably due to the fact that a 2 hour lecture may not actually be the best way to teach these concepts. Maybe spend 1 hour teaching the skill for the day, and then allow us to work on that concept within our groups for the second hour. That way we can work through the process and ask questions together in class, instead of trying to piece it together on our own. Also, the feedback for the different sections of our evaluation plan was really inconsistent and unreliable. For a class like this we should have been getting constant feedback in a structured way. Overall, I think this class teaches really important stuff, but it needs to be restructured.",
    "Strengths- Highly informative and develops learning tools for program evaluation skills",
    "It is a good course.",
    "This is a good course in program evaluation and structured so that you are basically working on an evaluation report throughout the entire semester, adding parts as you learn about it. I do think that there are some topics that could be fleshed out more (e.g., cost-effectiveness) as they seem tacked on for the sake of more material. The benefit of this class structure is that you gradually work on the final evaluation so you aren't slammed at the end of the semester, but because the bulk of it is finished by mid-semester, it feels as if there isn't much new material the last few weeks of class.",
    "I learned how to do a program evaluation from top to bottom.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed this course and its structure. I was able to learn a lot of tangible skills that I will be able to use in public health practice in the future. Thanks for a great semester! I have a couple suggestions for course improvement. First, Kathleen and Denise recommended keeping groups to 2-3 people, but I think this should be a mandatory rule next year. I was in a group of 5 people and I felt that it was way too big. It was difficult to schedule meetings that fit everyone's schedules and the work was divided up so much that I felt like I didn't contribute as much to the project as I would have liked. Second, I think it would make sense to do the article critique earlier in the semester. It was stressful doing it at the end of the semester. Third, it would be nice to carve out some time in a couple classes for people to meet with their groups. I felt like groups were made very quickly and it was hard to get projects started. A little more In-class time to work on the evaluations (especially at the beginning) would have been helpful.",
    "Great",
    "The course provides an excellent overview of program evaluation theory and methods. The final project is a great practical way of putting this knowledge to work. Overall, I think it is a great course for an intro to this material and wish that there were more courses offered that build on these themes. My biggest complaint about the course would be that the syllabus was incredibly difficult to follow - I would streamline the organization of it.",
    "This is a skill oriented class. It is very useful, non-academic, professors are approachable, knowledgeable and experienced. Some contents feel a bit rushed, so it would be nice to dedicate a bit more time for main, seminal topics.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the practice of program evaluation. It has a practical approach to the subject and will help budding evaluators get into the field. Drafting an evaluation plan as the final course project is also very helpful in learning the material. I enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I have no weakness to identify.",
    "Strengths: Professors were very helpful in providing feedback Improvements: Would be nice if there were fewer lectures and more practice based cases or experiences"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Though I'm sure she has good evaluation skills, she frequently talks as if all developing countries are the same, and she erases cultural differences and seems to think all \"poor\" societies are the same. Her manner of speaking is offensive to many students in the classroom and alienates people who come from a developing country context. During the boat clinic example, she spoke from a position of privilege without realizing it and came off seeming like she thinks she is superior to others. I don't think she is malicious; she comes across as clueless. I just have a hard time understanding how someone who has done so much work abroad can have such a narrow worldview, and it is upsetting. She could become a much better instructor by taking cultural sensitivity training, and treating all people from around the world with equal respect.",

She was not very responsive outside of class. Her experience with program evaluation did add to class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0in my opinion, Denise was best at sharing her experience of conducting evaluations which proved to be very valuable for our learning but not as good with the structured teaching. I would have loved to hear more of the lessons she learned from her own evaluations.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise brought in a lot of external evaluation experience, and I definitely valued her insights from working in her own consulting firm. I did feel that she came off as more disconnected from the course material at times, and could better align with Kathleen's topics and presentations.",

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise only led a few of the class sessions and while I don't doubt her experience in the field, it felt as if she was trying to incorporate them unnecessarily into lectures. Rather than offering an example of the topic we were learning, they seemed a little out of place when we don't know enough about the specific project and background to make the kinds of connections I think were intended.",

    "Instructor: Kathleen O'Connor Duffany \u00a0Kathleen clearly knows what she's talking about and is an excellent teacher -- she knows how to manage a class, is thoughtful about the populations she works with, and took time to hold an honest conversation about sensitive subjects that came up during small group work.

    "Instructor: Kathleen O'Connor Duffany \u00a0Kathleen was a very enthusiastic and engaging professor. I really felt that she gave constructive feedback on the projects, was able to explain class concepts well, and made sure that students were engaged during class discussions and activities. I do feel that she could have upped the complexity of the material presented to a degree--especially the quantitative analysis portions. However, overall I thought she had a knack for pointing out design fallacies and bringing in her own evaluation experiences to shed light on key principles of the course.",

    "This course is a very basic introduction to running program evaluation. It teaches you the basics and you design an evaluation working with an organisation of your choosing, though you will not actually carry out the evaluation (during the course, at least). I would recommend the course, with reservations. For someone who doesn't know anything about program evaluation it is a good introduction. But for someone who is looking to really gain hard skills, this is not the course for them.",
    "Very helpful material, but needs much better organization. We should not have been told we were having a midterm with multiple choice and then be given a completely short answer exam. It felt like a trick and made me very anxious.",

Class has so much potential: the profs are the nicest, most genuinely accommodating profs I have ever met at Yale, and really want to teach the students the material. Unfortunately, the negatives of the class - the ridiculously wordy and outdated slides and unfocused teaching styles, really hampers this class.",
    "This course is good for learning the basic program evaluation skills.",
    "Really good to learn the basics of evaluation. try to pick a local program. know that it may not always work out the way you want and sometimes the program will fall through. the important thing is to learn the skills and not the deliverable.",
    "yes",
    "I think this course was a good way to get my feet wet in program evaluation and design. I am going to use it as a foundation for the community health practicum course, and I do feel like I have a strong understanding of the basics. I would treat this course as foundational, and I think it would be most helpful if you already have a program or area in mind in which you would like to do an evaluation so you can come out of the course with a substantive evaluation protocol.",
    "This course is a great way to learn the basics of program evaluation.

    "I would absolutely recommend this course!",
    "Yes",
    "This course is very useful. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in programmes in general since it provides relevant knowledge. It is very skill-oriented unlike other MPH classes. Both professors are very down-to-earth in both style and content, they are professionals and therefore do a very good job in paying attention to the students needs and interests and making the class relevant and applicable. They are also very experienced and knowledgeable, yet still flexible and approachable.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn program evaluation in a practical way. However, there is a time investment in drafting a good evaluation plan (which is part of the final class project), so it is helpful if you are interested in a particular topic and or you intend to eventually carry out the evaluation plan you crafted.",
