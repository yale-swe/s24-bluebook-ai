   "comments": [
    "You definitely learn a lot in this class. However, the tests NEVER test your conceptual knowledge of the overlying ideas and main concepts presented in class. It is always on the tiny minutia in a corner of one slide. It can be very frustrating. Overall, it was a good class.",
    "Boring lectures, straightforward exams, not a bad elective",
    "No",
    "Take this class! I'm a history major and this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you are a person this class is relevant to your life and you will get so much out of it. Just take thorough notes during lecture and you will be fine. it was definitely one of my favorite classes so far.",
    "This is a great elective for MCDB. Interesting subject with a lot of real world applicability and deals with many current issues in the field. I found the different professors very interesting, and it was nice to have the same person every day, but to have specialists in different fields as well as professors from the medical school. Great class.",
    "One of the best MCDB classes at Yale. Very easy. Fairly graded. Generally interesting.",
    "Great overview of biology of reproduction. Good for majors and non majors alike. Lectures were very enjoyable and interesting because each person was presenting on a topic that they were particularly interested in.",
    "Yes! The course was awesome, and I don't know of any other course where you can hear from so many interesting and accomplished speakers about a really interesting topic. It was great.",
    "I recommend this class for everyone who wants to take repro bio. It is a good class and the exams are straightforward",
    "Great course to take for an overview of information everyone should know!",
    "The course is great at covering at least the bare minimal of all topics related to human reproductive biology. By having guest lecturers, we were able to learn about specific topics from professionals who specialized in those topics which also made for great networking opportunities. There are only three exams which are not to hard if you go to class and review your notes a few days ahead of time.",
    "3 exams, each 33% of grade.",
    "I'm not a bio major, but according to better informed people, this appears to be one of the better MCDB classes. The lectures are all given by different people, and amazingly most of them aren't terrible. In fact, the great lecturers completely make up for the substandard ones. The tests are pure memorization of slides. A trained monkey could do it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a lot of memorization, but very worth it, and very doable.",
    "only 3 midterms. no final which is huge. there are a lot of smart people that take this class so beware the curve. makeup midterm was significantly harder. great credit\/d class",
    "Course is interesting and exams are straightforward.",
    "I found this class to be full of interesting material that's fun to learn about. The different lecturers kept the course exciting, although obviously some were better than others. For the most part they were really good though and made the course enjoyable. Tests definitely required a lot of studying and memorization but were completely reasonable.",
    "A phenomenal class, especially if you're interested in obstetrics and gynecology. Most of the visiting lecturers are great and the TAs are very straightforward on what's going to be on the exams (they're the ones who write them). Go to the review sessions. Revel in the fact that there are no problem sets. Study hard for the midterms because the class is full of premeds and the material is all regurgitation.",
    "Take this class. It is great. Not quite as good as physio but easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "A fantastic class. The material is really interesting! I loving telling my friends weird facts about pregnancy, childbirth, hormones, etc... As a junior MCDB major, this was also practically a gut compared to my other biology classes. There are three midterms, no final, no psets, no quizzes. The midterms are easy, just multiple choice and short answer questions straight off the Powerpoint slides. HIGHLY recommended for MCDB majors looking for an elective credit.",
    "Reproductive biology from people in the field, most are not particularly good teachers, very hit and miss, felt like could study material without going to class, most classes felt like a waste of time, and upsetting since the information is amazing. If you are a person who wants constant good teaching be wary.",
    "This class is great because for once you're learning about human systems! You'll know your human reproductive biology so well by the end of it. This is information I think everyone should learn at some point. It's interesting, the lecturers are so amazing, and if you put in the effort it should pay off.",
    "I would recommend it overall, but know that it is not a gut class as some people suggest. Having three midterms only and no final no nothing is good, but then you really have to ace the midterms- there is no room for messing up!",
    "Doable class for non-science majors interested in the topic. Very straightforward and not difficult to do reasonably well in if you put the time into studying for exams. Really interesting course.",
    "Lecture 3x a week and three midterms. Most of the lectures are taught by doctors or researchers, so it's cool to learn from people deep in the field. The trade off though is that there are a ton of guest lecturers, some of whom are better than others. The midterms are very memorization based, and the averages were very high, so be prepared to spent a decent amount of time memorizing slides.",
    "Very interesting, low time commitment. But the tests are nitpicky. But I enjoyed the variety of lectures and speakers. Grade is based on three midterms and the content of the midterms is, at best, found in the corners of slides and sometimes not even mentioned in class.",
    "It's interesting material but the TAs are horrible and you basically have a new different professor for each lecture. I'll let you decide if that's the format you want.",
    "Pretty interesting class and virtually no work. 3 midterms. no quizzes. no psets.",
    "Really good and easy bio course. The lecturers change depending on the topic and all are experts in their fields. Most lecturers are really good, tests are very straightforward, and you learn a lot",
    "Definitely take it! The course is taught by med school professors who give great insight into the field from a clinical perspective. Even if you aren't premed, the material is accessible and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this as an extra bio course. Lot of interesting info and no final!",
    "Easy, interesting bio elective.",
    "It's a great class. Take it, it's a bio gut. Straight memorization",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Repro is an awesome bio elective. The material is very enjoyable and the class layout of only three exams is awesome. Make sure you study hard for them, though!",
    "Greatest biology class at Yale. No homework, no textbook readings, no problem sets, no midterm, no final. Just 3 NON-cumulative exams. Professors are OBGYNs from the Yale School of Medicine--85% of the lectures are amazing. It made me want to become an OBGYN and reaffirmed my desire to be a doctor. Exams are SUPER HARD and SUPER specific--you have to MEMORIZE a billion things including teeny weeny details on every single slide. Prepare to have your brain expanded by 10 times! :D The class is just too amazing for words. Take it--you'll realize just how incredible biology is afterwards.",
    "Repro is good class in that its interesting, its not very much work, and it is easy to get an A in. The guest lecturer format (basically every lecture is given by someone different usually an OB\/GYN at the med school) has upside and downside. Some of the lecturers are fantastic but others are terrible. And generally, the expectations about how much you already know and how much science you will understand vary widely from lecture to lecture. Overall though, most of the material is interesting, and there is no work except studying for three midterms - which are entirely multiple choice.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are interested in the material and are willing and able to spend lots of time memorizing details. It is not that much work at all - just three midterms.",
    "Repro Bio is a fun and interesting class. Just be prepared to study hard for the tests so that you can get all the detail related points.",
    "It is interesting, and a worthwhile topic, but unless the format of the class changes, I would not take it. It may seem great to have so many different guest lecturers, specialists in all their fields, but it makes the exams very difficult. You are not sure what is stressed on the exams, since each lecture is presented in a different way.",
    "great!",
    "I came away from this course with a greater awareness, if not also a greater knowledge and thorough understanding, of human reproduction as both a science and a social element. This class covers a lot of biology, making it worthwhile for MCDB majors, but also discusses cultural aspects of reproduction like IVF and cloning. It was a great elective course.",
    "I would say it overall teaches some really important stuff but lectures are hit or miss",
    "You learn everything about reproduction from fertilization to menopause and everything in between.",
    "it's an easy enough class (just memorize details), BUT it's super unsatisfying. you will come out of this class not learning relevant biology principles. you will be bored. the stuff they taught in the class was all self-explanatory and stuff you could google, and if you're a person who's more interested in learning at yale, you'll find a better class to take.",
    "Great great great class. Take it. But the grading is super not transparent. I have no clue what the curve will be for this class",
    "Yes, I recommend it though, but maybe as a senior fall class or junior year\/sophomore year class. Senior spring, too much preparation for the exams when you just want to unload. That being said, Repro Bio is a really interesting course, and totally applicable to real life. Real talk though, the exams creep up on you. It's tough to make yourself go to lecture every day when there are only three days (three in class exams) you have to worry about the entire semester...and if you tank one, put a fork in it, cuz it's done like dinnah. Other than that though, really interesting course. Review lectures on a regular basis. And textbook isn't needed.",
    "MCDB 240 covers a lot of cool material! Rotating guest lecturers, many of them clinicians, keep things interesting. Three non-cumulative midterms require that you study hard but aren't overwhelming. The one downside of the course was that the TF's didn't really know what they were talking about - better to address questions to the guest lecturers themselves.",
    "Decent class not much synthesis. Just memorize all the slides before the midterms and you're good.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in Reproduction or just looking for an MCDB elective. Honestly, this class was so chill and I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Really enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it to another student. Workload is very light but material is really interesting. Anyone interested in how the body works or looking for a science elective should take this. Really, anyone. Make sure you go to class though. Textbooks aren't necessary. Only drawback is that so many premed\/bio majors take this that the curve is a little tough.",
    "A solid course in the MCDB department and my favorite so far, partly because I am interested in OB-GYN and partly because it was so efficiently organized and well-run. There are three midterms, no final. The exam material is straightforward and mostly from the lecture presentations. Guest lecture quality varies but most of the lecturers are relatively easy to follow (there were a couple of really bad ones though so hopefully they will be changed).",
    "MCDB240 is a very straight-forward class, except for the tests. Your grade depends on 3 mid-terms and that's it, so you don't have to do any work outside of studying for the tests. That's where it gets tricky, however. The questions are very, very detail-oriented and can trip you up on silly things that don't seem relevant at all to what you learned. That being said, the lectures on a whole were pretty interesting. I like the fact that the lecturers changes every couple of classes so that we could be introduced to a wide variety of topics.",
    "I'd say take it! But, also definitely shop the first 2 weeks and make sure you like the style! And check out some of the slides for the later lectures to make sure they interest you and aren't too heavy. TAKE LAB TOO IF YOU CAN!",
    "I absolutely recommend this as a bio elective, or even for a non-bio major. It is a course with huge real-world applications, and it is taught in a really engaging, accessible way."
