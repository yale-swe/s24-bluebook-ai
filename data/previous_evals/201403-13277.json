    "If you are taking this class after L1 and L2, do not expect things to be especially different. If you liked L1 and L2, you will probably like L3. If you didn't, you still may like the second half of the semester. The class is divided in half a little before Thanksgiving. The first half finishes up JSL with JSL part 3. The second half introduces Sura-Sura, a really really great textbook (written by Seto Sensei!!). The semester starts off with a bit of review, but picks up quickly. As with the previous Japanese courses, there is a lot of work outside of class every night (on an extremely light night, 45 minutes, average being around 1.5 hours a night). This course is a lot of work, but it teaches you Japanese, and that's the point! Take it, odds are that you haven't yet had Maruyama Sensei or Seto Sensei, and they are a blast. Don't let yourself fall too far behind because it will be difficult to catch up due to the fast pace and momentum of the class.",
    "If you enjoyed first year Japanese at Yale, then you will have a great time in Japanese 130. Maruyama-sensei and Seto-sensei are wonderful and make every class a delight. The first half of the semester is spent studying part III of the JSL textbook, which has extremely thorough explanations of grammar. I had already learned how to study JSL, so I felt very comfortable using the new grammar structures; however, I often felt overwhelmed by the amount of vocabulary in each lesson, especially since many of these words did not come up at all in class. Also, the textbook felt very dated, and many of the core conversations were things I would never say in real life. Switching to Surasura halfway through the semester was a nice change of pace. I found it very useful to have a second look at grammar structures we had already learned, and it was nice to have everything (readings, vocab lists, grammar explanations, and kanji) consolidated in one book. The readings were more relevant and interesting, and class time was generally spent answering questions about the readings. The workload is about the same as 110 and 120, but I felt that I was able to do it more efficiently.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. I have learnt Japanese by myself for one year and this is the very first time for me to systematically learn Japanese. My grammar and listening were both poor but this class really helped bridge those gaps. Great class!",
    "I would recommend Japanese 130 as a great class for student learning, but caution the student that this is a very demanding and time-consuming class.",
    "Japanese 130 is a lot of work, but if you're even this far into studying Japanese, you obviously have an interest in the language. Go ahead and take it. It will definitely expand what you're able to say\/write\/understand, and if you like the language, the work isn't that bad."
