    "I learned a great deal about the American South--its past and its presently inherited conflicts. I also improved my research and writing skills.",
    "Learned a great, great deal about the untold story of the South. In particular, how to engage with marginalized narratives that were wholly new to me. Really fascinating, and walked away with a lot to munch on mentally.",
    "I learned to appreciate history in a new way and consider the importance of narrative when constructing history. I learned so much about the American south and broader American confrontations with Race and inequality.",
    "Learned a lot about the South's culture and how historians write history. Especially loved learning how to write a research paper.",
    "A better understanding of how to come up with original historical research and writing. As well as a sharpened ability to interpret historical events within regional context.",

    "Strengths: Professor Gilmore, time range was really well-spaced, readings, great classmates, music and other connections outside of readings were frequent Weaknesses: readings\/ course covered a specific track of Southern history and neglected other important content to a large degree",
    "Two books too many. We would have benefited from a slightly longer discussion on a few and a slightly slower pace of class. This course demanded a tooooooooon of workmore than nearly every course I've taken at Yale. This is great, in a sense, as it demands effort and engagement. But some weeks I found myself struggling to keep up, even with an earnest effort and true interest.",
    "Amazing class - I can't think of any ways to make it better",
    "The strengths are everything Gilmore brings to the table. I wish everyone could experience it but alas not everyone can since this is the last time Gilmore is teaching.",
    "It's fun, engaging, and i learned a ton.",
    "I loved this course!"

    "This was Professor Gilmore's last time teaching, so I don't think others will have a chance to take this class. However, if you do, TAKE IT. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes! Too bad Gilmore is leaving, as she's a wonderful professor with a warm heart and enormous mind. It was a pleasure to learn from her, and be a part of a long line of students who've gone on to change the world, one book at a time.",
    "Absolutely - amazing course with Yale's best professor",
    "Absolutely, though I know this was Professor Gilmore's last semester of teaching. The subject matter felt particularly relevant and urgent this semester, and Professor Gilmore was with us every step of the way. She is an absolute genius with a sharp wit and genuine care for her students. I felt like our class had bonded under her care, and I learned more than I ever expected about the region I call home.",
    "This is the last time Gilmore is teaching, but DAMN this was a great class. Never had a professor before who seemed to work so hard for her students.",
    "YES omg this course is one of the best I've taken at Yale. I feel very lucky to have gotten the chance to learn from Professor Gilmore before she leaves yale.",
    "Yes. Take this course",
    "YES! Although, I don't know who could ever fill Professor Gilmore's place.",
    "Yes although it won't exist because sadly Professor Gilmore is retiring!"
