    "#9: I think the field trips might be the weakest part of the class - what really stands out to me from the Don Morrow workshop were the endless case studies he gave at the end, which seemed designed just to 'trick' us! And the title workshop is a valuable experience, but it's not very efficient. Not sure there is any way to remedy that - but I do think we could get the same experience in even a shorter portion of the day.",
    "The course was useful to my interests and I appreciated the variety of speakers. Likewise, I appreciated the workshop with Don Morrow, but wished that it could have been held during the week (or class time, ideally). Perhaps this could be achieved by having one less speaker.",
    "I was an auditor in this class and the learning experience from all the speakers was completely worth it.",
    "Great class with lots of information.",
    "The readings were far longer than they needed to be to convey the lessons of the class.",
    "It's helpful for learning about how conservation is actually done in the US.",
    "It's clear that this course is a continuous work in progress--and I mean that in the most complimentary way. There are fundamentals skills and concepts in this arena; this course covers them all adequately and incorporates hands-on applications. The syllabus was put together well and readings were thoughtfully selected and updated. There is a lot of great (free) material on v2. Brad is a good lecturer and keeps a captivating, efficient discussion in class. The course is heavily focused on practical documents, practical organizations (speakers), and a lot of really worthy information. Alex was a great TA and his enthusiasm and orderliness will be missed. If I had one suggestion, while the amount of practical information is available in spades, the missing element of the class is something more intangible. We heard several times this year from people about their different perspectives on conservation. At the end of thinking about conservation from many angles, our thoughts had time to evolve. Ultimately, some people are still coming to conservation from their unique perspective and haven't budged much. Maybe it would be good, here and there, to throw in a few selections from fiction or non-fiction that are exemplary of perspectives on conservation or expressions of values that are prevalent in conservation. Who knows? Could be a unique little tweak to an evolving course.The course was a very worthwhile experience, overall."

    "The speakers - and getting to pepper them with questions! This class was definitely the most satisfying \"speaker\" experience I've ever had. The reading response requirements due the day before are really crucial to feeling prepared to dig into the discussion. The other best thing is that the class comes to feel like such a community.",
    "Brad and Alex do a great job on their own and bring in excellent speakers",
    "Class project... and the opportunity to hear from everyone else in the class. I think the most useful skills I picked up were from speaking with other class members on their work.",
    "The best thing for me was the wide range of speakers that came to class and addressed land conservation from multiple scopes and backgrounds.",
    "The reading materials were very interesting and important.",
    "Weekly presentations.",
    "Great range of speakers, and Prof. Gentry did a good job of facilitating the conversation.",
    "Visiting lectures from practioners paired well with appropriate reading.",
    "All of the interesting speakers that came to talk with us. I also really enjoyed the opportunity to go to dinner with many of them as this provided us the chance to ask them a range of questions, get to know them, pick their brains etc. I also really appreciated how open and available both the professor and TA were throughout the semester and how well prepared they were.",
    "The speakers and the clinical project but the class as a whole was great.",
    "I really enjoyed the clinic component of the course and the guest speakers. Brad and Alex did a wonderful job of engaging students in their placements and with the guest speakers. They also chose a very broad range of topics that are important to the conservation community and professionals going forward. It was interesting to hear about all of the other experiences of the other students in the course but sometimes I felt like the discussion in the beginning of the class was more of one student speaking rather than a class discussion where other students chimed in with how their experiences related to the student speaking.",
    "Hearing from a variety of perspectives.",
    "guest speakers",
    "The client work",
    "Learning from so many practical stories from earnest people, including our colleagues. The readings were good, balanced, and useful. The clinical component is unique and challenging--just what it should be. It treated conservation seriously and illustrated over and over again the legitimacy of conservation as a business, legal, and environmental tool."

   "comments": [
    "One speaker in particular was a disappointment: Ned Sullivan, because of the disjunct between what we read about in preparation and what he talked about. It felt like he just gave us the same shpeal he would give to any audience. But maybe what's remarkable is how rare that was, and how sharp all the other speakers were. It must be a challenge getting speakers to talk about a certain topic area - like organizational development - rather than just give an overview of the work their organization does, but it makes all the difference in having the course feel like a progression of learning rather than just one case study after another.",
    "The repetition between material in class and in the Doing Deals workshop made the workshop difficult to sit through",
    "The work load and managing the speakers--sometimes its not always clear what the speakers are talking about.",
    "More structured discussion instead of discussion about group projects. These do not offer much learning except the person who is currently talking about their project, and almost everyone else tunes out, so that it becomes a 1-on-1 with Brad. While I understand that the point was to make connections among projects, this was not as effective in practice.",
    "The speakers should not be interrupted so much with questions. It really derails the presentation, and the students are there to hear the content, not their peers.",
    "I think the portion of the class where we discussed our clinical projects could use restructuring. I am not sure how exactly this section could be more helpful but it seemed to me that it wasn't very useful for the students talking or the students listening. Because students were called on people weren't willing to talk about their failures or what they were having trouble with but instead wanted to put their best foot forward in terms of talking about all the things they were doing. Maybe it would be helpful to have students volunteer to talk about their projects. Or maybe students should take turn and have to discuss one \"positive thing\" and one \"problem area.\" I think this an important part of the class but as it was it wasn't very valuable to me.",
    "The class can feel disjointed. The readings were too much - it felt like they had just been piled on from previous years and often felt repetitive. Combined with the client projects it meant a lot of work.",
    "too much time discussing clinical projects during class, not necessary.",
    "See reading suggestion in Question 11. A better room, if possible. That room is too prone to laptops. They are the ultimate mood killers."

    "I'm concentrating in environmental policy and governance and this course was very useful in the understanding of north American land conservation policies. The exposure to the different policy ways that you can successfully use to conserve land was particularly valuable. Moreover, getting exposed to the financial mechanisms that support those policies enabled me to understand the linkages between land conservation, organizations (such as land trusts) and continuity of the policies.",

    "I had someone to keep me on top of the assignment, I learned from my partner, and I had someone with whomto commiserate when the project was annoying.",
    "The advantages were that I learned about my leadership style and my strengths in terms of keeping people on task and getting things done. It was also nice to use the expertise of my fellow teammates to create a product. The disadvantages were that two out of the three teammates did most all of the work. It was hard to be the nag and \"herd\" the team. I also wish that the class had included some form of peer or group evaluation because I didn't feel there was a way to express my concerns about my group with out \"tattling\" on one of my teammates.",
    "Had a great partner so no disadvantages of the group work - everything worked out really well.",
    "Same problems as ever with division of labor.",
    "Advantages were that I got to work on a very interesting, very large clinical project that I never would have chosen to tackle independently.The disadvantages were that group work was not executed equally and portions of the overall product suffered because of it. If the course is to utilize teams for clinical projects, there MUST be a way to keep group members accountable as the semester ends and people are less enthused to be doing group work for a non capstone project course. At least this was my experience. I dislike peer evaluations on group work, but that is at least a starting point. If group work is going to be a main (or primary) component of the clinical portion of this course, individuals in the group have to be accountable for something other than Scout's Honor."
