    "Very low workload, but not the most interesting material. Take it as an easy 6th course perhaps. You will learn some useful material, but it will sometimes be a struggle to overcome boredom. Also, don't expect transparent grading (though I've heard it's very lenient).",
    "Honestly, I have no idea what my grade is for the class. It's the last week and we've only gotten back half the work we turned in, so it's a little scary. Otherwise the professors are interesting, the material is very useful I think for any future endeavors in science, and overall the course isn't very work-heavy. I would recommend it to MB&B majors in search of a relatively chill elective.",
    "The material in this class is fascinating, and I feel that I learned a lot. It's different from a lot of other science classes at Yale in the sense that there are no midterms and no final -- you are assessed based on take-home questions and one-page summaries of scientific papers. All of the lecturers are great, but it's taught at the med school and it can be a bit difficult to get to class on time if you have another class immediately before it. Grading is very opaque... there were six take-home questions total, and by the end of the semester we had only gotten three back. I found that the grading was relatively picky, and they did not tell us anything about what the overall distribution of grades would be like. So that was a bit frustrating, but overall I thought this was a wonderful class. Definitely take it if you have any interest in genetics!"
