    "Alright so here's the deal. In, ENAS 335 \/ Professional Ethics, every week you basically do \"cases.\" By \"cases,\" you read a short article and answer questions directly from the text. It's kind of annoying busywork, but it's not hard to do, and some of the articles are fairly interesting (e.g., bioethics). At the end of the semester, you have to write a 15 page paper on any topic you want. Overall, you don't really have to show up to lectures (the Prof. says she has photographic memory re:attendance but whether that's true, who's to say). At the end of the day you learn a little bit about ethics (Kant, Rawls, etc.), and it's a chill class. P.S., no idea why it's listed as Engineering & Applied Science LOL.",

    "I really enjoyed this course- I learned about the different underlying factors that come to play when interacting with peers in a professional setting .",
    "Great overview of philosophical and professional considerations in the field of ethics.",
    "This is a good fifth class if you dont care about learning, but I was honestly super disappointed in this class. A good guy should be pretty easy, but should still make students feel like theyre taking something away from the class. I can honestly say I learned nothing from this course. You will learn the most basic facts about different philosophical theories, but only read a level of depth that you probably reached in a high school English class. Theres also a very low level engagement with course material since the assignments are essentially just reading comprehension exercises. BUT, if youre looking for a wild easy course credit, this is it. I cannot overstate how easy this class is. So go for it if you dont care about how much you learn.",

    "Basic moral theories and famous ethical dilemmas We learned how to approach cases and new situations using the moral frameworks We learned about different ethics issues in real life (corporate, state, school, etc) and discussed their validity",
    "This course provides a survey of various basic ethical frameworks and exposes students to dozens of business and medical cases that highlight ethical dilemmas or fresh thoughts on organizational behavior. Personally, I have gained an appreciation for the importance (and difficulty) of ethical behavior in the workplace.",

   "comments": [
    "It teaches real life skills. It was a good way to actually learn real stuff.",
    "It's strengths include the weekly case studies, the guest speakers and supplementary videos that were provided. It can be improved by a bit more of a theoretical explanation of the sociological processes that govern ethical outcomes but this may have been beyond the scope of the class.",
    "gut",
    "The course consists of the necessary tools to prepare students to perform ethically in their professional lives. The course material is well balanced between information slides and explanatory visuals (videos, audios) that help students develop a well-rounded knowledge of the topic. However, informational slides could sometimes become monotone and dull which I feel left students unengaged and dosing off to other tasks in their computers.",
    "homeworks were engaging and I liked how we could personalize the final paper to apply what we learned to our interests.",
    "The strength are the case studies. They expose you to so many different examples of how business should be handled.",
    "The lectures were interesting though sometimes boring or dense. The content is good and Professor Carreras is very nice. I like the freedom in choosing the final paper topic.",
    "Great professor, clear expectations and curriculum",
    "The homework seemed to relate very tangentially to the material so it would be nice to have work that complements the classroom teachings. Other than that, it makes a difficult topic of ethics pretty accessible and applicable, so I liked that.",
    "Strengths: cases were short, comprehensible, and on the whole very interesting; Carreras truly cares about her students. Weaknesses: student engagement generally very low; a bit of confusion in terms of grading in the earlier stages of the course.",
    "Strengths is the topic. Weaknesses include engagement during the long lecture and class attendance by multiple students.",
    "Strength is the format, and also the material is really interesting; weakness is that mercedes is kind of unorganized.",
    "I wish there had been more clarity with expectations for the Case Studies. At times, I felt that the grading was arbitrary since there had never been clear communication about what was expected from our answers.",
    "The lectures (slides) and the course guide were poorly organized. I really enjoyed the articles and thought the assignments were interesting and meaningful."

    "Great class. Mercedes is awesome, generally easy workload besides the weekly psets which can take up to a few hours to complete.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Carreras is wonderful and loves the subjects she teaches. She is very friendly and speaking in class is not scary like in other lectures.",
    "Yes! Learn real stuff that will help you. Not boring random junk.",
    "Yes !",
    "An absolute must-take for seniors. Pretty gutty, and important for graduating students to have considered this stuff beforehand.",
    "Meh. Take it if you want an easy class. If you actually want to learn about ethics, take a better class.",
    "GUT",
    "Yes because of Mercedes",
    "Yes, I believe this is a necessary course to properly understand the behavior that is expected in the professional environment. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between what is and isn't ethical, and this course helps guide you towards differentiating the two and making more ethical choices.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Yes, great class applicable to every topic.",
    "Excellent course",
    "Yes. If a student is interested in learning about ethical decision making in business this is the course for them!",
    "Yes, if they are looking for a fairly simple course that is interesting.",
    "Yes. Really interesting course that covers ethical challenges spanning over several disciplines.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get into it.",
    "I would recommend if you need a light course load and want to learn about the basic moral\/ethical principles. It is very practical and eye-opening, although sometimes it gets tedious when the professor talks about old theories.",
    "I would recommend this to students looking for a fifth class but warn that you will get very little out of the course if you try to just skate by. While Carreras' lectures can sometimes be hard to follow, she cares very deeply about her students and the cases are short and on the whole very interesting and applicable to a variety of careers.",
    "Its an easier class for sure but interesting topics to read about and write a final paper on.",
    "This is a great, fun, interesting class, Professor Carreras is the best!!",
    "Yes, worth it.",
    "Never.",
    "Yes"
