   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to students who are interested in human rights broadly but not in pursuing particular issues in depth.",
    "I would recommend taking this class. If you're interested in human rights at all, you'll love most of the readings we're assigned. Additionally Professor Kalmanovitz really cares about the students in his seminar and is very engaged in seminar discussions. Also bonus: you don't need to buy any books or course packets- Professor Kalmanovitz puts all the readings online.",
    "This is a great class. Professor Kalmanovitz is extremely smart, but he's also very willing to help you think through your ideas. You have to make sure you do ALL of the reading every week, because you go through all the themes in close detail, and he expects a very high level of analysis.",
    "If you're interested in learning more about human rights from several different perspectives, definitely take the class. You'll get an overview of legal, historical, and political debates surrounding the development of the international human rights regime. Keep in mind it's the \"development\" bit. This class focuses a lot on both philosophy and history, so it's somewhere between a political philosophy and international relations class.",
    "If you are interested in international human rights law. The topic is very specific, but it is a very good introduction to how human rights law work and to organizations such as the UN, ICC and international tribunals.",
    "I would recommend Political Science 192 to a student ONLY if they are interested in the development of human rights policies. If you are taking this for an easy political science credit or because you are interested in the UN in general, I would not take it because the readings are very specific. I would suggest reading over the syllabus before you decided to take the class.",
    "This course is excellent, and Professor Kalmanovitz is very, very knowledgeable about the human rights regime. The readings are fantastic, and I think the discussions are very good. The guest speakers he brings in are so very helpful in giving a practitioner's view of the human rights regime. The professor is also very nice and approachable, and he really warms up to you after everything. His grading is also very fair.I would recommend this to any student who is interested in human rights and wants to gain more perspective on it\/wants to know how they can make a big difference.",
    "This was a really cool seminar that was enlightening in many ways. Some of the reading is heavy and dense, but the discussions in class helped to clarify them. There are only 3 short papers and an in-class presentation, all of which were fairly simple and enjoyable.",
    "Yes! There is a lot of theory involved, but the discussion is very interesting.",
    "Excellent course. Professor Kalmanovitz is very thoughtful and can keep class discussion lively and exciting. The response papers that were assigned for each class helped both the discussion leader and the rest of the class move in the right direction. He is also cognizant of the fact that students have a lot of papers to write and does a great job of spreading out the writing assignments throughout the semester.",
    "An excellent course if you are willing to do the reading. I was skeptical about the format--weekly seminars, each led by a team of students--but people really put in effort and made the discussions stimulating. Professor Kalmanovitz is one of the best teachers I have had at Yale. A great combination of big theoretical questions with sober looks at bureaucratic and institutional realities. Sometimes the discussions became redundant--there are a million ways to say that the United States has been hypocritical, there are a million reasons international institutions are inefficient, etc--but I still feel like I got a great deal out of the course. I'd definitely recommend it!"
