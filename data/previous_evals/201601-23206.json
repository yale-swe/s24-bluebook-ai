    "The Technological World is an absolutely awesome class and everyone at Yale should take it. If you've ever wondered how anything works, this is the class for you. Whether you're a STEM person or not a STEM person, the material of this class is accessible and just a ton of fun. 10\/10.",
    "Great prof and great class. All you really need is an algebra background for this class. Learning about how this physics applies to real world technology is cool too.",
    "Tech stuff",
    "Don't take this if you have a serious science background because you will probably be bored and infuriated, but if you don't have such a background and you want to take a science class that is a Pretty Real But Doable take this one.",
    "A previous review said \"it's a trap.\" I didn't listen. Maybe it's not a trap if you took AP Physics. But as a humanities major who hadn't taken math or physics in years, I was completely stumped. Be careful. It's a trap.",
    "A great, interesting, not too difficult science or QR credit. Especially if you have a decent high school physics background, the science shouldnt be too challenging, and the applications are really interesting. You learn about how everything works for GPS to X-rays to LCD screens to Yale swipe pads. Pretty neat! Professor H is an interesting lecturer (though he can be a bit quiet, so sit towards the front of the room!) and does lots of cool demos. The homework and exams are fair. Definitely worth checking out.",
    "An interesting science class for non-science majors. Must be interested in the course subject though because otherwise it would not be worth it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students that are interested in physics and learning about technology because it can be a long and very boring class if you are not interested in it.",
    "It is an okay course to take, it allows you to learn about the technology you use everyday, but there are other courses that are better if you are a non-stem student looking to fulfill a DQ.",
    "Warning: Do NOT take this class if you are not prepared to review intro-level high school physics\/chemistry in just 2-3 weeks and then start learning new stuff. The class requires a serious amount of effort.",
    "YES PLEASE TAKE IT! Don't take some gutty SC credit that will kill IQ cells. This class is very approachable AND you get to learn so much from it. Definitely came away with a greater appreciation for technology and some physics concepts along the way!",
    "Take it!",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who loves physics and does not struggle with the subject at all. Non-stem folks should stay far away from this class.",
    "Honestly really enjoyed this class. being mathematically inclined the psets where never hard and the material was interesting and applicable. I love being able to say how things work even if the class was a little dumbed down so we could get it."
