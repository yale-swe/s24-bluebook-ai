    "Better control of writing, larger vocabulary, and improvement in my Spanish pronunciation.",
    "Extending knowledge of the rest of the building blocks for constructing and understanding Spanish grammar and greater engagement with parts of Spanish culture and history.",
    "I improved and practiced my ability to communicate in Spanish.",
    "I increased my ability to understand Spanish, not just grammatically, but critically, like in conversations of readings etc.",
    "I improved my spanish grammar, especially my use of the subjunctive.",
    "My spoken language skills, and knowledge of Latin American \/ Spanish literature, film, and history increased immensely thanks to this course.",
    "I learned how to speak Spanish with more fluency and with a greater understanding of grammar. I developed a greater interest in Spanish literature and culture."

   "comments": [
    "I feel that the course was very strong in its use of the resources at Yale, including the art gallery. I enjoyed much of our coursework, but I felt that we didn't utilize the textbook enough to make its exorbitant price worthwhile. I felt that we could have been challenged more by the novel we read at the end of the semester, but the class atmosphere was relatively low-pressure.",
    "I think the course is structured well and provides many opportunities to grow as a speaker and writer.",
    "Strength in encountering primary texts and works from Spanish speaking countries. It was difficult to increase speaking fluency with time limited to peer activities.",
    "Please, reduce the number of required semesters for foreign language. It hurts a lot of students' gpa's, and unfairly benefits students who went to private high schools.",
    "The course was good at getting us to engage with a lot of texts, but I think a lot of the work felt extraneous and gave me less time to actually understand and work on comprehension\/langauge skills. In short, it felt like it was often an unnecessary amount of work.",
    "I think that the final text could be more interesting than Batallas en el Desierto, and I wish that the online homework (supersite) had some sort of reminder system because I lost a lot of points on homework because I forgot that there was supersite homework because it was never mentioned in class.",
    "There was a lot of oral discussion and dialogue, which forced you to speak the language and become comfortable speaking it, which is necessary in improving your skills in a language. Sometimes it felt as if there was not enough time to complete all the tasks or activities that were given."

    "Spanish 140 is am engaging class that teaches and reinforces key principles of the language. It's conducted entirely in Spanish, and that fosters stronger speaking and listening skills. I would definitely recommend this course to someone looking to continue their Spanish education.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I would say that this is a great course for showing someone the holes in their Spanish abilities. It is not the end of the line for fluency but it's basically the most you can learn Spanish within the regular school track.",
    "If you're in this class then you probably need to be in order to graduate. Or you're already fluent in Spanish and are trying pad your gpa for med school.",
    "Yes. Its a good L4 language class. Lots of grammar. Tough at points, but you definitely improve language skills. Having a good professor is key.",
    "Yes- spanish is very useful and this course improves your spanish grammar and writing skills. However, because of the way the class was structured (lots of fill-in-the-blank grammar exercises and not a ton of discussion), I feel like my conversational spanish got worse.",
    "The course helps you become more comfortable in speaking Spanish, and it also helps you improve your grammar and writing skills. You also learn a lot about the culture and literature."
