I also really enjoyed and appreciated the guest lecture from Matt Carroll, I thought his contributions were thought-provoking and right on point and I think he's a great addition to the course if you can bring him back next year.",
    "It's real, and based in science. The lectures are good, and student presentations are phenomenal.",
    "I very much enjoyed the group discussions following the student presentations. I think that opportunities for student communication are extremely important for learning because of the exposure to new ideas and because I retain information better when I have something invested in it. I also really appreciated the pacing of the work and the total workload. It allowed me to delve deeply into issues and topics that were of particular interest to me without bogging down in general or irrelevant information.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures, and Ann's lectures, as always, were clear and organized. I also like the student presentations, which provided an opportunity to get a more in-depth perspective on a specific issue.",

Then we could have had a couple of extra class sessions to discuss the policy and cultural dimensions of fires and fire fighting in the U.S. (and other places!) in a little more depth. I also wish we had all been able to read one of the books--The Big Burn or Young Men and Fire (or another one)--and had a half-day class discussion about them.",
    "The course is too slow. Maybe just make it a 2 credit course? There doesn't seem to be enough material, even with the student presentations.",
    "Student presentation dates should be agreed upon well in advance of the presentation.",
    "A little more discussion of the readings. There was a lot of information in the readings that could be discussed. Also, the timing of the field trip was unfortunate, most people could not go due to conflicts."

    "Rather than how it fits into my overall program, I'd like to state that it fits into my overall future plans to work in the mountain west. Fire is a native aspect to this landscape (and many others) so a firm understanding of this topic is going to be very helpful.",
    "It was a great fit with my western focus, and helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the ecology of specific ecosystems. It's also wonderfully interdisciplinary since it deals with science, policy, economics, and management.",
    "As a western-oriented forester, this course is critical in terms of understanding a central aspect of western landscapes. Getting an overview of how fire has shaped and continues to shape policy and management is essential for anyone hoping to work in land management in the West.",
    "This course was my first real exposure to fire issues. Unfortunately, I feel as though the class was a standalone course since few if any other forestry courses really focus on western silviculture\/operations. It's a good course for someone wanting to work in the eastern US who wants exposure to western issues. I feel that it's not enough to prepare someone for actually working in the west.",
    "This was an important aspect of my program because I am interested in western forestry issues. The ecological and social aspects of wildfire are incredibly important to my studies at FES."

I learned the most from those lectures. Students who are very new to fire issues may have a hard tim participating in class discussions.",
