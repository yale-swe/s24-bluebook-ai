    "Formative lit-based course with enjoyable work and a professor who cares.",
    "I loved this! I recommend it to all! Very wonderful reading, and the class is just once a week!",
    "If you're at all interested in Paris or 19th century art, literature, and urbanization, take this course. The reading list is long but you'll walk away having read a wide range of authors and critics. It's great to have taken a course that uses different modalities for analysis and discussion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 historical, social, cultural and literary. You get the best of every world.",
    "Fantastic overview of the historical, poetic, literary, and even artistic landscape of 19th century Paris. Prof. Samuels is excellent, but you oughta have a genuine interest in reading the material if you take the course. Can be a lot of pages at times.",
    "Yes. you read great stuff. Reasonable workload.",
    "This class is awesome!!! If you love learning about beautiful French things - literature, art, architecture, culture - you are going to LOVE this class. Professor Samuels is a fantastic section leader. He takes a interdisciplinary approach to the topic, combining political theory, social theory, urbanization, and history, to lead the class to really interesting conclusions. The workload is completely doable, and you're going to love doing it anyway, because it's all interesting and beautiful.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course to another student.Sometimes, our discussions on the main themes-materialism, female roles, \"fl\u00c3\u00a2neurs\", and the effects of Haussman's work on the Parisian boulevards--became repetitive. I could go into the class without having completed the reading and get a relatively clear idea of where the conversation was headed. We also toss around the word \"modernity\", but I'm still not sure what this means. This is NOT to say that the topics weren't interesting. But in general I might be less enchanted by Paris than others.I personally recommend this course more for the professor than for the content. I love professor Samuels!!! He is just so approachable, he makes conversation flow smoothly, and he weaves in interesting sociological analyses at times.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's interesting, a fairly light workload and really rewarding.",
    "It's a survey mostly of literature during this period. I would take it if you're interested in how the Paris of today came to be."
