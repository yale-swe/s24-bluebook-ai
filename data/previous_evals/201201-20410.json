   "comments": [
    "It's a departmental requirement, so most students wouldn't have a choice. I'm not personally super interested in much of the material, so it wasn't my favorite course, but for those interested, it would be a good one.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Absolutely. The application of physics to the energetics of transport was really interesting, very well taught, and then tied in nicely to the mechanisms of disease in the final weeks of the course. I also really enjoyed that the professors and TA (Grace Kim) organized 2 class outings - it was a really nice way to get out in New Haven, get to know each other, and enjoy life outside the classroom. The professors participation in this class was top notch and I feel that I actually learned something as opposed to studying just for the exam.Awesome course.",
    "I would summarize Pharmacology 560 as course that takes an in depth look at the role and function of molecular machines in the human body. This is a course that nicely ties in various malfunction of molecular machines to various disease and therefore has significant clinical relevance.I would recommend this course to other students because it is very informative and interesting.",
    "ENAS 570 is an introductory course about molecular mechanisms of a variety of proteins. It is a worthwhile class to take to if one wants to get a sense of how molecular cell biology can inform disease pathophysiology.",
    "Exactly as the course description reads. Has both research and clinical aspects. Yes, because course may be beneficial to graduates and undergrads alike."
