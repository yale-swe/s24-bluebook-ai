   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this class, or any other taught by Facundo Alonso, to other philosophy students. It was a challenging but rewarding class in which we discussed recent work on norms of rationality for belief and intention in depth.",
    "Really interesting material - but also very challenging material.",
    "Surprisingly, this course is about intentions, beliefs, and rationality. More specifically, it's about the norms of rationality for what we should intend and believe, especially 'structural' norms such as the norm of consistency for intentions or beliefs (don't intend or believe contradictory things) and the norm of means-end coherence for intentions (if you intend an end, intend the means). We cover a lot of very recent philosophical thought on these subjects in the course. The first half of the course focuses on belief, andthe second half on intentions, with an emphasis on parallels between the two.I would recommend this course to a highly advanced philosophy student interested in epistemology or ethics. There is a lot of work - three articles per week, a reading response, and two papers - and the discussion plays at a graduate level, so this course is not for beginning philosophers. However, it was highly rewarding for me."
