    "I learned how to approach the difficult text of Chekhov through the 5 Stanislavsky questions of acting. We tackled monologues, scenes (short and long) and then reapplied what we learned throughout the semester to our contemporary monologues.",
    "This class is a solid acting class. It developed my understanding of character, motivation, action, etc. and provided ample time and opportunity to employ those tactics in an open, free space.",
    "This is the best acting class I've taken at Yale. I learned huge amounts",
    "I definitely became much more familiar with the work of Chekhov and especially liked Professor Wallace's method of asking actors \"what is your first offer?\" I learned a lot about approaching a scene for the first time and how to rehearse in order to improve.",
    "Learned a lot about Russian history and Chekhov, but more importantly a lot of acting skills and techniques that allow me to approach a text and a scene with more depth.",
    "I developed my ability to take my time in a scene and to let yourself really experience something before you move onto the next beat.",
    "I learned a ton about acting and about truthful behavior! I learned a bunch about my own acting and what I need to work on as I go into the industry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Fewer people should be in the course. We had 12 actors and it should be limited to 8. That would allow for more time to perform. It's hard to get going in just 20 minutes. And just when you think you've succeeded or gotten somewhere your time ends.",
    "This course does a good job of teaching and implementing acting technique. A smaller class size would allow for less down time, for each student only worked for may 30 minutes of each four hours class. We also never warmed up, which, considering the 8:30 AM time slot, made being present a bit difficult sometimes.",
    "The course itself there are no weaknesses but the 8 am start time was hard",
    "One of the weaknesses of the course is the timing. To have a class at 8:25 am on Friday definitely lowers students engagement (and alertness) after a long and tiring week. I often wanted to be much more engaged and awake than I was, and felt like I was sometimes struggling to stay awake. Despite this fact, Professor Wallace was always extremely engaged and committed. It was clear that he had vested interest in the students and cared a lot about what he was teaching. I really liked how working in such a small class gave us a lot of one-on-one time on scenes and how we got to repeat monologues\/scenes from week to week which definitely helped me feel like I was improving. I particularly enjoyed the last class in which we all performed and got very specific feedback from Prof. Wallace.",
    "Great discussions and group participation. The timing of the course wasn't the best because I was still half asleep... Fridays are already rough because I didn't sleep all week and then an early morning four hour class was also difficult. But definitely worth it!",
    "A studio acting scene class is a rare thing at Yale and it's nice to have the opportunity to perform and really work in that way;8:25 was way too early tho.",
    "It's an incredible studio acting class! I would prefer it was in the afternoon, but that's my only suggestion for improvement."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. While it has it's flaws (down time, early morning slot, etc.) it is one of the strongest acting courses I've encountered at Yale.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "YES!!! We are so lucky to learn from professor Wallace",
    "Yes, definitely! I think this course is a must-take for anyone interested in pursuing acting as a career or those who really enjoy Russian theater.",
    "This was a really great course -- Professor Wallace is really incredible and you get a lot of helpful individualized feedback on your performances in the scenes and monologues. It's a long class but worth it for the studio style class.",
    "Yes, if they wanted to have a real scene class and work on their acting, I would recommend it",
    "This is the best studio acting class you will take at Yale! If you have a chance to take a class with Professor Wallace then absolutely do it!! Even if its at 8:25am on Friday!"
