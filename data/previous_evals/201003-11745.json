    "Every student at Yale should experience a class with Professor Estrella at least once. He is an extremely interesting and eccentric professor. This class very rarely conformed to the syllabus but that was part of what made this class so good. The days when there was a lot of class participation were the days that I got the most out of this class - it really is a collaborative effort. This class tended to be an exploration of cultural matters in general rather than just Spain but I enjoyed this class nonetheless.",
    "YES. Though the direction of the course is not always clear, class sessions are always fun and the workload isn't bad.",
    "I would not recommend this course with this professor. The subject matter sounded interesting to me, and I think with another professor it could have been more enjoyable. By and large there were very few assignments and very little work, but I also feel I gained almost nothing out of this class. I thought my Spanish would improve, but I found class discussions never encouraged me to participate and if anything my Spanish only got worse.",
    "If you want a really fun class with great course material and not many assignments, take this class.",
    "Musings of Ernesto on all sorts of random aspects of Spanish life, vaguely dictated by the syllabus and historical events and a couple books. You need to be pretty proficient\/fluent in Spanish because he takes your language ability for granted. Workload is minimal; some reading, a couple \"reflexiones\" (which are actually pretty fun to write if you're comfortable writing in Spanish) and an oral presentation. The best part is just hearing Ernesto talk about Spain; it's like his idiosyncrasies are indicative of Spanish culture as a whole, which made everything come full circle.",
    "The reading is a decent amount, and class discussion is almost all in Spanish, so your speaking abilities are just as important as your reading and writing abilities. There were not many writing assignments, but they were interesting and satisfying, and provided an opportunity to be creative with the material we learned. Professor Estrella is entertaining and provided a lot of connections outside of Spanish culture, provoking our interest.",
    "Not a class you want to take if you seriously want to improve your Spanish, but a class you should take if you\u0092re looking for an entertaining professor and an easy grade. Two reflections, one final paper. All about 3-5 pages."
