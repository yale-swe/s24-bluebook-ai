    "Take this class if you can get in! Sethi is great. He is extremely knowledgeable and he has incredible experience in the field. It is fascinating to learn this material from the perspective of one of the \"good guys.\" Not very much work, the grading was lenient, and the material is important.",
    "An overview of major themes in business ethics; we go over some fundamental theories of CSR and then talk about how ethical decision-making is affected by both market structure and individuals.",
    "Very interesting course that teaches you about ethics \/ the lack of ethics in business today. Lots of work, but not difficult. The paper is actually interesting and fun to write. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes, pretty easy and interesting seminar. The papers are very interesting to write!"
