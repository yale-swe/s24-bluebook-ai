   "comments": [
    "I took this class becuase I was curious about the ancient greeks. While much of the time I found their rambling to be pointless, sometimes they say something very thought-provoking, and i've learned enough about them to understand what most people mean when they reference them. also, not a very hard workload at all.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the major, as it is a prerequisite. The material is challenging and can sometimes be frustrating, but the lectures are sufficiently explanatory. This class definitely introduces the student to philosophy as an academic field and is sufficiently interesting.",
    "This class is what it says it is - a survey overview to the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and the Pre-Socratics, as well as a bit of Epicurean and Stoic thought. If you have a great interest in that area, then perhaps you will enjoy this class more than I did, but it is required for the philosophy major. I would only recommend this course to those who need it for the major, but understand that there are some who may like it independent of that.",
    "If you love philosophy enough to motivate yourself to engage in a class which refuses to engage you back, then take this course. My advice would be to learn about the history of philosophy and the individual theories of the ancient philosophers, yes, but shop around and do so through a class which you find enjoyable. The first few classes taught during shopping period accurately represent what you will experience through the rest of the semester, so keep that in mind if you aren't thrilled by how the class begins.",
    "If you know you are majoring in philosophy and have to take this course, then clearly take it, but if you do not know if you are majoring in philosophy, I would not recommend it. I took this class thinking there was a large chance i would major in philosophy, and now I'm having doubts. The readings were a bit scattershot and boring, and the lecture did not help sort out the readings very well. The papers were frustrating, because the first two were drily logical, and it's difficult to take a drily logical approach to Plato. I wish I had taken Logic or some other class that would introduce me to a specific area of philosophy that might have been more interesting than this broad approach to the ancients.",
    "It's a required class for philosophy majors, which made the class an interesting mix of curious freshman and I-just-declared-my-major sophomores and juniors. The material is interesting and is what you're always heard talked about: Plato and Aristotle. If you're not really interested in philosophy and in never-ending arguments and never finding a happy answer (what bothered me) that will satisfy your whole section, then don't take the class. Also, if you don't get enough sleep and often feel tired in lecture, you will fall asleep.",
    "This course has a light work load. The readings are manageable. However, there are three essays, which are graded pretty harshly.This is a relaxed introduction to philosophy. Highly recommended.",
    "This class focuses mainly on Plato and Aristotle. If you want a solid introduction to the major texts of these two authors, then this class is for you. The papers and readings weren't overwhelmingly long, either.",
    "Take it if you have to (for the major) or really enjoy the classic philosophers. Otherwise go for something more exciting",
    "Yes. If you want to learn some basics about philosophy, this may be a good option.",
    "I would recommend Phil 125 to any student who is interested in philosophy but does not want to do DS. I would summarize the course as reading a lot of important ancient Greek philosophers whose work is pretty much the basis of all of philosophy.",
    "It was okay, but not great. The teacher wasn't very engaging.",
    "One of those classes where you are glad you take it only at the end of it all...Take it with Verity Harte if you get the chance, because Bobzien is a pretty boring lecturer although she really does care about her students and the T.A.s are great with meeting with the students.",
    "Do NOT take this course, especially if it is with Professor Bobzien.The material was interesting and I thought it was great that we covered different subjects in philosophy: philosophy of religion, political phil, etc.However, Professor Bobzien was awful. She was boring and unprofessional. Her grading policy is also unfair. She did not teach us how to write a philosophy paper but instead threw the assignment at us. She did not tell us how it would be graded, and instead took off points for things I had no knowledge about (i.e. I argued something that she said was hard to argue and also I didn't seem to understand a distinction she never discussed). Also, she accepts only her intepretation of the material and tries to create an objective answer, though there shouldn't be one.Excluding Professor Bobzien, I would say the class is good. However, there are much better and more interesting classes out there. While this class might have given me some background in certain fields in philosophy as well as info about the ancients, I think I would have preferred a class in a certain discipline such as political philosophy.I would audit the course if you're interested in the material.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to (i.e. you're a philosophy major and I'm sorry).",
    "I would, this class really reveals the foundation on which philosophy stands on and illuminates a lot of interesting concepts that I found myself thinking about after class\/section.",
    "A good, interesting class with well-organized lectures and handouts. Go to lectures. Do the readings. Pay attention in lecture (it's hard sometimes, I'll admit). The professor is slightly eccentric, but in a way that makes lecture more interesting. Also, if Alex Silverman is still TAing, work hard to get into his section: he's the best TA I've had at Yale so far.",
    "Good course, but only take it if you're a philosophy major and it's required. Or if you're absolutely crazy about Plato and Aristotle, I suppose."
