    "This class is designed as the first of two prerequisites\/introductions into the English major. Honestly, reading reviews of the class online during shopping period scared me, so I was sufficiently frightened and was pleasantly surprised that I still was motivated to do my Spenser reading in the dead of February (it's how I know I made the right choice of major... at least I think). If old white dead poets\/authors aren't your thing, you might not love the course. The reading can take a long time, but Professor Kastan was a fantastic professor to learn from (he always made us feel smart and as if we had a grasp on the material we were reading), and the discussions were almost always interesting to engage in and be a part of. You will learn just as much listening to others as you do speaking in the class, which is always amazing.",
    "English 125 has some interesting subject material, but the class itself COMPLETELY depends on the professor you have. If they're an asshole, you're stuck with a shitty English class that could potentially push you away from the major. If you have a great professor who cares about their students and shows genuine interest in student ideas and essays, you're down for a great semester. It's a tough class and everything you cover this class is in antiquated English - it's not natural to read, so be prepared to spend a lot of time reading.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, particularly to those hoping to explore poetry in a challenging way while improving their writing skills.",
    "ENGL 125 is very interesting and even if you're put off at first, give Spenser and Chauser a chance. In my opinion ENGL 125 is more cohesive that 126 and it's rewarding to trace the evolution of major themes through Chaucer and Spenser."
