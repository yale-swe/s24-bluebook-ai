    "Useful intro to CAD. Not a ton of work, and very useful material. The project at the end is very fun to work on. An excellent Mech E elective.",
    "This is a very solid course. I would definitely recommend it to anyone (MechE or not) as it takes someone through all the essential skills needed to use basic CAD and Simulation technology. I already knew Solidworks going in, but still got a lot out of the class. Moreover, it was not a very time intensive course (with the exception of the final project and a few assignments). Thus, it was the ideal ratio of work to knowledge gained. Additionally, what you learn will be practical skills that are directly applicable to work in engineering industry. Also, Professor Long was incredibly kind and willing to help, so I would definitely recommend taking a course with him.",
    "This was a very practical course, which is a rare find at Yale. I took this course credit D and definitely regretted that. As someone without CAD experience, the problem sets and final project took up a huge amount of time. But it was very rewarding to learn a new skill set.",
    "I really enjoyed this class - I thought some of the homeworks were actualy fun to complete and played with them even after I had finished the assigned portion. My main warning is that if You can't download Solidworks onto Your computer, You will have to spend a lot of time in Dunham, which meant I mainly did my homeworks in multiple hour bursts so I didn't have to leave and come back again. The TF was super helpful in explaining and helping me with the homeworks, and the grading was more than fair. This class is mainly a class on how to use Solidworks - that is what all but two of the homeworks are on and what the final project requires. There were two Matlab homework assignments, but if You're not good at coding, You get to drop one homework, so one of them can be Your one. The two midterms were on concepts like finite element analysis and how Solidworks models parts that we went over in class, and",
    "A pretty solid elective to take for the Mech Eng major."
