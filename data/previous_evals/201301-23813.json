    "EDST 190 is a must take course if you are interesting in teaching one day! You learn all about the challenges that ed reform faces in the modern US, and how different people are approaching those obstacles. Also, you get to observe in a local classroom, which really allows you to develop reflective practice and see teaching in action. The workload is not that bad at all (~75 pages a week), and the articles\/books are incredibly interesting. I would absolutely recommend this seminar!",
    "Great class! Not just for potential teachers--this is a must take class for anyone interested in education. Professor Carroll is fantastic, take this course with her if you can.",
    "Yes if you like thinking about questions like, \"What would the best education system look like\" or if you want to be a teacher\/superintendent\/etc and want to learn more education or if you just want to meet people who like thinking about education.",
    "This is a course every student at Yale should try to take before graduation. The topic is current and will definitely change your perspective on your own education and the education system in general. Professor Carroll is the best and the observation component is a great opportunity that one rarely receives as an undergraduate. It was a wonderful experience and I just hope I can find other seminars similar to this one in the future.",
    "TAKE IT! This class is a great introduction to the field of education studies and current debates in the education world. Lizzy is a great teacher, and she is very flexible in allowing you to investigate the topics that interest you. The best part of the class is the observation and reflection component.",
    "If you get into the class and are interested in Education or simply want to get informed about it, take the course! You will not regret it. Prof. Carroll is very informed and understanding. Great discussions with smart students.",
    "A really interesting look at the education system in America.",
    "This was a wonderful class with a great selection of readings and assignments. Class discussion flowed smoothly (with few annoying rebuttals) and it was interesting to see how different a person's opinions in education can vary. But please only take it if you truly care about education! It was so disheartening to see students snoozing away during class (I see you, YCC prez).",
    "this is a survey class that will inevitably change depending on who is teaching it. take it to access the experience of the teacher (and classmates) if you are already interested in education and want an access point into the world of policy, pedagogy, etc. do not take it to learn about education at large. There are better ways to learn about the area of education that your interested in. Read a book. Actually, what you'll read in the course packet will bring you less coherence than a book if you want to know the state of education in the country. what you won't get from a book is personal contacts and conversation",
    "This is a comprehensive overview of education from legal, philosophical, and pedagogical perspectives. There's an observation component in a school in New Haven. You're encouraged to discuss your own educational experience as well.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It wasn't a ton of work and provided a perspective on education that I hadn't really seen before.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. This is a class that will give an overview of the many issues and debates surrounding the American education system. You will never learn the full range of opinions on a single topic because the issues are very broad, but you will have a good foundation and be able to understand some more of the complications surrounding issues in education. The research paper will give you the opportunity to look much more deeply at a topic of your choice.",
    "Yes, incredible thought provoking experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Education Studies 190 especially with Lizzy. The course is basically a survey class -- each week covers a major area or issue in the current public education system in the United States, i. e. test-based accountability or teachers' unions. The heart of the course is the mandatory weekly observation in New Haven public schools, for which you can receive a free half credit (and why not?). I formed a close bond with the teacher and students in the 3rd grade classroom I visited every week and I am signed on to continue working with that school for the next 2 years as a result of the connection. The observation also provides common ground for discussion between students and allows New Haven to be an example we can really discuss and understand for many of the issues that we talk about. It's the one class I've had at Yale where students open up about their educational, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds and how those have affected them -- I know what kind of school every student in theclass attended which is something we really don't think about enough. I learned a huge amount about the Yale community and its educational diversity in addition to the subject matter. Furthermore, Lizzy Carroll is wonderful, kind, and an immediate mentor for everyone in the class - I hope she will be back and that the Education Studies program will flourish. Take it!"
