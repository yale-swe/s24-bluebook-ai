    "If you did 154, you know what 155 is. Quizes are a bit harder, but Shen laoshi is great and generous with the reading. She's great!",

    "good course to take after CHNS 151-",
    "Not a lot of work but can get a little dry at times",
    "Initially I thought of Chinese 155 as just a great way to keep up my former levels of Chinese, but I ended up learning so much more than I thought I would! I also have heard from students in the literature classes that I was considering that Chinese 155 is much more effective at teaching vocabulary or helping with grammar, which seems to be true. I definitely learned a lot of grammar!"
