    "Wonderful seminar. Will make you long for Paris. Covers all of the basics, links them together well, and at the proper times goes into some very interesting, detailed depth. It is a pleasure to hear Madame Girard's French. Old school in the best way. All in French, however. Essays not short and in French as well. I found that to be ultimately very rewarding, but do not go into the course expecting to speak any English. You do not necessarily have to do all of the readings, since there are only essays, but you will probably find yourself wishing you had.",
    "This class is a very good language credit for native French speakers or students with a good level of French. You have 2 short papers (6-7 pages), 1 final paper (10 pages) and one 15-min presentation to do for the whole semester. No final exams! You learn A LOT about the main artists in 19th-Century Paris. I highly recommend this class for the student who are proficient in French. The class is conducted in French and all the homework, readings and assignments are done in French. Most of the readings are short, but some can be pretty long. But never longer than a 250-page novel. Plus, the teacher assumes you read the stuff and you don't have quizzes.",
    "If you are looking for an upper-level French seminar to practice your speaking, this is not the class to take. It was essentially a lecture, but with ten students sitting around a Harkness table. Professor Girard is very kind and clearly extremely knowledgable, but class was not engaging at all, since there was no discussion whatsoever, and the \"lectures\" were not very well-structured or organized from class to class. We had a lot of reading assigned, but the nature of the class made it so that it wasn't even really necessary to do it, since we were never held accountable. This means that very few students were actually invested in the class. We also had a few papers, including a longer final essay. If you are looking to practice your speaking, this is not the class to take.",
    "It's an overview of the artistic world of Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. You cover both artists and writers who defined the period as well as the relationship between art, society and politics. I would definitely recommend taking this course!!",
    "A great approach to the intellectual and artistic Parisian life from 1780 to 1914."
