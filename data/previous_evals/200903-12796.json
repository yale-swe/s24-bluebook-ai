    "Only take this class if you are positive you have enough time on your schedule to handle the daily workload. I would also recommend not taking this class first semester of your freshman year, because you just don't know what the workload for any class is like, and you definitely not ready to handle this one. Wait a year, it won't kill you. Other then that, if you work hard, it's a great system that will definitely MAKE you learn French. You'll be surprised at the end of the semester by how much you can say.",
    "Don't take this class if you are not willing to commit at least one and a half hours every day to it. Seriously. If you get behind early on, you are doomed.",
    "Yes, there are weekly tests, so one bad test doesn't affect your grade. The class is fun, but the vocabulary we learn is a bit random. I wish there were more useful phrases, words, and statements we could learn.",
    "It's a good intro language course. Compared to other language programs, I've gleaned that intro French is more difficult than others. It's a fun language and the program is effective. I would certainly recommend it to another student, as long as he is interested in the French language.",
    "I would say this:If you really want to learn French, take this course. It is difficult, and will give you a solid hour or so of homework a night, as well as weekly tests. This is what it takes to learn the language efficiently. If you are seeking solely to fulfill the foreign language requirement, do not take this course.",
    "I recommend this course--it is an intense way to cover a lot of ground in French in a short amount of time.",
    "Learning a new exciting language and actually getting to speak it, not just write it. i would fully recommend this course to anyone else.",
    "Introductory French is a fast-paced, valuable, and challenging course that begins with the basics of the French language and moves through all the basics of speaking, listening, reading, and writing French. Each week there are four seminars and one lecture, either one or two lessons from a program called French In Action, and a test every monday night.I would absolutely recommend French 110 to another student because it is the perfect course for anyone looking to learn a practical, interesting language and culture.",
    "Basic intro language course, not too hard other that the weekly oral tests.",
    "If you want to learn French basics at a comfortable pace and with a fun curriculum, then this is the class. You learn a lot but don't kill yourself in the process, unlike some other intro languages classes."
