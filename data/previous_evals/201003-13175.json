   "comments": [
    "There are few reasons to get up for a 9 am class. Literature with Jane Levin is one of them. If you are in Jane Levin's section, don't think about switching out. If you're not, try to switch in. You'll be rewarded with a highly engaging seminar led by a superb professor who knows every one of the texts on the syllabus in intricate detail.",
    "The fall literature component is quite excellent, especially Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and Dante. Lots of pages in very little time, but absolutely absolutely worth it. Levin is a very smart and very sweet section leader, with real insight and a very helpful teaching style. Class discussions are often somewhat directionless, and she will seldom take the reins, so it helps a lot to have a good section. She is one of the most interdisciplinary DS teachers, so if you like that, this is definitely a section to seek out.",
    "Do not do Directed studies at all if you aren't naturally wired for the Humanities and really love it. Its just too much reading and too intense to be worth it for anyone else. (I am unfortunately in the \"anyone else\" category\")",
    "I read barely any of the assigned reading, and I really enjoyed the class. If you're worried you don't have time to read the reading for DS, do it anyway. You'll get so much out of the small classes with the awesome professors. Jane Levin is an awesome teacher. At the beginning of the semester, everyone will scramble to get in her section, but to be honest, she's not THAT much more awesome than the other teachers. The dinner at hte president's house was super awesome, though. I'd recommend DS and Prof Levin.",
    "I would recommend DS in general. Lit happens to be my least favorite of the three DS classes, but that's only a matter of personal interest. The class is a must for prospective English majors and anybody who wishes to acquaint themselves with history's greatest literary minds. Levin is a fantastic teacher. Not only is she highly intelligent and insightful, she also is probably one of the kindest people you will ever meet.",
    "Yes, definitely take DS if you get into this section! DS is awesome, and Prof. Levin's section especially.",
    "The literature component of Directed Studies is an excellent course, and Jane Levin is an excellent instructor.As for DS, it is important to realize the point: not to understand any given work as thoroughly as possible, but to get a bird's-eye view of Western thought.As for Professor Levin: She is always willing to meet with students, at any stage of the essay-writing process, and gets excited when she sees a student making connections between the different branches of DS. Her feedback on assignments is phenomenal. You may find yourself wishing she would do a bit more to direct the discussion in section, but she is a very good mentor and a lovely person.",
    "If you want an overview of important literature, take this class.",
    "A good class if you really like talking about literature and writing literary analyses, but if you are not excited by those things, you really notice the workload and it's hard to get through it.",
    "Directed Studies is an intensely rewarding class for anyone who loves reading, analysis, and nuance. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "At first, I found the material challenging and had trouble taking personal joy in the books we read. I knew these books important because other people told me so, but I waited for the personal connection that ties me to another world and another time--a character or idea that gets caught, unshakeable, in my mind. My classmates helped me find this. They waxed poetic about the merits of Odysseus and Aeneus, and soon I began to see them not as cardboard cutouts from a foregone era but as real men faced with heart-wrenching choices. I began to feel. The high language and unfamiliar settings became not detriments but glimpses into another time, layers of mystery that prolonged the hunt for meaning and, consequently, heightened the thrill of its discovery. I would recommend DS not for the books because, let's face it, we barely scratch their surface. No matter what we tell ourselves, as college freshman, we can only understand so much. I'd recommend DS for its community of thinkers, friends who challenge you to ask the question \"why?\"--a question I don't always ask enough.",
    "ds is definitely a great program, the syllabus is well designed and lectures are fantastic, plus all the professors are so knowledgeable - with that said, you have to know what you're getting into. just...be prepared. it's easier for some than it is for others. levin is the sweetest professor you could possibly have, she is just so nurturing without being excessively so. definitely try and get into her class if you can.",
    "This was a challenging launch into classical literature. If you like to read, this is a great class. If you don't like to read, this might not be a great class. I would recommend it either way, I guess, because even if you don't like to read it's important to have read certain books. This class takes you through the big leagues.",
    "A lot of reading. I would recommend Levin to anyone taking DS.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, especially if you have never read most of the books on the curriculum, because they all give you a lot of insight into literature. I have become a better reader and writer. Most of all I am learning to think in a much more sophisticated and often complex way.",
    "I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants a solid foundation in the Western Canon. I know people who feel like they learned nothing this semester. On the other hand, I know I learned a lot. There's a certain satisfaction to finally being able to understand references without having to check the footnotes or ask someone.",
    "I recommend this drive-by view of foundational Western literature to literally every college student. The works we covered are essential for understanding the framework and heritage of Western thought, both in the past and present."
