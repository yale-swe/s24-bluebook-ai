    "This is a great and broad course on Health Policy, especially useful to people with no prior policy experience. Mark Schlesinger is an excellent teacher, very friendly, funny and clearly very knowledgeable of the issues discussed. I thoroughly enjoyed the group projects, especially the pre-assigned membership, which brought me together with great people who became my friends. Discussing policy issues with them was very informative and helpful for me, to understand complex policy issues discussed in class. The case study and cartoon awards ceremony were also very enjoyable. I learned a lot from this class and I enjoyed being in it.",
    "Wonderful class",
    "Excellent discussion and topics.",
    "very comprehensive...so much information that I wish there were discussion sections like epi or biostats. there's no way I can synthesize everything mark throws my way.",
    "The course was not what I expected and I was slightly disappointed. If this is one of the required courses for health policy, it should be understood that some people have never taken a policy course before. Rather than helping those students, the course jumps over and leaves behind those who are truly trying to understand what's going on and caters to those who have already had policy courses before.",
    "This course was a really great course. The weakly readings were manageable. The lectures were engaging.The only weakness or limitation was the group projects. I found the projects to be challenging. It was difficult merging several ideas and opinions into a cohesive and uniform paper. It felt at times that there was not equal participation.",
    "Course is fine the way it is",
    "Maybe useful? Frankly speaking, I was lost in many classes of the course. Very conceptual and theoretical.",
    "if more material provided, it will be much better",
    "I do not like the lecture style of the course- because of the nature of the course rather than asking students questions that they answer with opinions, I think it would be better to have a discussion\/seminar based course. I think it is overall too theoretical.",
    "Great course, learned so much about complex material in a very short amount of time.",
    "It's a good beginning for health policy.",
    "A lot of things come to mind:PROs-------- Group projects are interesting and fun to meet other students.- Mark is clearly a very nice guy and very friendly to students.CONSs--------- When you assign this much reading, the truth is it becomes overwhelming and no one does it. NO ONE. It's too much, we're not tested over it until the Final and there is absolutely zero incentive to spend our entire week doing this reading.- The course is WAYYYY to academic: it does NOT explain the basic concepts of Medcaid\/Medicare, it does NOT analyze the trade-offs between patient autonomy and paternalism, it does NOT logically investigate arguments from liberals and conservatives about what is most important in health care reform. Instead, it is academic to the point of non-practical. The readings, the lectures, the topics, are all pompous BS that do not have concrete foundations in anything. One of Mark's memes is \"there are no right answers in policy.\" THIS IS NOT TRUE: There are many many arguments across a broad spectrums of answers, but there are right answers. Students should be responsible for understanding a libertarian's arguments regarding health care versus a progressive. This is not well taught and is onlyaddressed peripherally. Instead of \"re-addressing the new market paradigm,\" analyze health from a market perspective, discuss health economics, and use some slides or bullet points that address information asymmetry, high costs, technical expertise. Don't make the really ambiguous and messy flow charts.- It is ridiculous to get a 17-page assignment: where the actual assignment description itself is 17 pages. Especially when the assignment is so ambiguous. Extremely extremely frustrating. Also, the \"broadening the scope of health policy\" is such a ridiculous question to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of all we have learned related to Health Policy. Talk about fee-for-service for capitation, quality measure, politics of accomodation, HMOs role in health care delivery, or proposed solutions to the current health system. These ambiguous academic topics are not providing me any additional knowledge or skill sets, making the course a waste of my time and Mark's time.- Betsy taught an undergraduate health policy course that, in comparison (according to review), is orders of magnitude more practical, interesting, and helpful.",
    "This course was an excellent overview of a number of issues. As is inevitable with most survey courses, the different topics occasionally got confused, and it was difficult to understand how the different parts of the course fit together. Sometimes Professor Schlesinger tried to conduct the course a bit too much like a seminar, which made it hard to understand what his point was.",
    "I only with there was a better way to incorporate the developing world into the course other than just the developing world readings.",
    "The class was difficult because had no previous health policy knowledge. At the end, I felt I learned only a bit of the complicated health systems policy.",
    "It's a really great course. It's hard for non-health policy students, but it is extremely discussion oriented, interactive, and reading based. You learn A LOT in a very short period of time, and really attempt to create policy and do real life hand-on work. It's difficult, but you really get what you give. It's frustrating because there seems to be no repercussions for people who literally do nothing the entire course, but I guess that's to be expected with group projects in real life as well.What's really frustrating and could be improved is the many hours the course takes up. The in-class 3 hours is fair, and the readings and group projects are fair, but the extra hour to two a week of additional class just isn't fair. And not everyone can make it, so that's not very fair either. Maybe the class should be 2 hours twice a week, and the last 30 minutes should be led by the TA discussing basic health care systems and paper-related business. Maybe it would be 2 hours Tuesday and an hour and a half Thursday? Or visa-versa?",
    "This is quite possibly the worst class I've taken during my five years at Yale (four undergrad years, one MPH year). This class failed to teach me anything about health policy or health systems. Yes, we discussed the various tensions that exist in the world of healthcare, but we learned nothing about actual policy or systems! The projects were completely unrealistic in their scope and depth. Any paper prompt that is *as long* as the assignment itself is completely inappropriate. There were way too many guidelines and the expectations were unrealistically high. Not to mention the fact that we were asked to propose policies to change healthcare delivery systems **when we hadn't learned anything about policymaking or delivery systems!** I cannot believe that a class with such impractical content and terrible teaching still exists at a university like Yale. Not to mention that it's a required core class. I'm resentful that I spent so much of this past semester on this course. It is because of this class that I refuse to give YSPH positive reviews to prospective students (and quite a handful of undergrads have asked my opinion). I strongly urge you to either completely revamp the lecturing style and greatly simplify the group projects or eliminate this class altogether. It's especially a shame because I could have fallen in love with health policy, but this class has permanently put a bad taste in my mouth.",
    "more structure and intro\/overview needed before being able to think critically",
    "The course was interesting and had a lot of great readings, but I don't think it necessarily fits as being an introduction to health policy. I didn't even know the basics of how health policy is made in the US but instead of learning that first, it was more of an analysis of abstract policy ideas that didn't really fit what I was expecting. I think maybe if it fell in the spring semester it may have been a little better.",
    "Very interesting class for those interested in Policy. It was solely focused on American health system. It would be great if there was a similar class for global health systems.",
    "Great course. Good material. Good approach to teaching it.",
    "A good introduction to health policy. The readings were extremely well chosen, providing different viewpoints on the core topic for each class. It was good to have options between readings too. The group assessments were very challenging and very time consuming, but I did enjoy the opportunity for cross-fertilisation between students and the demands of having to assimilate a large volume of material in a short space of time and come up with reasoned recommendations for real-world problems. I thought the group assessment scenarios were very well chosen.The modular organisation of the course made a lot of sense by the end of the semester, and I can see the modules living with me as future tools for organising complex health policy analysis.I felt that policy institutions were a little neglected at the expense of policy theory, but that may be a topic for another course at another time.",
    "Strength: Lecture was always interesting and engaging. This was a different way of learning, with deep discussion and questioning as the primary focus.Weakness: Could have used some forwarning about how time consuming the group projects would be.",
    "This class provides an overview of Health Policy. I found the literature dated with the exception of the final which was current, however the supporting articles for the final were older. I felt very limited in being able to respond to the group projects and final because we had to use the articles provided. I felt it offered a narrow scope. I would have much rather have been able to research articles to support my critiques. Also, the course focused primarily on phycisians and health policy. There are many other stakeholders and health care providers in the health policy arena that's input and roles are invaluable, ie: nurses, phycisian's assistance, APRN's, etc..",
    "While the professor is obviously very seasoned and knowledgeable, I think the course needs to be redesigned to account for the dynamic nature of today's healthcare environment.",
    "Readings are interesting, classes are somewhat helpful, but there seems to be a lack of structure in the course which other course offer, such as powerpoints or important notes from the intructors.",
    "This is an excellent class. I knew very very little entering the class, and now I feel well-informed of, and facile with some important language and themes of health policy.",
    "I would say that the major strength of this course is that the work involved is structured to be representative of real circumstances as much as possible. The assignments introduced us to the challenges we would be facing in the professional environment. However, I did not feel that the class, in general, provided enough concrete information on the current structure of the health care system.",
    "US based course. Lot of readings that never was discussed in class.",
    "Strong class to get students thinking about health policy and economics. Really enjoyed the policy related comics. The group papers were difficult and tons of work but were great learning opportunities. Having no definitive policy answers to the current health problems is frustrating but it is also very applicable to the real world",
    "it is not very suitable for students who just entered healthcare area, especially international student. it is less structured and too spontaneous.",
    "The class was very interesting, however the fact that this was supposed to be an introductory health policy class, the class was not structured well. For students in other concentrations other than policy, there was no foundation for what we learned in the class. Furthermore, the instructions for the final were extremely vague. Instead of the assignment being challenging, it was just plain confusing. If I had more direction I feel like I would have gotten more out of the final.",
    "I found the course and lecture style very difficult to follow. I felt that it was difficult to link the weekly reading with each lecture, and I felt that the lectures were more of a conversation and less instruction.",
    "The class did provide the basis of a framework that can be utilized to analyze policy - however, the course could have been richer had we spent more time exploring how this framework works in countries other than those with developed market oriented systems. I think the class can benefit more from studying policy in health systems that are not market-oriented (systems which are centrally managed by the State etc.) Even though comparisons were made in class, there wasnt enough exploration of how policy is formulated in such systems.The course does create the expectation that it will also explore policy in the Developing world - especially if one looks at the syllabus. However, as the course progresses, one realizes that the topics covered, class discussions and assessments are dominated by US policy issues, and a handful Western European countries (even these are barely explored). While I see no problem in making the class a US policy class, I think that students should not be led to expect any more than that.",
    "strengths: interesting content, Mark is an engaging lecturerweaknesses: although it is noted to be an atypical policy course, it was sometimes difficult to follow. unclear what the main thesis of each lecture was."

I didn't realize that Mark was the author that I had referenced until the first day of class. It was a privilege to be one of his students.Mark's strengths would be his lectures and feedback. The comments on the group projects were extremely helpful. He really pushes and challenges everyone to be very critical and analytical.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He is very comfortable and natural when teaching this course, even in to a large group in an unnecessarily large room",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He is an incredible professor. He is engaging to listen to - his lectures flow well, he encourages participation, and he is very approachable.He also gives incredibly detailed feedback on assignments which is really nice to see. You can tell he cares about the course and his students which makes you want to work harder.",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I like Mark. He is a very nice man and is obviously extremely intelligent. He is friendly to students and clearly very passionate about teaching. That being said, lectures were not helpful and were sometimes painful. Lectures were not clearly structured, did not go over concrete concepts, and were just intellectual discussions of academic topics that didn't leave me knowing more about health policy domestically or abroad.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I thought Professor Schlesinger was an excellent lecturer. My only concern was that sometimes he rushed out of class before anyone could approach him with questions or concerns. If he were a bit more available, that would be wonderful. I also thought his grading standards were very harsh. I understand having high expectations, but he took it a little far.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is great. Absolutely the right person to be teaching this policy class. Brings up all the right issues, makes interesting points and knows his material like the back of his hand. Very loose atmosphere in class.",

He is the only professor who can go for hours without powerpoints or taking notes. He is really the best professor I have had this semester, and one of the best semesters I have ever had at a university. Not only does he have experience and publications, but he pushes for his students to call him Mark, and is available to talk to outside of class, a rare and appreciated personality trait.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Awesome",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is quite possibly the worst lecturer I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. Though I have a couple suggestions that would mitigate the awfulness of his lectures, I'm not sure that that they would make his classes that much more palatable. 1. Use more visual aids! The outlines that he write on the board barely serve to anchor the conversations because they are so obtuse. Visual learners like myself really struggle with an hour and a half of stream-of-consciousness lecture. Taking notes on a computer while attempting to jot notes on a handout is incredibly clumsy. Please just make a freaking powerpoint. Put your graphs on it, and add some headers to anchor the conversation. 2. Speaking of conversation, \"learning from my peers\" is an exercise in masochism. The same two people talk every single class. This is not a \"discussion.\" This is not the \"Socratic method.\" This is just two know-it-alls talking to Mark while everyone else bangs their heads against the wall. Please keep \"conversation\" and \"participation\" to a minimum! If you want to teach a seminar, cap the class at 15 people and let people actually talk, for pete's sake. Otherwise, take two comments, and move on! 3. Your feedback on papers is useless. Your grading scheme is so obscure. Your comments may be thorough, but it doesn't matter if we get the feedback six weeks after turning in the assignment. I'd rather get a quarter of the feedback so long as you get it to us quickly. Otherwise there's too much of a lag, and no one reads the feedback.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark has impressive knowledge and experience in health policy and it was great to learn from him and read articles that he wrote and recommendeds. His teaching style was a little too abstract for me in terms of how I prefer to learn, especially because I had no background in health policy. The group projects were also difficult for this reason. I think if Mark did more review of the paradigms and main themes of the course throughout the semester, there would have been a bit more cohesiveness that I would have appreciated. He did spend a lot of time grading the group projects and providingadequate feedback.",

All you will do is have abstract \"conversations\" (i.e., one know-it-all answers Mark's questions every single lecture) about the various tensions associated with healthcare in general. Then you will have to write incredibly long and unnecessarily complicated papers on how policies should be restructured. This is very difficult to do, given that we learn nothing about either policymaking or healthcare delivery systems.",
    "This is a great course if you are an abstract thinker and have had background in the policy system. If not, I would take the other health policy option to fulfill the core requirement.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student interested in Policy.",
    "Really great intro to health policy questions. I think all students, regardless of concentration, should take this course.",
    "This is a don't-miss course for anyone who wants a future in policy work. It defines a policy landscape you will use to navigate policy problems. Try not to get to worked up about the group assessments, they are an exceptional opportunity to work with other students.",
    "An in depth look at health policy, focusing on comparing and contrasting what works and what doesn't work in various settings.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Help you understand more about the US healthcare system",
    "Wonderful class. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "This course was an introduction to the thinking involved in policy analysis and construction. I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in becoming involved in policy.",
    "Course as it is of little use for foreign students. Only focus on the US and the group projects should have included options of a more general character. Nice professeor, but too much time spendt on asking students and trying to have dialogue.",
    "This is a wide ranging introductory course in health policy. Be prepared fora lot of work for the group papers. However, it is well worth it for the learning incurred.",
    "I will not recommend to others.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a student who does not have a solid background in health policy or is not in the health policy concentration. I think is a shame because all students from all concentrations should get a rounded public health education. Thus I feel like I am lacking general education about health policy after taking this class.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who wants to understand the theoretical and analytical framework of US health policy only.",
    "would recommend depending on the type of student it is"
