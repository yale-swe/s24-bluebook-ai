    "I learned that majoring in economics is fruitful. I learned that I need to study 3x as many hours as I am in class",
    "I developed a solid understanding of microeconomics, including supply and demand, price elasticity, different market structures, how prices are set, how firms interact with one another, and how the factor and product markets interact.",
    "I was challenged to think about problems in a specific economic way.",
    "I developed my skills in understanding economic principles and foundations. The extra math help in the class is great even though it involves having an extra class on Fridays.",
    "I know a lot more about economics now, and my ability to think about economics was definitely improved.",
    "Knowledge about basic microeconomics, including the math skills required to solve questions related to basic micro.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics.",
    "I learnt a lot about basic microeconomics.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics and got to put some of my rusty math skills to use."

   "comments": [
    "Tolga is very helpful and encouraging, and he makes it easy to succeed. However, sometimes you feel like you aren't learning, rather just getting answers at office hours to get your points and learning formulas to regurgitate information.",
    "I enjoyed the small, personal aspect of the seminar and the accessibility of the professor.",
    "I wish that the lectures could have gone a little slower with more concrete examples of the problems we were learning. Tolga is great but sometimes when you're asking a question and don't understand the way something was explained he will just explain it the same way instead of a new way.",
    "The course is absolutely phenomenal for anyone who wants to learn Microeconomics but has not taken any advanced Math classes in high school. I cannot find any weaknesses.",
    "The course is well taught but differs from the textbook we use, particularly towards the end of the course. Switching textbooks or stating this more clearly might help the course as a whole.",
    "I think this course could be improved with more focus on the math based part of the class.",
    "I think that towards the end of year, the class seemed to fly by and I found that I did not have enough time to process the information I was receiving. However, I still looked forward to going to class because Tolga kept the material interesting and he provided us with a lot of outside resources to help with our learning.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is a seminar and the instructor can more thoroughly explain the material and offer several examples to solidify concepts. I think it could be improved by devoting the additional section mostly to solving mathematical examples, as we were originally told, so that it is easier to understand the material."

    "I would because it is a prerequisite for lots of classes and it is manageable but helpful",

    "Yes, its an interesting and challenging course",
    "Take heed. You won't study throughout the semester. You'll cram before the midterm and final. Prepare to cram. Know how to cram. You'll make it fine.",
    "Yes. microeconomic skills were valuable and the course is taught at a pace and in a style suitable for students.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Tolga is an amazing and caring professor who is always willing to explain things over and over until the students finally get it.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "I would, I think this is a great intro class because you receive as much assistance as you need. It is also much better than a lecture as it forces you to always be focused and attentive."
