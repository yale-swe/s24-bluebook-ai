    "A lecture in seminar form. Take the class only if you're willing to sit through seminars in which you might only get one or two comments in. The readings are interesting and Winter is a genius on the subject of WWI, but I'm sure there are other classes on the subject out there that would be more interesting to sit through. If you're already interested in WWI and military history, it won't turn you off the subject, but it might make you aware of how history should and should not be taught in seminar form.",
    "HIST 234J is a miserable experience. I would not recommend it unless you want to dread a class all week long. Take literally any other WWI class at Yale. This course was a lecture in a seminar room. Students were expected to accept that everything Jay Winter said was absolutely right and not to question it. Winter didn't learn our names (there were 12 of us) until the end of October\/early November. There was absolutely no variation in seminars week to week or homework week to week, so the class was boring very fast.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I came into it expecting it to be as good as Professor Winter's lecture. It is not. In fact, it is so badly done that it has actually made me reconsider my major. The professor clearly didn't care about us, and the actual seminar meetings were more him giving us grammatical critiques than they were actual discussions. He assigned 16-page reading responses a week before they were due without any warning beforehand, and he moved the class to different times and days as he saw fit depending on his own schedule. Avoid this class AT. ALL. COSTS. You WILL regret taking it, no matter how much you may think otherwise. Taking this course was my biggest mistake at Yale so far.",
    "I would highly recommend that any student looking for a good history seminar look elsewhere.",
    "There are a million better seminars.",
    "Yes, if lucky enough to be given the opportunity to take this seminar, take it. Winter is an expert and it was incredible to learn from him.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is fascinating, and Professor Winter is a great teacher. One thing to note is that it's not really discussion based. Often, Professor Winter will use that week's reading response to begin the discussion and then lecture\/talk to us for the rest of class (always referring to the reading response). It isn't that much work for a seminar, however. You write one reading response (8 pages single spaced) about a certain week's readings and a final paper (25 pages double spaced). Professor Winter is incredibly knowledgeable about WWI, so it's worth it just to hear his thoughts about the material.",
    "It's a privilege to take a seminar with Jay Winter. You should take it if you get the chance. However, you will definitely be at a disadvantage if you have not taken his Total War lecture. A lot of students already had and were at a noticeable advantage when it came to the material."
