    "Take it, but only if you really adore poetry. If you don't, you will be wasting your time. But if you are a poetry fan, Harold Bloom's seminars are a Yale experience you will never forget. Prof. Bloom loves poetry more than anyone you will ever encounter and offers very interesting insights. Still, he is always open to differing viewpoints and is very available when you are writing your final paper (the only assignment in the class, which is somewhat nerve-wracking).",
    "Everyone should take Bloom at least once.",
    "This is one of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale so far. Professor Bloom's insights into the all the poems you read, heavily supplemented with random bits of historical background, etymology, philosophy, and often wonderfully hilarious personal anecdotes, make for a thrilling experience. Occasionally, there are so many tangents that you do not end up doing justice to the poems, but the tangents themselves are so good, that it's worth it.He assigns a large number of poems for each lecture, but you really only get to talk about one or two of them, and one can come in not having read them and just listen to him talk about them. The real work comes at the end, because your grade is entirely dependent on one 25-page paper, which you are absolutely free to write however you want about whatever you want, which can be disconcerting.However, if you are expecting this to be a true seminar, you will be disappointed. This is essentially a small lecture with occasional participation. You are encouraged to break into the discussion whenever you like, but after he's decided whether he agrees or not with what your saying, he will quickly respond and go back to lecturing, sometimes cutting you off in mid-sentence after having decided whether he likes what you're saying or not. Don't let that put you off: come to listen.",
    "Yes, for any lover of poetry, this is the right course because it surveys many of the important poets.",
    "It's not really a class, but it is an experience. Don't take it expecting to understand the poems at the end, but take it if you want to have a chance to think about them in a very \"Yale\" setting.",
    "it is a seminar, but for all intents and purposes it is a lecture. readings are fantastic and prof bloom is incredibly smart, but also incredibly tiresome and just an unpleasant person to be around. it is worth it if you can stand to be around the man for two hours a week, but that is asking a lot.",
    "I think this class is for the type of person who likes Harold Bloom, and that may seem self-evident, but it is important to say. Bloom is a very opinionated type of professor. He is a real legend who is clearly one of the smartest critics and teachers in the world in terms of poetry and literature. But he is distinctive, and what he says matters most in the classroom. That said, he has an insight into the poets studied and there works that is truly incomparable. My advice? Shop the class, see if you like the way Bloom teaches, and decide from there.",
    "I would strongly recommend HUMS 235. It was probably my favorite course this semester. It caused me to look at literature, especially poetry, differently.",
    "Not for the faint of heart, but an absolutely unbelievable experience. Intimidating because it's filled with grad students, and often frustrating for a) lack of a syllabus and b) no way of gauging your performance in class (since the entire grade is based on one long paper handed in at the end of the semester)."
