   "comments": [
    "By all means take this course if you can get into it. I was astonished that only eight people showed up, but that may be because the first meeting was well into shopping period. The readings are fascinating. Professor Trivellato is a great teacher, and the papers were fun to write.",
    "I certainly would recommend this class for those who want to understand history from several perspectives. In doing so, i believe that the student can develop an intuition for developing their own view on the past. Professor Trivellato is so helpful in nurturing analytical thoughts of her students.",
    "A great course! Professor Trivellato is insightful and dynamic in her discussions. There are only 2 papers for the course, which is a plus, however they're involved in a very satisfying way. Take it!",
    "If you want to visit Venice, take the course first. If you're interested in Venice, take the course. If you're interested in the Mediterranean, take the course. If you're interested in any of the words in the course description, you should probably take the course."
