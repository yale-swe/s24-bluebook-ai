    "I developed many insights into Spanish\/Hispanic culture from the various presentations, debates, and lecturas that we discussed in class. I feel like my grammar definitely improved.",
    "Excellent advanced grammar skills, moderate speaking and listening skills, and good reading comprehension skills.",
    "I approached fluency in Spanish through the course. My grammar and speaking skills improved tremendously.",
    "How to read a variety of texts as well as learn lots of grammar styles.",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish grammar rules and also improved upon my speaking skills. I also improved my reading comprehension skills with all of the short stories and the novel that we read at the end of class.",
    "I increased my gramatical and speaking skills in the Spanish language.",
    "Higher level of Spanish speaking, writing, and listening skills",
    "I gained a bit more understanding into archaic Spanish grammar. I developed a hatred for pointless, repetitive vocab worksheets. I was further discouraged to want to learn this language by the professor's constant curtness and negativity when students were still attempting to understand a concept.",
    "I definitely improved my reading, writing, and listening skills in Spanish. I also learned many more verb tenses than I knew before taking this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the presentations and the debate - great opportunity for participation points and enjoyable to prepare.",
    "This course does an excellent job integrating grammar and culture\/literature into one course, however, we could use much more casual conversation practice to improve fluency.",
    "Strengths: Teaches the grammar very well Weaknesses: we didnt get to talk in spanish other than activities we had done for homework",
    "I liked the readings that we did, I enjoyed the daily homework, and definitely thought that the grammar rules were drilled into me by the end. However, I wish we worked on listening comprehension more because I still can't understand Spanish radio or music very well.",
    "I really did not enjoy this class, it was very dull and teaching was negative.",
    "Strength: Small class, good classroom discussion, interesting stories Weakness: Class every day",
    "You are graded on the \"stylistic\" aspects of your writing in this class, yet we are never taught ways to improve our writing. We only learn complex grammatical tense and unrelated vocab words. Learning grammar does have worth, but I (and many of the students in the class) lacked a lot of the prerequisite writing skills to comfortably incorporate these complex grammatical forms into our assessed writing and speaking.",
    "I think that the content is fine (it's a language, there's really no way of getting around teaching certain concepts), and I thought that the seminar-style setting helped me engage with the material much better. My Spanish class in high school had a traditional setup, and I didn't learn that much. I thought that the readings were a bit boring and all over the place in terms of topic, but still I liked the movie \"No\" and the short novel \"Las batallas en el desierto\".",
    "Less silly assignments with no meaning would be great."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, helped my ability to read and write in Spanish a lot.",
    "Spanish L4 is a much better course than Spanish L3, and is a great end to the language requirement. I especially appreciate the last five weeks being spent on movies and a novella.",
    "Yes, I would. If you're looking to challenge yourself and become much better at Spanish, take this course.",
    "Yes because it is great for spanish speakers to hone their skills in",
    "I would recommend this course because I think I've improved a lot overall. My speaking has gotten better, grammar has gotten better, and reading and writing has gotten better. I thought the class was very fair and also enjoyable. It was a good amount of work, but worth it in the end.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. It was definitely a lot of work which is fine, but a lot of times I felt as if the work was unproductive and grading was unfair.",
    "Yes, this is a very good spanish class: high level of interaction and small class size make it very engaging",
    "Yale forces every student, no matter what their interest, to take a language. I would not be taking this class if I was not forced to spend my thousands of dollars per credit hour on a course that teaches me less than I can learn back home in cafs and coffee shops in South Florida.",
    "This course gets you up to a proficient level of Spanish. You learn basically everything that you need to know in terms of verb tenses and moods, and you will be better off at reading and writing Spanish. I still have trouble speaking the language, and the class doesn't give you as much of an opportunity to speak Spanish as I'd like (maybe that's just because my class had 16 kids in it, I don't know). You're most likely going to take this course because you have to for your language credit, but I wouldn't really worry about the workload. It's more of a nuisance than anything stressful."
