    "This class is a fascinating look into a topic that very few seems to know or understand, yet touches on a common humanity that we all share. Workload-wise, some of the reading became overwhelming at times \u0097 as a non-English major, I had difficulties finishing a novel or more every week. I recommend it as long as you're an efficient reader\/aren't too busy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to a fellow student. This class is a great survey of adoption topics. We touched on a little bit of everything--domestic adoption, transracial adoption, transnational adoption. The readings consist of fiction novels, non-fiction memoirs, interviews, and social science academic articles. We also watched two movies. There are 3 essays over the course of the semester. There was a lot of reading, but if you are interested in adoption issues it is well worth it!",
    "Absolutely take this class! This class made me completely reevaluate how I see adoption, race, and identity. I left the class with more questions than I began it with, but in a good way. The reading can get kind of overwhelming at times (sometimes a novel each class), but it's always interesting and usually once you get in to it each assignment is a quick read. Professor Homans is also a really great professor, she has really interesting things to say on the subject and she is very approachable and helpful. If you've ever had any interest in the subject- TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "If you have any interest in adoption, or family, or good books, take it.",
    "This was a unique and well-taught class. Definitely take if you\u0092re interested at all in learning about the adoption discourse, from 19th century literature to recent debates over transracial and transnational adoption \u0096 you\u0092ll come away from the class with a completely new way of thinking about adoption. The readings are great, with a wide range of different forms and fields of study. Discussion was also great \u0096 Prof. Homans is incredibly approachable and really knows the subject well. Be warned that the workload is pretty large \u0096 there was, at times, way too much reading (often a full novel for each class session). The grade is mostly based on 3 papers though. Homans is very open to reading drafts, and also allows you to re-write papers (averaged with the grade you got the first time), so the class is still manageable.",
    "adoption narratives is a great class, and you should definitely take it if at all interested in the topic! professor homans is a lovely professor, as well as a wonderful person. i took the class on a whim and it ended up being incredibly fulfilling for me. the books on the syllabus range in terms of their literariness, but the class discussions are always fascinating. the course made me totally re-evaluate everything i ever thought about adoption. i think this class made me a better person. if you don't take this class you should absolutely look at professor homans' other courses because she is truly just so wonderful to study with!!",
    "The readings for Adoption Narratives come from a variety of genres, and most of the texts were engaging and enjoyable to read. We read several adoption memoirs, many novels (some good literature, and some not so high quality literature), scholarly articles on adoption history, opinions on transracial and transnational adoption, and several documentaries. Class discussions focused on close readings of the texts, discussions of identity formation, race, and \"kinship\", and the issues of adoption and adoption policy. Professor Homans keeps discussions going and on topic without guiding the class towards a single interpretation; Prof. Homans is eager to hear what her students think and have to say and is an excellent discussion leader, although she sometimes expects the class to come up with grand theories about the implications of a certain aspect of whatever you've read on the spot. For the most part, though, she asks questions that are interesting but not impossible to answer and help move the discussion along. She is an incredibly understanding professor and is very generous with her time in helping students brainstorm, write, and re-write papers.",
    "Adoption Narratives is a fascinating class that explored the way in which so many diverse topics coalesce in the event of an adoption. Prof Homans is a skilled and brilliant discussion leader. She is also very generous with offering advice and help.",
    "If it is a topic you are interested in, I would definitely recommend this class. You delve deeply into the issue of adoption and into the MANY other related issues as well: race, identity, self, trauma, etc. There is flexibility with the assignments and you can write your papers on whatever interests you."
