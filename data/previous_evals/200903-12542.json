    "Take this class. It's a lot of work but oh man it is the best work. Where else can mention read Tennessee Williams and \"Vampire Lesbians of Sodom\" in the same breath? Fantastic fantastic fantastic. One of my favorite Yale courses ever.He means it when he says reading intensive though. I have stacks and stacks and stacks of queer plays, most of which I've read!",
    "Take it!!! Lots of reading, lots of writing, but you will love it. Its such important stuff and Bob is just brilliant.",
    "THST 356 gives a widespread introduction to Gay and Lesbian theatrical works and criticism and allows students to explore these works in depth through discussion in class and paper writing outside of it.TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Vorlicky in amazing and the class offers an introduction to a whole body of theatrical literature which is not touched on with the frequency it deserves. While the work load is very heavy, the quality both of the plays and the class discussion makes it worth the while.",
    "this is a discussion based class where you will be asked to read at least four plays and two critical texts per class. there are also two critical essays and one research paper. i am not one to complain about workload, but this was a huge amount of work. the discussions were interesting, but we often did not get to touch on some or all of the plays, and the conversation could get bogged down in the professor's summary of a critical text. also, be forewarned, this class is really about queer theater: everything is put into that context, whether it should be or not. that said, it is intense and interesting and you will read a huge number of plays and learn a lot about queer theater in general.",
    "Sadly there is a lot of reading. 3-4 plays a week with a few criticisms on the plays themselves. However the long reading list is necessary! All of the plays are worth reading. Professor Vorlicky understood that the students were not able to get to every single reading per week, but really pushed us to get out hand on all of the text.The writing assignments are a lot of fun and you really get to know the text that he assigns for the assignments. He gives a long list of plays to write about and you have to select a two of three to write about and cross examine. It was a lot of fun!"
