   "comments": [
    "English 114 is a necessary course for all freshman to take. You learn everything you need to write a college level paper and everything can be applied to future classes.",
    "English 114 is an extremely work intensive course, but the most rewarding course I have taken all year. You write 4 papers over the course of the semester and do a lot of reading and other assignments, but I think you also really, really improve as a writer and I would recommend this to everyone.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A WRITING CREDIT!",
    "Great class. I definitely became a better writer from this class and I got to write about sports, which made it more interesting. Also, the 4 essays we wrote were all different kinds- one was an article analysis, one academic argument, one research paper, and one informal\/magazine-type essay. The variety made it more interesting.",
    "I though this class was supposed to be about sportswriting but it was about sociological issues. Still, really enjoyed the class because youre able to pick paper topics yourself.",
    "I would suggest this class to others because it was helpful for my overall writing skill.",
    "Recommend highly for all students just to improve essay and writing skills",
    "Interesting class, but more work than expected.",
    "This class focuses on societal problems that manifest themselves in sports, primarily gender issues. I highly recommend taking it; it's a ton of fun with Professor Gibbons and totally changed my perception of sports and my understanding of masculinity and femininity. If you have any interest in sports or gender issues, I highly recommend the class."
