   "comments": [
    "Very interesting",
    "good",
    "Really good and should remain a core option for SBS class.",
    "It is heavily focused on psychosocial factors but doesn't discuss much in terms of its connection to epidemiology. Most epi studies were discussed by students during their class presentations. There should be more input from the lectures on this aspect.",
    "I really liked this course and the professor's style. Maybe the requirement is a little intense.",
    "Having a sociologist's perspective on public health issues has expanded my understanding.",
    "strengths: great coverage of all topics in the field. Appropriate amount of concepts and examples. TAs and instructor are super nice and give very useful feedbackweaknesses: None. More video clips would be more helpful in explaining the concepts.",
    "Great overview of the field. No weaknesses.",
    "Taught well- instructor and TAs are very accessible. Enjoyed the content. Wished there was a bit more emphasis on application of the concept in research process\/methods, not only being aware of the issue in a social context.",
    "You can learn a lot even you don't have the related background.",
    "This is an important option to offer for the SBS requirement. Other classes focus on the what has happened and what can we predict from this, while this class focuses on the why and how of ongoing cultural topics that are particularly relevant to health, in addition to understanding the world around us.I believe that the sections need more directive or more well rounded teaching fellows to fully bring out the potential of the topics.",
    "Strengths: covers topics not covered in other foundational curriculum. Wide variety of topics covered, interesting guest lecturers.Weaknesses:1. I think the student-led discussions would have been better left for discussion sections. Greater depth\/explorations of the topics might be possible in lecture sections.2. Also, applications of topics seemed limited. For example, how is \"x\" topic used in various types of epidemiological studies? For those of us non-SBS students it may be informative to take discussions into the applied world."

    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Compassionate, smart.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0The instructor was passionate about the course, but the lectures would be more beneficial if they are better structures in terms of contents and pace.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Julia is a very easy-going and nice professor. She is very good at creating a discussion in the classroom. In general, I really like her.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Dr. Rozanova is knowledgeable and was able to engage students by using a variety of audio visuals and personal experiences.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Very nice. Clear about the materials and very good at getting back to my questions.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Absolutely knowledgeable about the field. Sweet and caring, and encouraged discussion during lecture, which was a plus.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Amazing- made the course material very much comprehensible easily and class atmosphere was created to be light to allow discussions about tough topics in a very positive way. Teaching style is great as well as the various types of group projects, discussions designed around delivering the material.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Julia was fantastic. I had scheduling conflicts this semester and she worked with me to accommodate my conflicts. I'm so appreciative of this!!",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Really great professor, full of passion. Like her so much.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Dr. Rosanova is very articulate in a number of ways. She is articulate in the theory of her field, as well as articulate in mirroring back the students' comments and experiences. Her word choice is really exquisite as far as relaying what exactly is important about the topic at hand, in addition to how best to comprehensively understand that topic. I appreciate the way she set up the course and the required assignments and presentations for grades. They were meaningful but not too overbearing considering the other coursework and \"majors\" besides SBS that we all had.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Very approachable and open for comments. Worked to initiate class discussion around sensitive topics. Used a variety of approaches\/media to convey topics.From my perspective, students were not particularly engaged. This is not necessarily a matter of teaching, but perhaps splitting students into small groups to briefly discuss topics, then coming back together, would have promoted more discussion.Also, thank you for the guest lecturers. They were truly fantastic."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Nicole Genter \u00a0Very approachable, enthusiastic. Used ice-breakers to try and engage class.Sometimes discussions felt very surface-level. Probing deeper issues would have helped. Quick activities at the start of class that are relevant to the week's topics might jump-start discussion.",

    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Most of the discussions were undirected and casual. Didn't feel like learning much. It would be more beneficial if the discussions were more focused on the readings and if the TA has a few questions prepared to guide the discussions.",
    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0She is so nice. I love how she is very dedicated to her role as a TA and gives great feedback and also would suggest outside source to complement the class materials. She also brought us cookies!",
    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Pavita was fantastic. I had scheduling conflicts this semester, and she went out of her way to accommodate my needs. She was very engaged with the students and extremely knowledgeable of the subject matter. Couldn't be better!!",
    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0The most excellent TA I have ever met at Yale. Wish her all the best after graduation. Awesome women =)",
    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Pavita was enthusiastic, though I believe the section could have benefitted from more direction, than just an open ended option to discuss what we would like regarding the psychosocial focus of the day. Furthermore, she blended being a student with being a leader which is a difficult transition for the rest of the students to comprehend. However, she was open to feedback and learning from her inadvertent mistakes and best of intentions."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I learned a lot about this field. Also pace is good and we have enough time to actually absorb the materials. Lovethe group project and paper.",
    "Great class, especially for those interested in learning more about the field.",
    "Worthwhile certainly- courses like this barely exist in many school or curricula. It is also better to be exposed to these ideas and work early in one's academic career to have the necessary personal awareness and growth to be able to deal with these issues (i.e. race, mental health, socioeconomic status) in the workplace and also in conducting research.",
    "It's a good challenge for students. I recommend that.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Again, I think the focus of the course rounds out the education of a public health student. It enlightens understanding about the intransigent issues of our collective health. I would like to see management students have to participate in it or at least be exposed to the material."
