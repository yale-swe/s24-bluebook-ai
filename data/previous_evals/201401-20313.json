    "Great class for seniors.",
    "I thought that the course was a wonderful way to explore places on campus you may not any other way. I loved seeing all the neat things that Yale has to offer. I would highly recommend you take this course before graduating. Professor Bloch was fabulous. He was kind and funny, and I would love to take another course with him. The work was also minimal. There was a lot of reading before classes on Wednesday, but in terms of graded work, we had one paper and a final. If you're looking for a way to get the most out of Yale, this is it.",
    "Take it. So fun.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Treasures of Yale is great--it is made up of weekly visits to various collections on campus. There is a lot of reading, but you end up skimming a lot of it. The final paper is actually a really cool assignment because you get to work with any one of the countless Yale archives and collections.",
    "Treasures of Yale is a course unlike any other you will take at Yale. It basically consists of a weekly field trip to some bizarre and extremely cool collection that Yale owns. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Most people Credit\/D it, which makes a lot of sense, but we just got our grades back and I would have done very well, so Credit\/Ding it might not even be necessary.",
    "Take it! Credit d preferably!",
    "MUST take class. Amazing, thought provoking, great way to feel connected to the university more broadly.",
    "Treasures is a good class if you want exposure to a lot of things you might not have even known were at yale. Bloch is great.",
    "This was an eye-opening class for me. I was introduced to a number of wonderful locations and collections that I was unaware existed beforehand. Howard Bloch is the perfect professor for such a course and bring his own unique perspective. Students of al majors should take this course.",
    "Amazing seminar with an amazing professor. Bloch is a Treasure. This course is a treasure. You visit some of the coolest things, from ancient coins and maps to medieval medical textbooks and fairytales to preserved brains and stuffed birds. It's magical to see the riches Yale keeps locked away all over campus. Can't recommend this more highly as a fun and engaging course."
