    "If you've got to take it, you've got to take it. But a word of advice: do your own thing. You haveto spend a whole semester working on a single project, so do something you are f***ing excited about. Even if it goes against the critics' advice. Stand your ground with your ridiculous design and get your critics to get on board. I think the people who hated it the most found themselves trapped in a project they didn't like that didn't represent them.",
    "You have to take it if you are in Architecture.",
    "You don't have to take this class. Really. The design track is weird and Quixotic and incredibly stressful. If everybody else is in Design, remember, you don't have to do that too. Only do this to yourself if it's what you really want. If that's the case, it's probably worth it.",
