    "While I'm not sure how useful everything you learn in this class is, I definitely had to look at things in a different way to understand the material. This is the stuff that Prof. Aspnes studies and he keeps it interesting. I definitely got a lot out without having to put in a lot of work. It's a good elective if you need a course without frequent work. Just make sure to look at the problem sets well in advance so you have time to think about the problems. Most of them have some key aha moment that you need to figure the whole thing out.",
    "This is a theoretical course, with proof-based psets, not a practical course with programming assignments. Aspnes is a really engaging, funny, and approachable professor. Everything for the class is in this one giant periodically updated PDF blob - lecture notes, assignments, past final exams, etc. Everything you need to know can be found in the giant PDF blob. You do not need to buy the textbook. We were supposed to have six psets, but at the beginning of the semester, Aspnes couldn't find a TA, so he decided to cut it down to three psets. However, after finding a TA, he decided to keep it at three psets anyways. Though we only had three psets, they were still the same length as they would have been had we had six psets. Each pset is three questions. Most of tackling a pset is reading Aspnes notes and understanding what the questions are asking. Once you have caught up on all the material that the questions address, they are fun to think about and not too hard. Final is worth 40% of your grade and be prepared that some of the solutions may be one-liners (basically just cite a theorem). Take this class with a buddy; it's fun to work on the psets together the week they're due. The workload isn't bad; basically just need to spend a few days before each pset reading the notes and tackling the problems, and then need to catch up on and review material at the end of the semester to prep for the final. Distributed systems has a lot of interesting material.",
    "This was a good CS theory class. The material can be a bit frustrating because while the theory of distributed systems is somewhat motivated by practical problems, the actual theory seems totally inapplicable to the actual construction of distributed systems. Aspnes isenjoying and hilarious, but moves wicked fast in class and does a lot of hand waiving on the proofs. I don't mind the hand waving, but it sometimes causes him to rely on intuitions that the students haven't built yet and leave many of us in the dust. Hopefully, he improves his pacing a bit. Especially because, if you don't get super lost, he is enjoyable to listen to and not droning.",
    "CPSC 465 is a broad introduction to the highly abstract theory of distributed systems. Expect most of class to be spent on proofs.",
    "This was a good class. Very theoretical, but Professor Aspnes makes that clear on the first lecture. I took the class credit\/D and I think that was a good decision.",
    "To be honest, this wasn't my favorite theoretical comp sci class. Aspnes is a great guy, but I didn't find the material particularly interesting or relevant. That said, I had the opportunity to see a lot of unfamiliar proofs involving lower bounds, restricted adversaries, impossibilities, etc. which I hope will prove helpful in the future. However, I didn't find any of the material or proofs particularly fascinating, which was frustrating. The work load was very reasonable - there where 3 problem sets that were difficult, but do-able. I also thought the exam was fair."
