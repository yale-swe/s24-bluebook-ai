    "This is definitely a different kind of class. Its greatest contribution to the curriculum is the context understood by looking at art, considering culture and history and listening to Professor Draghi's circuitous and delightful stories. This course gets at something deeper than what we encounter elsewhere.",
    "The course was interesting and information, and although it did not follow any particular predefined path, that was not the point. It is very successful, I think, in creating a space where ideas and thinking are encouraged, especially ideas that are not particularly rational or easily described, but that depend on getting a feel for themes, intentions, and environments beneath the surface. In this sense, I think the course is an excellent outlet for important questions that do not receive treatment in other more problem-based policy and science courses.",
    "This course is what you make of it. It also depends on the fellow students taking the course. The visits to museums and library are fascinating.",
    "this course is unique by design - it complemented my other courses well and provoked further investigation of related topicsi would add that the course really comes together nicely at the end - from a set of disparate topics and organic diversions, the point of the class (a thought excercise) becomes clear - a helpful twist to the FES program",
    "Great idea to have a class that discusses art and history and at the same time gives insight on environmental conservation."

Also, this course is of great interest for everybody trying to expand overall culture knowledge.",
