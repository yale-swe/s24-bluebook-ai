   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class because the topics are important for anyone to understand.",
    "Teaches you about how people can be manipulated, more of a psychology class than a poly sci class. Beyond just learning about studies, we go in depth into each one, and Bullock provokes your opinion in order to find the value of this kind of research. Easy testing.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, I would recommend it all the way.Don't take this class if psych doesn't interest you. A minimal interest in polisci is sufficient.",
    "The class is a fairly simple and straightforward introduction to Political Psychology. The lectures often just summarized pertinent points of the reading with occasional points of clarification and elaboration. The material is rarely complex, and much of it will be very familiar if you've taken classes like Intro CogSci or Intro Psych. Bullock is a fair and clear professor; there are no surprises hidden in the class material or exams.",
    "The basic structure of the course is that for each class you read a few psychology studies and then in class Professor Bullock summarizes the studies and applies them to politics. Lecture is really interesting and you have to go or you won't do well on the tests.I absolutely loved this course. Professor Bullock is a great lecturer in a very understated but engaging way. He is also very accessible outside of the classroom, which I really appreciate.The material we studied was really interesting, and the tests weren't hard if you study.",
    "This is a good intro class where you pick up a lot of phenomena and trends that have occurred in real campaigns. The course covers a lot of canonical experiments and big findings that are useful in moving forward in political science. Professor Bullock is a good, clear lecturer with a fair view on the topics that he teaches. I'd recommend the course for sure.",
    "Take it. Interesting stuff, Bullock isn't bad,and not very stressful academically.",
    "You have to take it! Professor Bullock is very good.",
    "I would summarize it as being heavy on the psychology and light on the political. It is also a reading intensive class about 1\/3 of the way through the semester - do not be fooled by how easy it begins, with about 30-50 pages of light reading and a movie on the infamous Milgram Studies. It gets harder - much, much harder - as the readings become longer and more technical.",
    "Yes. Great course.",
    "Very little work. Reasonable grading. He wants to give As to people who have put in work.",
    "Yes, the class is great. It is very interesting material- the lectures, topics, readings are all very fun. The exams are hard but not impossible- if you study you will do well. The Prof. is good- his lectures are interesting, but he mostly just talks. I was able to follow without getting distracted, but if you find it hard to pay attention without visual aids like Powerpoint, maybe this class is not for you.",
    "I would recommend it, especially to other political science majors. It is very helpful in trying to figure out what, in a general sense, voters are thinking.",
    "Great class with a very engaging professors. The readings are somewhat substantial but the tests are very straightforward and fair.",
    "I really liked the course. It presents an interesting mix between politics and psychology, showing the psychological background behind a lot of political phenomena. Not too much work, although the reading load depends on the week, and the reading is all technical psychology or political science papers, so be prepared for that. Also, the tests should not have all questions weighted equally--it doesn't make sense to assign the same weight to a question requiring a one-sentence answer and a two-page answer.",
    "It's easy, fun. If you want rigor this may not be the course, but otherwise yeah go ahead. Can be a bit dry at times",
    "I would summarize it as a great introduction to the social sciences, and would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Provides a general overview of psychology in politics.I would definitely recommend the class",
    "It's a decent class, but not really challenging enough or in depth enough to offer a deep understanding of the topics covered. If you're looing for a fifth class to supplement your work in political science or psychology, I would reccommend it; otherwise, there are better options.",
    "Great professor. Interesting stuff. Reading that is difficult, dense, and uninteresting. Section filled with people that you'll hate if you're not a polisci major.",
    "A survey course, not a lot of stuff you haven't heard before.",
    "An unsatisfying introductory course which melds psych and poli sci, only take if you have neither of those backgrounds. Otherwise, the way the information is framed will be frustrating. On the bright side, very easy to succeed in.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's not too much work or too difficult, but it is interesting material.",
    "Cool course; you gain a new lens through which to view political behavior. However, it may leave you feeling somewhat hopeless about our political system.",
    "This is a very interesting introductory course in *social* psychology. Make sure you know what you're taking; half or less of the course will be directly dealing with \"politics\" per se, meaning things like elections, party alignment, voter behavior etc which we traditionally think of as politics. A lot of the course focuses on things like conformity to social pressure, obedience to authority, and other subjects which definitely have *relevance* for politics but are not themselves necessarily or immediately political.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone interested in psychology or poli sci.",
    "Psych 332 is a great course for those interested in the interaction between psychology and politics (as well as persuasion, media, advertisements). The readings are mostly interesting and present very relevant issues and ideas.",
    "A phenomenal class, very different from some other ones at Yale. No slides or technology, just a professor talking (but still interesting and not boring at all!). The material is interesting, the reading sometimes a little dense (but you don't have to do it all -- just go to lecture and take good notes). Overall, highly recommended class, it's great!",
    "PLSC 201 is an overview of important subjects in political psychology, from Milgram's experiments on obedience to the effects of personality on politics to Bayesian updating to the new field of genetics studies. Professor Bullock points out the weaknesses and robustness of the various ideas in their turn, helping place each article in the proper context so as not to be misled.This class is fantastic. Take it!",
    "Not a great class but interesting if you really want to learn about some really obvious things. lots of overlap with intro the psych",
    "Good class. You'll learn about heuristics, the 5 big personality types, the \"authoritarian personality,\" happiness, obedience, Bayesian updating, framing and priming, and these subjects' role in shaping American electoral politics. I learned a lot, but there isn't enough of stuff specific to politics.",
    "Political psychology focused heavily on the psychology side of the material, sometimes with little connection at all to politics. We covered some of the major work in the last half century of social psychology and learned interesting information. The readings were all from scholarly journals, which was interesting. Tests were reasonable, and the final was during the last week of class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to people looking to broaden their knowledge of the field of political science. You learn a lot about both psychology and political science. It's all interesting material. The readings can be a bit hard to understand sometimes if you haven't taken any sort of political science class before or if you haven't taken Stats. Luckily the readings do much of the interpretation of the experimental results for you.",
    "This class is best suited to poli sci majors looking to learn psychology as it applies to their major. The psych content is a little weak, so psych majors may find it frustrating. Still, the material is interesting and lectures are enjoyable (if a bit repetitive).",
    "I would recommend this course. The workload is not too heavy, the midterms are fair and not too bad to get through, and it's a really interesting class. I learned a lot!",
    "Very good course for an underclassman, with lasting value and engaging topics. However, I would not recommend this for a social psych major, as many topics will be familiar yet treated in less depth than you may have already been exposed to.",
    "This class gives a good overview of major areas of interest in political psychology and the methodologies used to address them. I would recommend this course to students interested in this area. I would warn, however, that it seems to be more aimed at political science students than psychology students. I found this to be frustrating at points as some information which was gone over in great detail I felt I had encountered many times before while other information wastaken for granted which was new to me.",
    "Interesting but confusing without a psychology background - take intro psych and intro stat before even though they aren't requirements."
