    "The DHS capstone was great. This was a senior project for Customs and Border Patrol. We took two trips to DC and a trip to El Paso, Texas to see the border (all thanks to the Jackson Institute). This class was definitely a highlight of my time at Yale.If Noah Kroloff teaches again, I would highly recommend taking a capstone with him. He is a great teacher and mentor - connects you to all the right people to interview, and guided our group without telling us what we should do.I would highly recommend a capstone with Noah.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "The Capstone experience is 100% dependent on your adviser and client. I had an absolutely AMAZING TIME working on my capstone for the US Customs and Border Protection. After three years of classroom work, writing papers, and theory, I got to pool all of that training together and do something real and that experience blew my mind. I've never been so excited about an academic pursuit, but this thing was enough to keep me excited the entire semester. That said, the experience really depends on your adviser and the client. Choose something you are genuinely interested in. Also, I'd say don't be afraid to pick the adviser who is a practitioner, rather than an academic. The practitioners have first-hand know-how, not to mention contacts and experience, and they are happy to share them with you which is so cool! No doubt you will hear mixed reviews. I for one had an amazing experience and it made me so happy I decided to be a Global Affairs major!!!"
