   "comments": [
    "This is a good intro class. It can sometimes be an awkward or difficult position between students with a music background looking for either written knowledge or an easy A, but I feel like the course is reasonably easy for everyone. Professor Morgan-Ellis doesn't grade the aural assignments too harshly, which helps keep people new to music from getting poor grades. She is nice and pretty good, but there might be better professors if you want to shop sections.",
    "Most people who take Music 110 already know how to read music, and I think it's a bit fast-paced if you're brand new to it. The first few weeks will be easy if you know how to clap eighth notes, but the class picks up by the end with chord progressions, triads, and lots of aural work. Esther is a hilarious instructor, and I really liked this class!",
    "Great way to learn the basics",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. It's a fun class to take if you are interested in theory and\/or music, even if you are majoring in something else. I was an Electrical engineering and econ major, after all.",
    "A great course to learn the basics of music and song writing. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested.",
    "Like any introductory class at Yale, this class was falsely advertised for students who do not have any musical background. I was in the minority as one of the students who stayed the entire semester without having any musical background. I often had to meet with my instructor during office hours just to keep up with the a capella, orchestra and other musicians in the class. It was a struggle to keep up, but I learned a lot. I encourage students who don't care about the grade\/want to learn about what we hear everyday to take the class.",
    "A fine course. You learn what's on the syllabus and some other interesting trivia from Professor Morgan-Ellis.Despite her occasional stuttering and stammering, Professor Morgan-Ellis is very good. She is knowledgeable, explains concepts clearly, and most important for this class, is enthusiastic in her instruction. She is nice, too, always willing to meet with students outside of class (which was very helpful)Something annoying about this class is that the daily homework, while easy, requires you to be pre-med levels of anal to ensure an A, even though the difference between getting 1 and 6 answers wrong I doubt has much to do with your mastery of the material."
