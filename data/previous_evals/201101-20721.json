    "This course approaches the subject of molecular machines -- from ion channels to myosin -- from various perspectives, including quantitative, structural, molecular biological, and physiological. It is quite interesting and serves as a great complementary course to physiological systems. Recommended.",
    "It is a collection of lectures that encompass molecular biology techniques, structures, and substrate transport across membranes. It is a different kind of look at cellular physiology that you haven't had before. I would reccomend it because it was interesting, I learned a lot, and the professors who teach it are overall great lecturers.",
    "I'd recommend the course. It is a reasonable amount of work and includes a number of interesting topics."

    "The quantitative and pathological understanding surrounding these various proteins is one that has deepened my appreciation of my research and biomedical science in general.",
    "Some of the things I learned in this course went alongside with what I was learning in my other courses. It didn't help me with my research but did help me understand several talks I went to this semester."
