   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We were unable to delve deep into anyone topic given the breadth of global health policy topics covered. However, completing the midterm and final exam assignments were helpful in instilling knowledge and skills.",
    "Good material, nice and concrete (although a little too focused on AIDS). Would be improved by shorter student presentations or more rigorous evaluation of student presentations - basically they should be either shorter or better. The debates and group discussions were very helpful, and it'd be great to have more time for those. The presentations at the end were very fun and should definitely be kept!",
    "Strengths: the only course where one can learn about so many \"cutting edge\" topics in global health financing policy Weaknesses: the organization of the course make it feel more like a seminar, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just think it should be made explicit in the beginning of the semester",
    "Strengths: This course exposed us to real world case studies about the challenges of financing health interventions and allowed us to debate what measures should be adopted, taking cost and health impact into consideration. The class size was also great because everyone was allowed to voice their opinions. Weakness: The course needs more of an introductory period for those who lack a background in health financing and global development.",
    "Strengths include useful weekly readings. Weaknesses include the tendency for presentations and chatter to take over most of the class, leaving little or no time to dive deep into the readings. It would be interesting to try a model case competition where debates on which health intervention to pursue would take place on slides and teams would present precise figures and numbers to back up their position.",
    "good course. I wish there was more focus on building technical capacity. I enjoyed the discussion based teaching style, but felt that there is a limit to how much nuance we can learn about subject matter. I wish the readings were more streamlined to include only a manageable load of relevant readings.",
    "This course is great because it incorporates a lot of real world material and information that policymakers use to make decisions regarding health systems. So you get a familiarity for the sorts of models and frameworks that ministries use to decide what sorts of interventions are most beneficial and most cost-effective. Unfortunately, a lot of the course is just exposing students to these sorts of issues. We didn't get into actual modeling exercises until the very end of the semester. I would suggest doing this modeling earlier in the semester so that students have more time to incorporate it into their final projects.",
    "This course is a wonderful bridge from other courses and the real global health policy world. You are exposed to material that would only be accessible from having a practitioner as an instructor. The projects of the course are its greatest strength in allowing the students to grapple with the class material and apply it to their own interests. The class could be improved by introducing modeling techniques earlier in the semester to allow students to be exposed to more techniques and have more time to understand them on a further level."

    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0He is an effective instructor who wants to connect students with opportunities.",
    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0Good instructor! Gave good feedback on reading responses and led class well. ALso appreciated commentary on readings. Would be nice if they were more clearly labeled in classesv2. More feedback on presentations would be good. Very sweet to bring all the sweets!",
    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0Strengths: Prof. Hecht is very engaging, caring, and of course, intelligent! He has unparalleled experience in the field and is able to use that for great discussions throughout the course! Weaknesses: Not really a \"weakness\" of Prof. Hecht but I wish he taught more!",
    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0Prof. Hecht was very accessible and genuinely wanted to provide advice and guide us through our presentations and papers. I liked the fact that he would set up scenarios for us to debate about what policy choices would be best under a particular circumstance. He's teaching style relies a lot on case studies, which is great, but I think at times it would of been best to have lectures that simply focused on providing an introduction to the topic.",
    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0Professor Hecht brings incredible knowledge and experience to the classroom because he practices what he teaches.",
    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0He is an amazing profesor and his class is one of the best i've taken.",
    "Instructor: Robert Michael Hecht \u00a0Professor Hecht is a very engaged professor. He is excellent about making himself available for all students. He knows how to make every minute of the class time valuable and push students to not be shy about taking stances on complex global issues."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "A great course for anyone interested in understanding how global health donor agencies work.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to students who are interested in health policy and financing in developing countries. This course exposes you to the challenges key decision makers in resource-limited settings face in determining the most cost-effective interventions to implement in their respective countries. Therefore it is a very useful course for individuals wanting to pursue a career in global development work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who intends to pursue a career in global health, especially undergrads who do not get as much exposure to pre-professional skills in the College. At the end of the course, you will be able to complete your own model of the costs and outcomes of a health intervention.",
    "This course is great because it explores a lot of real-world material and information that policymakers use to make health system decisions. You get a familiarity from the course for the sorts of models and frameworks that ministries of health use to decide what sorts of interventions are most beneficial and most cost-effective. Professor Hecht is extremely knowledgable about these topics and brings to the class a lot of this exact sort of costing analyses and case studies prepared for decisionmakers by his firm Results for Development. The final paper is a bit daunting but otherwise the workload for the class is quite manageable."
