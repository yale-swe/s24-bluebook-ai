    "Overall, I would definitely recommend taking Chinese 130 if you have the time and energy. My Chinese improved so much over the course of one semester. I found myself understanding the subtitled Chinese phrases in TV shows that I wouldnt have been able to understand at the beginning of the year. Plus, its nice to have classmates that you see every day-- its a great way to foster friendships.",
    "I've never run across a better run, more organized language class at Yale or anywhere else than the Chinese program here. The teachers are wonderful, the homework is beneficial, and it will challenge you and help you to develop in every aspect of the language. The professors are willing to help you with any course material and of course any extracurricular (e.g. Light Fellowship related items) as well.",
    "Yes. I learned a good bit. I just wish they'd make the tests less centered on wrote memorization of sentences.",
    "I would recommend it if the person has time and the passion to learn Chinese. But it's a lot of work so it can't just be a side-hobby.",
    "Intermediate Chinese on steroids. I would recommend if you are serious about learning Chinese. However, the workload is out of control, especially when you have 3-4 other classes to worry about."
