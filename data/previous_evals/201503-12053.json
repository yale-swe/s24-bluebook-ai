   "comments": [
    "I would recommend FREN 150 to another student, given that he\/she\/they actually are interested in learning French. If one has no real desire to master French, I think this class could be difficult (especially with the amount of self-driven work). I would not take this class if you will not do all the work and show up every day. Other than that, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course, especially as a bridge to taking other, more exciting French classes.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that French 150 is a lot of work, but it really does improve your mastery of written and spoken French. We also watch movies in French, which really improved my aural skills. I would recommend French 150 for any student who feels they have the time to invest in a good amount of work every week (grammar and readings and movies and essays do add up, time-wise).",
    "If you are really passionate about French then pursue this class, but it is a lot of work and definitely not worth it if you don't want to truly dedicate yourself to learning the language.",
    "French 150 is a good class if you're already decent and French and want to holistically improve your vocab, reading and listening comprehension, grammar, and conversation. Don't expect to focus too much on any particular topic. The class moves quickly, and you only get out what you put in, especially when it comes to out of class work on vocab and grammar.",
    "If you can get your language requirement done with just this class, go for it. It's pretty fast and rough and there's a lot of work, but it becomes more manageable as the semester progresses. I found Emilie Polak to be a very strict grader, so you might have better luck with a different instructor.",
    "Recommended. Great introduction to Some french books.",
    "French 150 is generally a good class, although it has a lot of busy work and little assignments. It's technically a language class, but most of class is discussion of reading that we did. I did not particularly like most of the things that we read, but that may have been mostly a matter of personal taste. It's a challenging course that will help your French as long as you put the effort into it and have the right attitude."
