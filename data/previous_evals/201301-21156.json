   "comments": [
    "Semester-long semi-guided research on a topic of your own choosing. Valuable chance not only to undertake your own research, but also to get useful feedback from instructor and fellow seminar participants.Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. It is a great class for anyone who is interested in Japanese history or anyone who wants to learn how to do serious research.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, especially to people who have an idea for a project but might want suggestions on sources, methodology, or other issues. Although I am not a history specialist, I found the class highly accessible. It is, however, a class from which you will get out what you put in. The amount and quality of research is more or less up to you, so you will need to be a self-starter to perform well.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class unhesitatingly.",
    "It is a research seminar specialized in Japanese history. I would recommend it to any student interested in delving deeply into a topic in Japanese history."

   "comments": [
    "The opportunity to undertake independent research was extremely valuable; it familiarized me with a variety of scholars and sources and helped sharpen my potential research goals for my future PhD studies. More fundamentally, it was good practice in performing a semester-long research project, and even more fundamentally, it allowed me to put my ability to read pre-modern Japanese sources to the test.",
    "This class is great training for me. I not only learned a lot of knowledge, but also learned how to do serious research.",
    "This was a great course for deepening my comfort level with and understanding of history methodology, and the process of conducting historical research. I was able to learn to use new resources. I used microfilm for the first time, and also made my first visit to the Library of Congress to access hard-to-find materials. I feel much more comfortable attacking the historical side of problems, now.",
    "The research paper produced in this seminar provided a basis for further developing my dissertation topic, and forced me to think about the different bodies of literature that need to be addressed in my prospectus."
