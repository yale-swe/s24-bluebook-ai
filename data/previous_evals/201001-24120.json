    "Easy, but boring. Don't expect a lot out of this class.",
    "Anth 110 is NOT a textbook taught course where you will have fun learning about the indigenous people of the amazon or matriarchal lineage systems. The course focuses on teaching students to look at anthropology as a discipline, the manufacture of knowledge, and the relationships between methodology, theory, and practice.Readings are very doable, and many of them are interesting, although you should definitely look at the course materials in advance - they are not for everyone (some are very abstract, some are rather dry, others describe violence in a very intimate form). The midterm is very reasonable (you have to not go to class, not do readings, never attend section, and hate anthropology if you want to get a C), but actually try to pay attention in lecture and do the readings if you want to score highly. The take home final is intensive, but summarizes much of what you learn through the course.Section is essential to the class, as well as required. Again, do the readings and be invested if you want to get anything out of the course.As for Professor McGovern's teaching style, when you shop the first class, you can be confident that the style and delivery will remain pretty much the same for the whole year. The course becomes somewhat more interactive in the second semester.Overall, you have to be interested in anthropology as a subject in order to getthe most out of this course.",
    "There is a lot of reading for the course, and in order to truly understand the material you should actually do it all. However, most of it is pretty engaging and not too bad to read, and it's well spaced out so that you're never overwhelmed. The concepts covered are very interesting, and it is a great overview of the subject and study of anthropology.",
    "Good intro class, not too much work, take it because you won't really be exposed to this sort of stuff anywhere else.",
    "It's a good intro course for cultural anthropology, and neccesary if you plan to take other anth courses. It's not difficult and you learn relevant material. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "i really don't know what i've learned beyond two words: structure and agency. everything was a zzzzzz.",
    "Anthro 110 is an introduction to anthropology-- its history as a discipline, its methods, its schools of thought, and some of the enduring questions it asks of itself. This is a great course because not only does it take you through the basics, but it also lets you get at some of the most meaty and infuriating questions of anthropology. The workload is low and most of the reading, especially later in the course, is fascinating. The questions Anthro 110 asks of you are worth considering no matter your major or areas of interest. That is to say, take this course.",
    "This class teaches you about different styles of writing and various ways to compose an ethnography. I really enjoyed the texts. This is an easy A.",
    "I guess, if you're into that kind of stuff or if you need it for a distrib.",
    "this class is good if your an anthro major or if your looking for a class that isn't too much work. the class material is pretty boring if youre not interested in anthropology. this course is NOT an into to different cultures, its an intro to how to do anthropological work...which is pretty boring. but the course work isn't too hard. its just a midterm, take home final and weekly writing responses",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You actually end up learning quite a bit and perhaps even a new way of thinking about things. Both the midterm and final exams were very manageable (the final was take home) and both Professor McGovern and Radhika were greta lecturers. The beginning of the course, after the first few initial readings, goes by a bit slow, but it gets better and better as your understanding of anthropology develops. Overall, a great course.",
    "It won't kill you if you have to take it, if you are interested in Anthro it's something of an introduction (as per the title...). and it is not the world's most taxing class, but it can be slow. And tedious. And you may very well want to gag the other people in your class. Or that may have just been our lecture group.",
    "A great introduction to cultural anthropolgoy, it introduces you to the necessary reading needed for a major. I would recommend it, the readings and the sections are great. In the end, it is really what you make out of the class.",
    "Yes. This is a pretty easy course; material is not hard to understand. Take it as a 5th class. One midterm, one take-home final, and short (1-2 paragraph) weekly responses for section. Don't expect to learn about different cultures; it is more about the methods of anthropology.",
    "This is a good introduction to CULTURAL anthropology. Don't take if you're not really into that. I would recommend to a friend because most of the readings are pretty interesting, and without being in the class I most likely would never have touched them.",
    "I would recommend Anthropology 110 to another student. I thought that it was an interesting course full of interesting readings and lectures. The books that we read in the second half of the semester provided very interesting discussion where we were able to use the information about anthropological writings that we learned during the first half of the semester.Professor McGovern was very interesting and brought a lot of interesting stories from his work to the class which brought a lot to what we were learning.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in an overview of anthropology or just want to learn about a few case studies, not really worth it if you're already an anthro major, there are plenty more courses which are much more interesting and focused.",
    "This class is an introduction to the discipline of anthropology. I found this class to be a strong introduction to the methods and the big names of anthropology. The readings are manageable and the workload is overall less than other classes I have taken. The lectures can sometimes be a bit dry but the lectures in the latter half of this course are more interesting, as are the readings.A great class if you're interested in anthro, and a good fifth class if you are looking for something that will be interesting but not a ton of work."
