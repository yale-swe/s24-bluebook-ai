    "Lots of different perspectives on what sound design is and what it means to be a sound designer, developed skills and capturing, simulating, manipulating audio content across a variety of mediums (Audacity and Audition are the GOAT for PC users!), got a ton of ideas about how to be a better collaborator to sound designers as a stage manager, producer, etc.",
    "Gained insider knowledge of the field of theater sound design. Developed skills with the software and equipment typically used in the field. Gained an understanding of much of the terminology and technical background of sound design.",
    "I learnt so much about sound design, its nature, its professional tools, its potential. We composed, cued, performed and interpreted sound. Plus, we got to imagine ourselves as designers of productions for specific playtexts.",
    "I learned the ins and outs of sound design for theater, as well as touching on other related topics such as instrument design\/build, the physics\/science of sound, and audio engineering."

   "comments": [
    "learned a lot! i loved going over everyone's work but there were just so many of us. it would be great if 2 sections were offered to accommodate student interest but allow class size to stay small",
    "Major strength was the course's heavy focus on creating and presenting sound design projects and assignments, I learned a lot simply by taking ideas from the reading and from discussion and trying them out in actual sound design assignments, learning about the techniques of audio capture and manipulation along the way! I use weakness very loosely in the sense that we had multiple \"reckonings\" with the original syllabus: not that I really minded them, and think the class was ultimately better for it. I'm very appreciative of Nathan's desire to center student work as a priority above all else.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Roberts facilitation of discussion. Almost always students were able to make their voices heard, and were never stepped on by each other or by the Professor. Nathan was always very enthusiastic about everyones projects. Given the enthusiastic discussion, the 2 hour class times always passed very quickly.",
    "Strengths: The breadth of learning and yet it never felt like we were skimming topics! The focus on DOING, i.e. executing almost 10 projects across the semester. This enhanced our skills much more. The focus on SHARING, whereby students could learn from each other and give feedback. Weaknesses: Most of the classes were spent going over projects which meant that sound-focussed readings went unaddressed and it was unclear which readings to do.",
    "The strengths included the project-based assignments and presentations in class. It was good to hear other people's work and build off of each other."

   "comments": [
    "yes! i did sound design before (not good at it by any means but i think it's fun) taking this class in my final semester. it was a really mix of formal\/theoretical and practical training",
    "Absolutely! It's a fantastic course for artmakers of call kinds! There are only so many spaces where people can create cool art in a low-stress low-pressure environment, and Nathan has created one of those spaces with this course.",
    "If you have any interest in learning about various sound design\/engineering softwareGarageBand, Qlab, Logic, and their Windows-equivalentsthen yes. In terms of accessibility, in the theater studies department, I feel that design classes such as these are the ones that are the most open to people who have never done anything in theater before.",
    "I would absolutely - you learn practical and theoretical skills. Not just for aspiring sound designers but all involved or interested in sound AND\/OR involved or interested in theatre.",
    "Absolutely; this class covers such a vast array of topics related to the umbrella term of \"sound design,\" and I left with so much knowledge and ideas in my toolkit as a sound designer."
