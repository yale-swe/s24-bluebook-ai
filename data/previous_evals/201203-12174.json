    "Shop well before you take.Joe is great, but is inexperienced teaching. His questions are very astute, but delivered in a convoluted, not streamlined manner. Never really sure what is going on. Wayyy too much lecturing for a seminar. Probably had 1-3 real discussions the entire semester: unheard for a seminar. Easy to \"check-out\" for the class. Great syllabus, too bad we only get to discuss 1\/4 of it because 3\/4 of the time is a Joe lecturing.",
    "Hmm. I do wish I could give this course a glowing recommendation. It's one of the sophomore requirements for the WGSS major--and it's way better than Globalizing Gender--so definitely take it if you have to. I mean, I guess it wasn't too painful. Honestly, there was barely any work at all--just a take-home midterm (that you could do in a group), three readings responses, and a final research paper or creative project.If you're looking for a continuation of US Lesbian and Gay History or a survey of LGBT issues, this certainly isn't it. Not that that's what I was looking for, but it seems that several of my classmates were, which led to a weird class dynamic. Joe Fischel is energetic, enthusiastic, and obviously very knowledgeable about the material, but he is such a Gay Man. Not that that's a bad thing. But for a class that was basically an introduction to queer theory, it just wasn't very queer. Relatedly, the lack of trans authors was pretty unjustifiable. I don't know.",
    "This was a very interesting course covering a wide range of LGBT history, theory, and issues. It was more challenging than I would have expected from an introductory course, since a lot of the class seemed to be in the WGSS department and already had some background in the material. However, the course and the professor were both fantastic, so overall the class was very worthwhile. There was a lot of reading and we didn't always have time to discuss everything, but this was mainly because the class got into such in-depth conversations.",
    "Fischel is great.",
    "I have zero reservations in telling you to TAKE THIS CLASS. It was very excellent. It covered a wide array of topics and, while we didn't get to speak about everything for as long as I might have liked, we did get to talk about a great diversity of issues. Especially as a person coming in with little background in this field of study, I now feel ably equipped to study further. And if Fischel is teaching it again, I would highly recommend him as a professor--he cares immensely about the material and about the students, and he is extremely engaging.",
    "Take it! It's a good intro without being a shallow survey, and even if you're well-versed in this stuff it's a really interesting look through the lenses of legal cases and stuff like that. Professor Fischel is great.",
    "Take it if you are really involved in LGBTQ studies. Don't take it if you are just interested or to meet a requirement but have no background.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. Not only is it a great introduction to LGBT theory, but Joe is an incredibly encouraging professor, creating a space for a student-driven discourse that is both truthful and precise. The readings were stellar, encouraging constant questioning and dismantling. This class is challenging--not because of the quantity of work is demands, but because of the quality of thinking it encourages.",
    "Do not take for an easy social science credit, but definitely take if you want to actually know a lot of basic, very important stuff about queer discourse. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER, IT IS NOT REALLY AN \"INTRO\" COURSE. You should know how to participate in queer discourse if you are going to feel comfortable in this class and avoid accidentally offending everyone else in the seminar."
