   "comments": [
    "Definitely shop it before deciding to take it. Interesting, but frustrating and out there.",
    "An interesting thesis which escapes disciplinary categorization. Touches on architecture, political science, philosophy, and urbanism. A nice perspective on all of these things which does not fall victim to any of those discipline's terms or jargon.",
    "Don't take it.",
    "Good class. Do not be discouraged as an IS student in this architecture class. It provides an interesting perspective on structures,networks, and spaces. My experience proved to be a good mental exercise.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you've ever wondered why the world works like it does. Studying the infrastructures that underlie everything is really interesting. There is a lot of reading, but the majority is relevant and not overly painful.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to anyone. The idea of understanding the disposition of infrastructure, something people normally take for granted, is very valuable.",
    "Somewhat frustrating. Unclear, unexplained readings tied together by interesting, relevant but unfocused lectures. Having one end-of-term paper be your whole grade is scarier than you think.",
    "This class was alright, but it could have been better organized. Sometimes I felt like I came out of the lectures not really knowing what was going on.",
    "yes but take it credit d fail",
    "This course is difficult to peg. I decided to take it because it was my senior spring and I'd always wanted to take an architecture course but never had. As it turns out, the course has almost nothing to do with architecture as I understand the term. I think it might most accurately as a course in network theory. It examines global networks of all kind: physical, electronic, symbolic, etc., but touches very infrequently on actual buildings or other structures, as well as urban planning. There is a very substantial amount of reading, which draws heavily on French post-structuralist theory - lots of Bourdieu, Lacan, Foucault, etc. Keller has a highly idiosyncratic view of the world and is a very engaging lecturer. She fond of coining her own jargon (words and phrases), and trying to understand exactly what she is trying to say or describe is an challenge that lasts the entire term. The entire grade for the course is essentially based on the final research paper. Everyone gives a little presentation on what they're writing about at the end of the semester, which was quite cool as people pick very different and interesting things to write about. I took the course Cr\/D, and I'd recommend on that basis - it's very thought-provoking and interesting, but I don't think I'd like to worry about getting a grade in it, because it's a bit flighty and crazy and the paper is worth so much.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Architecture and systems. It is not a purely theory class (as I thought it was), but you should have some (cultural) theoretical background. Sometimes I felt lost, but the lectures were, on the whole, fantastic: I think this class offers a great and flexible left-leaning alternative to right-wing hegemonic infrastructure classes like Grand Strategy.",
    "I would recommend it if you think theoretically, and are willing to put lots of work into one specific topic.",
    "Yes. It is the best academic course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely for Architecture majors! The class could be a little conceptual and less grounded but it is abs. enlightening about the invisible forces lying behind the built environment which is precious for future designers.",
    "This class covers some fascinating subjects and gives you an unusual perspective of how the world is REALLY organized and run. It's a mixture of urban development, history and sociology, taken from an architectural theory perspective. Take this if you are interested in Urban Studies, corporations, international relations etc. especially if you are a sociology major. Tons of readings come from sociology and I really don't know why it's not cross listed in that major. You learn about global infrasturcture through interesting and surprisingly entertaining case studies. Prof. Keller loves picking out absurd and humorous examples and lecture is really fun. Lecture is also mind numbingly frustrating at times, an endless string of architectural and literary technobable. Most lectures I came away thinking \"Wow, that was really cool...but what the hell did I actually just learn?\" Keller's lecture style is snazzy and modern and incomprehensible at times. But what you do glean out of the class will change your world.",
    "Overall I thought Globalization Space was an interesting class, but I would be careful in settling upon it. The lectures are dry at times, and the same goes for section. In addition your whole grade depends on one paper at the end of the term."
