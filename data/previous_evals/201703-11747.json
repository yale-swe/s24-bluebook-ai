    "I learned how to perform a functional harmonic analysis of music and compose entire pieces from scratch. I also learned the art of counterpoint.",
    "I developed my compositional and analytical skills and built a solid base on which to further grow my musical abilities. I came into the class with very little previous experience with theory, so it was illuminating to be able to look at the music that I listen to normally in a new light. My knowledge of forms and styles increased as well as my understanding of modulations and tonicizations. I also was introduced to the more nuanced discussions of pitch space and rhythmic space.",

   "comments": [
    "The class moves incredibly quickly, but I feel as though I learned a lot of new material.",
    "I think that one of the great strengths of the course was its compositional focus. Instead of assignments that were worksheet oriented, we were always composing, and I persoanlly loved this. It was a great way to constantly engage with the material in a creative way, and the time committment that it required was worth it. A particular weakness of the course doesn't come to mind immediately.",
    "The class is very engaging and the theory knowledge really helps you grow as a musician. However it moves very quickly."

    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I really enjoyed it and thought I learned things that enabled me to look at music in a different light. I would particularly recommend it to other musicians or peers with a passion for music.",
    "Yes, you grow so much as a musician from taking this class."
