    "Great class!",
    "Definitely take this! Its a great survey of modern architecture taught by a great professor.",
    "This class is worthwhile for anyone interested in better understanding the buildings surrounding them - on Yale's campus and in any major city in the world - and the architects behind them. An important class for art historians, architects, scholars of urban studies. I would recommend this class to any student interested in art.",
    "Definitely! HSAR 312 covers a really interesting period in architectural history, and Professor Buckley is great at teaching it."
