   "comments": [
    "I loved psych 110 01, it was super interesting and i would defitely recommend it. It is a great overview of basic psychology.",
    "I think this course is a great introduction to psychology. I would recommend it to any student, regardless of major, because it is fascinating to learn about your own mind. I feel like almost anyone would enjoy learning in the this class.",
    "Way too much work for how straightforward the concepts are. Ive taken all the premed classes and this one has the most coursework and that just feels wrong. Three exams, an 8-10 page paper, 6 pages of single-spaced reading response, a lot of (necessary) readings, AND a 5-hour study subject pool requirement just to add insult to injury. Actually the real insult is that you do all this coursework and then the teaching team takes weeks to get your grades back to you. Actually the real insult is that they finally grade the tests and then dont even hand them back to you. The concepts arent even complex. We learned way more and tougher material in my biochem class with like 30% of the coursework of this class. On the bright side, Dunhams lectures are pretty good, and the exams are pretty easy. He also has a pretty good taste in music that hes keen to show off at the beginning of every lecture. But he has way too high of an expectation for how much youre willing to care about his class. Only take this class if you want to be a psychologist even if youre premed you can learn the MCAT psych in a much less painful way by just buying a couple review books and reading them. Oh, also the curve is pretty harsh if youre a premed or just want to get an A. The cutoff for an A on the first midterm was a 59.5\/62. In other words, missing just 3 multiple choice questions takes you out of A range, and thats assuming all your short answers are perfect. A 94% would be an A- meaning the class is essentially curved DOWN. Well, I curve this class down Ill give it a B- and thats generous. Do not take.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course. Not an easy A and has a fair amount of work (especially in terms of external reading and studying). But worth the work.",
    "Take introductory psychology if you are interested in the subject or need it as a prereq for other courses. The workload was relatively low - readings + 1 reading response per week. It was not my favorite class, but it did its job.",
    "I wouldn't recommend PSYC 110. I took it because I had to, and it was a decidedly mediocre course. It was rather easy, and the material was more flashy than substantive. If you want to learn about some interesting experiments, you might enjoy it, but I found a lot of the lectures remedial or boring. I enjoyed the neuroscience section because it felt like we were getting more depth in that area. Overall, the class wasn't great, and the curriculum could be largely improved. Professor Dunham is a solid lecturer...but the lectures weren't great...",
    "Interesting material and awesome lectures - I definitely would recommend it, though the workload is heavy.",
    "Great broad introduction to psychology. I walked in knowing almost nothing about the field, and now I'm considering majoring in it. Definitely take this class!",
    "A broad, yet in-depth, look at the basics of psychology, a course that every student should take at some point.",
    "Yes I would, especially for those who are considering taking up psychology as a major.",
    "Intro Psych is an interesting course for anyone regardless of whether or not you are interesting in majoring in the field. Additionally, it is helpful in providing some direction in terms of the courses you might take should you choose to major in psychology. The workload is also extremely manageable.",
    "I would recommend that any student interested in the social sciences, human behavior and development, and anything pertaining to the way the mind works take this course. It was very interesting and I found that it shed plenty of light on everyday processes that we are aware of but are not exactly sure how they occur.",
    "This is a good course. Especially if you have no psych background, take this course to learn many things about yourself and the people around you. The work is not too bad, and the lectures are varied and useful. If you are well acquainted with psychology, it may be a bit boring, but it is worth taking overall.",
    "Yes, this is a classic must-take Yale course.",
    "It's a basic intro Psych class. If you find psych interesting, you'll like it.",
    "Great for gaining base knowledge of psychology.",
    "The class is interesting, but in a \"fun fact\" kind of way. Definitely serves a filtering function for students to self-select depending on whether they are truly interested in the theoretical structure of psychology and its various branches.",
    "Interesting and fun survey of topics in psychology that requires little work. The exams were fair and the readings were interesting. Professor Dunham was a great lecturer. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Intro Psychology was a great class. I have already recommended it to other kids.",
    "Solid class if you want a broad overview of the field.",
    "It is a good course to take for a basic overview of psychology, but do not stop here, because it is only the tip of the iceberg for most things.",
    "I would recommend this course. Psyc 110 is a course with such inherently interesting material. I honesty loved reading the textbook. Prof Dunham was a solid lecturer, but for me, the class was carried by its material. The tests were ambiguously worded, but I did enjoy writing the 10 page book review for the class.",
    "take the class! You will learn a lot",
    "In my opinion, the class is very interesting and we don't spend too long on any one singular topic longer than we really need to. The exams can be a bit tough, but doable. However, from talking with fellow students about the class both in this class and past classes, it appears that the professor and whether or not you liked their teaching style can really make or break one's enjoyment of the class. While I felt the professor and teaching style were great (and as a whole this ended up being my favorite class when all was said and done this semester), I can't speak for everyone.",
    "Too much material for MT and Final. Class was too demanding and hard. Didn't enjoy it at all. Look at syllabus ahead of time- big final paper! Also, professor's slides do not help because they only have pictures. I hope you take good notes if you want to pass bc the assessments have small detail questions.",
    "PSYC 110 is a great overview of Psychology. I would definitely recommend it to another student! The material was fascinating and the lectures were always engaging.",
    "PSYC 110 is a pretty standard introduction to psychology course; lectures by Professor Dunham are interesting and engaging. The two midterm exams and final are relatively easy, as long as you take decent lecture notes and do (most of) the readings. That being said, the readings can be long and unevenly spaced throughout the course.",
    "Intro Psych is a very interesting course with a variety of topics that should appeal to everyone such as evolution, development, group dynamics, relationships, and mental disorders. The lecture slides don't recap the entire lecture, so going to class is a must. The curve of the class is rough, so make sure to go to every lecture and study for exams well in advance, or take the class only for credit.",
    "I would say that if you were going to take the course, definitely see if you can take it in the fall with Chung or Bloom. Duhnam was a good teacher and I had a good time in the class but from what I heard from talking to students who took it earlier it's pretty clear that it is more ideal to take it in the fall.",
    "Good intro psych class. The tests were very well designed (and seemed better than Prof. Bloom's)! Engaging without being too much. Would recommend.",
    "Definitely! Everyone should take this class at some point in their four years at Yale.",
    "This course provided a good general framework for psychology, and I would recommend taking it if one was interested in the topic.",
    "It's a really hard class, it won't be an easy semester with it.",
    "Intro Psych was a great course. Lectures were always interesting and Dunham is a great professor. Not a lot of work.",
    "If you are a potential Psych major, the material itself may be enough for you to decide.",
    "If you're interested in psychology, this is an excellent introductory course that covers a wide range of material across many different psychological disciplines. Even if you've never taken a psych course and are just curious about the subject (like I was), this is a good course to take, with a moderate workload and very interesting lectures by Professor Dunham.",
    "I REALLY enjoyed this class. I thought Professor Dunham was EXCELLENT!!!!! I loved every lecture, readings were interesting. Tests were fair. Definitely take it -- for fun, or to learn!!",
    "good class, would recommend, has a lot of real-world applications."
