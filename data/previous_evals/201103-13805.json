    "When you are doing serious research on a topic, you regularly need books from HAAS as well as other libraries around campus (one can only hope). HAAS' policy of limiting book checkouts ensures that you must check books out to your shelf and write in HAAS , however there is no way to leave books from other libraries securely in HAAS. The result is that there is no single place where you can do your work. You are either lugging all of your other books to and from HAAS or you are checking out individual books from HAAS and going elsewhere to do work.This is silly, there should be a way of checking books from other libraries onto your shelf in HAAS.",
    "Yes, I think I have enough resources to fulfill my assignment."
