    "Relatively easy course about analyzing social networks. SNA typically has a lower standard for scientific proof than any other field, and they tend to make significant, causal claims that you couldn't really make in other contexts. It's an interesting course with weekly readings (which some people do, others don't), great discussion sections, and a final project. The weekly labs are super easy, but sometimes marred by technical difficulties. Prof Erikson is really, really great! I don't know how she grades the final, and we haven't gotten any grades back all year, so the lack of feedback makes it difficult to know how grades will work. Some people took the class more seriously than others, and people kind of stopped showing up part way through the year. It was a bit incoherent, partially because the field is a bit fragmented, but also because it was sort of gutty but with a lot of cool and interesting theory. You could get away without really understandingthe material, which wasn't good if you weren't disciplined to learn. That said, if you are truly interested and can get in (it's capped and preference is given to senior sociology majors), I'd recommend it as an extra class, but it certainly didn't take up much time.",
    "I would say that it is a great way to divulge into sociology from a networks perspective. I'd highly recommend the course simply because I enjoyed what I learned in every class!",
    "Really good course, especially if you are looking for a more quantitative and visual side to sociology.",
    "The topic of this course is so fascinating and useful for understanding society that I would recommend this course even if it was completely shoddy. There are a lot of readings, but do all of them, because each is fascinating. The final project is something you can half-ass, but do it well instead because it can lead to some genuine insights. I loved this course, but some of the students took the professor's laid-back attitude to mean that they could cruise through. There's so much to learn about network theory, that this was really a mistake. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Readings are a bit difficult, but if you're into networks, take the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in social interaction. This class is not necessarily only for sociology majors. The course is interesting and informative and requires an appropriate amount of work.",
    "Great new course. Seminar with no tests, only a final project and weekly lab assignments (which are very straightforward). There's a decent amount of assigned reading for each class, but it's all really interesting papers; do as much of it as possible just because it's cool material. The final project is pretty open-ended; I really enjoyed working on mine even though it destroyed my Reading Week. Professor Erikson is also awesome, and really helpful.Take this class if you're at all interested in networks; there aren't really any similar classes. It's perfect if you're looking for a light -- but still really interesting -- So credit. It can be pretty easy if you don't put much into it (i.e., don't do the readings, don't do much for the project), but you definitely won't get as much out of it.",
    "Overall SOCY 167 was a great class. It covered really interesting subject material that is relatively uncovered elsewhere in sociology, or other disciplines for that matter. The course didn't require very much work and was very relaxed, which was a selling point.",
    "yes, if you're interested in doing research with a neat method that's still being developed in the field.",
    "Great course. One of those sociology courses that involves a good amount of quantitative reasoning. A good course for anybody, whether or whether not you're a sociology major."
