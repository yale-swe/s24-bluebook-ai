   "comments": [
    "I have gained new insight into the process of adding changes to a Shakespeare play. This class was very much defined my how much we stretched the play, and the results of that taught me a lot about what works and what doesn't.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about the collaborating process when revising a new(ish) piece of theatre with a large and diverse group, which was a great experience.",
    "I learned a lot about Measure for Measure and the devising process in general. It was interesting to learn the myriad of ways in which this Shakespeare work has been adapted throughout the past 400 years, and the issues of feminism, class, religion, etc. present in Measure for Measure.",
    "A few moderately interesting background insights on Shakespeare\/Measure for Measure. However the incredibly stressful rehearsal and production process negated any potential benefit from these discussions.",
    "Developed the skill of reading and interpreting Shakespeare and acting Shakespeare",
    "This course helped me think more critically about the process of adaptation, both the different techniques for adapting a script as well as delving more deeply into how making deliberate choices can affect the final production. I also felt like we worked on skills for group devising, specifically ensemble-building viewpoints exercises, and working with physical gestures.",
    "I learned how to look critically at a play and impose interventions in order to aid the making of an adaptation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was so personally stressful. There was a big divide between students and prof, it was really scary how unhappy our prof was all the time. We never really knew whether a rehearsal was going to be stable or tense. It wasn't the content that was stressful, just the feeling that we were always being accused of not caring enough.",
    "I think the general format of production seminars needs little if no changing. I love the idea of having a class that puts on a full play through a very academic process. This specific iteration had weaknesses, but that is part of the inherent variability of theatre; some shows will work better than others.",
    "It probably could have been improved by the rehearsal process being slightly more structured from the outset, and sticking to the structure - however, I found this didnt really impact my enjoyment of the course negatively. Most likely, it just meant that the show was a little less developed than it could have been, which is not the end of the world.",
    "Strengths: Our production of Measure for Measure was ultimately successful and people enjoyed our performance. It was fun to get credit for doing theatre with my friends, which I often do extracurricularly anyway. We didnt have much homework because Shilarna understood that we had already put a lot of work into the performance. Weaknesses: Shilarna handled this production seminar extremely unprofessionally. She took her frustrations with certain students out on everyone and blamed us when things went wrong instead of taking responsibility. Most of our issues were caused by a compressed timeline, and that could have been avoided if she had assigned the cast at least a couple weeks earlier, instead of 4 weeks into the semester. Shilarna was right to be frustrated that many students would not make time for rehearsals. However, I believe she should have made it clear upfront that rehearsal participation was a large part of our grade, rather than sending angry emails to the whole class. I also believe that while Shilarna tried to make the class an open space for discussion and questioning, she grew very accusatory when students actually questioned her decisions.",
    "The production process was incredibly stressful, and then all the assignments that were supposed to be done throughout the semester were all assigned and completed within the last two weeks before finals. It was a nightmare. The expectations for the class were not clearly communicated, and Professor Stokes often didn't hold herself to the same standard that she expected from her students. A silly and fairly innocuous example is that she said that everyone had to arrive 10 minutes early to rehearsal (regardless of any previous commitments), but never showed up 10 minutes early herself. The same goes for emails. She required all students to confirm they had received her emails (otherwise their grades would be dropped), but it often took several emails to get her to respond to any student-initiated messages. She also said that everyone who showed up and did their work would receive A's. However I'm unaware of anyone who received an A despite everyone dedicating an incredible amount of work to the production seminar.",
    "This course was well-suited to incorporating input from all students, and so our final production felt like it truly represented the work of the class as a whole. The process-oriented nature of our work gave us great experience in collaboration and teamwork. The course relied on us holding ourselves accountable for the work we needed to do, both on our own and in rehearsals. As a result, though, sometimes the experience of some students was negatively affected by the lack of commitment of others, including those for whom the class was serving as a thesis.",
    "I would say one very strong aspect of the course was the group discussions. I felt like the class very much facilitated meaningful group discussion, which was impressive in a group that size. I also felt like everyone had equal opportunity to speak up, and that we were able to, for the most part, have open-discussions about the struggles we were facing in the devising process. I also thought the class had really strong reading materials, both in the plays which were all written by women of color and sparked very interesting discussions related to Measure for Measure (that definitely left an impression on the final production) and in the essays we discussed in the last couple of classes. I felt like one weakness of the course was that occasionally class-time would be dominated by group discussion, when it may have been beneficial to use some of that time to rehearse or concretely work on scenes in the production. While the group discussions were very helpful and insightful, it got to a point later on in the rehearsal process when it felt like we could have maybe used more time on our feet earlier on. There were a few very early classes where this was the case, but it gradually decreased as we got closer to the show, and then rapidly increased right at the end. I think maybe having more consistent up-on-our-feet devising throughout the course could have aided in building the production, or at least in putting some of the adaptation\/devising tactics we were practicing in motion.",
    "There were great efforts to make this a thoughtful piece of work that takes into consideration and comments on the current day and the problems that are still very prevalent now. Professor Stokes attempted to make every student feel as though their voice was heard and balanced many (often clashing) perspectives, her desire to make this show meaningful was evident."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This course will not be offered again.",
    "I would recommend a production seminar, but not necessarily this specific one. As I said earlier, I love the format of doing a show this way, but this particular production seminar was disorganized and chaotic for a number of reasons.",
    "Yes. It was an engaging and enjoyable process, even if the end product wasnt quite what we had initially envisioned.",
    "No. From what Ive heard, Shilarnas other courses are great, but I would not ever take a production seminar with her because she was very overwhelmed by everything that went wrong with the rehearsal process and the class environment was often tense. She was often clearly angry at students (which was evident from the emails she sent us) and that made me uncomfortable. It was also disappointing that our production ended up being a \"workshop\" when every other production seminar that I know of was a true performance.",
    "Best class Ive ever taken.",
    "Never. This was one of the most stressful classes that I have ever taken. Professor Stokes was incredibly passive aggressive, and it was very unpleasant. It was impossible to know when and why she would get incredibly defensive and\/or offended. When she did get upset, she was quick to lash out, which made for a very stressful and emotionally taxing semester. Professor Stokes came in with expectations that the students would have a professional, Equity-level commitment (25-40 hours\/week) to the show throughout the semester. This was not initially communicated to the students who took the class. She often made snide comments (sometimes directly to the person in question and sometimes behind their back to other classmates) about students and their inability to commit to the rehearsal process. This was incredibly unprofessional and made for an unhealthy, uncomfortable working environment.",
    "Yes! This course benefitted from a dedicated professor\/director and from its focus on process, so I'd recommend that a student considering this course make sure that they're excited about both of those aspects of the course before taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in adaptation and devising, but only if they are interested in really being involved in the process. I think the most engaging and rewarding aspects of this class are only possible if you are willing to invest time and thought in the production outside of class and in the rehearsal room. I think this class was the least rewarding for students who were trying to do more of the minimum because so much of the process was being actively involved in both the conception and carrying out of our initial ideas for the show. For students that don't really have the ability to make that commitment for whatever reason (interest or availability), I don't know that they would find the class as rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this process to another student; while a Production Seminar poses its challenges, especially since it is a collaborative process, and it was a challenge to collect everyone's thoughts and perspectives into one coherent piece of art while making everyone feel heard throughout. However, I believe it was a very important experience to have and one that is very rare in the theatrical setting. It was great to get the opportunity to devise a play and question it and work on the ideas surrounding it with everyone else in the cast."
