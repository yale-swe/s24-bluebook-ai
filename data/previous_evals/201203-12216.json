    "Yes! It's a great class and really useful if you're a social sciences or humanities major. Lloyd is fantastic.",
    "Even if you are not a math\/science person, if you are at all interested in social sciences or just understanding a little more about statistics without taking an intro stat course, or if you just need a QR credit, take this class! It isn't too challenging, but still interesting and informative enough to be worth your time and energy to take. Social science majors should definitely look in to this class. You learn to use Stata, which is so helpful, but it also gives you a new perspective on statical information, which I've found really useful since taking the course.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class to fellow students, whether or not they are Global Affairs majors. I would even recommend it to people who are just looking for a good QR class because it is so well taught, and the work load is very reasonable.The first half of the class is focused on calculus. As a non-mathy person who only took Math 112, I found the class very easy to follow and I was never confused. The calculus problem sets take a few hours (up to 5 for the ones that involve graphing) and are not hard.The second part of the class is statistical analysis using the program Stata. I had never taken any type of Statistics before and did not find this to be a problem. The stata material was a bit more difficult and the problem sets took significantly longer (6-10 hours) but were still manageable, and section was very helpful for the psets.This is one of the gems at Yale. Professor Grieger is a wonderful teacher and person.",
    "Highly Recommended. best way to get a QR at Yale.",
    "GLBL 121 is highly recommendable to anyone who wants an introduction to quantitative research and Stata. Lloyd is an incredible professor, and I literally discovered a newfound interest in statistical programs after taking this course. I am looking forward to learning more programs in the coming semesters, and I admit this would never have happened without Lloyd.",
    "The quick and dirty on calculus that give you pretty much the math everyone should know and then relates it to statistical concepts, also incorporating coding datasets on STATA program.",
    "I highly highly highly recommend this class. Lloyd is the best professor you will have at Yale, the subject material is interesting, and the course is laid out very well. Whether you are a Global Affairs Major or not, this course is a must-take!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Not a huge amount of work but you learn a lot.",
    "I don't like math, but this is a great class. Prof. Grieger is a wonderful teacher and does a great job of explaining everything, its not too hard and some of the statistical analysis is actually really interesting. If you need a QR and don't love math, definitely take it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Really greatQR and you will actually learn something. The best math class for a non-math major by far.",
    "If you need a QR, or are a (prospective\/current) Global Affairs major, take this class! The course covers a WIDE area of material (perhaps not as deeply as others), but provides necessary knowledge in multivariable calculus and STATA to use in development economics and social science quantitative research.",
    "Easy if you're in the major, also easy if you need a qr, but useful to know if you have yet to take calc or a class in stata.",
    "I took this as a required course for GLBL. Professor Grieger is truly wonderful and makes this a great class. The class begins with an overview of basic calc, and then the second half focuses on Stata. The weekly problem sets got a little tedious, but doing them completely prepared me for the midterm and final, which were very reasonable and fair tests.My friends who are not GLBL majors and took this for a QR seemed to be happy with their choice - it's a useful course that you will do very well in if you do the work! If you have never taken calc before, this is a fantastic course because Professor Grieger explains things extremely thoroughly, is super accessible, and the TFs are also very helpful. If you haven't, the first half of the class may be boring but I still think it's worth taking.Best math class I've taken!",
    "This class is really good. I was deciding between this and stats 101 and am SO glad I chose this one. I actually understand calculus (which I didn't in high school), can use basic stata proficiently, and have a handle on basic statistics. The first part is really different from the second part of the course but both were very doable. Plus, Lloyd is AWESOME and the reason I took the course, ultimately.",
    "This is a pretty easy course, especially the first half. The midterm and problem sets are very straightforward, although the final requires some studying for. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours at the end of the course into very long and repetitive problem sets. I don't think I learned much, but it's a fairly easy 5th course and Grieger is a really nice, funny, and approachable guy.",
    "I definitely recommend this class as a stats class because you get to learn how to program in a relaxed, introductory manner. It is a really valuable skill to have and Professor Greiger makes it interesting!",
    "Definitely take this class if Professor Grieger is teaching the course.",
    "I would recommend this class with caution. The first half of the semester is enjoyable. The second half is dense are psets take hours on hours to complete. You don't necessarily learn what you need to know in class in order to complete the psets. Overall for needing a QR, I'm glad I took the course. Much better than taking a QR about planets and stars....or an ECON\/STAT class.",
    "If you're GLBL, you obviously have to take it, but it's a great class, and very low key. I also think it's one of the best QR's you can take. Not too much work at all, very fair assessments, and a professor that really wants you to do well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "One of the best taught class at Yale. Take it. You'd get a chance to meet a wonderful professor-Lloyd. He is so funny and awesome.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE.Very manageable QR credit. Very engaging and approachable and wonderful professor. Very good TAs. Very easy to understand. AND you learn some practical knowledge you can put on your resum\u00c3\u00a9 (knowledge of Stata), which isn't something many Yale courses offer. Yes yes yes all around.",
    "Take this class if you want a really easy and basic QR. If you consider yourself at all math oriented, then I would recommend not taking this class. I would say that even though Lloyd himself rocked, I learned nothing of value from having taken the course. The first half of the semester is an insult to your intelligence if you've taken high school calculus, and the second half is SO BORING. You learn about the program STATA, and are assigned the world's worst problem sets. They are boring, tedious, and not heavily tested on the final. It's an easy A or A-, but really mind-numbingly boring. The professor rocks though, which is a plus.",
    "Absolutely, if: (a) you're majoring in a social science and\/or (b) you're in need of a QR credit that is actually practical.",
    "This class is half calculus and half Stata work. Compared to econometrics class, you learn less statistics but you get to apply your Stata skills to real data, which makes it much more interesting.",
    "This is a requirement for the Global Affairs major, but it is not painstaking at all -- as required courses usually tend to go. Most kids in the course have had previous math backgrounds, so in general, this class is very easy.",
    "If I could go back in time and decide between retaking this class and stuffing my johnson in a meat grinder, it would be a difficult decision.",
    "This class is great. Lloyd Grieger is a GREAT professor, you will look forward to being in his class. AQuA is a very manageable class for anyone (especially if you took AP Calc and\/or AP Stats in high school and haven't taken math since). The second half of the class, where you learn Stata programming and statistical analysis is a bit more tedious, but overall still great. This is a GREAT choice for a QR credit!",
    "This class is perfect if you have been afraid to spend an entire class on relearning calculus, but still feel like you need a refresher. As a bonus you get a foundational knowledge of how to use Stata\/apply statistics to the real world.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to be a data analyst by any stretch of the imagination, and because the class is not hard it can sometimes feel like the problem sets are wastes of time. But Lloyd is an incredible teacher (he will remember your name after handing you back a problem set, beware) and even if you aced calculus before, you will understand it far better after having taken the class.The rare easy but useful QR. No brainer.",
    "The first half is a review of calculus through total derivatives and the second half is an introduction to the STATA program (including commands and coding but focusing more on interpretation of output). I would recommend it because Professor Grieger is an amazing teacher and as QR credits go, it's not too bad!",
    "For me, this course was much easier to understand than Intro to Statistics and it teaches the program Stata. The amount of course work is probably about the same, but it is much easier. A good QR\/ basic stat class.",
    "Easy, fun QR with a fantastic professor. Even if you're not a global affairs major and you just want to get it out of the way, take this class!",
    "Great class to take if you need a QR credit. The P-sets may be a bit time consuming, but the workload throughout the semester is definitely consistent and manageable.",
    "Yes, especially if you have taken calculus in high school, this course builds nicely on that and gives an introduction to statistical analysis.",
    "I'm not sure how desperate you are to get a QR, or whether you are a global affairs major, like me, but I'd stick to straight stats or econometrics if you want to gain that skill set.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend if you've never taken stats or need to review calculus.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone with a background in math, but anyone else could take it. It's interesting, pretty easy, and relevant.",
    "The material isn't the most thrilling stuff in the world, but if you were frustrated by the overly theoretical, knotty nature of programming, Stata might make more sense to you (it did for me). The material picks up speed in the second half of the semester, but even so, it's very manageable. Go to section! Seriously. Go to section! It's not a waste of time at all and the TAs were great.",
    "Only if you need to. Lloyd is a boss.",
    "This class is awesome, mostly because of the professor, but also because it is one of the most useful courses someone cantake at Yale who is interested in public policy or international development. The first half focuses on calculus and is pretty easy, especially if you have taken calculus before. This is the best QR you can take if you are \"not good at math\". Lloyd explains calculus wonderfully and the pace is pretty slow. The second half is the more interesting part of the course as you learn the statistical computer program \"Stata\". My only complaint about the class as a Global Affairs major concentrating in international development is that it's too easy! The calculus review could have been constrained to a week or two, and we could've gone much more in-depth with Stata. I wish Lloyd would teach a more advanced version of this class because he's awesome!",
    "I can't imagine having taken a better QR class than this one--Lloyd was a hilarious professor who genuinely wanted all of us to do well in his class. We reviewed high-school calculus in the first part of the class (which I personally think could have moved a bit quicker) and learned how to use Stata in the second half. We analyzed real data gathered in South Africa, which kept the class interesting and especially relevant for people going into the social sciences.",
    "Take it if you are interested in social science aspects of statistical analyses! This class is made for students with little or no background in statistical processing.",
    "If you need it, then take it.",
    "take it. even though the problem sets for the second half are the worst, it's worth it.",
    "I hate hate hate math and vowed never to take it in college, but this was a fantastic course. Professor Grieger is AMAZING and cares so so much about his students, and provides you with EVERYTHING you need to succeed in his class. One of the best professors I've had at Yale. He eases you into everything and before you know it, you'll be using STATA like it's your job. I cannot sing his praises or this class's praises enough. A hidden gem among the QRs, take it even if you're not a Global Affairs major and you will love it.Go to the review session for the midterm!!! Seriously, just do it.Don't underestimate the psets toward the end. You do not (I repeat, DO NOT) want to save them till Tuesday night. Even seasoned procrastinators will regret it.Overall, TAKE IT!!!!",
    "Yes! Take this course! Especially if you need a QR, if you want to get a basic understanding of calculus, or if you want to familiarize yourself with a statistics computer program, this class is a great option. I learned a lot and fulfilled my QR requirement painlessly.",
    "The first half of this course is calculus, and the second half is entirely working with the Stata program. If you don't want to use Stata, it might not be worth taking this course. Lloyd is great and managed to make something interesting out of what could have been pretty dry material and overall not a bad QR. First half is definitely way better than the second half, though.",
    "The first couple of weeks of this course are all calculus, so students who do not enjoy that or who have no desire to review it should be aware of this. The statistical analysis portion can be fun as long as you don't wait until the last minute to do the problem sets. Interpreting statistics is an important skill to have, especially for people interested in social sciences or policy, but people not interested in interpreting surveys and policy memos might not enjoy this class that much.",
    "Easy materials",
    "Not too bad. It's an equalizing class.",
    "The class may seem boring by name, and the first half of it -- a crash-course in calculus that starts from basic linear functions but advances very quickly into the multivariate - is less than enlightening for anyone who knows calculus, but if you're looking for a QR\/want to major in GA, there's absolutely no reason why you should dread taking this class. I loved it, and you will too. Lloyd is the best professor I've ever had (he made Math fun. not an easy thing to do.), grading is tremendously lenient, the workload is far lighter than what you get with any average Yale course, and having a working understanding of STATA is far more valuable than you might expect (especially if you have social science\/developmental economics ambitions).",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale, mostly thanks to Professor Grieger.",
    "Rec.",
    "Absolutely! Lloyd is a great professor with so much enthusiasm for the subject and for helping his students. He makes statistics engaging and relevant. Examples focus on applying the math and programming to real-world problems, so this is a great course for anyone interested in social science.",
    "yup tho keep paying attention and slogging through those psets",
    "GLBL121 is a great course if you want an introduction to statistics or applied statistics. I had never taken stats before and was very happy with what I learned. The best part of the course if the professor. Lloyd is fantastic and makes the course very worthwhile. He is always available to help, and makes lectures interesting and entertaining.",
    "Yes recommend.",
    "Take this course. It is not sup[er challenging, but this doesn't mean it isn't valuable. Professor Grieger is fun and the material is important. Who knows- taking this course might change the way you think about your math capabilities and the role of statistics in your future.",
    "GLBL 121 is required for GA majors so if you're reading this you probably don't have a choice but here's good news: this class is AWESOME! Not so much because of the material, but Professor Grieger is amazing and one of the best professors I have ever had at Yale! He is enthusiastic, genuinely cares about students, is an excellent teacher, and is always organized. He goes out of his way to make class interesting and is great about posting all notes and ppts online. Psets are straight forward and not unnecessarily hard, exams are also straight forward and doesn't try to trick you. If you've already taken calc, the first part of the class will be ridiculously easy but learning to program in Stata and works with real-life data sets is interesting and very relevant. A huge plus of this course is that it is intended to be practical and relevant and with Professor Grieger, this goal is very effectively accomplished.",
    "Take it if you do not have a strong econmath background. otherwise consider econ 131 or 135",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! Lloyd makes the material easy to understand and the workload is not too heavy."
