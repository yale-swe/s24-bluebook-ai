    "I found the course very general later in the semester. I think the course needs to be focused on Industrial engineering concept, and policy and sustainability issues were more than I expected. I thought it will be a specialized course in Industrial ecology, but It was not.",
    "na",
    "It will be better if we can use real data to practice MFA before doing our research. We might need more exercise.",
    "The course is very superficial. I wish we would have actually learned to do industrial ecology. Ways of doing this would be by making the problem sets challenging. Also, problem sets should be used as a way to prepare student for their project. Otherwise, the project is mostly an improvisation which is very frustrating to students.",
    "The group projects and the trips that went along with those projects were very helpful.",
    "Workload heavy due to final project though I wouldn't reduce the workload. It is important to give more bounded projects (i.e. projects that can be completed within the semester. The projects should be assigned with clear boundaries, it should not be up to the students to set those boundaries since they are unfamiliar with the topic\/project.",
    "As always, I appreciate the hands-on approach of the project component of the course, and I think the principles of Industrial Ecology are useful for environmental managers.However, I felt there was some miscommunication and lack of organization in the way that the class was conducted. TAs would give conflicting and mutually exclusive answers to questions and explanations of work evaluations, for example, and while I was actually more interested in doing a non-Hawaii project, professors should be a bit more careful when using examples from Hawaii research and experience to illustrate course concepts. There were a few times when they referenced very specific events or points of interest related to the Hawaii research by way of illustration - more specific than what we could glean from the Hawaii literature we read. That puts most of the class outside the loop."

    "The project was helpful.",
    "The course is good for first year students who have less experience in industrial ecology. As a 2nd-year, 2nd-semester student who had taken a few courses related to this (linkages, energy, etc), some of it was review.",

   "comments": [
    "Should be a way for students to choose group members for project- a lot of time to be working with people who where randomly put together and don't get along.",
    "It seems like the instructors ran out of material about half way through. It is also pretty rudimentary.",
    "We had better have some Q&A sessions after the debate.",
    "The contents of the course needs to be revised to fit the title of Industrial ecology. I found the course very much general, and think it needs to focus on more on greening industry operations.",
    "The exam...was not necessarily a good reflection of what I learned. Maybe an exam is not even appropriate for a course like this.",
    "The class provides, in my opinion, a pretty superficial overview of an interesting topic. Another thing that frustrated me was the lack of feedback and discussion stemming from debates. We were assigned a debate and after presenting, we went straight into lecture without any time to ask questions or spark into more lively discussion. I think this was a mistake--we would have gotten more out of the exercise if able to actually follow-up on some of the more controversial points.",
    "The lecture was a little bit easy.I think we can learn more from the lecture and assignments if there are more skills involved rather than just concepts.",
    "The homeworks and their grading was not always clear. Making them broader in scope (longer, and covering more IE concepts) would help as would making the questions clearer. If the questions are to be more subjective in nature (thinking critically about a previous question or a concept we've covered in class), the grading must reflect this.Most classes were concentrated on a certain objective, but having both Marian and Tom step back and talk about the whole picture and how each lecture fits into the Industrial-Ecology puzzle would help.",
    "Selecting the right TA.Debating in class was an excellent idea - However, the judges never spoke about their perspective of an issue. In the end, the whole process was more of a grading exercise than a learning experience.",
    "Need more practical assignments.",
    "The instructors need to present with more authority. They have the expertise, but should really demonstrate it. The tone was too casual\/elementary at times. Don't be afraid to dive into the deeper concepts and theoretical underpinnings. The",
    "The problem sets and final project. This is were student really learn how to do industrial ecology and its applicability.",
    "I think that this course is very broad and tries to touch on a lot and it feels a bit too surface level, but I guess it is just an introduction to industrial ecology.",
    "The projects need more structure and clear boundaries such that they can be adequately completed in a semester. This ultimate direction and clear project scope should come from the professors\/TAs who have experience with the projects they assign.",
    "See above",
    "I found the course too theoretical while the project was entirely practical. I thought the lectures did not really prepare use to do the project. I would place more emphasis in lecture in explaining how industrial ecology is practiced and how it is useful. Try to cover real problems and real solutions. Try to convey real tools that students can apply in work."

The only solution I can think of to this is to provide additional direction and expectations for the debate).

    "I could expand my knowledge through collaboration with others.",

    "Everyone brought a different background and knowledge set to the group, which was very helpful for our group project.",
    "Advantages were that the projects were very cool and interesting. Disadvantages were that there were SUCH different requirements for each group in reality...and it was hard to figure out what all was expected sometimes.",
    "This group project was one of the more frustrating things I have ever done. I suppose it provided an appropriate real world experience in dealing and working with people who are probably the last people you would ever choose to work with. I was frustrated and towards the end, I had had it with my project--I just wanted it to end and didn't even care how it ended. I also felt like it was difficult to coordinate with our professor and TA contact; our project contact, however, was extremely helpful and involved.",

    "I learned a lot from my team members.",
    "Sometimes group members are just difficult to get a long with.",
    "Advantanges, i was able to share time with people from other cultures. Disadvantages, because we did not know very well what we were doing it was frustrating at times.",
    "I really want to stress that people had different expectations for the group project and some people did very little work. I was quite disappointed in that aspect. I think our project went well, but it took huge efforts from two people, while one person did not do anything.",
    "Group work made the class interesting and possible. It was nice to get to know a group well, and I believe we worked well together. That said, the groups could have been diversified to minimize weaknesses (for example, mixing groups up so that no group was 100% international students or no group was 100% environmental sciences undergraduates, etc.).",
    "Always tough to schedule and more time-consuming that independent work. That said, I don't think we would be able to accomplish projects on the scale that we do in IE if we were working on our own. I had a very positive group work experience this time around."
