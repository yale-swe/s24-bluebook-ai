   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class if you're interested in mass incarceration and want to learn more- a lot more. You have to keep up with the readings, but don't get scared off by the quantitate stuff- Prof Wildeman helps the class to walk through the tricky parts in class.",
    "Absolutely. I knew absolutely nothing about the topics of this class prior to this semester and feel quite knowledgeable about the material now. It is fascinating stuff, and not a ton of work. You get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Take it! Good class.",
    "If you're interested in how prison affects society as a whole, take this class. There's lots of reading but it's not really a ridiculous amount and I found you can basically do it all the day before anyways.",
    "This class is all about the growth of the prison system in the United States and how it has impacted inequality in various ways. It is a really interesting topic and one that everyone should no more about. I think it was one of the best seminrs I have taken at Yale. Professor Wildeman is really knowledgeable and energetic - he makes a 925 seminar really fun. He is also really prompt with feedback. I would definitely recommend it, I thinkits a very manageable amount of work, but be sure you participate in class to get the most out of it!",
    "Fantastic! Really in-depth overview of a specific subject matter, which Prof. Wildeman walks you through very thoroughly. Great professor, great class discussion. 13 weeks is a long time to sit through a seminar on one specific topic you're not interested in! We explore multiple sides to one specific issue which is really good if you want the dept for this subject matter. Make sure you're prepared to commit to the 2 hour seminar every week and the reading. The reading is not too bad but does require time. Overall a really great experience!",
    "This is what college should be about: learning a lot, getting passionate about it, and lively discussion. Take it.",
    "This course reviews the current literature on the effects of U.S. mass incarceration on inequality. The main strength of the course is Professor Wildeman himself. He has solid grasp of the material and the readings. As he does research in this field, he deeply cares about the ways in which punishment might affect the inmate's family. The course, however, does not make space for discussions about policies. The focus of the course is to understand the main arguments at stake and then point out their weaknesses. Yet I totally recommend this course to any student interested in critically evaluating the role of punishment in society.",
    "The course is amazing and it can change your perspective on the criminal justice system and provide you with the knowledge to determine the extent of mass imprisonment in the United States alongside its inequalities. Definitely recommend this course!"
