    "This is a really chill and really fun class. You learn practical skills for taking care of museum specimens (focus on vertebrate fossils but applicable to many specimens). You get to make a mold and cast of a plastic dinosaur head, break stuff and glue it back together, and practice uncovering an actual fossil.",
    "Interesting little gem of a class. Lectures on something that is often skipped over in other courses with hands on activities throughout. Approachable and knowledgeable teacher. Would recommend to anyone that has an interest in this field.",
    "Absolutely. This is such a cool course that mixes such a wide variety of students (graduate, PhD students, undergraduates from all majors). On top of that, Marilyn is such a fantastic professor she really cares about her students and wants to make sure her students learn and enjoy the course. She is great and so is the class."
