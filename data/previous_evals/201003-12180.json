   "comments": [
    "Not a good use of time. Take a different workshop by a different instructor who will assign small weekly writing assignments and structure class discussion.",
    "Oh yeah, take it. I mean, it's just a workshop\/class, but surely you'll be inspired by your peers, and Crowley is wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow students. It's a great environment and its a way through which to expand your writing skills.",
    "It's a pretty free-flowing workshop with an open structure in terms of what work you do. Basically, it's a mix of new stories and revisions, and it's all very manageable. Unless you're workshopping, the only work each week is to read and critique the stories of the people whose work is being discussed. Professor Crowley is a little quirky, but he's also really wise in a way a lot of professors aren't. I say take it!",
    "Crowley is a great guy and this class is exactly what you'd expect from a fiction workshop. I wish he gave a bit more criticism, but otherwise, fantastic.",
    "Take this class if you want to write short fiction. Crowley's great, the format is great, and you'll actually have to write things over the course of the semester. A lot of the quality of feedback, because it's a workshop, will depend on the rest of your class, but Crowley's incredibly insightful and humorous and engaging, and he always writes up a page on each story in addition to the things he says in class, so you'll definitely get helpful criticism.",
    "You read each other's stories as well as ones from professional writers and review their strengths and weaknesses. Prof. Crowley also builds recurring themes to better understand larger components of good writing throughout the semester.",
    "This is a good workshop. You need to write about three stories and two revisions for the class. John Crowley is helpful, honest, and funny. As with any writing workshop, your experience will depend a lot on the other people in the class."
