    "I found this an immensely interesting and useful class. The intensive course structure was challenging but it also meant I was able to focus on the course in some depth for those two weeks. It was a bit too challenging to keep on top of all the reasons. Fewer, key readings would have been useful. I also think a slightly more structured draft delivery schedule for the second half of semester would have been useful. For example two pre-determined dates that draft texts would have been due by. Overall I loved this course and gained a lot out of it.",
    "The best thing about the instructors is their dedication to the course. They are genuinely passionate about the subject and have A LOT of professional experience, they are open and willing to share their knowledge and contacts. It depends on the student wether you take advantage of it or not."

    "It is hard to maintain the same level of commitment and interest throughout the semester. A student would need to be very motivated to take the course and make the most of it. The two week intensive lectures are exhausting, and following-up with the professors via long distance is hard, but worth it. I cannot emphasize enough how much it depends on every student, because the professors are wonderful and remain interested and available."

This course was perfect for me, it was diverse, it was international and it gave me a good intro into both law in general but also environmental law.",
    "Because I wanted to learn about environmental law from an international perspective. I was not interested in the more detailed aspects of the American legal system but rather more holistic approaches to environmental law across the globe.",
    "I have a law background and wanted to learn more international environmental law theory. This is not the best class for that, as most of the learning is done through the term paper - but it does provide a wonderful opportunity for non-lawyers to learn the basics and how to do a comparative approach; and for lawyers to specialize in a specific topic through their paper. Getting to know the instructors is also an invaluable opportunity."
