   "comments": [
    "An overhyped class that's too much trouble for the B+ you'll most likely receive, and most definitely not worth your time.",
    "Five essays of around five pages, first draft and final. Also amazing readings pulled from sources like the New Yorker throughout. Would absolutely recommend you take this class if you want to improve your writing through a more creative outlet (more personal and fun writing)",
    "Absolutely. The essay prompts allow you to tailor each one to something you will enjoy working on.",
    "If you have the chance to take this with Professor Sexton, please do yourself a favour and take it. He is by far the best professor I've had at Yale. He really cares about his students and values everyone's opinions in class. Assignments were very fun to do and didn't feel like work.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes this term. Professor Sexton has great experience in editing and writing, and this class helped me to grow my critical reading skills in a way that I'm not sure 114 or 115 -- the classes most frequently recommended to first years -- would have, given what I've heard from friends about those classes. And while this course isn't about academic writing, it will certainly prepare you for peer reviews and critiques, in addition to improving your voice and sense of certainty with your work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It really challenges you to take command of your writing instead of adhering to concrete templates that inhibit creativity.",
    "I think 120 is a great way to enter the writing scene at Yale. If you have done a lot of writing before the class will be a breeze for you - you will read 2 essays a week and write one essay in 2 weeks. This way you will be able to increase your writing portfolio and more critically evaluate how good you actually are. If you have not done a lot of writing 120 is great in that it methodically leads you through different techniques and genres.",
    "This class was great. Awesome English class. Take it with Adam sexton.",
    "ENGL 120 07 is a great class. You will learn a lot about different writing styles and techniques, many of them to be incorporated into your own writing. You will discuss the essays, critique them, and then discuss and critique yours and your peers'. The grading is especially strict, but you get used to it. I would recommend this class, 10\/10.",
    "In this course, students are asked to read non-fiction essays and incorporate the techniques of the authors into five essays of their own. I would recommend this course to another student. This course can prove useful to anyone, no matter what they are studying, as it allows one to improve one's writing skills."
