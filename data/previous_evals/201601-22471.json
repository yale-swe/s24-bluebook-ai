    "Absolutely. Financial crises courses in other schools should really emphasize the issues and informational frictions that are central to this class, and I surprised that they do not. I would advise any student interested in intermediation or business cycle theory to take the course."

Now when I read papers on banking, I have a more discerning eye about what key informational frictions they might be ignoring, and how they define crises."
