    "I learned much about the history and theories behind animation as a medium.",
    "Understanding of the history of animation, various animation techniques and their origins, as well as key questions and debates surrounding the medium of animation",
    "I learned about animation beyond just normally watching it on the screen.",
    "I was able to learn so much in a comprehensive look at the history of animation-- from the beginnings of \"trick films\" to modern day CGI blockbusters. Throughout this survey of history, Prof. Gerow weaved in a significant amount of animation history as well, talking about the intricacies of what it means to be animation, and how it relates and sometimes opposes cinema as a whole.",
    "I developed my critical thinking skills regarding media, and I feel that I also developed my writing skills in this course, even though the credit was not a writing credit.",
    "To think critically about what animation is and its history as a medium",
    "We learned about the history of animated film and problems associated with it.",
    "This class was a primer in the long and variegated history of animation. \"Disney\" is included in the title, but the focus of the class really isn't on Disney, at all. Rather, it is about the competing aims and styles of animation, its playful and mysterious origins, and the Disney style as contrasted with that of other players.",
    "Learned about the history of animation in cinema and how to analyze animated films.",
    "Above anything, I gained a much deeper understanding and appreciation for the field\/art of animation. Even yesterday as I was watching a movie, I am able to recall the techniques used and appreciate the work behind it.",
    ".",
    "I learned how to analyze, criticize, and understand animation, as well as film, against its greater history. I learned about famous theories and tropes of animation, what they represent, and what they tell us about the human condition. I also thought critically about how a medium of art affects the content of the art and how artists can use the medium to their advantage.",
    "Knowledge of different types and movements of animation; ability to recognize important animated films",
    "History of animation, writing\/analyzing animation",
    "broad history of animation; relationship between cinema & animation; theoretic understandings of animation; issues of gender & race as explored through animation"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor was amazing, interesting, knowledgeable and kind. I never got bored in class! Section was very helpful in working through more difficult concepts and was also interactive in a way that didn't alienate people who were non-film majors.",
    "There was a lot of content covered. I believe it could have benefited slightly from some more focus on a few key parts of animation. Despite this, this course was excellent as a whole for learning about animation as a medium.",
    "This is definitely a survey course, it covers a very broad time span and many different forms of animation, so it doesn't go too in depth into any particular film or area of animation, but provides a strong basis for understanding the medium.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Gerow is a passionate, incredible professor-- the course's strength comes from Gerow's ability to merge different fields, such as film, philosophy, and psychology. The way I look at animation\/film will never be the same. Weaknesses: it was hard to figure out what to focus on for the exam, whether to go to the technical\/ID or philosophical\/reading-- there was a lot of material to cover and the exam ended up being much more difficult than anticipated.",
    "Sometimes it was difficult to gauge what I was supposed to learn from the lectures. Also, for the exam, I did not really know what was important to study. A practice exam would have been nice. The animations were amazing to watch, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching everything.",
    "This course was excellent in its content-- I felt like I learned so much in such a short amount of time. The papers were very interesting as well, balancing research and analysis. The final paper allowed us to choose our own topic, which was so fun. However, the final exam was a bit hard (which the professor acknowledged afterwards), which was understandable being the first version of this class to be taught. One thing is that there is a huge time commitment in terms of screenings-- on top of lecture and section, there is a 2-3 hour screening every week. Don't take the course if you can't dedicate that time.",
    "I liked how this course discussed Disney animation and other types of animation. However, I wish that it spent more time discussion other types of animation besides Disney.",
    "Lectures are well organized and the class moves at a good pace. I wish we could have spent a little less time on the really old animation.",
    "This class covered a wide variety of animation styles and studios, which made it a great survey class. This is an interesting class to take even if you do not know anything about animation. The lectures made me think about classic animation films in new ways. The course had a lot of meeting times, and the film showings were at times very long.",
    "The screenings were nice but a large time commitment and some films felt unnecessary to what we were learning. I was surprised and pleased with the sheer amount we covered by the end of the semester. I also felt that the course treated race and gender with more care than many other Yale courses.",
    "This course covers a lot of ground, which is the main strength and chief weakness. I personally found it rather difficult to keep up at times. There is a lot of reading for the course, which some people did not always elect to do because of the sheer quantity of it all. While it is important to get a survey of different styles, especially in a course like this, I think that focusing on fewer themes or fewer styles would have been wiser and allowed for more depth. This course has mandatory screenings which lots of people didn't attend! This is really problematic so now I'm calling people out on it! GO TO YOUR SCREENINGS.",
    "Lectures were great and engaging. I enjoyed the variety of the topics discussed. I think focusing a little less on Disney would benefit the course.",
    "There were a good number of readings and I fell behind with them. This made it hard to keep up with the class and in the discussion sections. I think a way to improve this would to choose more engaging topics or further pace the readings. I remember towards the end of the course, as the topics became more relevant to me, I became much more engaged and excited.",
    ".",
    "It is a very interest topic and you learn a lot about a wide range of topics. It is not too hard and the lectures are always exciting. You do meet a lot and it requires a lot of time, though the readings arent too bad. There are virtually no other assignments. The essays are a lot of fun, and you get a lot of leeway with the final essay.",
    "Strengths: fantastic, comprehensive lectures; amazing syllabus; opportunity to write about whatever interests you on the final paper Weakness: felt unprepared for the exam; didnt know exactly what I would be tested on",
    "strengths: lecture & their structure, really clear & informative"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale. It was honestly one of my favorite courses I have taken in the past 3 years.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was very informative and it was taught in a manner very conducive to learning.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes if you're interested in animation it's a really good overview of animated history and techniques",
    "Yes! Prof. Gerow is a passionate, incredible professor-- the course's strength comes from his ability to merge different fields, such as film, philosophy, and psychology. The way I look at animation\/film will never be the same.",
    "Yes! This was my \"fun\" course for this semester, and I am so glad that I did it. It was tough at times, but the animations are really eye opening and there is so much you can analyze in a film. I really enjoyed watching these animations!",
    "Yes! It is such a fun class and section, and the lectures are so informative yet entertaining.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I received clear feedback on my work, and the workload is not super intense. There are readings for each class, but they are usually not that challenging.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes because the topics were cool and it was a nice break from some of my other classes because I actually enjoyed the material",
    "I would, but with the caution that students need to take the course seriously and not think that it being \"animation\" means that it will not be challenging. Unfortunately, a lot of students operated off of that framework and had a rude awakening on the final examination! Professor Gerow is quite literally at the top of his field and I wish I interacted more with him. He is brilliant to learn under.",
    "Really good class. Professor Gerow is one of my favorite professors at Yale and the course is very interesting. Animation is such a varied and intriguing topic and there is definitely something for everyone in this class.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student. It is taught so well by Prof. Gerow who's enthusiasm is so much appreciated. A very fun\/interesting topic that also doubles as a great class to improve reading and writing skills.",
    "Yes! Good survey of animated film. Wish we had more classes devoted to animated film.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about animation, its history, context, and theories or to anyone who wants to learn about film and how to evaluate it. Its a great intro to film in that sense. It is interesting, not too difficult, and not too work intensive. You learn a lot about many topics. Its a great course.",
    "Yes! Youll watch such amazing films and expand your knowledge of animation past and present. Youll also do a good deal of talking about race and gender theory which is so important and so fascinating.",
    "If you're interested in animation or media, yes. It's really interesting and as someone who thought they knew a lot about animation, Aaron always had more to say.",
    "yes, if they were curious about animation or interested in genre studies from the film dept"
