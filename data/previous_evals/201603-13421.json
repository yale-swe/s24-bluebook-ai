    "I gained knowledge about Chinese philosophy and garden artwork.",
    "I learned about the cultural context and philosophy of Chinese parks and gardens. I was also able to utilize various Yale-specific resources through assignments, such as the art gallery and the libraries. I have a much better sense of what it means to write in the humanities on texts, art pieces, and making arguments.",
    "I developed a broader perspective on different types of gardens and the different purposes they served, especially in ancient and modern china. Also developed a better idea of the humanities and the research and effort needed to learn about gardens.",
    "This course offered an in-depth history of a subject that I knew nothing about in a multivalent way that I could often connect to discussions in my other courses. I gained valuable skills in researching and analyzing diverse types of primary resources, from maps and site plans to handscrolls and rhapsodies.",
    "I gained knowledge of the Chinese conception of gardens and the important role nature has played in literature and culture over various dynasties. I also gained a broader familiarity with various type of traditionally Chinese prose and painting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course lacked historical context that would have been valuable in understanding the cultural significance of Chinese gardens.",
    "I think this course did a good job of placing Chinese gardens in the context of philosophy, and providing a comprehensive overview of the topic. I wish there were more synthesizing of big ideas from each time period. I think the course could have placed gardens better within the context of Chinese history, which it often skirted around but didn't hit upon squarely. Although there was some sense of continuity from lecture to lecture, I wish we spent some time hitting upon bigger concepts and how they changed over time. I also wish there were less focus solely on texts and discussions. I had trouble gaining much from the texts; it would have been more engaging if we also utilized pictures, videos, etc. to experience the gardens. The Canvas website would be less cluttered if the assignment for the readings and the reading quotations were condensed into a single assignment, where we could both download the readings and upload our reading logs.",
    "Strengths: the course was fairly structured and allowed me to time manage well, with respect to the readings. Also there were few assessments that the professor was lenient and very helpful for. Also the seminar setting allowed for a more cohesive and attentive environment to learn. Weaknesses: a rather esoteric topic, so it was hard to stay motivated and engaged all the time.",
    "This course's major strength was the way it approached its subject -- Chinese gardens -- from many different directions: artistic, literary, historical, intellectual... I often felt, however, confused as to the context of the sources assigned and discussed and think that a kind of preliminary crash-course on the Chinese history we covered throughout the course (in addition to the useful lesson-to-lesson contextualizations) would have been nice.",
    "I think the trips to the various locations on campus were really engaging and aided the strength of the class. The Staten Island trip especially was a blast. I also enjoyed the variety of texts that were read, particularly the poetry. I do wish the class had a greater focus on the gardens themselves and how they were constructed---the garden design project was one of my favorites. I also think keeping on a more consistent or apparent timeline could've been helpful as I often felt I lost a grasp of exactly who the writers were that we were reading and how they interacted temporally."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Chinese art and philosophy, this course is for you. However, if you are looking for an interesting elective credit on something that sounds cool, steer away from this class.",
    "This course is well suited to those who like reading texts and discussing them. The course would reach a wider audience if there were more emphasis on other methods of learning like pictures, etc.",
    "If you're at all interested in anything about gardens or the east, it is a fun setting to learn about something new. But looking at the big picture it can be hard to stay motivated.",
    "I enjoyed this course greatly, but I would probably only recommend it to students with a strong interest or potential interest in its very niche subject.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student interested in Chinese culture and pursuing the topic of nature in a relatively low-stress environment, with a warning that some of the material it covers doesn't always feel easily applicable and appears more interesting than useful in an everyday sense."
