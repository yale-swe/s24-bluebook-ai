    "Teaches you general equilibrium theory, and the mathematical framework behind much of modern economics today. The models themselves have rather...questionable assumptions, but learning how to mathematically \"prove\" the impact of social security is interesting, to say the least. A somewhat painful class (and I consider myself decent at math), but valuable to anyone considering higher-level economics.",
    "I learned the basics of general equilibrium theory and overlapping generations models. The course was a good introduction to economic theory.",
    "Shortcuts to solving utility maximization problems Thinking about economics using more formal mathematical models",
    "learned a foundation for basic mathematical economic models",
    "Finding equilibria under various conditions",
    "In-depth understanding of many different economic models.",
    "I gained insight on the theory and computational techniques behind a variety of microeconomic models that serve as the basis for higher-level study in economics, including Pareto optimal models, competitive equilibria, the welfare theorems, Arrow-Debreu, and the Samuelson and Diamond models.",
    "If you enjoyed the general equilibrium component of intermediate micro, then this course is great for you. You get a lot more insights into the definitions of equilibria and much more mathematical formality than in intermediate micro.",
    "Through this course I developed a deeper understanding of general equilibrium, but an unconvinced that I retained much of the theory or the reasons why the theorems we studied are true. Instead, I think I will retain more of the computational techniques for solving general equilibrium problems. This course also provided insights into topics not covered in previous econ classes, especially regarding the overlapping generations models we discussed near the end of the course."

   "comments": [
    "The problems are extremely abstract. It would help if we could go over examples in class, since the textbook has essentially no examples of how to solve homework-type questions. There's a lot of theory, but it's very difficult to learn to solve the problems based on what we learn in class.",
    "It would be stellar if Prof. Bewley could use a microphone - he talks rather softly. If he doesn't, sit in the front of the class.",
    "Expectations were clear, but lectures were dry. It is important material, but more enthusiasm on the part of the professor could have made it more exciting.",
    "Great class. It is difficult to hear the professor.",
    "The problem sets and class notes\/textbook were great. Would have appreciated a more engaging lecture format, but it didn't hurt my understanding of the material.",
    "Strengths: Extensive online resources posted, very good textbook Weaknesses: Subject matter can be repetitive and lectures overlap significantly with textbook Improvements: more lessons with visual or digital components would help",
    "Strengths: the course prepares one well for the rigors of higher-level economics; problem sets and exams sync well. A helpful textbook. I also appreciated the opportunity to have the final replace my midterm grade. Weaknesses: lectures were not particularly helpful, and the course was lacking in help resources, as there was only one time for office hours and it was difficult to meet the TF outside of those times.",
    "The material was interesting, but Professor Bewley's lecturing style was rather unengaging and difficult to follow. Compounding this issue was that Prof. Bewley wrote the textbook we used as well, so it was less useful as a resource to see the material presented in a different way. I think that encouraging more student participation in lecture and pausing more frequently to see if there are questions could help alleviate some of these issues."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would not - you have to teach yourself most of the material and you receive little feedback when you get things wrong, which makes it even more challenging.",
    "Take it if you want to do grad school (or are interested in grad school). It's a tough class, but definitely not uninteresting material. If you're just casually interested in economics, take another class. The exams were more than fair (and frankly, I learned almost everything about the course during reading week). The only way to do well is to practice the problems until you can't take them anymore.",
    "You probably have to take this class for your econ\/math major, but if you don't, you should take it anyway. The course provides a rock-solid foundation in mathematical economics, and will push you to think more rigorously about the conceptual models developed in micro theory.",
    "The material was interesting, but I would only recommend this course if you are an Econ and Math major and are required to take it.",
    "If you are interested in economic theory, I would recommend the course.",
    "I liked this class.",
    "Yes definitely",
    "If you need to take this class for graduate school in economics, do not expect that this class will prepare you for the analytical thinking demanded by microeconomics sequence at the graduate level. Sure, Truman went through the formal models of general equilibrium, which are really nice to learn, but students are evaluated based on problem solving skills and not formal thinking skills. (You will learn many shortcuts to solving utility and profit maximization problems.) Doing well in this class wouldn't hurt your chance to grad school, of course. But I would suggest if you could do Micro at PhD level then you should.",
    "it's pretty good, i found it hard at first but caught up later in the semester. only take it if you need it though",
    "Take it if the material seems interesting to you - the course is incredibly well structured and the material can be fun if you are into econ.",
    "This review will be less relevant to Econ\/Math majors since this a requirement, and more for Economics majors who are considering taking this course in preparation for graduate study. I took this course as it seemed to be good preparation for economics graduate study, and to that end I am glad to have taken it. The course reviews the theory and computational techniques behind a variety of microeconomic models that serve as the basis for higher-level study in economics, including Pareto optimal models, competitive equilibria, the welfare theorems, Arrow-Debreu, and the Samuelson and Diamond models; while proofs are done in lecture and in the textbook, the exams and homeworks are computational for the most part. Prof. Bewley is a nice and approachable professor, albeit not a stellar lecturer, so I recommend glancing at his textbook for the course, which is fairly helpful for the most part (lectures, for the most part, did not feel particularly helpful). The course is divided into weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final. The homeworks were fairly challenging, and it helped to work in groups to get through them. The midterm and final were fair for the most part and were a mix of computational questions and some application of definitions. Dedicate as much time as possible to prepare for both of them by going through the extensive practice exams posted by Prof. Bewley and by going through the textbook to understand the major definitions and applications of the theorems, especially from the first half of the course. It is possible to have your final exam replace your midterm exam if you score better on it, which means you should fully focus on studying for this course during reading period if you did not do as well as anticipated on the midterm. One unfortunate aspect of the course was that the amount of help resources was limited; the TA was helpful, but had office hours at a fairly inconvenient time, and it was hard to schedule times to review material outside of those. I would hope that more help resources could be available for those who take the course in the future. In short, while I would not recommend this course in a general sense, since the material is fairly dry and not immediately clear in application, it is well worth your time if you are interested in graduate study in economics in any capacity. Having completed the course feels incredibly rewarding, and I have a better sense of the rigors of economics grad school having completed the course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning more about General Equilibrium. The problem sets can be pretty challenging, so make sure to start them earlier. But, the psets are graded fairly leniently, and the exams are very fair and straight-forward",
    "This course is not a great class, but also not awful, and you definitely do learn more of the theory and problem-solving aspects of general equilibrium. Lectures were often tough to follow as Prof. Bewley speaks pretty quietly, so a good teaching fellow makes a big difference. For econ\/math majors, you have not choice, but for others, I do not really see the reason why you would want to take this class, unless you have a burning desire to learn more about general equilibrium."
