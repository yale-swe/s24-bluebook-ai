   "comments": [
    "Really interesting, fun, easy-going curriculum. A lot of exams, but it is never unmanageable. Try to get a smaller class--it gives a better atmosphere.",
    "120 gets a bit trickier than 110, but it covers the material at a much nicer (read: slower) pace than 110 does. There are more movies and we even read a short story! Definitely would recommend it, especially if you can get Chris.",
    "AWESOME . TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. Italian department rocks",
    "Take this course with Chris Kaiser.",
    "I would say that it is a great class and other students should definitely take it. It is not a gut class and you have to work a little, but it is a lot of fun and you learn a ton.",
    "If you want a language credit, the Italian department is fantastic. It's a challenging course, but very fun and engaging nonetheless.",
    "As follows:ITAL 120 is a continuation of ITAL 110, that is to say, a class that introduces the basic grammatical concepts of Italian in a fast-paced but well-regulated manner spiced plentifully with cultural tibits and interactive exercises."
