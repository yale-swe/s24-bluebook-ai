    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I think that for people who have never analyzed violence empirically before (like me), this class adds a more empirical level of understanding to theories and frameworks already familiar.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. I thought it was really interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is looking into the violence classes offered by the global\/polisci majors. Comprehensive approach\/survey to the literature available on insurgencies.",
    "I'd definitely recommend GLBL 361 to anyone who's interested in learning more about the theories behind violence and civil insurgencies, while reading some very interesting and modern papers. The class does have some repeat readings with a couple other lectures and the Global Affairs core, so I would take a look at the syllabus to make sure that you haven't done too many of the readings before.",
    "Great class!",
    "I would recommend this seminar!"
