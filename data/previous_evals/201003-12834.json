    "There is much more independence in this course than you've probably experienced in any previous course. This is a blessing and a curse. We become very used to having professors tell us what our next step should be or where we should go, but in Painting I, how much feedback you receive is almost entirely up to you. Will really knows his stuff, and you can normally sign up for a time to meet with him on Mondays if you want. Otherwise you're on your own in terms of how much and what work you create. Ultimately, this is a good step to becoming a working artist in the real-life art world. I recommend this course, and am interested to see how Will's class differs (or doesn't) from other Painting I classes.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to paint seriously.",
    "Take Painting Studio every semester if you're a painting concentration. You need a space to do all of your work. If you're not a painting concentration, take it anyway to develop a studio practice which is applicable to all areas of life.",
    "It depends a lot on the professor -- but no matter what it's a great opportunity to do independent studio work.",
    "This is a great class to develop your studio pactice. Students are given the freedom to investigate their own visual interests, and the professor is very helpful in guiding students through that investigation."
