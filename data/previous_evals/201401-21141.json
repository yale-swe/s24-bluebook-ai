    "If you want to read great books and have great discussions with a smart professor, take it.",
    "Take this class! I am so thankful to have taken this course before graduating. I am an EP&E major and I have never taken an English or Journalism class in my time at Yale. This class reinforced the importance of critical thinking and exposed me to a variety of new ideas presented in various ways. I will be a better reader and thinker because of this class. The reading list is great (even though there are some books I absolutely hated, I still think they were worthwhile reads and fit well into the course). More importantly, Professor Oppenheimer is a really great seminar leader. It is worth taking this class with him and the interesting other students he selects to make up the class. REALLY GREAT CLASS!!!!!!!!!",
    "I really enjoyed Journalism of Ideas. It's a chance to read a varied assortment of long form journalism and cultural\/political criticism. At first the syllabus seemed almost too varied, but it turned out the different works we read had more in common than I expected. The only weakness of the course is that there isn't as much emphasis as I would expect from a writing class on discussing the craft and journalistic techniques of what we read.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Being witty helps. The syllabus was the envy of my intellectual friends. (Don't roll your eyes; that's completely honest.) My only gripe was the day we spent talking about Tariq Ramadan, which was -- in quick, hazy retrospect -- a valiant effort to make sense out of Ramadan's nonsense. Mark Oppenheimer is the professor I'll miss the most, so it's fortunate I can read him in the New York Times. Do let him know if you're afraid of dogs, though.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Really interesting readings with a great professor.",
    "This is the best course I've taken at Yale. Seriously, I've never said that in these evaluations before. The syllabus will blow your mind. You'll read your ass off, but you'll love doing it because these books are at once page turners and mind-stretchers. AKA, you'll work hard but you'll love doing it. Oppenheimer is intense and he'll push people, but all for the greater good of interrogating the texts. This is also the only seminar I've ever taken where a lot of the students ddi like all 200-300 pages of reading every week. What! But it pushed me to work harder, and I got a ton out of it. Just two papers, one book review that's fun and a final piece of journalism that's a really good time to make. Not overbearing, and really a wonderful experience. Oppenheimer has a hands off approach that's really refreshing. Oh, and if you want to work in journalism, he is the best person in the entire world to talk to.",
    "Journalism of Ideas is basically a fun book club with a friendly public intellectual. Mark Oppenheimer is an opinionated guy who throws in his own insights about the state of society and then listens attentively to students' feedback. The class is fun, but because the discussions are largely free-form and there's only one full-length journalistic piece (which never gets revised), it will never gain the reputation of classes such as Anne Fadiman's or Fred Strebeigh's. That being said, the book list is excellent, so if you want to read lots of great creative non-fiction, this class is a good option.",
    "Think of it as a Book Club, and your essays will be totally self-directed (which is something I love). If you're looking for a lot of structure or a lot of writing practice, then this isn't your thing. But if you want to think about ideas, writing, journalistic ethics and all kinds of fascinating concepts, then YES. Also great for senior year, felt kind of like I tied up my writing career at Yale with a lot of thought about writing.",
    "It wasn't a writing class so much as a reading class - a seminar about the particular readings on the syllabus, not about the journalism of ideas. I wouldn't recommend it unless he's changed the fundamental approach of the class. Otherwise, take it if the readings appeal. Also, the reading was way too heavy most weeks. Like multiple books, some of which we would only touch on for 10-20 minutes of class time."
