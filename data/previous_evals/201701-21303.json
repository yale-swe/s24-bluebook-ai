    "Developed a better understanding of Japanese literary traditions as well as better writing skills",
    "I learned how to think critically about an ancient text and ask myself important questions about how the narrative structure works in relation to its historical and literary context.",
    "I had never spent an entire class on one text before, and it was highly instructive to do so, especially with one so inexhaustible. It helped me to see a text from many angles (and formalize those visions in reading responses and three essays). This course also made me much more aware of problems of 'authorship' and the nuances of intertextuality. Lastly, the nature of the weekly responses encouraged me to be in dialogue with my peers even outside of the classroom, which was great."

   "comments": [
    "I feel like the class was small enough to have been structured more like a seminar. The professor gave us some opportunities to talk, but not a lot. I wouldn't have minded the lectures if I got a lot out of them, but they were often just summaries of the readings without a lot of analysis. He likes to point out certain passages that interest him, but he doesn't really analyze them. I also think the feedback on our essays could have been clearer in telling us what to change or do differently on our next papers. I also didn't find the writing exercises to be helpful. I don't think my writing improved at all over the course of the semester. Most of the comments concerned the content of our essays, even though this is a WR.",
    "Strengths: very thoroughly explored \"The Tale of Genji\" and its continued influence in Japanese culture, provided ample opportunity to better my analytical essay writing skills Weaknesses: frequent use of Japanese in class\/analysis of specific words' meanings in Japanese was intimidating for those that had no knowledge of the language--extra resources for those that had never taken Japanese language might be useful",
    "The class was made very interesting by the different backgrounds of a mix of graduate and undergraduate students. I think expanding the role of the student who leads the class discussions, or a similar measure, could enrich the conversations had in the course.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic. I felt that Prof. Kamens truly had a superb grasp of the text and was able to give insightful comments and lead engaging discussions for every class.",
    "I feel this course really did everything right: the syllabus was extremely well thought-out with perfectly relevant, rich supplementary materials; the lessons were just as carefully planned and exciting; the feedback on written work was extensive; and I've already mentioned the benefits weekly responses above. The only weakness I can think of -- and this might be the fault of my own misguided expectations about the class and not an actual 'weakness' -- is that the 'discussions' tended towards lectures. I don't really have a problem with this, as Professor Kamens has so many amazing things to say about the Tale, and I know he made an effort to include time for class discussion, but sometimes I felt I could use more of it."

   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course! It isn't interesting and Prof. Kamens dominates the class. Please don't take it, unless you are already very interested in East Asian literature.",
    "For me, The Tale of Genji has been on my to-read list for a long time, and this course was a great opportunity to actually check it off my list. I think it's an important work to read because of its prominence, but if you don't normally like to read, I don't think you would enjoy it.",
    "This class was slightly more challenging for someone with less experience reading Japanese literature but ultimately was rewarding. I would recommend this course to anyone with the slightest interest in \"The Tale of Genji\" willing to read the entire text.",
    "Professor Kamens is a fantastic instructor. The premise of the course is already fascinating; the excellent instruction and small scale of the class are icing on the cake. There is ample allowance for choosing one's own way of interpreting the text, leading to enjoyable papers\/projects.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in Japanese culture! It is truly a hidden gem of the EALL dept.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student -- I would just also recommend that they read a bit of Genji beforehand to see if they want to spend a semester on it."
