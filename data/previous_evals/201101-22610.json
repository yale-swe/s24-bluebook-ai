    "You have class and homework every day. There are three films, two books, and a number of short stories. There are tests every two weeks. Although there is a lot of work, your professor can make it seem manageable, and you will learn a lot of French.",
    "French 140 is the natural continuation from 130. You'll study some of WWII from a French perspective as well as reading a few other texts earlier in the semester. Similar course packet, similar small (maybe smaller) class format. Moderate amount of work. Great course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a follow up to 130 or for someone just starting French at Yale. It teaches you a lot, challenges you a bit and is not too stressful.",
    "I'd recommend taking L4 French, even if you don't need it for a language requirement. If you have a genuine interest in learning French and put in the effort, you'll see a huge improvement in your speaking and writing abilities.",
    "My French definitely improved in this course, and I like that it emphasized all aspects of the language: grammar, reading, and speaking. Its a lot of work, but it forces you to practice skills that are needed for the tests. I would say the course credits (1.5) are an accurate representation of the amount of time and effort put into this class.",
    "YEEEEESSS",
    "French 140 is a good amount of work, but it is a very fair, very fun class. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking to fill the language requirement or just get some experience with conversational and literary French. The professors are great and the material (especially some of the stories we read) is interesting. Your French will improve tremendously. Don't be alarmed by the amount of class time and work per week- take this class."
