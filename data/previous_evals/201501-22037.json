    "It doesn't hurt to have deadlines you end up producing at least a couple things that make you proud. However, I didn't find that our workshops were helpful or friendly or informative. This might be a reflection of our class rather than the professor, but we were always a little tense and mistrustful. I think prof. Cunningham can be a good resource if you're willing to reach out to him.",
    "A straightfoward fiction workshop with a gifted writer and a really great group of peers. Unfortunately -- and it's hard to say whose fault this is -- the course this year just didn't seem to work. The workshop magic never started, and discussion, especially at first, was stilted and terse. I think Michael Cunningham, in an effort to improve discussion, would step in and comment often -- but perhaps this only further impeded the organic flight of the conversation. Everyone writes two stories and a revision, which feels like the right amount. Three stories are workshopped each week, and everyone submits line edits and a critical note for the week's writers. MC sends you a long note and very dialed-in line edits on each story you write, and is energetic about offering to help with intermediate drafts before the deadline. He also makes himself available to meet especially after you've been workshopped. Again, great peers, but the discussion never took off. To MC, I would say be less involved in the discussion -- less contribution, more facilitation. If you take this course, make a point of getting drinks with the class, as this was a useful way of continuing the conversation."
