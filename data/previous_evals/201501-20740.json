   "comments": [
    "Yes. It really changed how I viewed the chemistry of biology.",
    "Good overview of current bioinorganic chemistry problems and techniques. I would recommend if they wanted practice giving proposals or wanted to learn about bioinorganic chemistry.",
    "Take it! Definitely a good way to cover a section of chemistry least touched on by other classes you'll probably take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for any student interested in inorganic spectroscopy and living systems and any student looking to get experience and useful feedback in developing proposals for original research.",
    "Bio-inorganic chemistry is a great elective to take if you want to learn more about the material that was covered in inorganic chemistry (Chem 252). The course is more heavily focused on inorganic chemistry than biochemistry, as most of the techniques you will learn about are from inorganic chemistry. There is a fair amount of work for this course, as you will need to read a paper and do a quiz for every class and there are two proposals. However, Professor Holland is very clear and fair on his expectations for the assignments. You will learn a lot from your fellow students in this course, because there is a discussion at the beginning of every class on the paper that was assigned. I would especially recommend this class if you are interested in pursuing graduate studies in chemistry or biology.",
    "The class covered bioinorganic chemistry, but focused more on inorganic. That being said, I am still not very clear on which techniques are appropriate for doing x, y, or z. I think the material could have been presented in a more organized fashion.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any other chemist, as it incorporated a variety of different subdisciplines in chemistry and would thus be interesting and useful to most students in the field.",
    "Very good class to take. Good pace, not overly difficult, yet has projects and tests for optimal learning. He blows traditional classroom techniques out of the water - very superior teaching style. Good, helpful projects as well"

   "comments": [
    "This class was very useful in illustrating what techniques and questions are at the cutting edge of bioinorganic chemistry.",
    "The proposals were hard, but they will help us so much when we have to do our antithesis. Also we had to read the literature a lot, which is super important. Not only did I learned more about bioinorganic chemistry, I am more prepared as a graduate student.",
    "The course was useful for getting feedback and experience in developing original research in chemistry",
    "The course showed me the hot topics in the field. I enjoyed the guest lectures by Professor Brudvig and Mayers and the seminar earlier in the semester. This course was helpful in showing me some of the techniques that were commonly employed.",
    "I was previously unfamiliar with inorganic chemistry. I think I've learned a few things, but I am also still confused on anything remotely inorganic related.",
    "This course helped to reinforce fundamentals in inorganic chemistry. It also introduced me to numerous techniques that may be helpful to use in my research.",
    "All the techniques covered in this class will be helpful for my PhD career."
