    "I feel so much better equipped to read and write cultural criticism (which covers so many genres, from personal essays to narrative journalism). Taking this course gave me the language to identify what makes good writing. We discuss very specific techniques and effects that writers achieve, which is so refreshing sometimes, writing classes can devolve into complimenting a piece of writing without getting into the specifics of why it works.",
    "I learned about the strength of cultural critique as a way of writing, and how to write my own. We read a tremendous number of incredibly fun, funny, moving, unique, provocative texts that I learned so much from and will definitely carry with me going forward. I also became a better peer-reviewer; we reviewed our classmates' essay drafts during the editing process (which was extremely helpful and fun!)."

    "The main strength of this course is Professor Shirkhani, who is so thoughtful and gives an incredible amount of feedback. She's also always willing to talk through papers (or even ideas for papers) I wish I had used office hours more throughout the semester. For certain classes, I think it could have been helpful to know which readings we would focus on most (Prof. Shirkhani did a good job of telling us what to look out for within specific essays, though), and I think it might have been cool to talk about the Klinkenborg readings a bit more. But those are minutiae far and away, a fantastic and well-developed course!",
    "Strengths: so many! Awesome overall structure to the class. We had readings due nearly every class period (the readings were really well cultivated) and we discussed them in depth. The class always flew by (Professor Shirkhani is amazing). I loved the small class size we had seminar style is so fun and effective for a class like this. I also felt like the amount of writing was definitely reasonable 3 essays, and a few exercises here and there. All were truly fun to write. Weaknesses: None!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. It will help you read more closely and pay attention to techniques that will bring your writing to a much more nuanced, oblique level (as opposed to just giving \"hot takes\" or falling into clichs). Professor Shirkhani is thoughtful, well-prepared, engaged, and gives the most thorough feedback on essays I've ever received in an English course. She also has mastered the art of guiding a seminar discussion it never felt too loose or unstructured.",
    "One million percent! Overall, extremely enjoyable to its core. The readings, the time spent together in class, the writing assignments. You will grow as a writer and really improve your own voice. Highly, highly recommend."
