    "Italian 150 is very different from Italian 110-140 in that there is not textbook, no tests, and no grammar. Instead, you grade is based on participation and weekly essays. I would definitely recommend it to others, given that it's a great way to actually put in use what you've learned in previous Italian courses! You become a more confident speaker and develop your writing. Keep in mind that the essays are graded more strictly than in L1-L4.",
    "YES! A great class, low-stress, and a great way to either maintain your language skills or improve them from L4. You read Italian books and watch movies, and discuss various subjects all semester. A definite yes!",
    "Great class if you're looking to refine your italian. Not too much work and easy to enjoy.",
    "Excellent L5 class. I entered this class thinking this would be the sort of gut language class that I was used to, but no. The workload here is not as light as you may think. Weekly essay assignments, dense reading and sometimes 6-hour film viewing. But it all paid off inthe end. My spoken and written Italian improved tremendously. This class is very well-rounded, covering both grammar and application. The weekly essays really helped improve my grammar and vocab, and in-class discussions honed my speaking skills. In short, I loved it and learned a great deal from this class.",
    "Yes. Best Italian class I've ever taken so far.",
    "This class is a great L5 course that covers a wide range of topics. The books we read in class (real Italian books!) are interesting and the movies greatly helped my comprehension. The essays each week were not too difficult, and there was no final, which was wonderful.",
    "A really good L5 Italian class, and Prof.ssa Sodi is wonderful. You'll write a tema and do corrections each week, read some fun novels, watch some great films (she also teaches a film class-she's great with films). It's a really great way to improve your Italian, and it will be more work than you think!"
