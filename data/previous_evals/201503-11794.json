    "Start early. Seriously, I did a good amount in the fall and I still feel a time crunch (since Economics senior essays are due right after spring break). I pity my suitemate, who basically has done nothing so far.",
    "Do it only if you're interested",
    "Individual semester research. A thesis is not needed for the Econ major, so don't recommend it at all..",
    "Great way for you to explore a niche interest in economics.",
    "Yes--Do TWO semester thesis, not one. It makes no sense to do it in one.",
    "A key part of the Economics experience at Yale - gives you a glimpse of what academic work in Economics is like, and makes you appreciate the importance of all that you've learned. Useful to have prior knowledge of econometrics.",
    "Yes if you like economics and have a topic that you want to pursue. If you are doing the economics major just because, then don't do the senior essay.",
    "Yes, if you have a topic you are passionate about researching.",
    "An opportunity to add something original (hopefully) to the economics literature. Absolutely recommend if you're looking to develop a whole set of new skills that be extremely useful to you in your career, no matter what career path you choose.",
    "Everyone should write a two semester thesis! It gives you time to collect and manipulate your data and also to put together a good project.",
    "If you want to write a thesis, then you're going to take this course, so this question is not relevant."
