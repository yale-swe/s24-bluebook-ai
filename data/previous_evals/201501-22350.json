    "Take this class if you can get in. Three speeches and one midterm. The readings are interesting and you will look forward to them, and they're also summarized every class by the speaker and Professor Hill, so not a problem if you don't get to it. TAKE IT, so great.",
    "Absolutely recommend to second semester seniors (no one else will get in). It's a very light workload, but incredibly helpful for both your own edification and your development as a public speaker. Yes, half the class thinks they will be president, but Hill really creates a community out of the students (you evaluate each other), and it's a lot of fun.",
    "this is the ultimate senior class. if you get in take it. It's mostly wise musings of Charlie Hill with some useful knowledge thrown in.",
    "Ostensibly a study of great orators throughout history...but in reality, an incredible class in how to be successful in the real world.",
    "Class where you read and give great speeches taught by a guy who wrote speeches for Kissinger.",
    "Good senior spring class",
    "A survey of great oratory throughout time with an emphasis on learning how to write and deliver our own speeches.",
    "If you get in, consider your Yale education a success",
    "Yes, if you get in take it!",
    "This is a really wonderful class. You will improve your speech making ability and learn a lot about politics and politicians. Its a classic senior spring seminar, and even if you disagree with Hill's politics, learning from professors that have different views than your own in a seminar setting is not an experience to be passed up.",
    "Amazing class, take it if you can. Learned a lot, opened my eyes to a new subject.",
    "A really interesting and unique course, definitely unlike anything else I've taken here. Mixes the very old with the very current in a really interesting way. The class is basically one third lectures from Prof Hill, one third speeches\/critiques from the students themselves, and one third discussion of current events (which is less discussion and more just students asking Hill questions). Workload is very light. By far the most enjoyable final exam I've taken. Definitely take the course!",
    "I would definitely recommend Oratory and Statecraft! You will learn a lot about how to make effective speeches and the role that oratory has played throughout history and in current events.",
    "Take the course - the reading is superb and the professor, one of the best."
