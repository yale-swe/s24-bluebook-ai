   "comments": [
    "This course taught students how points of view are shaped by an individual's culture and where they come from. I thought the class subjects were very interesting and the readings made me think more about how different opinions are formed. I felt this was an important topic to discuss, especially when it comes to the environmental field and different beliefs regarding climate change and other related controversial topics.",
    "I developed the ability to view conservation and its history more critically. The course really expected students to deeply engage with high volumes of reading and to be able to apply the readings to environmental issues centered largely around the American West and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. I learned the importance and examined the intricacies of the underlying ways of thinking behind different groups of people.",
    "I gained a general understanding of theoretical framings of environmental projects. I found our discussions around power to be extremely valuable in thinking about how to approach environmental issues and deciding on future work opportunities. The readings on science miscommunication and truth were useful in other classes and the insight I've gained will be a foundation for thinking about strategic communication.",
    "Learned new concepts, frameworks, and language to speak and think about power and morality in debates about policy and science.",
    "I am a public health student, so understanding an environmental approach to navigating social\/cultural issues surrounding EJ issues was extremely interesting and valuable for my future work.",
    "I gained knowledge about the social dynamics surrounding environmental issues. Especially, these were: structure and relationships of power; the role of morality as a driver and as a mediation tool; an exploration of moral relativism and how it relates to environmental moral framing; the role of societal and moral influences upon the scientific process; and an introduction to environmental justice.",
    "Learned how to critically evaluate certain concepts in social science related to environmental justice and typical environmental issues.",
    "Our discussion of the major intersections of environmental challenges was informative, insightful, and very appropriate for the areas the course aimed to address.",
    "Developed robust frameworks for understanding social\/environmental conflicts. I find myself using the frameworks developed in this class to filter nearly all of the information I'm receiving at FES.",
    "This class should be mandatory for all FES students. It is an incredible intro to social scientific modes of studying the environment. I am an undergrad in EVST, and wish I had taken this class earlier on in my career. The course content was very critical of environmentalism in general, tracing its roots to white supremacist and settler colonial ideologies. We got to read some really key texts from critical science studies (social constructivist analyses, feminist analyses) and we got a reasonable introduction to scholarship on environmental justice. I would recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in studying environments\/place because it provides a really strong social scientific foundation that might be very new to people who have studied in more traditional environmental sciences departments.",
    "Many new ways to critically think about situations in the world around us and engage with the material in new ways. I learned a lot of new social science approaches and ideas that have shaped how I view world problems.",
    "This course was a great survey of the field of environmental sociology. I learned so much about the relationship between people and the environment. I especially liked learning about the critiques of science. I thought it was really interesting to learn about how morality, power, science, conflict, social issues, and structural problems are related to the field of environmentalism.",
    "I gained critical thinking skills to better evaluate the dynamics present in complex environmental issues. I will take away insights about the complex social dynamics and moral convictions that underlie complex environmental and political situations.",
    "I gained a much clearer understanding of various philosophical and social science concepts and theories, and as a result, I am more capable of articulating the interconnections among concepts, current events, and other real world issues. The knowledge I gained in this class has enhanced my analysis of environmental issues and allows me to view issues from multiple angles.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the social dimensions that are important to consider when making environmental management or policy decisions.",
    "- Understanding of Settler Colonialism - Constructions of Power - Framing of Morality - How the wealthy conceive of the environment - The questions we should be asking about our environmental future.",
    "I learned about the perspectives of people from different parts of the country and from different social classes on environmental issues.",
    "Grounding in environmental sociological theories, frameworks, and philosophy; how peoples moral frameworks (usually unconsciously) shape how they relate to the environment; how power structures relating to natural resources are created and maintained, especially as they related to our studies of minsinformation, the ultrawealthy, settler colonialism and white supremacy.",
    "It was incredibly insightful to learn more about the moral, political, and economic relationships that comprise our understanding of the ecological or \"natural\" world. As well, the work regarding tracing disinformation campaigns is something that should be made into a focus itself at the school.",
    "I learned a ton about how debates about the environment actually work, and how nothing good will come of any of this.",
    "Deeper understanding of environmental justice research and applications in the United States",
    "- critical thinking about race and the environment - problem solving around crises of the environment and roadblocks to success - frameworks for thinking about new problems - a new insight to indigenous rights on the landscape in the US and around the world - an intimacy and shared experience with my classmates and community that I would not have otherwise developed in a class that was in depth, personal, and discussion based",
    "This class really opened my mind to broader concepts of environmentalism and issues in environmentalism. Gave me the vocabulary to articulate problems in our field as well as think critically about management decisions.",
    "This course provided me with the opportunity to interpret my own morals, worldview, and motivations more deeply and exposed me to a lot of content that pushed my own self growth. I was also very impressed with the peer-peer discussion this course generated and found the course discussions offered endless diversity of opinions that made me reevaluate my own.",
    "I learned a lot on several topics, including the history of the environmental justice movement, the impacts of white supremacism and colonialism on the development of national parks and our conception of wilderness, moral psychology, and the American West.",
    "The readings were great. The syllabus alone is worth a ton in terms of the content."

   "comments": [
    "I think the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class came pretty close to my expectations, if not exceed them. I have not taken a lot of sociology classes prior to this, so I have little to compare it to, but I feel this class offered me the knowledge and insights I was hoping to gain in terms of different moralities and beliefs regarding the environment.",
    "I certainly dived deeper into the topics and took a more critical lens then I expected at the onset of the class. The class ended up being a bit more theoretical and philosophical than I anticipated, and I think it could centered around more case studies and real world examples. I appreciated the depth with which we examined Justin's research in the American West and I am extremely interested in the West as a case study.",
    "I had high expectations for this course and I'd say they were met in terms of the selected readings, lectures and class discussion. I didn't anticipate such a large amount of time being spent on group presentations, which did not always seem necessary\/most beneficial to digging deeper into the themes.",
    "The course had a stronger focus on morality and to a certain extent philosophy than I expected, but I really appreciated that.",
    "Exceeded my expectations",
    "Went above my expectations.",
    "I honestly didn't know what to expect. A large part of why I was in this course was to fulfill a core requirement for my previous ELCM specialization in the MEM program. It has completely blown me away with how positive I believe it has impacted me, and will continue to shape the way I think about and approach problems in a more complex and complete manner.",
    "They were not necessarily what I expected to be learning looking at the course description, but I am happy with the skills that I learned and insights that were gained.",
    "The course covered major issues at the intersection of environment, morality, and politics, and so was exactly what I had hoped for.",
    "Exceeded my expectations. I had some initial concern that the course material was too broad and that we wouldn't dig into the particularities of any one issue enough to achieve a depth of learning. Very wrong about this, and this had to do with the course structure.",
    "Great! Justin was extremely clear since day 1 about what the expectations were for the class and about what we could expect to get out of the course if we did all the work. He is an organized teacher who set clear expectations for his students.",
    "I didn't know what to expect from the class since the title is so broad, but I did feel like I learned a considerable amount from the course.",
    "This aligned with my expectations because the syllabus was very clear.",
    "This class aligned with my expectations.",
    "I got what I wanted out of this class and it definitely met my expectations. I would have liked to hear Justin Farrell lecture more, not necessarily in terms of taking up large amounts of class time, but at least more consistently throughout the semester. e.g., at least 10 minutes of his thoughts on that week's concepts",
    "Surpassed my expectations",
    "A lot of the material was new to me, so I didn't know what to expect. The organization of the curriculum was great and very helpful in guiding how to approach the material.",
    "It exceeded my expectations by far - I didnt really know what to expect, but this was one of my favorite classes so far at FES and has reshaped a lot of how I think about how people use and relate to the environment.",
    "Wonderfully.",
    "They roughly met my expectations, which were high to begin with.",
    "Well aligned",
    "They exceeded expectations. This course has shaped the way that I will go forward in land preservation and has helped me personally in my quest to find what is 'right' and 'good' for me.",
    "Very well",
    "My expectations were far surpassed in the content covered and the discussions. I heard less from Justin than I was hoping for though. I would have liked to have more lectures where we heard his opinion on these topics or how the works we were reading fit into a broader context of thinking but I suppose there was value to its structure.",
    "The knowledge I gained in this class aligned with what I expected, although I thought I would be writing more in this class. I think it's a shame that instead of papers, we had written exams."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the strengths include the diversity of the readings. The reading load each week was pretty heavy, but I found a lot of the topics to be very interesting. I also thought having students summarize the readings each week was pretty helpful when it came time for exams. Some students may have preferred a final paper to the two exams and final project, but I did not mind the exams and project. One of the weaknesses of the class was that I wished we had spoken more explicitly about how we could take what we learned in class and apply it to the real world. This was something that came up in class several times with students. I feel that there was a missed opportunity to talk more about how to avoid conflict with others who have different morals, so that solutions can be reached between different groups of people.",
    "The readings and class discussions were a great strength of the course. Other opinions and insights from students helped to expand my thinking. However, the class was pretty big to facilitate a flowing and coherent discussion. It could be a bit challenging to speak on a topic in such a large group setting, and often the conversation would change so dynamically that my point would be lost. I think the class would have benefitted from being a little smaller. Or perhaps we could have allotted more time to the smaller groups. I think the reading responses tended to be a bit tedious. I appreciate the summary aspect as it provided an opportunity to overview some of the concepts, which were useful to revisit in preparation for the exams. However, it was unnecessary for the student led discussions to present and summarize the readings. This felt duplicative. I think the class would have benefited from less student led presentations and more lecture based content on readings or case studies from Justin. I really liked Paul's presentation of his research in the Great Basin.",
    "I think that this was a very long class (3 hours) in which almost all of the time was about students participating and giving their opinions. I would have liked listening to the professor more, there were classes when the teacher never spoke. I think that engaging students in discussion is an important part of the adequate development of a course, but the professor have years of experience and knowledge that has to be imparted and that we want to listen.",
    "This class was my favorite so far, because the weekly modules always managed to nudge my thinking toward how a critical take can create actual opportunities for improvement. I think it's easy to get stuck in identifying the challenges, but the critical theories (especially the first week's readings, Bell, Smith, Jasanoff and Kosek) helped think about what is really at stake in environmental work. Professor Farrell's lectures were a highlight, because his work presented clear case studies for the class themes. Class discussion, especially our small-group discussions were awesome and crucial for unpacking some of the texts. I found the biggest weakness to be the amount of class time spent on group presentations. I also found myself wondering why we read so much Haidt.",
    "I loved the readings, and I think we had some interesting in-class discussions. I think we lost some valuable time on group presentations that just summarized the readings. I also felt like Justin's presentations\/lectures ended up being a little bit rushed because the student presentations went long.",
    "extremely strong discussion, some of the best I've had in my undergrad and graduate career",
    "I appreciate and understand the initiative to foster student participation and learning, but I wish the group presentations were shorter and there was more time for the professor or TAs to lecture. Reducing the class size would potentially help mitigate the amount of time the class presentations took. Breaking into small groups was a good idea to garner more student participation but the mobilizing and moving of bodies took up a lot of time as well. Overall, I think the readings and content of the course are fascinating. During class time itself, I got the most out of the lectures from the TAs and professor, as well as the discussions that took place. Personally, I would deemphasize that amount of time student lead presentations take.",
    "For me, the greatest strength was the readings. They were challenging and demanding, but they were incredibly rich and rewarding if you took the time to engage with them. Secondly, I thought all of the lectures were incredibly rich and informative as well. The only weakness I could identify would be that some people did not seem to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings in the class discussion. This was not an issue for myself, but I felt the class conversations were usually dominated by only about a dozen voices, rather than the full 35-odd people who could've been contributing.",
    "The strengths of this course were definitely the student discussions that took place. Because the class was three hours, it allowed ample time for students to discuss in detail their thoughts, experiences, etc. about a particular topic which led into other useful insights. I wish that Justin had taught a little bit more\/shared his opinion because I felt that although student discussions were valuable, they were conversations I could have with my peers outside of class and during class, I'd instead want to learn how Justin felt\/framed issues he was assigning us to discuss and read.",
    "Strengths: content, instructor, the engagement it warrants from the class Weaknesses: class size and so lack of individual attention, although even this worked out well",
    "Strengths of the class included first the breadth of knowledge, insight, and experience of the student body. Students brought so much energy and critical thought to this class, and I loved it. Justin selected excellent readings as well; I really liked having some texts (such as Justin's two books) run through the entirety of the course, supplemented with one-off pieces that stood powerfully alone. Because the class was so full and so rich it's hard to call this a weakness, but I did sometimes find myself wishing that Justin played a bigger role in the course. I think I speak for other students in saying that Justin's career and his research is super fascinating, and represents a tract that many of us have an interest in, so I would have like to hear more from him.",
    "I would incorporate even further scholarship from indigenous studies and by nonwhite authors. I think this class began to touch on issues of race\/racism within environmentalism, but could have gone much deeper. Also queer ecology!!! Seems sort of like the only other branch of radical environmental critique that we didn't get to explore for the class.",
    "The strengths are the analysis of the readings in the group discussions. However, I would have appreciated more lectures from Justin concerning more of the material, not just on the parts from his research, although that was interesting. I feel like the course was too discussion heavy and not enough information \/ lecture heavy. I also know that a guest speaker was supposed to be there but course scheduling didn't allow that to happen, so I would have liked to see that another time, or more guest lectures in general. I also think the final project was too broad in scope for the time limit and course, which made it difficult to adequately put it together.",
    "I thought the course was very well organized and I learned a lot. I thought the discussions were meaningful, the lectures were interesting, and the readings were eye-opening. The workload was fair, however, the reading responses took a significant amount of time but they really helped in studying for the exams.",
    "This course was awesome! The readings were fascinating and the class discussions were insightful and productive. The last few sessions of the course felt a bit thrown together thematically, so more clarity towards the end could be helpful.",
    "While hefty at times, the selected weekly readings were intellectually challenging (in a good way). While group discussions were a good way to share ideas among classmates, I think it would be interesting if all of the news stories that people linked to in their reading responses were shared in a list each week (names removed). Sometimes there might be a story that I was really interested in myself but it felt tangential\/unrelated to the topics that actually ended up being discussed.",
    "There is a heavy reading load that takes up a lot of the student's time and most questions were barely addressed during class discussion. I believe that for the amount of time a student puts into this class it would be appropriate for the professor and TAs to give feedback on summaries or questions prepared for class. I think this class is important, however, it just needs to be better organized.",
    "- More assigned reading from the political right to illustrate some of the framing around morality, environmental values, climate change. Most often we learned about these perspectives through academic papers that would say \"this is how the counternarrative is formed\" but we seldom read the counternarrative directly.",
    "Strength: The readings were informative and spaced well. The momentum of the class was great. I enjoyed our field trip to the Beinecke because it was a way of applying some course material, though it was not directly related. Weakness: The class structure sometimes felt too free-form. I usually got more out of the readings than the class. Maybe the discussions can be re-constructed in a way that is more effective, or there can be a discussion section for the class to allow for that time.",
    "Maybe just that the class was a little large, but the discussions were still great and everyone had so many thoughtful contributions from different backgrounds that I wouldnt have wanted anyone to be forced to drop it.",
    "The course was a little big as it was deemed a core class for one of the concentrations, fortunately there wasn't an issue as everyone in the class was committed to respectful and insightful pursuit of the subject matter. If anything there was barely anytime for the Professor to answer questions the student discussion was so lively. More coverage of disinformation campaigns would be a welcome addition.",
    "My only suggestion would be asking Justin to lecture on some more complicated subjects, like social constructivism, rather than letting topics be hashed out by student presenters.",
    "Feedback on reading assignments would be nice, and sometimes the discussion (which was always excellent!) would lose a bit of focus or drag on into lecture time.",
    "- strengths: critical thinking, readings that aligned with a theme that were pointed toward learnings, bridges between discussion, lecture, reading work, and group work. Level of personal connection and honesty from professor Farrell as well as teaching fellows. The group of people within the class: a diversity from across several Yale schools and Yale college. weaknesses: class size: I would have like a class that were about 10 people fewer. I believe that there were ~35 participants, and I would have liked about 20-25, I do think, that a large size was overall helpful to get diversity within the class. This might be challenging going forward as a core class of a specialization. Perhaps there could be two sections? Perhaps there could be overall more opportunity for other 'similar' classes that are both equally available within the specialization core that would yield similar results. (e.g. Environment, Politics, Morality and Culture & Integrative Anthropology in the Environment - two separate classes that achieve similar results with different professors) (number 6 below I believe is a result of the large class size - otherwise would be able to be highly agree - also with no.6 in a positive way feedback often came through other students agreeing or disagreeing with my own opinions)",
    "Readings were excellent. Class size too large. Discussions need to be facilitated in smaller and consistent groups (12-15). Weekly writing assignments should be more about synthesis rather than summary. Would like to see more of Justin's lectures rather than student presentations.",
    "I think one weakness was in the student presentations. They were often just summaries of the reading which we all did and didn't offer much additional value. The discussions we had afterwards were so stimulating though, it was often a shame that they had to be cut short. I think altering or substituting the student presentation component to something with more structure would be good. I would have liked to have had more of a writing component to this course as well to help synthesize many of my thoughts. I also think keeping a course journal would have been good.",
    "This was a great class. The reading list was excellent, and I found the class discussions to be interesting and thought-provoking. I was exposed to a lot of things that I had never read\/heard before, and I think that it will give me a very good foundation for the rest of my time at FES. I was really glad to have the opportunity to read from Justin's upcoming book. Given that many of the topics covered could elicit some very personal reactions (e.g., moral relativism), I think it's a shame that there wasn't more time to explore these, either in written assignments or in smaller group discussions. I think that the reading reactions were an effective way to ensure that students read the materials, but I was disappointed that our discussion questions were rarely used. The class enrollment should probably have been limited to a smaller size. This would have allowed us to do papers instead of exams, which I think would have been more appropriate for the course content, and would have helped my learning more. I think there was a sense among many students that the large group discussions started to lose direction and focus because of the large class size and the limited intervention from the instructor. While we did have smaller groups, we often didn't end up meeting with them, largely because of time management issues, and when we did meet, the groups were still a bit too large to be intimate. Time management was not a strength of this class. The student presentations\/discussions were not held to their time limit, the small groups often didn't end up meeting, and the professor rarely ended up lecturing.",
    "Full-class discussions with a class of this size were not very satisfying in terms of depth of engagement. The format (lack of papers) also limited deeper personal engagement or personal feedback. Small discussion groups were still too large, and met too infrequently to form any kind of bond or engagement over time. I did not find the written exams or the final project stimulating and was disappointed to lose a day of class discussion\/lecture to them. I would also have preferred less time given to students reciting the content of the reading we had all done and more time instead with faculty lecture or engagement with the content via discussion, engagement with case studies, or group discussion of the questions we submitted online. Since so many reading responses and questions were required each week, we put a lot of time and energy into those, and it felt like somewhat wasted energy since those questions were never turned into class discussions."

    "Take a proactive approach to doing the readings and summaries. Use the summaries as an opportunity to outline the readings for future review.

    "Be prepared to read closely and you will gain an understanding of very complex concepts.",
    "Be ready to do a lot of reading - the class is only rewarding if you have done the reading, which does take time but is worth it.",
    "Take it!!!! Everyone should take this class. It might bring everything you thought about environmentalism crumbling to the ground, but that's so important! And together with your fellow classmates you can begin to build it back up, this time knowing the truths about what environmentalism stood for in the past (and how it continues to function as a racialized and classed ideology now). The texts we read are foundational -- I think no environmental education would be complete without them. Also, you will just learn so much from your classmates because the readings demand personal reflection, intense critique of the field, and some difficult conversations arose out of that. The classroom environment becomes a place to ask honest and scary questions and have the support of your colleagues as you begin to deconstruct some of the problematic things we've learned in the environmental science fields.",
