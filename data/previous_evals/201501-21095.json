    "Great course! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a firm foundation in the history of science or intellectual history.",

    "Thanks for a great course! I really enjoyed our additional graduate student meetings and thought that giving feedback on each others' papers was a really helpful exercise. I didn't like Bruce Moran's Distilling Alchemy (in my opinion it doesn't do anything particularly well, and the content was totally unmemorable), but the other texts were great and provided an excellent foundation for thinking about the history of science."
