    "This course not only increased my abilities to read and understand literary Chinese, but also offered an engaging introduction to the difficulties of studying ancient texts beyond the superficial language levels (i.e. in evaluation of editions and textual transmissions).",
    "This course was a great overview of many different types of ancient Chinese literature as well as techniques in translation. I learned a lot about grammar, vocabulary, and style, as well as historical perspective.",
    "More familiarity with reading and translating Classical Chinese, tools for looking up and translating texts independently."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: gave a useful survey of a variety of texts across several centuries Weaknesses: sometimes dragged a little in term of in-class pacing; homework levels tended to fluctuate quite a bit as well",
    "I really liked the breadth of texts that we read and translated. One thing I do wish is that we'd been a little more on schedule and went through in detail each line of translation rather than tending to rush through them towards the end of class. But otherwise it was a great course!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in pursuing studies in literary Chinese because it offers a more worldly and comprehensive understanding of ancient Chinese textual studies than the first semester (which focuses primarily on the language) does.",
    "Yes! The literature you read is fascinating, and it's exciting to get to learn how to translate classical Chinese texts while learning about their historical and philosophical contexts.",
    "A good continuation to CHNS 170 so that you get even more practice with a wider range of texts, from Confucius to Mencius to Zhuangzi to poetry (which can be pretty hard). Less emphasis on grammar than before, because you should already know it fairly well. By the time you finish this course, you should have the knowledge, skills and resources to begin translating Classical Chinese texts independently.",
    "Infinitely better taught than part I of Literary Chinese. The hard work pays off. Thank you, Professor Lin! Feedback was always meticulous and helpful."
