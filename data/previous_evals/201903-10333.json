    "This course allowed me to strengthen my reading and comprehension skills via the weekly reading responses online and also proved crucial in better gauging what academic conversations are unfolding within the field of American Studies. Most importantly, the course created a comfortable environment in which cohort members could engage with one another's work but also get to know one another as peers in this program."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the opportunity to meet and get to know various faculty across the program. However, I think American Scholars can benefit from being a more intentional \"professionalization\" seminar, where we might take time to learn about various aspects of the program--like funding sources, advising, etc. We could perhaps meet with faculty members for one hour and spend the remaining hour of each week's meeting on a particular theme. Additionally, while the writing requirement was helpful for my project, I do not think it is entirely necessary for American Scholars. Not having a writing requirement would open up space to take a third seminar that might be more directly related to our interests without feeling like we are over-committing in the first semester.",
    "I enjoyed the course's weekly structure and guest visits but wished there had been more opportunities to speak to the guests one-on-one beyond the individual interviews. Moreover, it might be useful to also dedicate weeks or segments of each discussion session for discussions around academic professionalization (e.g., approaching professors, funding, conferences, etc.)."
