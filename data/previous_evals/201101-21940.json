    "If you want to get better at Greek, this is a must take class. You will learn a lot. And reading plato is actually very rewarding.",
    "If you're seriously interested in learning Ancient Greek, I would definitely recommend it as the best bridge from Hansen and Quinn to actual texts. I do not recommendskipping ahead at all - there is simply so much grammar and vocab to learn, and while it is possible to som extent to \"fake it\" through more advanced texts, you will ultimately be doing yourself a disservice.",
    "A solid L2 Greek class. You will read most or all of Plato's apology. Expect quite a bit of homework per night.",
    "This course is significantly harder and more time-consuming than Greek 110a. Success requires a significant committment of time, every night.",
    "It's more Greek... Definitely helps strengthen reading comprehension skills. Its a good foundation, and I would recommend it if you're at all interested in continuing with Greek.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was quite helpful in transferring the basics of Greek grammar into actual reading of an ancient text.",
    "After a very enjoyable Intro to Ancient Greek Course, I was very disappointed in Ancient Greek 120. I did not end up learning much of anything, as the class was devoted mostly to memorization. We did not review grammar topics very thoroughly or in a manner that made much sense, and I actually forgot a lot of what I had learned during the first semester. based on other language courses I had taken at Yale, I was expecting a review of pretty much all the grammar we had studied before to reinforce our understanding. This did not happen and I got very little from the class."
