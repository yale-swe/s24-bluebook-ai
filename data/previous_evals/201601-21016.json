    "It's a continuation of RUSS 150 that will continue to improve your grammar but won't really help your vocabulary or speaking.",
    "For students who wish to continue Russian language study, this class will move you up from intermediate to advanced level. The course is a lot of work, but it will be worth it because of the solidified grammar and vocabulary that you will learn.",
    "RUSS 151, like RUSS 150, centers historical texts and uses them to teach grammar and vocabulary. There is an emphasis not only on wrote memorization of these language concepts, but also reading fluency and writing proficiency.",
    "This is not an easy class, but necessary in continuing Russian. Take this class with Professor Muravnik!"
