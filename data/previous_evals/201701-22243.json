    "I wish we received more specific feedback after our presentations about what we could improve upon. I also would really appreciate NOT having this course so late in the afternoon. It was at the same time as all of the bioethics talks, and so I never got to go to any of them. Also, as it is one of the only days that the med school gives us the afternoon off, it is much easier to be productive if we have bigger chunks of time (i.e. have the class right after lung instead of later in the afternoon). As for strengths, I enjoyed working with faculty mentors to present their work, though some were certainly not as helpful as others. I think when the research mentors are chosen, they should be given a clear idea of what is expected of them, because many did not seem to know. I also would have liked the attendance policy to be made more clear for this course."
