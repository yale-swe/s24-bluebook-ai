    "We learned about how robots work, what architectures can be used to control them, and my favorite: how to make robots learn to do something! (not including genetic algorithms, those are for chumps).",
    "This class was a fantastic introduction to robotics. It covered different architectures in a way that highlighted how the field progressed. It also got us to work with and code up our own simulations. Those were very instructive.",
    "I learned a very high-level overview of robotics and AI.",
    "I learned a lot about the field of robotics, and how it intersects with the fields of psychology and cognitive science.",
    "I learned so many things about robotics: how to approach robot intelligence, why robotics and AI are so different, how to actually make a good robot controller, etc...",
    "Learned about the current state of robotic design and the different approaches to designing intelligent robots.",
    "A general overview of types of intelligent robots and the history of intelligent robots. Understanding of high-level design and concepts (Detailed implementation not covered)",
    "Pretty broad survey class, but I think I have a pretty strong understanding of both the history and current trends in robotics. I also have a deeper understanding of the concepts we explored in the problem sets - so certain architectures, genetic algorithms, q-learning.",
    "Little to none, some sections were useful but most powerpoints (which were the class's material) were way over everyone's head, so I barely got anything out of them",
    "The history of robotics, how to design robot architectures (both building and evolving robots), what information and knowledge we consider when designing and building robots, why we care about intelligence, why we care about robots, why we car about social robots",
    "This was a good survey course of the history of robotics and possible areas of future exploration in the field. I developed insights into how far we've come in the field of robotics and how far we have to go.",
    "Great introduction to robotics and very interdisciplinary-- you learn about engineering, computer science, cognitive science, and psychology interspersed with bits of biology and math. Basically, you learn a lot about the field of robotics in general, without much depth.",
    "This course allowed me to learn much more about the history of robots, how they work, and different algorithms used to achieve different effects within robots.",
    "Awesome survey course of the robotics landscape, mainly from the control and \"intelligence\" part of robotics (less so the physical part). Topics include genetics algorithms, reactive vs deliberative controls systems, basic machine learning, and practical applications!",
    "Interesting combination of psychology, computer science theory, and robotics. Learned about the history\/progression of robotics and AI as well as great survey of new frontiers.",
    "Learned about the history and different methods of robot behavior with many real-world examples.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of AI and robotics, like the paradigm shift from classical AI to behavior-based systems, and the subsequent hybridization of the two, which gave a lot of insight into the state of the field (the history of ideas is important, otherwise we might repeat old mistakes!) Also some technical understanding of behavior based systems, learning algorithms, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures are interesting and well-related to systems that seem relevant and actually existent. The Webots assignments were interesting. However, the work for the course was very backloaded, and some of the assessments (hw and tests) were confusing in terms of expectations.",
    "Scaz did a great job making robotics accessible, without dumping down on the engineering that goes behind it.",
    "Could be moved to later in the day so I would go to lecture more often. Some lectures had tons of material (machine learning, PID), while others had none (humanoids, social systems). All were made interesting and felt worthwhile, however. Problem sets were graded based on arbitrary design decisions which were not in the specification.",
    "Interesting topic but the lectures can be a bit dry. The homeworks do a good job teaching the material but especially the ones later in the term are very frustrating. A hodgepodge of topics",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course is how well it surveys so much different material and makes it so accessible.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and fun to go to. I think the final and midterm should be structured differently so that half of the questions are not about remembering certain little things. Maybe have a project using webots or just increasing the weight of homework and amount of it.",
    "The professor is a very good lecturer, and the slideshows always feel like an extremely well put together presentation. I felt some things were learned were somewhat insignificant. For instance, we spent a lecture looking at robots attempting to express moods. I didn't really learn too much about this topic except that robots were pretty bad at it, except maybe cartoon-like robots could passably represent different moods, but I don't feel like that's worth 30 minutes of watching robots make faces. A lot of the course consisted of watching robots do various things, and while I agree it's important to see, I think we saw too much of the same stuff. Watching robots playing soccer might serve a point, but it doesn't need to last 5 minutes to make that point. It is entertaining though. The midterm tested us on the content of guest lectures we had when the professor had to be away. This was 20% of the test if I remember correctly, and it was totally fair since he told us those lectures would be fair game for the midterm and we're expected to go to class, but I don't think those lectures or the content tested involved information worth knowing. It was more like X person is working on a robot that does Y. There was extremely little about how the robot worked in terms of design. It felt like learning specific useless facts without concepts. So, I don't think those lectures were very educational, and putting them on the midterm was completely fair, but they were bad questions only slightly related to robotics. Another weakness is that the first two psets were unclear given the spec and what was said in lecture, so going to office hours was necessary. However, everybody went since they were confused and the one TF had trouble helping everybody in the given time. Another pset took many people over 12 hours (some up to 30), but the majority of that time was spent literally doing guess and check on certain values and waiting for a 2-5 minute simulation to run. There was little learning involved. Apparently the point of the pset was to show that the method we had to use was a bad method. RIP free time. No re.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, Scaz is a wonderful lecturer Weaknesses: Maybe too broad of an overview, especially in the second half of the semester it felt like we were developing a very shallow understanding of a really wide range of topics",
    "This class was the most frustrating course I have ever taken (and I speak as a CS major done with core requirements). From the first problem set, grading seemed completely arbitrary, with mistakes and overlooks resulting to unfair assessment; when pointing out those errors to Sarah, she'd just make me feel bad for \"complaining about my grade\" and give me 1 point back just to make me feel like I'm only going after the grade. I spent significantly more time and energy on the psets than many friends in the class and still got equivalent or lower grades than them. I studied hard for the midterm and guess what, 10% was about guest lectures, which is ridiculous. At that point in the semester I realized it really was not worth it trying to understand the big and interesting concepts in the class because the exams basically tested class attendance and I could not do above average on the problem sets no matter how many hours I spent on them. I was really disappointed by this class, especially because I know and like Scaz a lot. I hope that in the future the grading becomes more fair, the exams actually test knowledge, and the graders become open to recognizing their own grading mistakes...",
    "This was a strong course. I wish we could have done more with the webots simulator. It would have been more beneficial to my learning to do a final project in webots instead of a final exam.",
    "This course is very broad and not as deep-- this is both a strength and a weakness, depending on what you are looking for. Probably the best part of the course is Scaz's lectures-- he's a really engaging lecturer, and the lectures are full of fun videos and information so definitely go to class. The biggest weakness was probably the problem sets-- they were pretty confusing, and sometimes even the TA didn't know the answers at office hours.",
    "Strengths: Great lectures and very engaging psets. Webots is a great software to learn about robots. Weaknesses: Some lectures were more related to biology than robotics and I thought we spent more time than we should on them",
    "Lectures were engaging and well designed. Webots platform was frustrating at times, but TA support was awesome so that worked out OK. Would have been cool to have some problem sets on a few more of the concepts presented in class, such as swarm coordination.",
    "Lectures are really interesting and engaging. Problem sets were tedious and frustrating at times. The requirements weren't extremely clear, but the grading reflected very specific expectations.",
    "Very interesting material that rekindled my interest in robotics. Some very good and some frustrating problem sets. The later ones had us implement genetic algorithms and machine learning which was very fun. Scaz is a good lecturer with nice visual aids. Guest lectures felt like filler.",
    "I'd personally have preferred more technical depth in the material covered, especially in the earlier parts of the course, but I guess that as a survey course that might be a little hard. The lectures were very engagingly delivered, in a way that effectively communicated important ideas and concepts rather than encouraging rote memorization."

    "If you're looking for a good CS elective that isn't a 4.99 workload, definitely recommend this class! Unless you plan to continue with robotics, however, I'm not sure how applicable some of the modules (except perhaps the ones on machine learning at the end and genetic algorithms) would be.",
    "Fantastic introduction to robotics. Scaz is a great lecturer and his class really helps you grasp the big concepts and principles, while having you dive into some of the implementation details with the problem sets.",
    "One of the very few good CS electives! Take it!",
    "The class is pretty chill up until the midterm and problem set 3, when you will get slammed and have no idea what's going on. Problem set 3, which was over Thanksgiving, took me roughly 30 hours to complete and was the most miserable CS experience I've ever had (even after 223 and 323!).",
    "This is a social science class. Involves much history of robotics with a few insights into actually building robots. Problem sets are stupidly easy, but graded based on design decisions which are not specified. Lectures vary from intense machine learning to no-content lectures about social robotics and humanoids. Scaz is really nice and enthusiastic and a good lecturer.",
    "Not really, better than some other CS electives but if you don't need the credit I think there are better classes. It has an interesting topics but dove in too deeply into some things, especially low level robotics things than I really cared about.",
    "Yes. Scaz is a great professor, lecturer and guy. He's excited about the material and wants the students to be also. it's also just a really interesting field and a good opportunity to see what they're doing in Scaz Lab and potential to get involved.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to understand robotics! There is not a lot of homework, and the homework isn't very hard. Take this class for the lectures, because Scaz is a brilliant lecturer! Even though there isn't a hands on component (though some of the homeworks use a pretty cool 3d robot simulator), note that you need to take this class in order to take the Robotics Lab.",
    "I think this is fun CS elective, but is more like psychology than CS.",
    "This is not a hard class conceptually, although it may be hard to get a good grade on some of the assignments despite understanding lecture since the spec can be unclear and how to actually design some things were not really covered in lecture (we just looked at examples, but didn't talk about how to design yourself), so that could be hard. I would take this class if you're looking for a 5th or 6th class that's not too hard or too much work, but is interesting.",
    "Yeah! This was a fun CS elective with some really interesting content that had me thinking",
    "Do NOT take this class. It is frustrating, grading is arbitrary, and exams are unfair.",
    "The lectures are enjoyable and often fun, but be warned that you do not learn much in this course. Almost no work (outside of showing up at lecture) until the last two psets . Do not buy any of the textbooks - the lectures contain all the necessary material.",
    "A great class! Scaz is also just a wonderful professor who you want to learn from. Lecture is always interesting and he makes the information easy to understand and retain. A couple more involved psets but generally an easy and enjoyable class. More of a cognitive science class.",
    "The first half of this course is a history of robotics, and the second half is mostly standalone lectures describing an area of robotics that could each be its own course. There are two written homeworks and three coding ones that follow. The midterm and final are pretty straightforward if you come to class and study the lecture notes. It's an interesting class. Scaz is a great lecturer and you won't find yourself bored. You'll learn a lot and the coding projects are actually pretty fun. Don't worry if you're a non-major. There are no heavy computer science concepts taught in this class.",
    "Take it! It's not offered very often, and it's a course full of interesting material. Scaz is a great lecturer and you learn so much, even if not in a lot of depth so I think it's a great, interesting, and not-too-programming-intensive course.",
    "Great course if you wanna learn about robotics even if you have zero experience working on robotics projects before.",
    "Strongly recommend! Scaz is an experienced and engaging lecturer, he really makes an effort to keep it exciting both through relevant examples, updating the slides each year, and through including at least 1 video per powerpoint. It'll link cool CS ideas to social puzzles about what it means to be human, and tie it to cognitive science questions about what it means to be intelligent.",
    "Unlike many other CS courses, wonderful class if you have any interest in psychology. Lectures are great and assignments are at least interesting, though tedious at times.",
    "Take it for a CS elective! Not too much work and interesting material. It's also the gateway to the coveted social robotics lab.",
    "A really great survey course if you want to understand the history of ideas in the field of AI and robotics, like the paradigm shift from classical AI to behavior-based robotics. Not much coding, math, or technical depth, so don't come looking for that, but otherwise Scaz is a very engaging lecturer who focuses on imparting key ideas and concepts rather than the small details. If I wasn't already familiar with AI to some degree, it would probably have significantly changed the way I thought about intelligent systems (both natural and artificial) and how to build them."
