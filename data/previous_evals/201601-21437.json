    "Great L2 language class.",
    "So if you're taking german L2 you're either skipping L1 or you're finishing the two part series. If you're the latter than you don't have much of a choice because you'll lose first semesters 1.5 credits if you don't take L2. As such, I would say that you need to go into this course knowing it might be the most work you have of all your courses (Given german meets 5 times a week). In addition, you learn at a faster pace than L1. If you're skipping L1 and going straight to L2 than this is my opinion of the course. It goes too fast and doesn't leave time for students to understand the material. It would probably help if there was section for it. I would suggest getting a tutor as soon as you think you need one, or going to Office hours as soon as you think you need. If you don't know a topic well now, it will come to bite you in the butt later. So if you do poorly on a topic you should really make the effort to improve in that topic before it is incorporated into another topic.",
    "Really enjoyable, fun class to have every day of the week. Found it a lot harder than L1 but ended up getting a decent grade so it really isn't impossible!"
