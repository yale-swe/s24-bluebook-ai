    "The same as 150, still great.",
    "A continuation of JAPN150, similar in style and the kind of content covered, workload remains largely the same also. The content ranges from historical to contemporary topics, especially culture in Japan that everyone knows about but no one really knows about in detail which is really informative for a more profound of the culture of the language that you will be studying."
