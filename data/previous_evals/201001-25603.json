    "There was a lot of interesting material covered in the class but I didn't feel like the material was very tightly organized.",

    "I was an auditor and so don't have responses for many of the questions. I very much appreciated the chance to audit and felt that the course tied together many areas of knowledge that before were quite disconnected in my mind.",

   "comments": [
    "I felt like the exams were only vaguely related to the lectures and the homework assignments didn't help in preparation for the exams. The instructors also assumed that most people in the class had prior science backgrounds, which made it difficult. Lectures were fairly dull and seemed to be read straight off the powerpoint.",
    "More effort needs to go into actually preparing the course. Reading materials felt somewhat random and assignments superficial. The grading of the exams felt also opaque with little feedback.",
    "As just mentioned, the discussions need to be spaced throughout the semester; having them all in a row was difficult and I felt like they started to lag towards the end--it was hard to keep motivated over five classes of discussions in a row. Also, grouping the discussions with the presentation so closely together made for a lot of work grouped in a pretty intensive time period; again, I think it would be better to space these assignments out.",
    "During the week of discussions, as there are 2 proffs and one TA, consider breaking the class up into smaller discussion groupsClearer guidelines and higher expectations for student presentations to facilitate more discussionSeveral lectures towards the end of the semester, circa the Stoichiometry lecture, created quite a bit of confusion for several students -- having more introductory readings might help",
    "Maybe provide readings as assignments earlier in the class, especially if the papers will be discussed in lecture.",
    "The discussions may have been better if the class size was better. The ecological stoichiometry discussion in particular was not very helpful. Fewer readings and\/or closer readings may have been helpful to narrow down students prep time so that they would be more engaged.",
    "The slides were sometimes difficult to follow and had some extraneous information, figures etc. Streamlining would be really great.",
    "This was a solid introduction to Ecosystem Science, but at times it seemed a little bit basic, and I think that the expectations could have been set higher."

This was actually one of the better group assignment experiences I've had since at FES, but I think that had to do with being able to chose our group rather than being arbitrarily assigned. Advantages included being able to tackle a broad range of the material individually and synthesizing it together.",
