   "comments": [
    "Really interesting. Take this class.",
    "I'd recommend it because it makes you see a relationship between media and medicine that most people don't notice.",
    "Fun class.",
    "if you need an extra 5th easy course and you're pre-med, why not?",
    "HIST 147 teaches students to find and identify the hidden messages in health related advertisements as well as the audiences targeted in the ads. As my TF said on the last day of class \"You should leave the class more confused than when you came in.\" There are so many implications that are involved with advertisements that truly influence the way we perceive things.",
    "This class was fantastic, very interesting and with a very manageable workload. Take it!",
    "Class was not terribly difficult. The workload was manageable at worst, and practically nonexistent when I was feeling lazy. The lectures were interesting and enjoyable, but the section was a nightmare. The tests weren't hardto study for, but the essay-style made them more difficult for some students. All in all, a good class if you're looking for something extra.",
    "A very interesting class and great if interested in material.",
    "I would recommend this course. The material was interesting but not so complex that it required a lot of work outside of lecture. The weekly reading responses were kind of annoying but there were always some interesting readings assigned, so it wasn't that bad. Furthermore, there was only one 10 page paper at the end, along with a midterm and a final, so the workload was not bad at all. This is a good course to take if you want an easy humanities credit or think you might be interested in history of science. It was the first history\/humanities course I had taken at Yale and it was definitely manageable.",
    "I had high hopes for this class, but it fell far short. A over half the lectureswere boring and unnecessary, and the readings were interesting but not at all rigorous. The bar was really low on everything. The material covered was from a huge range of subject matter and suffered from a lack of focus and depth.",
    "This is a great class that I'd recommend to anyone interested in media or going into a profession in medicine. The topics that arose in this class will stay on my mind far after the end of the semester.",
    "Take it--very interesting, not too tough.",
    "Material is interesting and lectures are enjoyable. Readings are sometimes long but usually interesting and you don't have to do all of it.",
    "If you go to class, you will learn how medicine evolved in America and how the media had a huge role on what Americans believe. Super interesting if you like the anthropological side of medicine, not super science-y which is cool.",
    "Yes, take this class. TAs are really involved and interested in this material, and Warner is a great lecturer. Readings are mostly interesting and not too heavy.",
    "The ideas behind the class are interesting. The end result (being the class itself) was rather disjointed. It was hard to figure out how the different lectures were actually connected and the syllabus changed frequently. I found it difficult to see the overall goals behind the class until the end when I had to review for the final.Good in theory. Could be better in practice.Choose Debbie as your TA if possible!",
    "Media and Medicine is a class that does exactly what the title says- it talks about the relationship between the media and medicine in the 20th century. We covered topics such as vaccines, wonder drugs\/magic bullets, public service announcements, the medical hero as portrayed in films and television clips across time, ethical scandals, why reform in medicine occurs, the changing role of the patient in the doctor\/patient relationship, cigarettes, obesity, and health care. It was quite comprehensive and I still felt as though I got to understand each of the topics in some depth.We got to watch a lot of clips from films, tv shows, advertisements, public service announcements, and new new media, which was fun, because I actually got a feeling for what was described in the lectures.There is a lot of reading (and required section), but a lot of the stories were interesting. There is a 10 page research paper, a midterm and a comprehensive final.I would definitely recommend this class to another student- especially if they have never taken an HSHM course before!",
    "This was a really great and interesting class. With a midterm, final, and a 10 page paper, the courseload was not excessive. There was a LOT of reading, though if you are genuinely interested in the material, it is really fascinating. Basic message: TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "This was a very cool class on an interesting subject. It was very neat to see how the media likes to portray medicine and how that portrayal started to change in the 1970s. The professors are both great speakers, and I liked how they switched back and forth to present both the history side and the medicine side of things for us. The reading really isn't too bad and much of it is quite interesting. The exams are not that challenging as long as you pay attention in lectures and do at least a little reading. The paper isn't too bad either. I definitely recommending taking this course no matter what your major.",
    "You could tell that this course was very much a first-time-being-taught-class, but even with that experience it covered interesting material in a new way, with caring TAs at the side. A good experience.",
    "Great class to take - my favorite this semester. Really interesting material, and really interesting lectures. Also, it was graded fairly and I actually enjoyed doing the readings.",
    "Yes, great course. Light on the readings and the course paper turned out to be pretty rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student so long as they improve the organization next year (all of the syllabus\/reading assignment changes were confusing\/frustrating)",
    "I would recommend it if you want an easier class. It's as engaging as you want to make it - you don't have to do the readings, but a lot of them are interesting. The midterm wasn't too difficult and my TA helped a lot with my paper.",
    "The class is pretty interesting, the coursework isn't too demanding, and the tests and assignments aren't difficult given that you do some of the readings and show up at lecture.",
    "Definitely, workload is light, easy to read through, lectures are interesting and you will come across info\/ideas you won't see in other history classes.",
    "Interesting subject matter, but structure of class detracted from students' overall ability to follow the material.",
    "This was a great class! I think it's a class everyone should take because it does a nice job of incorporating medical history with American history, and such information is good to know. It covered a lot of interesting topics that often spurred discussion among my friends and I. It could go in more of a chronological order though. I think that would help give a better understanding of how topics relate to each other in terms of time period. But in terms of workload, it was fairly light and the readings were always interesting. I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Great class for anyone remotely interested in medicine. I honestly thought it was going to bore me but just shopped it for the sake of doing so and I'm now going to be a history of science and med major. It's not overbearing with its workload and the paper can actually be fun if you like your topic.",
    "yes, would recommend. I particularly enjoyed the dual professors who alternated lectures and styles.",
    "It's a great introductory class about the role of the media in communicating health information. I think that any student can enjoy the material but as a premedical student, I found it particularly helpful in thinking about how patients \"consume\" health information and how this affects the patient-doctor relationship. I totally recommend it!",
    "The readings are incredibly interesting and very relevant to today. Sheds light on things we take for granted, so now I think about the world a different way. It has been really cool to stop and analyze the media surrounding us everyday. A great class, easy grade.",
    "This course provides a background of the media and its role in shaping medicine\/the public expectations of medicine from the tb epidemic to the present. I would highly recommend this whether you are pre-med or not, as many of the writing\/research skills are applicable to any course.",
    "Absolutely- I would say the class was very interesting and different from many of the others I have taken. It isn't too much work while it is also very rewarding. Definitely worth taking.",
    "This class was interesting, linking media and medicine. It wasn't fabulous but is definitely worth your time. You have a moderate amount of reading for section each week, and moderate amount of work otherwise (includes 1 paper and 2 tests). The lecture material was enjoyable-from prime time television to advertising to war films on VD. It is a lecture class, so you won't have much interaction besides section to discuss the material.",
    "Interesting class. Lectures are fun, you get to watch cool video clips from shows like E.R. All really relevant stuff. It's nice to learn about American healthcare and public health movements of the past. Topics include Stigmatization of disease, primetime television, HIV\/AIDS, the Golden age of medicine, Mass Public Health Campaigns, Cancer Wars etc.",
    "I would recommend it! It was very very interesting and theinformation is relevant for every student. The readings are approachable and very interesting to read. Section was fun to attend. The organization of the class will improve too because some of the kinks can be attributed to this being its first year.",
    "I would highly recommend Media& Medicine to anyone interested in public health or medicine who wants a light, interesting, and relevant course to add to their schedule. It covers all sorts of aspects of public health and media throughout history, and I feel better educated about a multitude of topics because of this class. I refused to miss a single lecture because each one was so interesting and engaging, and I found myself referring to the material in my day-to-day life. The midterm and final are not too challenging, and the final paper topic is up to you and your interests. This was my favorite class this semester, and I plan to save my course packet because I actually think I'll want to refer back to it in the future.",
    "A great, interesting overview of the relationship between media and medicine. Definitely take it.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, it was very interesting to learn how media influenced medicine in American society and vice versa.",
    "Absolutely recommend. The best advice I can give is to take the class with Deborah (Debbie) as your TA. Just trust me.",
    "take it if you're interested in health campaigns, healthcare reform, medical scandals, advocacy movements etc... Some of the readings are very interesting and it's not too much work",
    "I liked this class a lot. Reading wasn't too much, lectures were always interesting, sections were pretty solid. Take it just as a fun 5th course.",
    "I loved this class! It's really interesting and the workload is totally manageable.",
    "Take this class! Usually I wouldn't be the type of person that insists that you take a history class, but I thought that I learned a lot of historical information that tied into entertainment and medicine that I was really interested in. The professors are really interactive, and the sections are enjoyable. For the most part, the readings are always interesting, and the lectures are often a bunch of movie clips that are really relaxing...it's not even like you're attending class!",
    "This is a really fun class. The lectures are split between Dr. Berland and Dr. Warner, with Berland covering modern issues and Warner taking the historical approach. I found Berlands lectures much more exciting, but Warner's lectures weren't too bad. They both used video a lot, which was nice. They videos were pretty entertaining. They also get some pretty cool guest lecturers to come in. The readings aren't too bad a for a history course, either. I would definitely take this course no matter what your major as long as you are interested in the material. It's a really cool class, and now that they've worked the kinks out, it should be excellent.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. This was the first year it was offered, so there are still a few organizational kinks that they still have to work out, but the material is very interesting. The readings are manageable and very engaging and the exams are very fair.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, from any background, who is interested in the increasingly important issues discussed in this course.",
    "Media and Medicine was a fabulous blend of historical content of medical information in the media. It was neat how there was both a historical and current perspective to the class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "yes, good class with not too much work.",
    "yes interesting and not taught in other courses. also not a ton of work.",
    "American Studies brings understanding to the progression of medicine in American history as a result of the media's influence. It tells about how the media has worked hand in hand with media, bringing to light medicine's successes as well as its downfalls. Definitely take this course. It is very eye opening. There are so many things that this course brings to light that you have probably noticed but have found no means to explain. It really is a great class and you will surely take something out of it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This was one class I could never fall asleep in, no matter how tired I was, all semester. Every lecture was riveting, and it wasn't just the charisma of the lecturers--both Dr. Berland and Prof. Warner were good lecturers, but they weren't the whole show. Most of the material and the things the professors were saying about the material and the historical clips and examples the professors showed made almost every lecture really interesting. I really liked how the class taught me to tracehistorical trends throughout the decades and to think critically about source material and really engage with the history of medicine. The reading is mostly source material, which is typically an easy read, my sections were conducive to learning and discussing relevant issues critically, and the assignments and exams were actually quite fun and stress-free.",
    "Lots of fun. I like learning about the media, and have always been interested in healthcare. I took it because I'm working with media next year, and thought it was cool Yale offered a lecture class about an intriguing cross-section: the historical methods could be applied to media and education, media and politics, etc. People who take it are pretty interested in both parts of the class (media and medicine). The material is approachable and engaging, and the professors are excellent. I originally took it for a humanities credit.",
    "good, interesting class. easy.",
    "Media& Medicine is a great background in how Americans regard doctors, researchers, healthy behavior, and disease; how this regard has changed over time; and how this regard is shaped by and reflected in the media. Lectures are a BLAST. You get to watch old film clips that are historically hilarious and ironic (unintentionally, of course). The workload is manageable, yet you still leave the class feeling like you\u0092ve learned a ton. TAKE IT. (even if you\u0092re not a pre-med kid. I wasn\u0092t)",
    "yes",
    "Yes. Easy and interesting",
    "Having never taken and HSHM or American Studies course, this was a great ice-breaker. The material learned throughout the semester was very interesting, even to the students who aren't pre-med. A great way to learn about media and how it shapes everything in our society.",
    "This class is a unique interesting combination of two fields that I would not usually think of together. If you have an interest in history, media, or medicine, this is will be a fun class for you. While the lectures can drag on at times, the readings are usually fun and informative, and the workload is not bad at all.",
    "I would only take Media and Medicine again if the syllabus was revised to make the course a more coherent whole. As it stands, the material is interesting but hard to synthesize together.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. YOu have a midterm (which is easy), a 10 page paper (which with adequate planning- you have over spring break to start it- should be ok) and a final (which is pretty much tell me everything you know).",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I have no intention to be premed, and essentially no basic interest in science or medicine. Yet I shopped this class with some friends and was absolutely hooked. I think in the day and age we live in,with health and medicine issues so prevalent, the knowledge you gain in this class is really important and applicable to real life. I would absolutely recommend it. It was interesting and intriguing.",
    "Yes. It changed then way I look at advertisements and the grading and testing was not too harsh.",
    "You absolutely must take this course if it's still offered. It will open your eyes to medicine as you begin to realize what an important role media plays in shaping it. As future physicians and medical practitioners, you would not realize how much you are missing until you take this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class. Especially for Pre-meds who need a humanities credit. It is interesting but not intensive and filled with a lot of other pre-med and science students so there are no mini-shakespeares in the class.",
    "It is a great course that yous hould take before John Warner decidesto retire. TAKE IT NOW.",
    "Media&Med was a GREAT class. It's incredibly interesting and is extremely relevant today, whether or not you're planning on going into medicine. Professors Berland and Warner both bring unique interests and passions to the course, and the lectures are engaging. Definitely take this class!!",
    "A great intro to medicine in america and the role of the media in portraying health information. Really fun! Great media clips and pictures and videos!",
    "This was the first year this class was taught, so things will undoubtedly be different next year, but it was a good class overall. Exams consist of essay questions, and as long as you understand some overarching concepts, you'll be able to do it. It's interesting to learn about the evolution of media and medicine over time, and I think you come out looking at both a little differently. There's a paper, but that isn't too bad, either, also because you have TAs and such to help you if you have problems. I recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student because it helps train students to think about media\/medicine in context! This is an extremely useful skill.I would summarize the class as an overview of the relationship between media and medical establishment, from times of relative cooperation to active opposition.",
    "I found this class really interesting. I enjoyed the mix of Professor Warner and Berland's lectures. While I didn't walk out with a unified concept of the the co-growth of media and medicine, I did understand their effects on each other much better. It's agood history course for premeds looking to maintain a liberal arts education.",
    "It was a great class and I hope that they continue teaching it. The paper was fun to research because there is a lot of interesting topics in media and medicine.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course, not just to pre-med students, but also to those who are simply interested in what sort of impact the media can have. I am an English major, and I really enjoyed the way the course follows different themes in the American public's psyche, and how they have evolved and why, etc. It is all very fascinating, and the workload is definitely not too much to handle. These were lectures that I looked forward to going to.",
    "Great class, lot's of fun and not too much work. Tests were very very easy",
    "I really liked this course. I would describe it as a great intro for paper writing and history research, and would recommend it."
