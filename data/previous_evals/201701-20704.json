   "comments": [
    "learned so much about eastern europe that i never knew. was really cool to learn about history like WWI and WWII from this perspective because I've only learned about it from a US perspective, so i learned a ton.",
    "I learned practically everything there is to know about Eastern European history since 1914. I further gained the critical skills of quick reading, critical discussion, and fast-paced essay writing. I could not be better informed about the important intellectual movements of Europe as well, including intellectual nationalism, Marxism-Leninism, revisionist communism, etc.",
    "I learned so much about the past century of Eastern European history. This course takes topics you learned very briefly in high school and adds so much depth and context to them. Professor Snyder explains world historical events with such clarity and draws out important themes that make lots of sense but that youd otherwise never consider.",
    "This course (my third in the history department) gave me a greater understanding of the breadth and importance of the field. It taught me to look with a critical eye at all institutions and phenomena that we tend to assume to be immutable, everlasting. It reminded me that history did not end in 1989, that there is nothing inevitable about democracy or progress, and it taught me to never assume that it can't get worse (it can). Skills gained include the careful analysis of historical trends in their historical contexts, the ability to avoid presentism, a broader perspective than my own Western one, et cetera.",
    "The course enhanced my understanding of Eastern Europe. I already knew a lot about the subject from my own study and background, but I enjoyed seeing an American perspective on the region and its troubled history.",
    "Learning to learn and think about history.",
    "I did not know much about the history of Eastern Europe until I took this class. However, my writing, thinking, or analytical skills were not greatly impacted.",
    "We got a comprehensive overview of the political, economic, and social changes which take place in the nations of Eastern Europe from 1914 to the present.",
    "I learned to effectively cognise the history of Eastern Europe as a region; the intellectual frameworks introduced to understand highly complex and heterogenous events (e.g. resistance in WWII, phases of Communism) were incredibly effective in allowing me to comprehend and retain knowledge. For example, Prof Snyder provided 'patterns of resistance in WWII' such as 'communist' v 'nationalist' and 'revisionist' v 'revolutionary' that could cleanly categorise many qualitatively different resistance movements.",
    "Knowledge and appreciation for eastern Europe, an area I knew virtually nothing about going in. A deep understanding of how communism grew and ended, another topic I was ignorant in before the course.",
    "I learned a lot of recent world history that has helped to contextualize the current conflicts and wars ongoing in the world today. I've learned about the kinds of ethnic conflict and nationalism that gave rise to both world wars and the cold war tensions and other conflicts that followed. I learned that these conflicts have still not been fully resolved. Peace has had only relative meaning in the past century.",
    "I learned a lot about eastern europe during world war 1, war 2, and after the war. i learned about the history and movements that led to the course of events during this time.",
    "Knowledge of the history for several countries in Eastern Europe from 1914 to the present. I also learned about various of their political systems and how geopolitical relationships shaped the course of history in this region.",
    "I had very little background information coming into this course, so I learned a ton about the history and narrative of Eastern Europe",
    "The course is titled \"Eastern Europe History since 1914\" -- that's literally what this class is. You learn just about EVERYTHING about Eastern Europe since 1914. It's incredibly valuable information, particularly as a student who took this for a humanities credit. Happy I chose this course.",
    "I learned a lot about Hitler, Stalin, and the rise and fall of communism. I had learned a little previously about these subjects; this class is absolutely eye opening on the subjects. Snyder is the man.",
    "I learned a ton it's an awesome course",
    "Learned so much that I never knew about Eastern Europe!!",
    "A strong political and general overview of the historical period.",
    "I learned a great deal about Eastern European history from 1914 to the present, and how to analyze history without the bias of an American perspective. I also learned how to incorporate literature and primary sources into my study of history.",
    "Understanding the way that Eastern Europe developed as a region Seeing the historical roots of twentieth century catastrophes Understanding recurrent historical patterns (cosmopolitan\/globalist cities vs underdeveloped periphery regions, the Peasant Question and land reform's effect on burgeoning democracies)",
    "A general understanding of the geopolitics involved in Eastern Europe from the start of WWI to today along with a sense of why these politics are important and an essential part of European and global history.",
    "I now understand the geopolitical situation of Eastern Europe much better. I can see a deeper meaning to the recent history of Eastern Europe.",
    "I learned how to think about history by seeing that everything is connected and making connections myself.",
    "I learned a lot of historical content and perspective on the history, particularly Professor Snyder's arguments about the bloodlands; the European integration project; Hitler and the Ukraine. You work on the skills of a regular history lecture, e.g. exams and section.",
    "I learned a lot about eastern european history and i learned a lot about the different people that caused events to happen. I learned a lot about different movements and philosophies that dominated Eastern europe and the world from 1914 - present.",
    "I learned about the ideologies and the events which have shaped Eastern European history and the rest of the world. Specifically, it was interesting to learn about the rise of fascism, communism, and totalitarianism in Eastern Europe.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about Eastern Europe, but this class does not develop many skills at all.",
    "Biggest takeaway outside of concrete facts was that history is not over.",
    "Greater knowledge of Eastern Europe and how it has played a crucial role in current affairs.",
    "After taking this course, I can chart a timeline of the courses each Eastern European country took since 1914. Basically, this course provides a thorough understanding of events leading to WWI, what occurred during the inter-war period, WWII, and events up to the early 2000s. This course did not solely cover historical events but themes, motifs, and parallels during these times.",
    "I learned a huge amount in this class it was fantastic.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the history of Eastern Europe, and to some extent, the current political landscape through this course. As a continuation of last semesters' \"Eastern Europe until 1914\" it did a very good job of showing common threads.",
    "Detailed knowledge of twentieth century Eastern Europe",
    "Advanced knowledge of Eastern Europe and histories of the cause of the rise and fall of Communism and the world wars, leading up to the founding of the European Union.",
    "I learned about the major events, key figures, and overarching themes of Eastern Europe from 1914 to present.",
    "Better understanding of: Eastern Europe, communism, nationalism, the rise of fascism, the role of contingency in world-changing events, the depravity that everyone is capable of.",
    "I constantly surprise myself by bringing up intricacies of Eastern European history in casual conversation.",
    "Before taking the course, I didn't know very much at all about Eastern Europe. Now, I feel like I have a basic understanding of the region in the 20th century and an appreciation for the scale of the tragedy that took place there. My main area of growth was mainly in learning a great deal about a topic which I had no prior experience with.",
    "Knowledge of international and domestic relations of most eastern european countries develop recurrent political and economic patterns in eastern europe and analyse them reading and absorbing huge amounts of readings",
    "Enhanced knowledge of Eastern Europe which developed a greater understanding of our current political climate.",
    "An understanding of the history of Eastern Europe to the present.",
    "This course helped me learn how to craft several narratives about a single period of history and work as a historian to complicate said narratives in the hope of creating a coherent, unified history.",
    "I gained a new perspective on World War Two. I also learned a ton about the Cold War.",
    "I learned how to consider history from multiple directions. I improved my ability to consider both a factual account of a particular event, and develop a greater big picture narrative of developments in Eastern Europe, for example the story of many countries through the inter-war years or through the post-Stalin period.",
    "I learned a great deal about Eastern Europe, also about fascism, how governments fail, and a new view on WWI, WWII, and subsequent history (new viewpoints on material I thought I knew, hurray!)",
    "I developed a whole new aspect to my understanding of Western history. By learning about Eastern Europe, a region often overlooked by traditional Western History classes, I gained a more wholistic viewpoint of both World Wars, the Holocaust, and post-war Europe.",
    "This was my first history course at Yale because I needed an HU. I learned so much about Eastern Europe since 1914 which is still seen today.",
    "It was incredible to separate the Western biases built into the historical narratives of twentieth century Eastern Europe with Professor Snyder. I look forward to continuing to study a region I previously never focused on.",
    "I gained knowledge of the causes and consequences of events taking place in the variety of countries in Eastern Europe from 1914 to the present and valuable insights into current affairs in Eastern Europe today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Snyder is a legend and I love everything about his lectures. Understandably, he is busy. Professor Shore is also great, but she lectured 3 or 4 times and they seemed forced. Her lectures didn't really compliment his well, so maybe limit them to 1 or 2. Not that she wasn't interesting; it was just very different material that worked better with her courses, I think",
    "Great lectures, really good job giving both the detailed series of events and how it fits into a larger narrative. Could be improved in only minor ways: 1. Put handouts online in case you lose them 2. The lectures by Marci Shore often were not well coordinated with the course as a whole and as a result didn't contribute much",
    "weakness: WAY too much reading. i'm sorry there's like 11 books plus a $100 course pack. i'm not a history major so idk if this is normal but it seems pretty ridiculous to me. another weakness = marci shore. i know she's the professor's wife and everything but her lectures were SO boring and not engaging at all, i didn't learn any historical events when she talked she just told these stupid anecdotes the whole time and i literally fell asleep. contrast with snyder who is engaging and was able to teach us a ton of history in a very short time-- this should really be an hour and 15 rather than 50. strengths = learned a new perspective on history that i had never heard of and learned about a lot of countries that i think the US tends to overlook.",
    "The lectures are fantastic, as are the readings. My only complaint is that the lectures sometimes go too fast for students to handwrite, and that sometimes there is simply too much reading to be able to complete.",
    "Lots of strengths. Great lectures. Unmatched. The readings can be a bit dense, but theyre generally quite helpful and at least reasonably interesting. The books are all quite good (its the massive course packet that features some denser material). Occasionally, when the reading comes from Snyders book, the lecture repeats it a bit more than ideal. The handouts in class with key terms are excellent. Professor Shores lectures are also great, but it would be nice if Professor Snyder told her what the class has been up to; she always seems unaware of exactly what to cover, which feels so ironic.",
    "This course is one of the reasons to come to Yale. Professor Snyder is the best in his field and his lectures reflect that. Something new and exciting happens every lecture and the class is set up so you can succeed while really learning fun material.",
    "I question the pedagogy of assigning 400 pages of reading per week (or more). This I feel discourages students from even starting the readings, which denigrates that quality of the section discussions. The lectures were always invigorating, though they never touched on all the key terms mentioned, and often only loosely followed the supplied outline. More communication with Professor Shore may be helpful becausegreat lecturer though she isshe often seemed confused about where the class was in time and content, including one memorable day in which she stated she hadn't known she was giving the lecture until she passed a TA by chance on the day of. This impeded the flow of the course.",
    "On the plus side: Professor Snyder, his extremely well-thought out and engaging lectures and the excellent choice of readings (probably the best and most interesting I've ever had at Yale!) On the down side: The size of the class (too many people taking it simply because of its hype), and the fact that, because of the sheer scope of the class (100 years of tumultuous history of 6 or 7 countries), many topics were treated a bit superficially in lectures. Still, the readings filled out well what was not covered in class.",
    "Perhaps more focused readings? Seems like a lot of reading for a survey course where non-history folks might be involved.",
    "Often lectures felt scattered and could have had more depth over breadth.",
    "The lectures of the course were undoubtedly the best aspect, although it was at times off putting when our repeat guest lecturer, Marci Shore, did not quite know where the last lecture had left off and what exactly she should discuss with us. I also found the reading to be at times overwhelming. Most students often skipped large sections of the readings, and even in section we were never able to cover all of the readings we were assigned for any given week. Especially as this class has no papers, students were more inclined to not read and just do their best in section. Even if all the readings were kept for next year, I would suggest making some of them optional, that way students who need to prioritize can still come prepared to section and get the most important themes, and sections can cover all that is assigned.",
    "Professor Snyder is a brilliant lecturer. I think it would be nice if he stayed and taught all of the classes; I understand he has book events and interviews across the country, but the class really isn't the same when someone else teaches it (note that Professor Shore is an excellent teacher too!)",
    "Fascinating lectures, sometimes so packed with info you can't write it all down. But the tests are fair and focus on understanding the main examples and ideas. There is a lot of reading, none of which you need to do in order to understand lecture or prepare for the tests. However they dive deeper into some of the trends and issues mentioned than lectures can, so are useful if you're interested in the material.",
    "The course is strong because the material covered is so significant. But I found the course to be extremely demanding. Somehow we were expected to do 200-600 pages of reading every week. I spent around 35 hours doing readings over Spring Break just to stay on top of it all. If my other classes hadn't been so manageable, I don't know what I would have done. As a STEM major, I felt that the reading load and lecture presentations to be very unfriendly and unwelcoming to me. It seemed constantly assumed that I had so much more context. Terms were not explained. Lectures were rushed. No review material was provided. Each lecture had a long list of people and ideas that might be discussed, but had no actual content on them: these lists were more intimidating than useful, because many of the obscure persons weren't ever mentioned at all. This class was terrifying stressful to me. So, the class could be improved if the jargon were explained, the lectures taken at a more reasonable pace, and review material\/lecture notes\/or presentation slides were used and then provided instead of the lists. Alternatively, the course could just have a disclaimer warning STEM students to stay away.",
    "Less unique than the first semester (HIST 263) because this semester overlapped a fair amount with Cold War with Gaddis, but not sure that's avoidable. A great all-around history course. The amount of readings assigned is stupid - in HIST 263 I kept up with readings because the amount was high but manageable, in this one the amount was so high I didn't even go to the trouble to read any of it (aside from online reviews for the books).",
    "Bad and overlong readings most of the time, which made section obnoxious",
    "The class has only a quiz, midterm, section, and final . This is nice because there is not that much work but it is also bad because you have to do well on each thing. Also there is a ton of reading.",
    "Biggest strength by far is Tim Snyder. The guy is cocky as hell but he knows his stuff and is an incredible lecturer. Weaknesses are wide and varied. The no electronics rule is plain ridiculous, especially when Snyder wastes time calling out kids on their phones in the back. I understand that having open computers can be distracting, even if you're not the one using a computer. But that still beats having to write notes faster than you can think. By the midterm all my friends in the class had stopped taking notes. Also pretty terrible that this class doesn't exist at all online. Having Snyder teaching is enough to get kids to go to class, and it could benefit a lot by posting key terms and lecture summaries online. If kids don't want to go to class that's their own decision to make, and there honestly needs to be more transparency in general with this course. Also, on a personal note, I thought the rule that you can only miss one section the entire semester regardless of circumstance is absolutely absurd. Decided to use my one allowable skip before the midterm because it would let me leave earlier for spring break. However, after the midterm I had to return home for a funeral. Had a Dean's Excuse and clearly communicated with my TA more than 5 days before that I'd be willing to do a makeup assignment or attend another section to make up the credit. Didn't hear back for two days, then was told I'd have a chance to make it up with a writing assignment, and then finally heard the following week that there would be no chance for me to make up credit. This was likely because the hard-working TA's of this course don't appear to like grading things, as the only things that were graded were two one-hour exams and a 10 minute map quiz. It makes zero sense that no more than two hours of writing should account for 70% of our grade, and I would suggest having a longer final next year, and weighing it more than the midterm. Finally, the readings were way too long and it would be helpful if the TA's could pick around 100 pages of the reading each week that they determine to be the most important to help guide students.",
    "This was my first history course and I really enjoyed it. It feels like some of the reading is excessive, but I can see why it would be useful for people who are more interested in the material. I didn't really like the guest lectures from",
    "I think this course is really interesting, but there are a lot of readings assigned each week, and I think it might be helpful to narrow the focus of the readings.",
    "Professor Snyder's lectures are like watching movies. He's brilliant. This course has no weaknesses.",
    "A class with an interesting perspective on the world. Fantastic class. There are too many guest lecturers, who sometimes do not fit well into the narrative of the class and feel out of place.",
    "A lot of information, and Snyder does a good job explaining the larger narratives at work.",
    "Wish that the outline sheets that were given out at the beginning of each class followed the class better (they got better toward the end!) but really no complaints other than that",
    "It's a very interesting lecture, and Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer, as is Professor Shore, who often guest lectured. I felt that it lacked a little bit of engagement with the material, it doesn't ask for much analysis on the material beyond what is presented by the professor on the podium. But still, very interesting lecture.",
    "The strengths are that the history content of this period and region are obviously fascinating and often misconveived\/little known in popular culture; the course was a huge learning leap in this regard. Also, the assignments workload is really quite reasonable which makes the experience overall fine. HOWEVER: Tim Snyder as a lecturer is vastly overrated, and as a teacher is generally dismissive of his students. I got very little impression that he cared at all about his students: he arrives late to classes, often refuses to use a microphone so the majority of the room struggle to hear his lectures, and had his wife (who is, fair enough, very good but still not our course instructor) give guest-lectures AT LEAST six or seven times, often at no notice to both her and us, which makes it seem like he would do it when he just couldn't be bothered to show up. The reading-load for this course is also far beyond the reasonable, and the system for participation grading in sections is a little draconian-seeming. The readings are also very dry, and Snyder takes every opportunity to assign you to buy his books which is just tasteless tbh. Last of all there is a strict no laptops policy in both section and lecture, which I found a huge disadvantage as it seems he deliberate fact-loads his [often rambly and unstructured] lectures to make them difficult to follow (see above: overrated), and so having hard-copy\/non-searchable notes is incredibly inconvenient.",
    "This course is fantastic - a great overview with multiple perspectives.",
    "Lectures are very interesting and well organized, but the \"laptop-ban\" made it difficult to get all the information down into my notes while also remaining engaged in the lecture. Sections and readings are a great supplement to the lecture and allowed me to actively engage with the material. The workload of this course was just enough to allow me to engage with the material, but not feel swamped.",
    "Strengths: -strong lectures from Prof. Snyder -Prof. Snyder makes a strong effort to break down complex political developments and make them seem current and timely for today's fights Weaknesses: -a very very over-ambitious syllabus that assigns too much reading each week, that is never discussed in lecture and barely noticed in section. As a history major (and former English major), it simply isn't reasonable to assign more than book's worth of material each week, especially when it wouldn't even be discussed. This is a case when expanding breadth is harming depth. Better to focus on a few primary source texts or novels, and not assign the umpteenth \"Economic History of Interwar Austria\" that not a single student cracked open.",
    "This is a great course, more supplemental material could be included all of the events which professor Snyder recommended were excellent and I would like to know about more in the future.",
    "Professor Snyder is an incredibly engaging lecturer, as evidenced by the fact that this lecture is one of the most popular at Yale. I felt, however, that the latter half of the course was a lot less engaged and a lot less thematically coherent than the first half.",
    "It is a very interesting course and a very interesting topic, somewhat understudied. Although there is a lot of reading that could be trimed down, and the timeline can get confusing between the different countries.",
    "Professor Snyder is the best professor I have ever had- I am a huge fan. I am not a history person but this is a must take course for all Yale students.",
    "Please let us use laptops. Also I didn't really get a lot out of the lectures with Professor Shore.",
    "Strengths: Professor Snyder is amazing. He is a gifted lecturer and brilliant. I particularly appreciate how organized and thoughtful his lectures are. I did not get as much out of section. Also, it was confusing when Professor Shore delivered lectures. It is no fault of hers, but I think not having Professor Snyder lecture some of the times detracted from the continuity of the course and the material. Also, it did not seem quite fair to ask Professor Shore to speak on political history (rather than more intellectual\/cultural matters that are her specialty).",
    "This class has very interesting lectures that are fun to go to. The sections are really not fun to go to and they have a lot of pressure surrounding them because of the grading system. I think that in order for this class to be more enjoyable and student driven then the sections need to be toned down a good amount because i know that for a lot of kids they were overly stressful and hard to attend.",
    "The lectures are riveting. Both Professor Snyder and Professor Shore are great lecturers who do an excellent job of taking you through both the events and the ideologies of history.",
    "Overall one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The one potential area of improvement might be narrowing the reading selections to more thematically relevant readings. I visited Professor Snyder during office hours and asked him a few questions I had on one of the readings. In the midst of the questions, Professor Snyder indicated that I might have been focusing too much on the details and missing the larger thematic picture. This seems to stem from the large quantity of reading and material to cover, and may be helped by more thematic emphasis in section, lecture and in reading selections.",
    "Lectures were awesome. Hard to do all of the readings though.",
    "Amazing lectures and great section. Loved how narrative and history were connected.",
    "Large amount of information- I loved the course but would prefer the one hour final be on the last day of class instead of in finals period.",
    "Lectures are incredible. They are the heart and soul of the course. The amount of reading, however, is completely unrealistic and not well integrated into the course. The cost of the course readings is also ridiculous. A $100 Tyco course packet along with at least 7 additional books. I didn't do some of the readings because I couldn't get them from the library (or Borrowdirect) and could not afford them. Course readings from the packet need to be available on classesv2, and some of the books should just be scrapped. Expecting all students to be able to shell out over $200 on course readings shows a lack of regard for low income students.",
    "This is an excellent class. Great lectures, lots of reading, but great material.",
    "I think this class was honestly perfect. 5 stars.",
    "Great course, I really enjoyed it, but I believe that one weakness of this course is the un-standardization of sections. Grading is highly dependent on your TA, who vary wildly in teaching style and approach. My TA this semester was quite strict, for better or for worse, in comparison to my TA for the course last semester and to my friend's TA. Because of this, the material that we went over varied hugely from what other sections went over. For example, some TAs sent out key areas that one should focus on while studying for exams, while mine did not. While I'm sure that it had little impact on my grade, it had a large impact on my overall experience in the course.",
    "Honestly I think the biggest weakness is the sheer expense of all of the course materials. I think some of the books and readings assigned can be done without just to save students' wallets.",
    "Best course I've ever taken",
    "Strengths: 1. Fantastic lectures. Professor Syder is an incredibly intelligent and talented lecturer, constructing a thematic narrative of Eastern Europe that merges diplomatic, cultural, and intellectual history in a manner that illuminates historical trends and essential truths not just in Europe in the world at large. 2. Great readings. Professor Snyder's books are excellent, but the other course readings (1984, From Stalinism to Pluralism, etc.) are wonderful as well. Weaknesses: 1. Occasionally disjointed lectures. As much as I loved Professor Snyder's lectures, I think he did an overall better job of crafting a broad thematically coherent narrative of Eastern European history to 1914 (his fall survey course) rather than after 1914 (this one). There were a few lectures that were so dense and covered so much that they were difficult to follow, and on a class-by-class basis it wasn't always clear in which direction the class was moving. I found the lectures in the first half of the course (up until the end of WWII) to be better organized and more compelling than those in the second half, though again the lectures as a whole were great. I just wish that several individual ones had been better executed and that they linked together more obviously\/clearly. 2. Excessive readings. The readings were great, but there were simply too many. It just wasn't possible to do all of them.",
    "Professor Snyder is very engaging as a lecturer; I hope that he can better give TAs instructions as to the general topics we should discuss in the class.",
    "The lectures were fantastic and so content heavy that I could barely keep up writing notes.",
    "Very important: the readings should be reduced OR the TAs should send out what they will cover in section. The readings that are just hyperdetailed accounts of (for example) interwar Hungarian agrarian economics should be made optional, because they add literally nothing besides corroborating detail (which is important for actual historians, but not nearly as important for undergrads in a survey class). When people see enormous reading assignments, they just (irrationally) decide to do none of it. If TAs sent out which ones were really important, section would be much better because almost everyone would do the reading.",
    "A great course. Way too heavy on the reading. The reading is necessary, because Snyder doesn't go into much historical detail -- instead he prefers to advance arguments and overarching themes into which the reading then falls -- but there is so much reading that many, daunted, don't do any of it. I would recommend that the reading load be revised and simplified.",
    "I think the readings are wonderful and that Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer. However, the lecture style might not be suitable for all types of students. Professor Snyder lectures very quickly and assumes you have at least a rudimentary knowledge of the region. Furthermore, no laptops are allowed in class and notetaking can only be done on a computer. I found it difficult to adjust at first, but I ended up really enjoying the class and getting a lot out of it.",
    "improvement: more focused readings more section time (more than one TF) review sessions that are across all the sections and during reading period or midterm season",
    "Strength: Snyder is an absolutely entertaining, engaging lecturer. Weakness: having said that, he missed several lectures, which seems inappropriate. Also caused confusion because in guest lectures from Marci Shore, the focus would suddenly be in intellectual ideas and not concrete events.",
    "The strength of the course is the lectures. They are incredible. My only suggestion for improvement is better coordination between Dr. Snyder and Dr. Shore. But this course is fantastic .",
    "I thought that there was a lot of superfluous reading at times that made the course unnecessarily daunting. The readings were often highly detailed statistical analyses that served little purpose in a broad survey class. I think that the syllabus should be altered to either shed the unnecessary readings, or include an exercise such as a paper that would allow us to incorporate these readings and further explore a particular topic of interest. Regarding strengths, I thought that the lectures were phenomenal. I always left knowing that I had gained fascinating and topical insights.",
    "I love this class! But I just wish Snyder hadn't had his wife give so many of the lectures.",
    "I thought the lectures were excellent - that is definitely where I learned the most in the class. However, it would have been nice to have some sort of powerpoint or visual accompaniment for people who aren't audial learners. Also, there was way too much reading assigned - often between 400 and 600 pages a week. I couldn't conceivably do it all on top of the coursework for my 4 other classes, so I had to resort to either skimming or just not doing the reading, neither of which were really helpful for actual learning. If less reading had been assigned, I would have been able to do it all and actually have gotten insights out of the reading. As it was, I felt like there was kind of no point in even attempting to do the reading at all.",
    "Snyder was an amazing lecturer. I enjoyed all of his lectures.",
    "The course is structured really well. The way it takes an issue or time period and goes through each major country we looked at worked very well, and was helpful in revising and consolidating what we had learned. There could maybe have been a bit more discussion of the Eastern European countries in the period of post-USSR to the present, as this was only really discussed in passing with mentions of EU and NATO, slightly in the context of Yugoslavia and in half a lecture just on Ukraine. Also, the way the guest lectures were structured was a bit confusing and slightly concerning; I put my detailed feedback on this under the \"Instructor\" section.",
    "Tim Snyder is the best lecturer. He covered more material in more depth in 50 minute periods than I thought possible.",
    "Timothy Snyder is an incredibly engaging lecturer. For students who prefer visuals during lectures, this class could be harder, as Professor Snyder does not use slides or visuals when he presents, nor does he allow computers in the lecture room.",
    "Only notable weakness was perhaps the dense amount of reading necessary every week",
    "I wouldn't change the course, except that there should be lecture review sheets at every lecture, and especially when Professor Shore lecture, they would be missing.",
    "It would have been nice for the Professor Shore's guest lectures to follow a similar format, i.e., have an outline, that makes it easier to synthesize the material with Professor Snyder's lectures. Other than making sure Professor Snyder uses a microphone to project to the rows furthest back, the class was phenomenal.",
    "Strengths: Engaging lectures, material is highly relevant, well-organized and well-structured to explain the major trends and important events of the period Weaknesses: Too much reading (often 2 books or more per week) to plausibly do, and not all reading was actually relevant to the class or discussed in section or exams"

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend, have to put in some work and go to lecture, but will learn a lot about a largely neglected area of the world with one of the experts of the field",
    "Yes. Take this course. Professor Snyder is a master in his field and you also get a few lectures by his wife, Marci Shore who is also an incredible teacher. The topic could not be more interesting given the current political climate in the world. Snyder's lectures are extremely engaging, and though he talks extremely fast you are always left wanting more. Do not graduate without taking this if possible!",
    "Absolutely, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Amazing. Tim Snyder is the best lecturer I have had in 4 years at Yale.",
    "great course. tim snyder is a great lecturer and very engaging but beware of the days when his wife marci shore lectures-- she is incredibly boring and apparently incapable of teaching actual history, preferring instead to tell anecdotes of when she met people in eastern european countries that i'm sorry, no one cares about. anyway, the material was really cool and you learn history from a non-US perspective which i really enjoyed, and i would definitely recommend it.",
    "Of course.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have any interest in history (even if the region has never particularly appealed to you). Snyder is brilliant and gives some of the best lectures out there. Each presents a meaningful argument about the period of Eastern European history and sheds new light on the area. Youll learn a ton about history that is relatively recent and still has a major impact on current events. The books are largely excellent as well. While the readings can be a bit heavy, the exams arent bad at all. Again, an amazing course for anyone who enjoys history lectures.",
    "This really is just one of those classes that you have to take while you're at Yale no matter what major you have declared. Timothy Snyder is the best in his field and his lectures are enjoyable with very few students every missing a class because you really don't want to miss any opportunity to hear Professor Snyder lecture. Take this class!",
    "Great prof. Would recommend.",
    "Endlessly fascinating. Endless reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the region, a mind for considering history complexly, and\/or a desire to break out of their Western canonical point of view of \"world civilizations.\"",
    "Best course at Yale, a must take for anybody. Professor Snyder is literally the God of giving lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, although to be honest so many people are taking it already that I would rather not encourage everyone to enroll in it! It's a wonderful course, very well taught by an extraordinary historian (Black Earth and Bloodlands are some of the best books I've ever read). The readings assigned are all great, and the workload (two easy exams) is more than manageable.",
    "This course is not a gut, but it is not difficult in any particular way. Prof. Snyder is an interesting lecturer. Would recommend this class as a STEM major looking for a HU at the last minute. It's interesting history and section was engaging.",
    "This is an overrated class. Decent, but it never blew me away like other history lectures. Often it felt like the content was bogged down in small detail and lost the big picture.",
    "I would recommend this class. Although there is a lot of material and a lot of reading, Snyder is a lecturer who shouldn't be missed during your time at Yale. In addition, Eastern Europe is an incredibly fascinating region which is overlooked in classic, Western-focused history classes, and understanding it better has really helped reform my view of the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Prof Snyder's teaching will leave you with a much deeper understanding towards both regional history and ideological history (Nazism, Communism, ethnic cleansing).",
    "This was a great first history course to take, and Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend the class if you need a humanities credit and you can get into a section with a good TA. Weaknesses, Professor Snyder wasn't there for about a fourth of the lectures. Professor Shore didn't know where we left off and would lecture whatever would come to mind and say \"Wow, you guys haven't read *insert book here*? Who made this class's syllabus?\" at least twice each time she came in. Strengths: Interesting material, but that's because Eastern Europe since 1914 was an interesting period in history. Exams are graded by your TA, so make sure you know what your TA wants on your essays and IDs. Exams wouldn't be hard at all if you binge study and know what your TA wants. Sooooo many unnecessary readings. There was about 4000 pages of reading for the semester.",
    "Great course if you want to know more about WW1, WW2, and the evolution of communism in Europe.",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic course and Professor Snyder is one of the best lecturers at yale. It is an easy credit\/d course and can be a good letter grade course if you put in the effort for the readings, which there are a lot of. The tests are fair and very straight forward.",
    "Expect to spend ~$200 on books and the $100 course packet of mind-numbing readings (the actual books you read are far better than the course packet readings, but both are required). Expect to read 200-600 pages a week. Expect to only understand the lectures very well if you are not a STEM major\/have a good understanding of history and the eastern european area already. Unlike me. The amount of reading and difficulty in understanding the lectures made this class terrifyingly stressful for me. But... if you think you can BS your way through the readings and lectures all right, you could probably get an A without too much work, since your grade is based almost entirely on the exams, and you get to choose one of three essay topics to write on. If this sounds like your thing, take it. But this was not the class for me.",
    "Great history class. Personally I think it's less of a must-take than HIST 263 (the first-semester one) because this one overlaps with more Yale courses and so is less unique, but I know that others would say the opposite because this one has a lot more links to modern politics. The amount of reading per class is utterly ridiculous, but that's fine because you don't have to do any of it - I actually kept up with HIST 263 reading because it was more reasonable, but I didn't even try with this one. Tests are very reasonable and only require information from the lectures. You unfortunately can't use a laptop in class and Snyder talks kind of quickly, so if you're a person who can't write fast, you might have a problem.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS YES TAKE IT",
    "This course is incredible. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and class is always very engaging. The material is interesting and I was always excited to learn about it.",
    "I'd say the class was enjoyable and anyone should take it. It really depends on what they want because its mostly readings and lecture and not any other assignments.",
    "Great course. Every student should take it before graduating.",
    "Here's a full rundown of this course: TIM SNYDER: Tim is an unbelievable lecturer, without a doubt. The guy speaks like 6 languages and knows more about communism than the president of yale dems. That being said, he's cocky as hell and will actually stop class to call you out if you're on your phone. You'll also likely never speak to him. SECTION: You're required to go and have one skip. Usually pretty easy to get full credit for section. READINGS: Way too long. You won't be able to do all of it, try to get at least some of it done. Not covered on exams so you can skip it all and be fine. EXAMS: We had two one hour exams with 5 dates, 5\/10 IDs, and 1\/3 essays. Pretty easy to hit B+\/A- range on these by just knowing the key terms and major themes. 70% of your grade is based on two hours of exams tho, which is kinda scary. Map quiz at the beginning of the class is a walk in the park. ELECTRONICS: Snyder has this whole thing where you can't use computers or phones in class. It's ridiculous. Half the kids don't take notes and the other half scribbles feverishly like crackheads loaded up on red bull. Usually you'll have one kid type up notes or find ones from last year and send them around. If you really bug the TAs hard enough they'll probably let you use a laptop. Also this class literally doesn't exist online, so the only materials you'll have are the key terms lists that they hand out every class. OVERALL: Interesting material. Cool professor. Bad organization. Class is technologically in the stone age. Graded material is few and questionable. My recommendation would be take it Credit\/D and just enjoy the lectures.",
    "Absolutely. The course covers a fascinating period in history and Professor Snyder does an excellent job in presenting the material.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking the class! Professor Snyder is amazing and the material taught is very interesting.",
    "Yes, Professors Snyder and Shore are very engaging and have a passion for the subject that is infectious",
    "Perfect course for a STEM student looking to take a relatively easy but simultaneously valuable HU credit.",
    "A must-take. Phenomenal course. Snyder is amazing.",
    "100% this is an awesome course, Snyder is an amazing lecturer and I learned so much",
    "Fantastic course.",
    "Yes, definitely! I'm a STEM major and took this as my Hu credit- it was very manageable, interesting, and I really feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Would ONLY recommend if you know you love the area of study, and want to do the readings passionately; DON'T take just because you've good things about Snyder, because frankly he was mediocre at best, especially compared to other big names of the history department like Chauncey, Magaziner, etc.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student at Yale. Snyder is a must-take professor and even if the material seems like something that wouldn't interest you, your mind will most likely change after taking the course. The workload is so bearable and the course is definitely suitable for a non-history major. Honestly, I hated history in high school but loved this course. It is so enlightening to learn about a region that is very underrated and whose history is not discussed in detail in your average European history course.",
    "Tim Snyder is a celebrity now. While his linking of Eastern European autocracy to contemporary authoritarian\/ethno-nationalist movements is putting him on TV, his real strength is being able to distill decades worth of political upheaval into a way that seems comprehensible, human, while being alternatively funny and tragic. Highly recommended! P.S. Feel free to only do as much of the reading as interest you -- it is never brought up midterms nor section.",
    "Yes, this is an excellent course that sis interesting and often helps us break through preconceived notions and ideas we didn't even know we had.",
    "Definitely! Professor Snyder might be the best lecturer I've had at Yale. However, I would recommend taking the first part of the course as well (pre-1914).",
    "You MUST take this course. It is not necessarily a lot of work, though it is a lot of reading. The tests are well designed and make sense, and you have a lot of options. I learned so much.",
    "Chill 5th class if you don't really do the reading, and Synder is great to listen to in lectures.",
    "Yes. This is the best class I've taken at Yale Snyder is the best professor I've had here, the subject matter is the most interesting and it's taught really well, and the TFs are super qualified.",
    "Yes, it is a great overview of twentieth-century European history and Professor Snyder is great to learn from. The exams are not too cumbersome, as they are both 1 hour (midterm and final) and comprise 5 IDs (you choose 5 out of the eight or ten provided), matching 5 dates (which are very obvious), and 1 essay (which you choose out of 3 prompts). You can easily get away with doing only a cursory skim of the readings -- the reading load is very high, but very few students do them all.",
    "Yes I would as long as the student knows that they will be devoting a large amount of time to this course because the readings are substantial, section takes a good amount of preparation, and the tests cover a lot of lectures.",
    "I wouldthe lectures were awesome and chock full of interesting and relevant information.",
    "Professor Snyder's lectures are incredible. The material is fascinating and many of the readings are fascinating as well. Overall, this is one of the best lecture courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class is not overrated at all. Definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely. Best class I've taken so far.",
    "Definitely recommend! Interesting lectures and doable class.",
    "Would 100% recommend. The lectures are incredible. The readings aren't great, and the cost of the course packet and additional books is ridiculous, but you can make it through the course almost entirely off the lectures. It's so interesting. Loved it.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Professor Snyder is an incredible professor--very knowledgeable, an intriguing lecturer, and a joy to speak to. Eastern Europe is frequently a geographic region whose history does not get explored, so this class is very eye-opening in that respect. It is a fairly manageable course with high rewards if sufficient effort is put into it.",
    "Absolutely, the best class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone. The lectures and readings are fantastic. Incredibly interesting material and Timothy Snyder is very entertaining. Amazing.",
    "Take this class professor Snyder is amazing and perfect",
    "I took Professor Snyder's fall term class (Eastern Europe to 1914) and absolutely loved it, so I took this second part and it did not disappoint. It's still jam-packed with Professor Snyder's standard brilliance and still covers material that is utterly compelling. I wondered if because this course covers a region of history I'm much more familiar with that there'd be less new material (I knew nothing about Eastern European history but have studied WWI and WWII plenty), but as it turns out there are massive swaths of important history left out of more traditional studies of this era, which tend to center on Western Europe. This class and the one before it has really given me a greater appreciation for the importance of Eastern Europe in understanding world history, while still providing me with a sophisticated intellectual framework to understanding the study of history in general. Professor Snyder is an incredibly intelligent and talented lecturer, constructing a thematic narrative of Eastern Europe that merges diplomatic, cultural, and intellectual history in a manner that illuminates historical trends and essential truths not just in Europe in the world at large. His insertion of dry humor and outlandish trivia jokes into his lectures really imbue them with an energy that sets them apart from lesser ones. That being said, lectures were occasionally disjointed. As much as I loved Professor Snyder's lectures, I think he did an overall better job of crafting a broad thematically coherent narrative of Eastern European history to 1914 (his fall survey course) rather than after 1914 (this one). There were a few lectures that were so dense and covered so much that they were difficult to follow, and on a class-by-class basis it wasn't always clear in which direction the class was moving. I found the lectures in the first half of the course (up until the end of WWII) to be better organized and more compelling than those in the second half, though again the lectures as a whole were great..They were generally incredibly compelling and illuminating, just like Professor Snyder himself. The readings were similarly excellent. Professor Snyder's books are fantastic (if not more than a little haunting), but the other course readings (1984, From Stalinism to Pluralism, etc.) are wonderful as well. This class's section, with my TA Kate Brackney, might have been the best section I've had so far at Yale, mostly thanks to the myriad ways we engaged with the course material, ways that really clarified and deepened my understandings of the themes covered in lecture. Any class with Professor Snyder is a great class, so make sure to take this (and the slightly better first part) before you leave Yale!",
    "If you wanna learn from THE master regarding European History, take this class. 100% recommend especially in this political climate.",
    "Yes!! This class teaches you about how history is connected and not every historical event is inevitable. Also, my world has opened to an entire region that I knew little about prior to the start of the course.",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Snyder's lecture are engaging, funny, sometimes awkward, and always interesting. He manages to give tiny fun anecdotes and also make broad theoretical points. This class helped me think about Europe in a different way. He assigns his own books, but that's ok because they're gripping. Section can be ridiculous if your TA does not tell you what to read, because there is way too much reading to do it all, so a lot of people just do none of it. If this class is offered again next year, you should take it, unless you are triple majoring, or unless you hate fun and interesting and useful classes. Marci Shore will guest lecture sometimes at random with almost no preparation, but she still nails it, and while I prefer Snyder's style and content, my roommate liked her lectures just as much or more.",
    "Absolutely, must take.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and the readings are compelling. However, if you're a student who doesn't do well in certain lecture environments, I would caution you against it. No laptops are allowed in class and so notetaking can only be done by hand. Professor Snyder also lectures very quickly and doesn't use any audio\/visuals aids. I had a difficult time adjusting at the start of the semester, but the course really grew on me and I learned a great deal. Just be prepared to jump in and don't be intimidated if you feel like you don't know enough at the start of the course.",
    "rovides important insights on global affairs of our days",
    "If you take this class, go to every lecture. It's only 50 minutes and with Snyder lecturing you'll be engaged for every second of it. Also if you go to every lecture it means the class isn't that hard , just do some of the readings and you'll be fine.",
    "Yes this course was incredible.",
    "Just take it!",
    "Great class! Snyder is very entertaining and loves history, and that comes across very clearly in his lectures. While the (non-Snyder) readings are kind of dry and tedious, and sections are generally not a great way to engage with the material, the class itself is phenomenal and not too much work. Highly recommend!",
    "Take this course!",
    "I found the course material fascinating, especially since I think Eastern Europe is an area that is not often discussed in American public education so there was a lot of new stuff for me to learn. I found the lectures very interesting - I think Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and effectively ties in the events of history to events happening today. However, there is a ton of reading assigned, and most of it is (honestly) pretty boring - lots of economic history of individual European states (although maybe you're into that kind of stuff). Take it if you're interested in the subject matter and willing to do lots of reading or some hard-core skimming.",
    "Absolutely! An amazing class in which I learned a ton. The material was so well organized!",
    "I definitely would. It is a brilliant, in-depth look at an important region of the world which is often overlooked in traditional history syllabuses on the world wars and high cold war politics. It will develop your understanding of both the unique histories of each country considered, and how they fit in to broader historical trends and political ideas.",
    "This class is amazing. Tim Synder is amazing. Even if don't think that you are particularly interested in Eastern Europe, take this class; you will learn about key moments in history from a new perspective, and also learn a lot more about how people and states react to horrible circumstances.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in Western history, politics, or sociology. It's been one of my favorite classes so far at Yale.",
    "The readings can be difficult to manage but when you learn on how to focus on certain pieces of information the class becomes amazing",
    "This course is amazing! Professor Snyder is well-liked among students for a reason. You will learn so much about Eastern Europe and get to be a part of Snyder's interesting lectures.",
    "This course provides an in-depth account of a region often relegated to a small paragraph in the history narrative. Professor Snyder is one of the best lecturers that I have ever had at Yale. This class is a must-take at Yale, even if its auditing the lectures.",
    "Excellent course, which widened my perspective on politics and history! I love that it covers very comprehensively the intellectual background of historical events.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was an engaging and extremely relevant course about an interesting time period in a region of the world not often studied in much detail. Snyder was a fantastic lecturer and managed to tie together complicated events in different countries into larger trends that made sense and that communicated the most important factors in the region."
