    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, even or perhaps especially for students who do have no background in Vietnamese studies. As the syllabus mentions, the readings are in translation so no Vietnamese is required (though it would certainly help -- I certainly wish I could have understood and appreciated the original texts.) I had no background in Vietnamese studies prior to this class and decided to take it based off a recommendation from a friend -- I'm really glad I did and would recommend you do the same. Reading is light, and while you don't have to intensely study every poem, short story, or novel assigned to prepare for class, you probably will read the materials anyway because Vietnamese and East Asian thought is so different from what we are normally exposed to. I for one found the materials to be super interesting, both ancient poetry and also modern short stories. We also watched several movies, and the professor is great. In summary, this is a great fifth class and I would recommend students both with and without backgrounds in Vietnamese studies to take this enjoyable course.",
    "It is a very interesting class, you will learn a great deal about Vietnamese literature and culture from this class.",
    "def take it. The final project was a large one, but you get to decide what it is. It's definitely an eye opening course."
