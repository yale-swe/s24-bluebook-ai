   "comments": [
    "YES. An essential class for any music major\/ serious music student. Training your ear is perhaps the most important aspect of becoming a musician or scholar and this class does that along with some rigorous rhythm training and keyboard work. Becoming a better musician in a relaxed environment --- the perfect class if you put in the time and effort.",
    "This class was great! Fun but I still feel like I learned a lot, and Lalli is a fantastic teacher. Highly recommended.",
    "With hesitation. Lalli is a wonderful man, and the skills you learn here can be truly valuable--drilling rhythms is something that every musician should have to do, and atonal dictation\/sightsinging is super important for choristers, at least. However, the class could have been much more focused and covered much more ground than it did."
