It might be good to get a sound system or something in the room though, because some of speakers and questioners were too soft-spoken to hear during the Q&A. Also, the food was a bit meh. That might just be because I'm vegetarian and picky though. Though free food is free food and I'm always glad to see it, whether it appeals to my palate or not."
