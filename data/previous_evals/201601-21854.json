   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend Science and Politics of Cancer to any student. It is a low stress class that offers flexibility in the midterm and final essays. You learn a lot of stuff about the importance (or lack of) specific cancer tests and the history and politics surrounding them.",
    "Take this class. Just take it. Whether you're a STEM person or not, you'll love it. You will get a basic understanding of the biology of cancer and have the opportunity to discuss political and social aspects related to cancer treatment, too. Not to mention the fact the Professor Bazell brings in several prominent members of the cancer and genetics fields to speak.",
    "Great class. Professor Bazell is great and clearly knows what he's talking about. He took anonymous criticism well and used it to improve the class over the course of the semester. I definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in cancer at all. I'm a history major and loved the class. It ends up with a great mix of science\/medicine and history\/political science people which makes for really great discussions. There is some science at the beginning of the year but it is entirely manageable.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in cancer research.",
    ".A great class, especially if you are a non-science major and want to get rid of your Sc credit in a really fun and non-gutty way. Bazell is a really friendly guy who is always there to answer questions and ensure that students understand the material. Easy to do well in this class as long as you speak in class, ask questions, and stay engaged in the material (which isn't hard to do since most of it is interesting). Participation is everything though!",
    "It is a very discussion-based course with a lot of freedom for how you want the class tailored for you. There will be a lot of science and a lot of politics, and you will learn so many useful things about cancer. Amazing course.",
    "The Science and Politics of Cancer is a very approachable and informative class especially for non-science major students. It is heavier on the science than the politics but you have a lot of liberty to explore the political aspects of cancer in the papers. Professor Bazell is very knowledgeable and leads terrific discussions.",
    "This is a great course for both science and non-science students to learn a tremendous amount about cancer, the controversies surrounding it and new breakthroughs. The readings are manageable, entertaining, and extremely interesting. As a STEM person I feel that I learned so much from this class and that it even helped with my biology class because it supplemented many of the basic concepts we covered. Bazell picks tremendous readings, is very receptive to the needs and desires of the class, and he also brings in really great and super interesting speakers towards the end. The work is tremendously manageable and I never felt overwhelmed or stressed by this class, rather it was a time to learn about sincerely interesting topics and not worry about super critical and difficult papers but just about the process of learning. There is a midterm and final topic but you can choose literally anything and I got super passionate about both of my topics and it made writing really enjoyable. The class starts out a little slow but really gets going and it is a great opportunity to learn from such an interesting and experienced man about such an important topic.",
    "It's a freshmen seminar. Take it!",
    "Science and Politics is a wonderful seminar for anyone interested in the basic science and biology of cancer, as well as the societal implications of cancer diagnosis, the cancer \"industry\" and the politics of cancer research. Professor Bazell is very knowledgable and invites engaging and relevant guest speakers. Despite the small class size and few papers, this course is far from a \"gut\". In order to participate in discussion, assigned readings must be completed thoroughly. Definitely recommend to any freshman!",
    "Amazing course everyone should have the chance to take as it is something that affects everyone in some way. You get out what you put in; there's a lot of reading and if you do that, ask questions, and participate, you'll do great in the class.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend only if the student were extremely interested in cancer or needed a science credit."
