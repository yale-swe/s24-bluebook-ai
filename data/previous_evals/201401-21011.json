    "good review of first two levels",
    "Absolutely recommend taking this class with Sybil Alexandrov. Despite much of the material being mechanical (and review), she will make sure you stay engaged in what is going in the class. She truly cares about how we do and encourages students to speak. My classmates and I always seemed to have fun in her class.",
    "This is a basic-intermediate Spanish speaking, writing, and grammar class! You basically learn a few units of vocabulary (travel, emotions, health, etc.) paired with a bunch of units on grammar. You write a handful of ~300-500 word essays in response to an image to practice your writing. Though they are tedious, they really help you identify common mistakes that you make in your writing. You will also read a handful of short stories in your course packet. These are great for learning new vocabulary and practicing your reading comprehension! The class is basically conducted in Spanish so you get your daily fill of Spanish speaking practice. I really recommend this if you're trying to learn Spanish! L3 is really solid and super well-organized (thanks to Yale's awesome Spanish department)!",
    "Basically, don't take it if you're not a freshman and old enough to know better. The class wasn't all bad and my teacher (Alexandrov) was consistently well-prepared and engaging the class. The curriculum, however, is fundamentally flawed in my opinion. Too top-down, which doesn't allow individual sections to take initiative and do cool stuff. The stories (cuentos) that you'll have to read are the nadir of the course--absolutely miserable. No teacher can fix a bad curriculum, so I would not recommend taking this course."
