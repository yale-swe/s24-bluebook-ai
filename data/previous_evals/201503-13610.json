   "comments": [
    "Interesting class providing a theoretical framework to understand politics. Workload is manageable: 6 psets with 2 questions each. 3 exams are fairly easy.",
    "Political economics is a good class that probably would not be appealing to a lot of people. Its like the light version of a graduate course on political economics. That means all the material is formal, mathematical models. Its perfect for someone thinking about graduate school, and I think it offers a lot for students who are just generally interested in getting acquainted with the research in this field. However, if you are not keen on math, or if the political half of this courses title interests you way more than the economics half, I doubt this course would be enjoyable for you.",
    "This is a great but hard class. Completely theoretical, very mathematical, and challenging. Models can be hard to grasp, and even harder to know well enough to be confident for the exams. Very well taught (definitely attend lecture and listen to everything Prof Weese says). The material is great for those who love theoretical econ (particularly game theory). Exams are fair and well graded. The class is 20% biweekly problem sets and 80% exams",
    "A very ok course. Not much work at all, with problem sets and three midterms. I think this was the first year for the course, so it was a little disorganized at times. Weese did a good job of explaining things in class, but problem sets were based on the textbook. The textbook was ridiculously hard, making psets and exams (taken from the book problems) impossible.",
    "Political Economics is a fascinating field, shedding light on how the systems that we have in place in this country is not as democratic as we think it is, but the mathematical approach that we used in this class was rather dry. Take it only if you are comfortable with complicated math models (more complicated than 121, about the same as 350), but past the math, the concepts are not difficult. The workload is rather light too, with psets about once a fortnight, each taking less than 2 hours.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in political science and if you are comfortable with the sort of thinking that goes along with economic models. It is difficult and there is a lot of content, but we tracked the textbook so it was easy enough to learn if you put in the time. Exams were not easy, but they were predictable.",
    "Not a huge workload but also not exceptionally interesting. Involves a lot of math and I would generally get lost in lecture part way through. Tests are straight out of the book and the homework is not hard, so no problems there. Take if interested in the intersection of political science and economics. If you're just looking for a random interesting econ seminar to get the major done, I'd probably suggest looking elsewhere.",
    "Take this. You will not regret. You will learn lots, and you will thank yourself."
