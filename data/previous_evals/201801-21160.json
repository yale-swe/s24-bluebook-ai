    "Very interesting overview of India's economy since Partition",

    "Learned about the economy of India since 1947 (decolonization).",
    "I learned all about India's economic history, their current economic challenges and successes, and what faces them in the future. We went over different parts of India's management of the economy including fiscal, monetary, and tax policy, and also examined each major sector and their prospects going forward. There also was a lot of reading so I got a lot better at managing that and reading what's important too.",
    "The course explores India's economic history from independence to the present day and the trends, ideas and important figures that shaped that history. It also looks at India's current economic situation and what needs to happen for India's economy to continue to prosper.",
    "I learned a lot about India both in terms of history and economics. I also gained a great deal of knowledge about developing economies and the struggles they face.",
    "I learned a lot about India's economy, particularly in the last three decades."

    "Professor Mohan is super experienced and knowledgable. Sections are pointless and should be eliminated (with good reason!). No one in the class knows the intricacies of the INdian economy well enough to provide insightful discussion, so discussion was 100% regurgitation of lecture notes. Furthermore, Professor went over almost every single class by 5 or even 10 minutes and almost never covered all of his slides. This should be an hour-15 minute lecture with no section!",
    "The material isn't interesting and the professor is boring. It was so hard to concentrate.",
    "Unfortunately, there's a stark discrepancy between what you learn and what your expected to learn (i.e. what questions are asked on the exam). Prof. Mohan, his teaching fellows, and the readings approach the economy from a macro point-of-view, yet the exam asks about policy programs and trends that maybe were discussed for 1 minute.",
    "The most obvious strength was Professor Mohan: his vast knowledge and experience regarding the Indian economy is something you can't get anywhere else. He is also extremely down to earth and approachable. The TA's were very accessible and open to any suggestions on how to improve the course midway through. I thought that the guest lectures were incredible and I would have definitely welcomed the opportunity to have more throughout the semester. I also wish that more time would be dedicated to speaking about what Professor Mohan thinks of India's future (we only spent one lecture on that). Additionally, I would have liked to delve deeper into his areas of expertise and leave out the others that he said were necessary to go over, but wasn't quite as enthusiastic about like poverty and education. He can still assign readings on this to give us an idea but I also realize the design of this course was to go over all facets of India's economy rather than focus on a few.",
    "I feel that I have a very firm grasp on India's economic history and current economic circumstances, although I do feel that some of the lecture material did sometimes overlap with past material.",
    "The material can be quite dry at times.",
    "I would appreciate a greater variety in assignment structure, perhaps several smaller assignments rather than only 2 big assignments\/assessments."

    "Yes, super interesting. But make it an hour-15 minute lecture with no section. No one in the class knows the intricacies of the Indian economy well enough to provide insightful discussion, so discussion was 100% regurgitation of lecture notes. Furthermore, Professor went over almost every single class by 5 or even 10 minutes and almost never covered all of his slides. It would be much more conducive to learning to listen to an extra 50 minutes of lecture a week as opposed to reading back class notes in section.",
    "This course was interesting and well-taught. Professor Mohan is really an expert on Indian economics and has special insight since he actually played a big role in India's liberalizing its economy. This class is worth taking if you need an economics credit or are particularly interested in India. The only issues I had with the course were that there are far too many assigned readings each week, making it very difficult to actually keep up with them, and the readings themselves are quite dry. Overall though, I would recommend this course.",
    "If you're looking for an econ gut, this is the one. Midterm paper and take-home 24 hr final, so little work. Attendance is mandatory tho.",
    "No. You're better off reading \"India: Emerging Giant\" by Arvind Panagariya and taking a class that's actually worthwhile.",
    "I would highly recommend to anyone interest in learning more about India's economy.",
    "Not really. Its not a ton of work and you do have the opportunity to learn quite a bit, but the material is very dry and while Mohan is clearly very accomplished, he is not a great lecturer.",
    "Absolutely!"
