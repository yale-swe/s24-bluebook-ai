    "I would recommend it to other students - it provided a good basis of a lot of different aspects of pharmacology.",
    "Pharm I is an overview of drug action, design and metabolism in the beginning, and then it goes into specific medications used in the treatment of diseases like cancer, athsma, infections and transplant rejection. I would recommend the course to a student who knows they are interested in pharmacology and is unsure of what disease model they would like to work with, since it gives a good overview of hot areas in pharmacology. However, if they know what disease they would like to work with it might not be as useful."

    "The introductory lectures were the most helpful since they gave an overview of drug discovery and I would like to work on identifying good drug targets. This will help me understand how drugs are designed to help look for better targets. Also, knowing how some drugs are used in the lab was helpful. However, I plan on working on drugs affecting the central nervous system, which was not covered."
