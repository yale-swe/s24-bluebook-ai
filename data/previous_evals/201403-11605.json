    "I learned a lot from this course, on R programming skills, sample size calculations, pilot studies, and, more importantly, on how to interact with the investigators and how to present the results. Here is a little thoughts on the course when there are a large number of students in the class. You might want to do group projects with one leader and different members in each group can work on different aspects of the projects and everyone gets at least one chance to present throughout the whole semester. In the final presentation, maybe only the leaders will present.",
    "Overall, the course was helpful in gaining experience on communicating and collaborating with a clinician. Getting feedback from different faculty in an informal setting was a good way of learning. Strengths: - Discussing projects regularly was a good way to organize one's thoughts and practice how to present as well as learn about various other projects from different aspects of medicine such as cardiology, psychiatry, cancer genetics, etc. - The informal and welcoming environment of the class was conducive to interesting discussions. - Working with clinicans helped in learning a lot about how to best communicate ideas to non-statisticians. The hands on experience went beyond what we would learn in a classroom. - Class gives you a better understanding of what the actual profession entails. Weaknesses: - For the future, it might be helpful if students also started on the writing and reviewing process earlier and got as much feedback on their writing and reviewing skills from peers and professors as they did for the oral presentation \/ communication and data analysis parts. The regular feedback was helpful in understanding areas of improvement for data analysis and presentation and it would help in improving writing as well.",
    "We can discuss many practical issues in the class, which helped me learn a lot. And the presentation and review of write up provide good experience. The form of class is good. Denise is really humorous and the coffee is very good.",
    "It's a useful course in enhancing our presentation skills. Many techniques were talked about, such as writing R package, creating web app. However we didn't get a chance to use them in practice. It would be better if they are put in the homework.",
    "The course is very good, providing us a chance to learn how to present our works and communicate with others."

They helped students find projects, took personal interest in each student's project and provided useful constructive criticism over the course of the semester. - The informal environment of class made it easy for students to ask questions and have engaging discussions. - They gave honest insight into the different aspects of consulting, letting students know about the rewarding and exciting parts as well as the challenging parts of being a statistician.",
