    "I would say its a focused class on medieval Egypt, which was an incredibly fascinating (and fairly unique state). I would easily recommend it to another student - it's a really cool subject to study.",
    "Very solid overview of Mamluk period of Egypt. Covers economic, social, political, foreign relations issues, and goes into interesting details about specific problems during the time (Spice Trade, Waqf lands, organization of the army, wars with the Mongols and Crusaders, effects of the plague etc)."
