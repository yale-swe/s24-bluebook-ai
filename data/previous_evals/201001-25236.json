   "comments": [
    "Summary of the development of Islamic theology, some early debates. I would recommend it if you want to know a little more about Islam but probably not as a general introductory course.",
    "If you want to learn about Islamic history and theology - do it! It's really fascinating stuff and Griffel is a good guy to learn from.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for students who have an good background in the basic tenets and terms of Islam. He teaches as if everyone has had some sort of basis in the material and your questions are expected to be about the new material, not basics about the religion.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in the topic, regardless of any prior knowledge in the material. The class is very easy to understand, there's not a lot of work, you can probably get by without doing the readings, and its really really interesting.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to learn about Islam, this is the class to take.",
    "I would recommend this class, but it would be helpful to have some basic knowledge of Christianity and Judaism first.",
    "Prof. Griffel is a great lecturer. This class is really interesting but deals with a lot of obscure and complex theological ideas that may not have a lot of relevancy to other areas of investigation.",
    "Very interesting, makes you think. Definitely take it if you're interested in theological debates.",
    "take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, who is looking for a more in-depth understanding of Islam from a theological standpoint. It's important to understand the theological history as much as it is to understand the political history.",
    "This is a serious theology\/philosophy class, with a lot of Arabic names and words to memorize. You will also spend a while debating slight variants on a theme, and will read a lot of medieval philosophy. If that sounds fun, hooray, if that sounds horrible don't take this class.",
    "Very interesting material, very engaging professor and relatively easy exams. I would take it again!",
    "I would definitely take the class if you are interested in the subject matter. You learn a lot about the various concepts that Islamic philosophers and theologians have grappled with over the centuries.",
    "Excellent course for beginners and advanced students of Islam and the middle East. Griffel is concise, thorough and interesting. Take it to understand what is happening today .",
    "I expected to enjoy this class more than I did based on the first several lectures. If you are looking to learn about how the major Islamic theologians\/philosophers over history have interpreted the scripture, and that's all, then this is the course for you. I think perhaps I was looking for a class with a different angle and thus sometimes the information we were learning tended to feel either disjointed\/disorganized or lacking in a greater significance. So in the end I don't think I would have taken this class if I had known what it would have been like, but I think others might enjoy it.",
    "Definitely take the course; it is a good class on Islamic thought and opens one's mind to the diversity of thought in the Muslim world; the fact that the class ends by discussing modern islamic issues like fundamentalism and jihad is a great way to see the historic imprint of these thoughts",
    "Yes take this class. Professor Griffel is amazing and unbelievably knowledgeable.",
    "Interesting course that gives you a broad overview of the different theological positions within Islam. Sunnism and Shiism of course become much clearer by the end of the course, but you learn about many other religious and political movements as well. It functions like a survey course, so if you want to study this material more in-depth, take a seminar. Professor Griffel teachesone on the Salafiyya movement, which is supposed to be very good. His lectures are quite energetic and he is clearly excited about teaching.",
    "This class is a comprehensive way to learnt he foundations of Islam and to understand its importance in the Middle East society form its very origins.",
    "I would recommend this class. The subject matter is very important -- I came in without any knowledge of Islamic theology, and left with a basic understanding which informs me about a myriad of political and current issues.",
    "Take it to learn about Islam, if you've got a little background already. A lot of the arguments are old and confusing, and it takes some effort to get yourself into a mindset where they make sense. Still, if you know something about Islam and want a more detailed understanding about the theology - how God has been thought about and talked about over the years - then take the course.",
    "Professor Griffel is a great lecturer.",
    "Definitely recommend it--I learned a lot!"
