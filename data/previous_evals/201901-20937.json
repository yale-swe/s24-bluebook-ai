    "to learn to speak French",
    "This course was amazing!!!! Not only did my French improve tremendously, but I'm now able to communicate my ideas in French more thoughtfully! I have fallen in love with the language, all thanks to Mme. Skorupa. The texts and films were very interesting, and I truly enjoyed the video exchange with Telecom-ParisTech. If you want to improve your language skills immensely and have an enjoyable class experience for two hours every day, take this course!",
    "Learning French. This class is so awesome, I am glad I took it instead of L3",
    "Improved French ability through an introduction to some classic French writers: Camus, Gide, etc.",
    "I learned Yales standard for French levels 3&4.",
    "Improved my French greatly, increased vocabulary and more advanced grammatical structures"

    "There is a lot, I mean, a lot of work. The amount of homework is excessive and I can't understand how the professor can grade all of that. I am worried about her own mental sanity because the work is too much. There are many activities that can be eliminated because they are unnecessary. It is much better to have quality over quantity in your activities, but our productivity and quality gets affected because of the insane amount of work.",
    "Strengths: EVERYTHING Weaknesses: NOTHING (although you have to be willing to work for your grades!)",
    "This class had 11 other students, we were engaged throughout our work, and it might get a difficult to keep up the work but you will learn a lot. One thing I'd want to tell people is that if your grammar isn't that great, you need to work on it. Most of the time you are learning about cultures and new vocabs.",
    "The French department here is very good, and we seem to have good French students, so no complaints there. This course is, overall, well-structured and facilitates learning French, though there are some drawbacks. The homework was at times a bit much. This is an intensive course, but much of the homework after a certain point felt like busy-work. The self-corrected worksheets that have a corresponding audio take FOREVER to do, not because they're hard, but because the audio moves at a snail's pace, and when you're doing corrections (which are also in the audio clip), for some reason they repeat the entire phrase or question before giving you the associated answer. A worksheet that should take you 10 minutes to do, audio and all, is usually elongated to 30 minutes of sitting there and listening to the painful 30 second pauses in between parts. And the way the audio clip is designed, it doesn't allow for you to easily skip around until you get to the relevant parts, so oftentimes you have to sit through the entire thing, pauses and all. And in a given night, you might have multiple worksheets of this nature. And, sometimes, the corrections in the audio are incorrect or don't match with the written worksheet. The texts we read were mostly fine, though there were some that were downright boring to the point of tears. But that's a matter of personal preference. Some people loved the texts I hated, and vice versa. Grading was at times harsh, but fair."

    "Yes. If you are serious about learning French, there is no better way than with intensive. If you are willing to put in the work, and approach it with a positive, fun, attitude, the class can be a blast.",
    "If the student was willing to put forth the effort and if they were eager to learn French, then yes."
