    "This was a wonderful (experiment of a) class. It would have been helpful to receive readings earlier--say, before the weekend preceding the next class session. Class discussions also had the tendency to be dominated by the more extroverted or opinionated students. Overall, though, it was a very good experience, and working with artists was truly a valuable part of the learning process.",
    "It was wonderful to have a class with students from outside the law school to bring different disciplinary perspectives, and to interact with artists within the law school context. Each class was really interesting, but I think the next time this course is offered, the through-line could more coherent, as it wasn't necessarily clear how different class sessions related to one another or what they were building towards. Thank you for making this class happen!",
    "This was a wonderful class--I loved the interdisciplinary nature of the course and how multifaceted the curriculum was. It took a tremendous amount of work for Jim and especially David to put this class together, and I am deeply grateful. It was such a pleasure to meet students from so many different graduate schools within Yale about topics we all cared about deeply. Thank you for a fantastic experience--I will carry this class with me many years after I graduate, I know.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing! I couldn't believe how much material they were able to gather that was so on point and current. Having students from the other schools was an incredible experience. I feel so lucky to have been a part of this.",
    "I genuinely loved this course and respected the spirit behind it. This was a rare opportunity to engage with students across different disciplines with a range of professional goals and approaches to research. I found it valuable and challenging to push myself outside of the tropes, assumptions, and frameworks sometimes unintentionally adopted in my field (I am not a YLS student). I also appreciated that the course required a variety of types of work from us (short informal writing shared with the class, a critical essay, clinical work, a research paper, etc), rather than purely reading and writing a single final paper. It was helpful to use different parts of my brain, give myself permission to share unfinished ideas, and to write creatively. That said, it definitely felt like a lot to keep up with some weeks. I also would have liked the course to have included more legal and policy readings, as it was heavily theoretical. I did appreciate the range of range of artistic material addressed, including documentary photography, contemporary installation art, theater, poetry, propaganda videos, and documentary film. I wanted to note especially that David, the course assistant, was excellent at leading discussion and finding ways to incorporate the thoughts of each student in productive ways. I especially appreciated the fact that he consistently sent the group follow up thoughts, articles, resources, etc via email throughout the semester, a practice that was also adopted by other members of the seminar, which made for a comfortable atmosphere of community learning. I feel like I developed a group of allies across campus with whom I'm excited to continue to engage moving forward.",
    "This was a wonderful seminar - probably my favorite academic class in law school. It was clear that both David and Jim cared deeply for the students and for the subject matter, and I really appreciated the effort and thought that went into planning the seminar, facilitating class discussions, and out-of-class guidance. I feel very lucky to have been able to have this experience!"
