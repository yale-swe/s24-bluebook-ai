    "go for it, especially if you want a fun, engaging class you'll pay attention too--but only do this if you love lit!",
    "DS Literature is great and the second semester is full of really amazing stuff. Professor Semk is very nice, and class discussions were very relaxed and inclusive. He can be a tough grader; it seemed like he was trying to prove something by grading us harshly because it was his first year teaching Directed Studies. Our class discussions were a little bit stilted and awkward compared to other sections, mostly because he was new, I think. That should definitely improve with time.",
    "Directed Studies Literature covers the latter half of the Western cannon in literature including works from Petrarch, Cervantes, Tolstoy, and Borges. Definitely a very worthy syllabus; the combination of rotating lectures and the small discussion groups with professors is certainly quite unique.",
    "Take DS Lit, if you love reading and writing! It is a fantastic course with many of the greatest professors that Yale has to offer. If you take DS, really try to stay on top of your work, otherwise you won't get as much out of this great program as you could and should. Prof. Semk is a great teacher with many interesting insights and he will definitely make you enjoy the readings.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies. It is about as much work as you can assign yourself freshman year, but more than worth it. Also although it is time consuming the work itself is not particularly strenuous-- a lot of reading, that's all, and a 5 pg paper that you whip out by the end of the year. The professors and the small seminars make it all worthwhile. The Directed Studies environment is incredibly intellectually stimulating and makes you feel part of a community instantly at yale.",
    "Readings: Petrarch, Don Quixote, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Goethe, Tolstoy, Proust, TS Elliott, Wallace Stevens, Borges. Amount of reading per week varies greatly, since it can sometimes just be a few poems, but at other times it can be as much as a whole volume of War and Peace (that is, if you haven't finished the reading over break). There are three papers, each worth 20% of your grade, and a final exam, which isn't difficult. I would recommend this enthusiastically to any student who has taken the first semester of DS -- I don't understand why anyone would ever want to drop. The first semester is the groundwork for understanding the second semester, and vice versa. You'll feel so accomplished when you walk out of your last DS exam, and you will have learned SO MUCH in one year.",
    "Directed Studies Literature will only be rewarding for a student who is extremely motivated and who will actually complete the tremendous amount of reading assigned for each week.",
    "I would recommend DS overall, but would warn them that literature was the least stimulating course of the program.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a very interesting survey of post-Enlightenment literature, but the readings can seem somewhat random at times. Even so, I would definitely recommend the course if you are even remotely interested in Western Literature, and Professor Semk was a great section leader.",
    "I enjoyed Literature a lot because it forced me to read works that I think are important for every educated reader to have read, but I would caution students that the pace of the class is very fast and often left me either not being able to finish the book or else feeling like I didn't have a solid grip on it.",
    "Second semester Lit has a lot of great works that I\u0092m really glad to have read in a seminar setting. It was also a nice break from the frequent reinterpretation of the epic in first semester (Paradise Lost does fall into this category, but it\u0092s a very different reinterpretation), which is something to consider for those deciding whether to continue with DS. In any case, Dr. Semk was a very good professor \u0096 he guided discussion without dominating it or allowing it to get too far off track. He was also very enthusiastic and gave good feedback along with fairly generous grades."
