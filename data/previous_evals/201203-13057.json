    "The course can only introduce the basics of moldmaking and casting... however, it's amazing that this course even exists and I know I'll be using what I learned in my own work.",
    "Art 125 is an excellent introductory course for learning how to construct molds and to cast everyday objects. Imagination is key to this class and although there is a structured core for skills that one will develop, the class certainly does not limit one's ability to create things that they find interesting. This along with the knowledge of the instructors will definitely put someone who is thinking about looking to work in this area on the right track. Another plus is that even if one has no previous art experience, this class is still quite manageable and fun. At times, this class was quite time consuming, but it really depends on what you choose to do for any particular project. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in it. Preferable take it with a friend cuz the hours are long"
