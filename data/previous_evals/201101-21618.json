   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class, but it definitely helps to have prior knowledge of the Middle East. She almost exclusively admitted students that had background knowledge, which obviosuly makes for better discussion.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in UNDERSTANDING the thinking in the middle east better.... not a class to take if you are looking to understand things right away... makes you question your assumptions",
    "Great class. Unique readings. Dynamic conversation if you get the right mix of people.",
    "If you are interested in the Middle East, you should definitely take this class. Workload was manageable and subject matter is very relevant. If you have an interesting group of kids in your seminar, it should be enjoyable.",
    "If you want a great class, a class that will get to ask the right questions and take time to challenge preconceived notions that have been taken for granted, this is the class you are looking for!",
    "Good class, though I'd recommend maybe even taking it Cred\/D. Lawrence did a great job facilitating discussion, and the other students in the class were great. Not sure if this course is being taught next year (Professor Lawrence will be on leave), but I had fun.",
    "Middle East Exceptionalism is a great poli sci seminar for any student interested in the Middle East. It should be noted that many of the students in the class are very well informed on the Middle East so do not take it unless you already have some background on the region. I had taken one introductory Middle East class and still felt far less equipped than much of the class. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the class discussions. Prof. Lawrence is great at leading discussions. The readings are not at all excessive which made for good discussions because most people actually did the reading. The writing assignments were not easy but there are only 3 in the semester (besides the final paper) so it's never overwhelming. Overall not too much work\/very informative\/great discussions=awesome class.",
    "This is an exploration of the the various methods that academics have used to either support or debunk the hypothesis that the Middle East is essentially and measurably different from all other parts of the the world, whether because of Islam, oil, ancestral tribal culture, peculiar economic traditions, orso forth. As such, the variety of readings is vast, and every student is bound to find something engaging: perhaps the article about Islamic economic practices, or that which finds the root of female oppression in rentier goods, or the book about suppressed hadiths related by women. Take this class; as the Middle East rises to prominence and importance in the modern world, it is more necessary than ever to understand it - and, in contradistinction, to understand ourselves - and this class will help.",
    "Take this class if you're into what makes the Middle East particular",
    "This is an excellent course if you're interested in applying some broader themes of development and culture to your understanding of the Middl East. Make sure you take a look at the syllabus before you enroll to get a feel for the material. The readings were excellent and the discussions, interesting."
