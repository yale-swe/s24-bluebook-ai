    "Amazing course; I truly did learn a lot. The speakers were incredible as well. However, I would like to know more about how technical skills we learn throughout our public health program can be applied to global health research or occupations. It would be beneficial for us to receive more baseline understanding of the global health sphere (the unilateral organizations, other major players, SDGs, etc.) in the beginning. I know some topics were covered by the speakers, but knowing these concepts at the beginning can help provide us better insight throughout the lectures.",
    "The course syllabus is very comprehensive and the guest speakers were well selected and represented different backgrounds. I'm not a public health student and despite my limited background in global health, I felt I received enough guidance from the instructor and the TFs in my final project",
    "I thought that the lectures were generally interested but a bit disjointed...i.e. no linear flow. My favorite lectures were the ones where we discussed case studies!!",
    "if you combined the ethics seminar, epi of violent conflict course and the global health seminar, that was this course. it felt repetitive of all of the aforementioned classes. there was even a lecture by a guest lecturer that was the exact lecture given during the fall 2015 global health seminar and the individual project was near identical to the final individual project of the violent conflict course.",
    "I only took this course because it is required for the global health concentration, and I was dreading it because it was an evening class at the end of a day full of classes for me. However, every week our lectures and guest speakers were fantastic. The topics seemed a little disjointed from week to week, but I always found myself completely engaged during class, and I feel much more prepared now to think about global health research dynamics. As I plan a very unstructured internship in a low income country, I am very glad I've taken this course. One thing I really disliked about this course is that our weekly assignments were due 3 days before class on Monday, but they were rarely posted before the weekend. This left a very small window of time to complete the assignment, and I often ended up scrambling to finish my write-ups late Monday night. It would be *so* helpful in the future if we could have access to assignments at least 5 days before they're due. I also felt like our main project--the grant proposal--was very disjointed from the rest of the class. Even though I learned a lot through writing the proposal, what I learned in the course did not help me write my proposal at all, and I felt unprepared and stressed out by the assignment.",
    "Great course with accessibility to a range of public health topics, practitioners and researchers.",
    "Absolutely fascinating course that was really made powerful by guest speakers. Every week there was at least one expert who provided incredible insights into our topic through their personal experiences. This course was really an in depth exploration of these specific topics and not an introduction to global health, which is exactly what I was looking for.",
    "I liked this course after i went through the first couple classes. At first i did not enoy the reading responses but i realize the importance of them after i thought back to the knowledge i gained from having to critically read the assignments. I also enjoyed the final product. At first it was frustrating to come up with a topic that i did not really feel could be feasible but after i was able to think about what i really wanted to do i was able to find a topic that actually could be implemented and would be enjoyable. i learned so much while researching my topic and i was actually quite proud of my proposal by the end of it.",
    "Interesting and varied guest speakers",
    "I entered this course hoping to expand my knowledge of global health issues and to become more familiar with the terminology. While I leave the course with a broad understanding of the concepts of global health, I feel as if the course was an extension of a public health student's education. The instructor often asked students to tell him whether or not the students had covered a topic in a previous public health course so as not to repeat the information. This course, however, was open to medical, nursing, and PA students who often do not have the time to take public health courses but remain interested in global health. In the future, I think it may be beneficial to recognize the diverse professions included in the course and to not try to avoid overlapping content with public health courses. I also wish there had been more clinical application. While the majority of students were public health students, I think this class would serve as a great opportunity to introduce them to the clinical side of global health (just as healthcare students are exposed to research, advocacy, etc.). The class serves as a wonderful opportunity for collaboration and recognizing each profession's role in global health.",
    "It's a very good course which covers many issues in Global Health",
    "This class was an eye opener for me on the field of Global Health. Kaveh was a great instructor in that he was able to answer our questions and engage in discussions about student concerns. He took every question seriously and brought in experts that could help in answering additional questions. This course is also the only class that I have had at YSPH where the instructor brings in a diverse amount of guest lecturers. Guest lecturers were diverse, from all around the world and honest. It was refreshing to have opinions outside of the typical white men that are brought in during most other EMD courses.",
    "Really good class. great topics and experts invited to the class",
    "-enjoyed the assignments -would have been helpful to have the reflections due on Tuesday\/Wednesday, so we would not forget about the readings by the time class came on Thursday -enjoyed the case-based discussions and debate exercises -would have been helpful to learn about frameworks and approaches to developing proposals and addressing global public health issues -guest speakers were great, but some overlapped with speakers from the global health seminar",
    "The course was not a good overview of Critical Issues in GH - it seemed to be a repeat of the 1st semesters global health speaker series. We spent hours during the week working on reading responses and then rarely discussed in class. Final project was a great exercise - however it would have been more helpful and to have segments of the course teach us the methodology for proposing a research question or intervention in the global setting. For instance, teach us about what are clear issues in global health so that as students we can pick a topic that is relevant to issues today. Perhaps have a speaker series the first half of class, then use the second half to teach us how to identify stakeholders and the importance of choosing the correct stakeholders.",
    "Strength was the guest lecturers from vastly different fields of global health. I really enjoyed that. I also really liked having weekly reading responses as an incentive for reading and that you get 2 excuses. Although I did not like that we had to read way ahead of the time by Monday when the class is on Thursday.I felt like I was really excited about the topic, but had to wait too long to hear about it.",
    "Great course, liked the proposal project a lot. Though, even though it is a foundation course, I'm not sure if I walked away with any new knowledge of the current state of specific global health issues and current events. We mostly talked about the debate about what global health means, and ethics, but I have no idea what the global burden of disease is. Really enjoyed the case study classroom discussions!",
    "I really liked how this course allowed students to discuss and debate specific case studies in class. I acknowledge that this course is intended to be a high-level overview of global health issues, but I think the course was a bit too high-level. I didn't feel like I gained any in-depth knowledge of the topic areas. I might suggest having this course follow more of a case-study approach, where students would read a particular case study for homework and have presentations\/discussions in class. The weekly reading responses were very repetitive and I would have loved to have explored other individual\/group writing assignments that may reflect the type of real-world work we would conduct in global health. Also I really enjoyed writing the final paper proposal. However, I think it would have been useful to have a session or two about what kind of writing style\/structure is most effective at conveying your arguments\/ideas in this type of proposal assignment",
    "Very poor course. Kaveh doesn't teach Critical Issues in GH. He brings in seminar speakers, which defeats the whole purpose of taking both this class and the GH seminar. Scholnik actually taught what GH was and what the issues were.",
    "The global heath topics and regions covered in this course is great. The speakers are real practitioners and talks are informative.",
    "This class suffered from a lack of structure and organization. Each week covered disparate topics with guest lecturers and there was a lack of continuity and connection between topics, so none of the information really stuck. The only time I actually felt I learned something was when completing my weekly reading assignments. The individual project is an interesting idea, but ended up being somewhat useless because the TFs and Professor Khoshnood didn't know enough about each students specific topic to be very helpful with their comments. The class need to be restructured and perhaps eliminate the guest speakers.",
    "It is an excellent course",
    "Strengths: Range of diverse topics covered (I really enjoyed learning about many new areas in Global Health that I was not familiar with). Case discussions that are representative of the real life circumstances (should do more of those). Ways to improve: Having better guidelines for the final project. It might have been a little too open ended - which might have been the point of it all too. But it was a bit difficult navigating around it in the beginning. Maybe have some variation in homeworks. It might be interesting to allow students to do their own research on a current topic in global health and write about it, or something like that - for those weekly summaries.",
    "Course was really interesting and explored issues in global health not usually covered by coursework. The reading responses required as homework didn't add anything to the understanding of the week's lecture or guest speaker."

I would have liked to hear more about his specific line of work--I think that would have added a lot of value to the course. I really liked his case-study approach of teaching during the semesters.

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Professor Khoshnood is such a kind, intelligent professor. However, I do not feel his talent and strengths as a professor were highlighted well in this class. Each week there was a guest lecturer, which ended up making the class feel very fragmented and disorganized. For future version of the course, Professor Khoshnood should take on a larger role in actually leading and teaching the class because I think he would be great at it.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He is an excellent teacher",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Maybe begin the seminar\/guest lecture series with you and the work that you have done in global health. That might help students have better idea of your interests and your commitment to global health as well. Thank you for an excellent course and the introduction to such diverse topics in global health. I will particularly remember the professor from Vermont Medical School, who gave such an inspiring talk. Would love to hear more of such talks.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Great professor who was good at engaging the entire class in discussions and lectures with guest speakers. The assignment assigned throughout the course didn't seem to have many connections to the material being taught."

    "Overall, some of the speakers were more interesting than others, but the course was engaging. I wouldn't say I learned as much technical or analytic skills as I would have liked, and the proposal would have been difficult for me if I didn't have a research\/global health background, but I believe this course to be incredibly resourceful for those of us who already have a baseline understanding of the global health realm.",
    "I would recommend the course to other non public health students interested in global health. It was very useful for my to deepen my knowledge on global health issues, and furthered my skills in project proposal writing.",
    "as i said earlier, it is a combination of the ethics seminar, epi of violent conflict course and the global health seminar. at this time you have to take this course for the global health concentration, which is the only reason i took it. so if you need it to do that then yes i recommendation to take it, but i hope multiple courses will one day be offered to fulfill this component of the global health concentration. otherwise, skip it.",
    "I will recommend.",
    "This course is a very qualitative overview\/survey of random topics within global health. I learned a lot, particularly in the ethics sections, even thought the topics were disjointed. All of the lectures were thought-provoking and inspiring.",
    "Highly recommend. But be aware that an evening course means variable attendance and attention to lecturers\/visitors.",
    "I would recommend this to a student because it gave a wide range of topics that was very interesting to learn about over the course of the semester. It gave a birds eye view for everything and allowed us to get in touch with people around the university that we would never have known existed in our short time here.",
    "I would recommend this course to students. The course covers a variety of topics and the weekly reflections were a helpful way of engaging in the literature. I do hope in the future the course instruction (i.e. speakers) can be more inclusive of medicine and nursing.",
