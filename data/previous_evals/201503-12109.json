    "I recommend German 150 for those that are truly interested in the German language, since, as always, it may be difficult at times to find motivation to plow through hours and hours of work for a subject that does not interest oneself. I would venture to say that it probably will be ones most demanding course, or at least one of them, of the semester. However, the results are very tangible and very satisfying.",
    "excellent course! we talked mainly about immigration from Turkey, but also spoke about African Germans, Jews and Russians. given the current refugee crisis, this topic was particularly well timed and interesting.",
    "A nice course that assures you to improve your linguistic skills in every sense. The content is sometimes boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend GMAN 150. My German has greatly improved, and I learned a lot about multiculturalism in Germany. The course can be challenging, but I found it rewarding."
