    "must take if you're MB&B major",
    "Average class. Weekly problem sets (that aren't too long), a midterm, and a (non-cumulative) final. Pretty typical. The content was overall interesting, and although the crystallography gets a bit tricky at the end, it was cool to get a glimpse into how that works, since you see crystal structures all over the place.",
    "Required for the major. Only glimpse of biophysics you get in this major, which is kind of ridiculous. The first half is okay: just an overview of biophysical concepts. The second half makes ZERO sense. Chuck is honestly incomprehensible in that a) he is unprepared and seriously needs to rehearse his lectures prior to class, and b) the material itself is difficult to understand.",
    "A good class that is probably better than second-semester p-chem, but it also has its own inherent value. II enjoyed learning the material. De La Cruz is absolutely fantastic, and Sindelar is mediocre to bad. There were moments when I regretted taking the class because Sindelar's half of the class was incredibly painful, but the excellent TA made up for everything. Honestly, I enjoyed the class a lot, but I can understand if you're on the fence about it. Hopefully things will improve by the time you're taking it so that the class will be absolutely fantastic.",
    "If you are reading this, are probably an MBB major, and this is a lot better than a second semester of pchem.",
    "I would assume you're taking the class because it's required for MB&B. It's a pretty relaxed class, and overall pretty good. If you're not really interested in biophysics per se, the first half of the class is a lot more interesting, while the second half is mostly based on methods.",
    "Very chill, second half is a little tougher but extremely helpful for actually learning about important techniques.",
    "Terrible in every possible way.",
    "First half is awesome second is pretty brutal. I've never felt so conceptually lost in a class before. Enrique is a boss. Chuck is nice but very hard to follow and the second half of the class is all techniques. Two tests. Non cumulative. Weekly psets that get progressively harder",
    "Its a great class, most people only take it because they have to though. But its really a pretty good class.",
    "Great class! Take it, you probably have to anyways. Not hard.",
    "The first half is pretty easy and rather interesting, but don't get complacent. The second half of the course is all spectroscopy and experimental techniques in biophysical, drawing on physics and mathematics that most of us did not understand. All in all the second half was not worth the first, but if you're MB&B you don't have a choice anyway.",
    "This class isn't always the most organized class, but it was an enjoyable class! Professors, Enrique de La Cruz and Charles (Chuck) Sindelar are very approachable professors and very passionate about their work. Enrique is such a bro and really entertaining. The first part of the class deals with reaction kinetics and equilibrium as well as the physics of diffusion. It's not the most entertaining or engaging material, but the experimental approach to the topics was interesting. The second part of the class focuses on spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM and although the material was very interesting, it wasn't the easiest to grasp. A lot of the math is left out so you get a very qualitative approach to the topics which could have been taught better. Overall, it's a nice MBB class, the problem sets aren't that hard, and the exams are memorization-heavy.",
    "This is a tough class to review. Enrique is one of the best science lecturers I've had at Yale. He's engaging, approachable, and clearly knowledgeable about the subject. The second half of the class, however, definitely goes downhill. Chuck cares a lot about the material, and clearly is accomplished in the field, but his lectures are just really hard to follow, though crystallography and spectroscopy are inherently very hard to teach. The workload is quite manageable, at least.",
    "A pretty relaxed, moderate workload course that rehashes p-chem and gives a nice introduction to the methodologies involved in biophysical research. You probably have to take it for the major, but definitely nothing scary here and can be done concurrently with other more challenging classes if necessary.",
    "You gotta take it for mbb and it's not like it will kill you. But not terribly interesting",
    "first half is interesting and clear with Enrique. second half is frustrating and difficult to understand with Chuck because he would interrupt himself in his explanations which were already difficult to follow, making note-taking very difficult. I would not recommend this class if you do not have to take it.",
    "Pretty good. Average amount of work. You'll learn some stuff.",
    "A fun overlook of biophysics, it has a strong emphasis on imaging the biological world.",
    "Hm, yep, I think so. You have to take it if you're an MB&B major, but even if you're not, it's a pretty good senior spring course. Just make sure to do the supplemental reading ahead of time and you'll be all set!",
    "The first half with Enrique is definitely more interesting (and easier IMO) than the second half with Chuck, but overall both were good. Not too much work aside from the weekly problem sets."
