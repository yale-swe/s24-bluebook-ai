    "It is a basic material science lab but it really focuses upon how to write a lab report and how to give a presentation on one. I do not think that any other MENG course does this and I believe that it should be mandatory for all mechanical engineering students.",
    "Yes, purely because getting to know Jan is awesome. The labs themselves are OK (the first two on testing material properties were much better than the second two on characterization) and the lecture's not great, but I learned a ton about scientific communication, both in terms of writing reports and presentations. Since that was Jan's goal for the class, I'd call it a success.",
    "Well if you're here, you have to take this class, but anyway it wasn't bad. This actually feels like a half credit, since class only meets half the semester, and there are only 4 labs. However, the labs are sometimes a bit boring, although not difficult. The point of this class is to teach you to write scientific reports, not do experiments correctly. Jan will help you along with this, he's a cool guy. Not sure how you could do poorly in this class, as it hardly even feels like we are getting graded.",
    "great to take concurrently with 285. sucks that there's lecture twice a week for this half-credit lab for a large part of the semester. there is some cool stuff to be observed and the prof+TAs are awesome. jan is a boss, search bulk metallic glasses he's one of the first things that pops up. the TA is also a boss, and all the instructors are laid back. overall great, jan gives some great feedback about your writing. probably my favorite lab at yale so far.",
    "Get a good lab partner - it makes a world of difference.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a pretty straight foreward class and the experiments are fun. This year we did fou experiments,wrote two long lab reports that were re-worked multiple times, and then gave a presentation on a third lab. The class really does help to solidify your lab report writing skills.",
    "On the whole, the course serves two purposes: it gives a basic overview of materials science practices and how to apply that knowledge, and it guides a student through how to write and present scientific papers. It's definitely a useful class for any engineering major.",
    "Very good class! Prof. Schroers is very nice, helpful and very invested to his students. The lectures are interesting and he really teaches you how to write a paper and do a presentation, which are immensely useful skills. Also, the workload is very reasonable.",
    "Repeats much of 285, with an emphasis on BMGs (Prof. Shoers' specialty). Labs are interesting, course load is only a few reports and a presentation."
