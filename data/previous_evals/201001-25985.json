    "Take it. This class is awesome. You learn not only about designing the green products of the future, but also about being a more savvy consumer.",
    "good intro to green engineering. topics are diverse and offer a good beginning intake.",
    "I think it's a good class for an engineering student to take to get a better perspective on design and product development. That said, it's not that difficult and I think there is probably a better design class out there for environmental engineers.",
    "Pretty boring. Not complicated, but hard to take an interest in. Don't take it if it isn't required for your major-you won't really gain anything.",
    "it's a great way to learn about the topics of our time",
    "Green Engineering and Sustainable Design is an excellent introduction to the principles of sustainability and how they can be applied in products. You get a chance to learn about new innovations in biomimicry, green chemistry, etc. and the opportunity to do a group presentation about how to improve a product is very enjoyable. However, unless it changes, you don't learn much about the quantitative engineering aspects of green design.",
    "I would recommend it. It was not an extremely work intensive class, yet it was interesting and I felt like I learned a lot, especially relative to the workload.",
    "It is a great survey course on green design. It is a bit redundant if you are already familiar with the material though."
