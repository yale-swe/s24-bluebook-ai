    "This class was, without a doubt, the best class I've taken at Yale. I took this course as an art major, thinking it was just an advanced painting studio. However, it really pushes you to consider your practice in a new way. Munro Galloway helps you engage with different forms of abstraction and by the end of the semester you are creating objects and paintings that you wouldn't have before. You learn a lot, not just about modern and contemporary art, but about yourself and why you make the things you do. I was able to push my own boundaries for art making and discovered what I really want to make as I move forward as an art major. You also become very close to your peers and learn from their critiques as well. The class is geared toward the students enrolled in it. Munro only assigned projects and readings that were relevant to the kind of art we were creating, which we really benefited from. Definitely take it, otherwise you're missing out on an amazing experience!",
    "Advanced studio class following the history of abstraction and abstract art practices. Munro is a great professor. He tailors his teaching to different student and really shows that he cares about our individual pursuits. By the end of the semester, I feel like every one in the class developed their visual vocabulary and conceptual interest much further. Like every art class, the more you put into it the more you get out of it. It's also more interesting when you have classmates who are serious about their work-->better crits.",
    "An exploration of different approaches to abstraction which is relatively self guided."
