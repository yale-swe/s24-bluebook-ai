   "comments": [
    "I really learned how to think critically and dynamically about the concepts we learn in class. Even though there were three distinct units, it's crazy how much topics from Unit 1 (quantum mechanics) carried through to Unit 2 (organic chemistry) and Unit 3 (transition metals, solids). Also, I always knew our world is based around chemistry, but this class really opened my eyes to how vast of a role chemistry plays in our lives. It's everywhere, from the plastic cups we drink out of to the processes that occur in our bodies to even color. Also, now I can read the labels on the bottom of disposable cups and name\/draw the polymer that was used to construct it.",
    "I learned so much about chemistry through this course. From quantum mechanics to organic and inorganic chemistry, I feel like we covered a very broad range and were exposed to most subfields of chemistry. Through this, I was able to determine which areas of chemistry interest me the most. I learned the skills of asking for help on most assignments (through peer tutors and TAs) and in studying efficiently for midterms.",
    "This course helped me to learn how to extrapolate from material we learned in class and apply that knowledge to real world situations and applications of chemistry. Additionally, my understanding and exposure to different areas of chemistry was broadened and deepened, so my interest in the field was more stimulated.",
    "I learned different chemistry topics than I would have otherwise learned in a normal chemistry course. Also, I learned how to synthesize information in lectures such that I could determine what were the key points.",
    "This class is essentially an overview of the chemistry that is left out of the AP Chem curriculum. It provides a foundation for molecular orbital theory, organic chemistry, and transition metal chemistry. It's more focused on conceptual thinking than it is on memorization, and it will give anyone interested in chemistry or STEM in general a great framework with which to work and explore problems.",
    "I developed knowledge about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and transition metals.",
    "This course helped me think more conceptually and critically about concepts in chemistry. I learned how to apply the information I learned in class and really stretch myself out to find answers to the questions on exams\/problem sets.",
    "I learned new aspects of Chemistry that I was never exposed to in high school. I learned to think more conceptually, whereas previous chemistry courses emphasized formulas and solving problems more.",
    "a more comprehensive level of chemistry rather than simply plugging numbers into equations, helped me learn HOW and WHY things occur rather than that they simply DO occur",
    "A variety of topics in chemistry",
    "This has been a quirky course. I have learned so many new topics I have never touched upon in AP Chemistry. I believe this course will prepare me for future STEM courses.",
    "The most important thing I learned was to intuitively think about chemistry. This is a skill that has been invaluable in other classes and in tackling contemporary issues in chemistry\/biochemistry",
    "A lot about quantum chemistry and organic, which may at times have seemed unhelpful but allowed me access to broader concepts.",
    "I continued to develop my knowledge in chemistry and really elevated the way I think and approach concepts in chemistry.",
    "In this course, I gained a conceptual understanding of Chemistry that helped me deeper understand Quantum mechanics, Organic chemistry, transition metals, and solid state structures. I gained the skill of being able to connect concepts in Chemistry through a fundamental understanding that I gained throughout this course. Great course!",
    "I learned a lot about general chemistry as a basis for my future chem classes including organic chemistry, transition metal chemistry, and many others.",
    "This course broadened my knowledge of chemistry and allowed me to see its applications in and outside of the classroom. I learned so much that I wouldnt have if I had just taken general chemistry.",
    "I learned a lot of organic chem, quantum mechanics, and other topics in chem I had almost no knowledge of before. I also learned a lot about how to study for courses.",
    "I learned about critical thinking, especially between linking subjects together. I also learned a great deal about quantum mechanics.",
    "I learned a lot more about how the different facets of chemistry were interconnected and gained a deeper understanding of the science in general.",
    "After taking AP Chemistry, I thought that chemistry was more exact and mathematical. After taking 163, I learned that some aspects of chemistry are fuzzy...for example, the orbitals we learned about are really just an approximation.",
    "I got a deeper understanding for the reasons behind chemical reactions, and behavior of molecules.",
    "I learned how to apply the many general chemistry principles I learned in my high school AP Chemistry class to an eclectic collection of chemistry fields such as Quantum, Organic, and Solids Chemistry. By taking this course, you develop the mindset of thinking like a chemist, not learning the general principles of the field. For a student who is sufficiently prepared (Eg. has experience with chemistry in high school), the conceptual nature of this class is extremely rewarding.",
    "Concepts behind basic chemistry. A new way of understanding chem.",
    "Compared to my AP chemistry class in high school, Comprehensive Univ. Chemistry taught me a lot about Molecular Orbitals and how to read MO diagrams to visualize Lewis Structures in a more accurate perspective and also to image the interactions between orbitals. I enjoyed the molecular orbitals and electron density part of the class the most. Additionally, I learned about functional groups and polymers and how everything comes together through synthesis and mechanisms to make organic compounds. I earned about amino acids, peptide bonds and quite a bit about stereo chemistry. Furthermore, I learned about metal complexes and why they have color and how their MOs depict that. Finally, I was introduced to unit cells and lattice structures (close packed and body centered cubic) to understand how solids pack and from there the idea of semi conductors was developed.",
    "I developed much greater knowledge of quantum mechanics, and the origins of why chemistry is the way it is.",
    "I learned in depth about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry and transition metals through this course which I would not have otherwise.",
    "I learned how to take a much more conceptual approach to Chemistry and how to think more broadly about the concepts I was learning.",
    "I learned how to better approach conceptual questions and think more like a scientist.",
    "This class taught me an unexpectedly large variety of new knowledge, skills, and insight ranging from MO theory to organic chemistry, transition metal chemistry and solids. Although it was a hard concept to get at first, learning the wavefuntion explanations for electrons and MO theory helped to explain so much of the rest class. I would consider it to be the most important skill this class developed because it gave us a clearer and more comprehensive view of chemistry. This was the first chemistry class I've taken that actually answered questions like why certain organic compounds are more stable or how bright pigments get their colors.",
    "I learned about three separate topics: quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and transition metals\/solids. In the end, we learned how three distinct topics came together and gave us a bigger perspective about chemistry.",
    "I developed a lot of rational thinking skills by taking this course. Since it was almost devoid of number specific work, the majority of the learning that took place was conceptual, and that emphasis allowed me to improve in making connections between the different units and seeing the bigger picture. I also gained a solid foundation in organic chemistry that will aid me next year when taking the full course, knowledge I believe will be invaluable in allowing me to begin with a head start on what seems will be challenging course material.",
    "I learned a lot of new chemistry topics, despite the class being \"gen chem,\" which was very exciting. I think I am now better prepared for college-level exams and thinking.",
    "Learned a bit of everything in general chemistry",
    "I gained the ability to think outside the box and apply concepts from many different areas of chemistry.",
    "I felt that this class allowed me to build up my knowledge in chemistry, and become more able to extend what I have learned over the semester to new problems.",
    "I felt as though I truly learned a lot of chemistry when taking this class. From some subjects that I had already learned to a slight extent, to those (especially our transition metal and solid units) that I had never studied in any depth before, we covered a wide range of topics, yet the connection between disparate ideas and theories was always present, especially by the end of the class. On the whole, I feel as though this class gave me a very solid foundation to take other chemistry courses at Yale, while at the same time the familiarity of some topics and the pace of the class (especially at the beginning of the semester) allowed me to acclimate well to the college workload.",
    "This course fundamentally changed the manner I think about and understand Chemistry. My perspective surrounding chemical reactions and how they are present in the world around us has become so much more comprehensive, and even though I struggled with a lot of the content, I am very glad that I chose Chemistry 163. I learned how to look at problems critically and how to trace interdisciplinary connections between different areas of study within Chemistry. I developed greater resilience to face problems that seem impossible to decipher at first. And, most importantly, I learned the importance of building a foundation to be able to develop higher level thoughts.",
    "Comprehensiveness is truly the nature of the course. Topics that were discussed in the course ranged from quantum mechanics to organic chemistry and we were able to learn how those topics worked in the context of chemistry.",
    "I learned to think very conceptually about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry and metallic solids.",
    "Learned a lot about how the world works in a scientific sense. Learned to apply theories to real life, and also just enjoyed learning the theories as is.",
    "A more advanced understanding of the subject of chemistry and how the subject relates to other scientific subjects like physics and biology.",
    "Greater general knowledge of Chemistry. Better understating of Molecular Orbital Diagrams and Solids.",
    "I learned a lot about various chemistry topics and how different concepts can be used to understand more about different chemistry topics. I also learned about how to stretch my thinking to unfamiliar situations.",
    "I really liked Professor Mayer's fun facts. Such as how some of the scientists we are learning about went to \/are buried at Yale, or how we can look at our shampoo products and now know some of the chemicals in it. Those details helped me get excited about chemistry. I developed an insight into what it meant to take a huge lecture class at Yale. And that understanding the concepts and broader picture is more important than memorizing the details. More than the actual material taught I developed insight into what high learning means: not memorizing but deep understanding.",
    "Most of the material taught was completely new information to me, including quantum mechanics, a lot of the organic chemistry, and transition metal chemistry. Because of the way Professor Mayer designed the tests, I learned how to synthesize information from different units and developed a bigger picture of chemistry as a whole.",
    "Taking Chem 163 allowed me to gain a very thorough overview of different subjects within chemistry that I have never explored before. Our first unit was a a detailed dive into the quantum mechanics of chemistry, which was extremely exciting as there were theories such as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, etc. that were truly fascinating. Next, I was able to learn about organic chemistry during our second unit, in which I picked up skills such as drawing organic molecules, simple organic synthesis, reaction mechanisms, and identifying chiral centers and optical isomers. Finally, in the third unit, I learned about solid state chemistry and transition metals. This unit enabled me to know more about why solids in the real world behave the way they do. I really enjoyed this class a lot because it allowed me to sample various topics in chemistry and also learn about why things occur the way do they in the world.",
    "I think Chem 163 was a really unique overview of important concepts in chemistry that went well beyond the AP Chemistry or usual Gen Chem curriculum, and I think each topic selected for the course was appropriate and interesting. I really liked how learning so much about orbitals early on in the course deepened my understanding of chemistry I had already learned and directly applied to the topics we discussed in the rest of the course. The advanced nature of the course was especially helpful to me as I am deciding whether I want to pursue chemistry as a major. If I do, the material in the course will definitely help me in more advanced chemistry courses.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of how chemistry works in the real world. We covered some basic physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and solid-state chemistry. I think the course really helped me think \"like a scientist,\" having to rely heavily on conceptual understanding than lots of numbers and formulas.",
    "This class helped me to see chemistry in everything, and it really fostered the love that I have for chemistry. It does a good job of showing that everything in chemistry is sort of interconnected; all the principles and concepts we learn interact with one another to produce the effects that we see in the world around us. It was so interesting to see how everything we learned in the class came together in the end. Through this class, I also became a lot better at being able to explain chemical phenomena and to find potential reasons and causes for things.",
    "I learned a lot about various topics of chemistry that I had never learned about before such as quantum mechanics, organic chem and transition metals.",
    "I realized, for one, how helpful going to peer tutoring can be, because the problem sets for this class could not have been completed without them. Also, from high school I was used to learning all the material for the exams in class, which was not the case in Chem 163, so that realization helped refine my study skills outside of the lecture hall for all of my classes.",
    "Before taking this course, I had extremely limited, if any, knowledge on quantum mechanics and organic chemistry. My AP Chemistry course in high school did not introduce these topics. For example, MO diagrams, Particle in a Box, and organic chemistry terminology were all new to me. Hopefully, the organic chemistry concepts covered in Chem 163 will help me when I take organic chemistry next year. More importantly, this course taught me communication skills. I came from a high school where I tended to do everything independently. This class, more than any other class that I took this past semester as a first-year, taught me that communication with others is essential to success. The difficulty of this course makes it impossible to succeed without taking advantage of office hours and peer tutoring hours. I also learned a lot about myself as a student, such as the study habits that best fit me, by taking this course. For example, I found that reading Oxtoby, the textbook assigned for the course, does not benefit me, as it is far too detailed and extends past the concepts discussed in class.",
    "A better understanding of quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and transition metal (and metal) chemistry. I have also developed great study habits due to the help offered in the course.",
    "My knowledge of general chemistry improved drastically over the course of the semester.",
    "I learned how to make connections across subjects and was challenged to think beyond surface concepts.",
    "My knowledge and general understanding of chemistry expanded in taking this course. We covered some aspects of quantum physics and chemistry on the atomic level as well as the structures of organic molecules.",
    "By taking this course, I not only learned how to manage my time more wisely, but also discovered just how much and how little I knew coming out of high school. This course introduced me to the vast realm of science that I thought I knew in and out."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A weakness of the course is that the professor goes all over the place with the concepts. It can be pretty hard to follow along the lecture sometimes, and you never really know where he's going when he jumps from one topic to the next. But at the same time, this works out to also be a strength because it helped me synthesize better everything I learned in that class. Like the professor stated on the first day, science is a messy field and does not work one topic at a time. Another strength is that the professor always made sure we realized how awesome science is. There's a sense of wonder I get everyday I come to that class, from learning about d splitting in metals and how it relates to their colors, to the realization that the monomers we learned in class (styrene, propylene) are actually what makes up common objects we use everyday. This class made me realize how much I love chemistry, and I hope to take with me the same passionate energy that my professor had.",
    "The strengths of this course rest in how much material we are able to cover and how we leave the class exposed to many areas of chemistry. However, sometimes I wasn't sure of the purpose of the class as a whole (since chem majors will be taking organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry in future years and gaining exposure to these subjects there). But it was interesting to get a taste of these things, and if I happen to be a chem major, hopefully go into those upper-division courses a little more prepared. I thought the amount of work for this course felt just right, but for the first two out of the three units, I couldn't see how the problem sets related to the questions we were being tested on on the midterm (I felt like we did not gain sufficient practice with test questions).",
    "Strengths: broad material covered, allowing a lot of exposure to a lot of fields; teaching fellows very good at helping to clarify information from lectures weaknesses: sometimes moved a little fast and it was unclear what from the lectures was important or not; could have used more time with teaching fellows than just 50 minutes once a week",
    "The strength of this course was that it provided a new perspective and information on topics I'd learned before. This course also taught a wide variety of new material so it went beyond just review. One weakness is that the course goes by quickly, so it's easy to get lost or become confused at points.",
    "Professor Mayer is an excellent professor. It's a gift to see such a passionate professor work with an introductory STEM lecture. He clearly cares about the subject and consistently demonstrated a care for his class as students and people. Sometimes our timing on psets or exams was a little off because Mayer is prone to tangents, but all of them are incredibly interesting applications of the material we're learning. He says his class isn't about rote memorization, and he stands by that. This class really reignited an interest and enjoyment of chemistry, and I think it's a great example of how STEM can be taught.",
    "Mayer tends to ramble and get off topic quite often which made lecture feel ineffective sometimes and made me question why I have this class three times a week if we aren't even using all of that time effectively. This class is definitely easier if you've had some exposure to organic chemistry beforehand.",
    "Strengths of the course are the discussion sections with the TFs, as it helps to clarify confusing topics from the lectures.",
    "This course really challenged me to think about chemistry more conceptually, which is much different than my other chemistry classes. It was difficult, but very rewarding once I understood the concepts and how all the class content kind of connected together. There were also a lot of office hours and review sessions for exams that were really helpful. A weakness is that the course required a lot of extrapolating of information. I often felt unprepared for the exams or didn't really know how to prepare for Professor Mayer's style of questions. I always felt like I had to teach myself a lot of the conceptual aspects of the course because I didn't pick them up during the lectures.",
    "The strengths would be the amazing peer tutors. They serve as a great resource to learning a lot of the material for the class. Along with that, a lot of the content was very interesting and it was clear that the professor was very passionate about the subject. Although, this course was very time consuming and stressful at times, I think all the new material I learned really changed my view on Chemistry and I am grateful for that. One of the weaknesses is that the lecture does not nearly cover everything that is needed for the midterms or finals. Nor do they really cover everything necessary for the problem sets. Much of this course felt like independent study rather than a class that I was attending every other day.",
    "weakness- very fast, tended to feel like i knew what i was doing only to find out after the test that i didn't lol strength- in-depth assessment of chemistry",
    "Interesting material, difficult to learn at first",
    "There are many TFs and Peer Tutors involved in this course. Their help was integral for success in this class. The professor was disorganized, but he loves teaching.",
    "Prof. Mayer is great and he genuinely cares about the students, and his lectures do allow the students to take a leap into a higher level of chemical thinking. However, this course will require a significant amount of individual work to understand the concepts. The lectures are not enough to understand the basics, and I think the course structure should accommodate that (for example, if section covered topics that are going to be talked about in future lectures, students would be able to better follow Mayer and he would be able to take students even further)",
    "Strengths are that Prof Mayer and the TAs are amazing, theyre super knowledgeable and are willing to go above and beyond to help students in this class. The only weakness for me is that lectures were a bit disorganized and I personally prefer more structured, linear lectures.",
    "The strengths of this course was how great of a teacher Professor Mayer is! I also really enjoyed learning new concepts in engaging ways, especially with the way Professor Mayer tells stories and uses examples to teach the material. I also think that Professor Mayer's demonstrations were a strength of the course because they solidified a lot of the material we were learning. I also think the p-sets were very helpful in learning the material, and that the peer tutors and TAs were a crucial part of my learning experience. I think the only weakness was that I felt like the tests at the end of the course were too concentrated together, and it made it feel like the learning was only for a grade. I also think that some of the questions on the test were ambiguous rather than difficult. For example, on the solids test, we were asked to determine the structures of a few molecules. However, the correct structures were different answers than one would have gotten if they used the radius ratio rules. We learned to use the radius ratio rules in class for determining structures, not comparison of the size of atoms. Thus, I think that question was based too much on how well someone can interpret what the professor wants rather than on the actual material.",
    "The materials were difficult, I think it would be nice to be able to drop a midterm as some are very difficult.",
    "Although most of the material was taught during the lectures, the lectures were not in depth enough and were often a bit disorganized. I found myself having to read all the textbook pages for the class for every exam, which was enriching but extremely time consuming. This was especially because the textbook pages recommended for reading were given to us only a week maximum before each exam. If we were given textbook pages to read throughout the course of the class, it would have been much more manageable and I wouldve been able to engage more with the lectures. As for strengths, the sections, peer tutoring sessions, and all the revie sessions were extremely helpful.",
    "Sometimes it felt like things were only really tied together towards the end of the unit, and at that point it was often very close to the midterm\/exam.",
    "The course is strong enough. The lectures are engaging; I also liked that there were some student discussions, though there could be more. I especially enjoyed the access I had to my TA.",
    "It was strong in its structure of the order of material, but weak in that it was common for the professor to get off schedule and fall behind in the material, causing situations like brand new material taught on the day of exams to be tested that day.",
    "It is very confusing. Mayer is very intelligent and sometimes forgets we are not all at his level.",
    "I think that I could have used a little more guidance preparing for the exams. It was sometimes hard to know what to expect.",
    "The topics were well organized, and were all given enough time to be taught. Each topic in a chapter were interconnected in a way that made me understand how chemistry works better. Has good support with peer tutors and TAs that helped a lot.",
    "Strengths: -You develop a conceptual understanding of thinking about chemistry -Learn about new general chemistry topics (quantum, organic, and solids) Weaknesses: -Topics can be niche and confusing -Sometimes you can fall behind on work",
    "The classes were very fast paced and I learned more after through section. I wish section reinforced class material rather than teach it all.",
    "This course was strong in that it explored topics that a traditional general chemistry course would not. I would improve it by making it less dense, however, as there were many complex topics that were explored which many students felt that they did not have enough time to grasp before being tested on it.",
    "The weaknesses were that the material was all over the place and really scattered. A whole semester of organic chem was done in 5 weeks which was really challenging. The strengths were that the peer tutors really helped.",
    "Its strengths are in the range of topics taught that I feel will prepare me going forward. Another strength is Professor Mayer himself, who makes this course incredibly engaging and enjoyable to attend every week. With that comes a slight weakness that he admits, that the information of the course is not always most clearly presented, but that doesn't take away from it.",
    "Strength: Mayers amazing teaching. Weakness: Problem sets often had material we hadnt gotten to in class yet.",
    "Strengths are the materials Prof. Mayer chooses to cover and the way he covers them tying organic and solids chemistry (all things we haven't seen before in high school or AP chem) back to MO theory. Also, Prof. Mayer is truly invested in this class and always ties new publications into our PSets and the history\/applications of the chemistry we're learning into lectures. Weaknesses would be that the PSets are written a bit confusingly at times.",
    "The strength of the course is that everything ties together well. The first third of the course sets a foundation in quantum mechanics that is called upon heavily in the latter portion of the course, and this allows for significant overlap in the subject material that helps solidify the concepts. A weakness of the course is that the lecture itself is a bit disoriented. A few times a topic will be introduced in the lecture that will have to be covered in discussion in order to make sense. While frustrating at times, it does highlight the importance and usefulness of the discussion sections, which is another strength of the course.",
    "This course was well designed. Everything, though it seemed disconnected, was connected at the end of the course, which was very exciting. I think that 50 minutes three times a week has its benefits, but Prof. Mayer was often rushed to get through content at the end. Maybe longer classes twice a week would be more beneficial to students?",
    "A strength is the quality of the resources available outside of the classroom. The TFs and peer mentors are really helpful if you are willing to put in the time to talk through the material with them. A weakness is how quickly some concepts are taught. It would be helpful if the course was slowed down a bit over more difficult material and took the time to explain why a particular phenomena happens the way it does.",
    "Although the class material was mostly understandable and approachable, for me, it did not all come together until the final few days before the exam. It was difficult to see the entire picture before this time.",
    "This content of this course was very interesting in my opinion. It went into much more depth than high school chemistry. The classes introduced all of the topics that we needed for the tests, but I feel like the weekly discussion sections were necessary to gain a stronger understanding of the topics, especially because we went so fast.",
    "I enjoyed having the discussion sections that would help me understand concepts that we discussed in class.",
    "The strengths of this course include the teaching and the availability of help at all times (the peer tutors and TFs always felt accessible), the pace of the class, the generally high level of interest in the class, and the material. The largest weakest of the course, in my mind, was that the classroom could at times feel like a somewhat intimidating environment, and certainly not very many people plucked up the courage to raise their hand while in class. Still, Professor Mayer taught clearly enough, and there was enough opportunity for help from peer tutors and TFs that this didn't really feel like a problem. Indeed, for a lecture course, this class was actually pretty small and felt just about as welcoming, I imagine, as an intro lecture can be.",
    "Strengths: deepens our understanding of chemical reactions and chemical structures by teaching us how to visualize them in terms of orbitals. Weaknesses: sometimes, a little bit too fast paced. Also, it would have been better if band structures were taught over a greater amount of time rather than only in the last lecture. How it could be improved: I feel like a little bit more of individual interactions with the students could be implemented in the course. I think that it would also be beneficial for students to get more feedback on how they are doing throughout the course, in case they want to decide to Credit\/D\/Fail it.",
    "A strength of this course is that there are plenty of resources from TF's to peer tutors, to the textbook that can aid in students' learning. There aren't many weaknesses that I can pinpoint.",
    "I learned a lot in the class, there's very interesting and useful material. It goes somewhat fast, and not everything gets discussed at length, so section is important. It's not a class that is easy to catch up in, but the workload is reasonable.",
    "Strengths: very interesting and comprehensive. Weaknesses: disorganised.",
    "This is a great course. It is challenging yet enjoyable.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it touches a wide variety of topics and stretches your understanding. I would say that one way that the course could be improved is by providing more outside resources for the quantum mechanics unit.",
    "Strengths: Quality test questions. They really challenged a student to connect what he\/she knows and stretch the knowledge to answer new questions. Weaknesses: I have no idea what is going on. I wish there were more practice questions available because the biggest challenge of this course was getting used to the Professor's questions. I also wish there were more resources on canvas that would explain the concepts, because it is difficult to understand it when the professor only goes over it once in class. The Professor is also often difficult to understand in his lectures. I often could not focus on his lectures because they were too fast-paced and complicated.",
    "Strengths: 1) intellectual challenging, 2) forces you to synthesize information from the entire course, 3) builds study habits Weaknesses: 1) very challenging compared to Chem 161 even though both are introductory courses, 2) sometimes confusion as to where to find more resources to study without being overwhelmed with dense material like Oxtoby I believe this course can be improved if Professor Mayer provided additional resources that were easy to understand, because our textbook was very dense and did not help much.",
    "Strengths: The TF's are wonderful and are so supportive throughout this course. Also, while the problem sets can seem a bit scattered at times, they really do advance your knowledge and push you to learn more deeply the concepts covered in class. Weaknesses: Sometimes, I felt that the lectures did not cover the material with enough time ahead of problem set due dates so that students could work through the problem sets without any help from the peer tutors. Improvements: Chem 163 could maybe be improved if the lectures aligned a little better with the problem set due dates.",
    "If I could change one thing about this course I would make Yale could pay for our Sapling. I know y'all have enough money in that endowment.",
    "The strengths are the depth of understanding that is facilitated by the professor, teaching fellows, and peer tutors. The weaknesses of this course are that some of the concepts can be very difficult to grasp, so it might be helpful to have extra resources\/textbooks\/readings that clarify some of the questions that students may have. I think having more concept tests throughout units would be helpful to assess how well the students understand the material.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures, good structure of the class, very manageable workload, lots of independent learning, fantastic professor Weaknesses: lectures were very disorganized at times, and we also often did not cover all the material needed to complete a p-set until the day it was due",
    "The course was very interesting but sometimes it was hard to follow and difficult to decide which information was important and which wasn't.",
    "Overall, it's an interesting class. Chem 161 would have been much too easy, but I was not at all prepared for orgo, so this course was a good middle-man, so to speak. I also think it did help me step away from the plug-and-chug chemistry I was used to from high school. It was challenging though! Professor Mayer teaches very fast paced, and it's sometimes hard to distinguish between what he considers interesting and what is actually important material to know. The lecture slides aren't always the most helpful with making that determination either -- they often have more diagrams than words.",
    "I loved that the lectures were recorded so that students could rewatch and catch points initially missed during class. I also appreciated the detailed answer keys to the practice midterms and problem sets.",
    "One strength of this course is the number of resources that are made available to students. The ongoing availability of peer tutors, teaching fellows, and the instructor allows the student to have ample opportunities to reach out for help. However, one major weakness of this course is its workload. Whereas Chem 161 students only have Sapling assignments as problem sets, Sapling is used merely as a warm-up to the problem sets for Chem 163 students. From my experience, Sapling assignments take, on average, 1.5-3 hours, and problem sets take 6-8 hours. This means that there have been weeks where I have had over 10 hours of homework for Chem 163. Considering how time-consuming problem sets are, they, along with the Sapling assignments, should have more weight to a students overall grade in the class. Currently, Sapling assignments and problem sets together make up at most 10 percent of a students grade, with 90 percent depending on the three midterms and the final. In addition, the length of these problem sets does not prepare students well for time-management on exams, for exams take only two hours.",
    "Strengths include a strong infrastructure for learning and a great transition between topics (the whole class was intertwined in a way). One weakness of the class is the rush near the end of the semester.",
    "Its very intellectually engaging",
    "This course moves very quickly. This is both a strength and a weakness. No introductory material is provided and is instead expected to be known. This course could be improved by moving the discussion sections to not on only Monday or Tuesday. My section was frequently cancelled on Tuesday night in preparation for upcoming midterms, and that was difficult.",
    "Strengths are that there are many resources for studying and always someone to contact for help. It also focuses on conceptual knowledge rather than memorization. One thing that could be improved is clarity of what information needs to be known and what information doesnt.",
    "The level of help provided outside of class (peer tutors, office hours, the recorded lectures, and additional resources provided on Canvas) is exceptional and really does enhance my understanding of the material being taught. I don't know if this can be fixed, but the quality of the recorded lectures could be improved a bit, it's difficult to see the boards with the camera quality.",
    "One strength of this course would have to be the implementation of the Teaching Fellows. Over the course of the semester, I found myself asking for their help as I slowly realized just how supportive and helpful they could be. Not only did they answer my questions beyond what I'd expect in a response, but also set me up with resources that they thought could help fine-tine my own understanding of the material."

   "comments": [
    "I would. It's a lot to handle, especially the first weeks where you're thrown right into quantum mechanics. But the things you learn in that class are so cool and simply awe-inspiring. If you're looking to exercise your curiosity and feel excited about the world, you should take this class. But make sure you can first handle the workload, because it's a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has taken AP Chemistry or the equivalent because I think they would be very bored in Chem 161. Though fast-paced, and requiring a lot of self-study in my case, the course was generally enjoyable when it came to topics that interested me. For topics I found particularly difficult or uninteresting though, I found it very hard to stay motivated. If you're okay with the likelihood of feeling far behind in comparison to classmates and feeling uncomfortable at times with your grade, this class will still be enjoyable. However, if you know you would struggle with these things, I would hesitate to recommend this course.",
    "Yes, to those that have a solid basis AND interest in chemistry to begin with, this course is a good option to start one's chemistry path. However, if you're not particularly engaged with the subject, then this course may seem like a lot of work (much more so than regular gen chem).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student- especially someone who believes that they have a firm understanding of general chemistry and are looking for an extra challenge. This is because the material this course teaches is much more in depth than a general chemistry class and is often totally new material that is not typically covered in a first year class.",
    "Yes, when choosing a chem course, I think 163 is definitely the way to go. It's understandable that students with less background go into 161, but even with some chem, I think students will be able to handle 163. It's challenging not to weed out who is \"good at chem\" and who is \"bad at chem,\" but it's challenging so as to promote student growth and reward meaningful engagement with the subject. I think if more STEM lectures were taught like this, we would hear less of the common complaints about STEM curriculum, saying that it's too dry, uncreative, and impersonal. Professor Mayer's 163 is a great experience for students of STEM and for students in general.",
    "It depends. If you really want to be challenged and enjoy learning about chemistry. I liked chemistry before taking this class, so most of the time I found the challenge aspects of this class to be gratifying. If you are taking this class because you are pre-med or have to take it for your major, I would probably say to take CHEM 161 instead.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who really enjoys learning Chemistry and science in general. I would also recommend this course to a student who is looking for a fairly challenging course that will take up most of their time during the semester. In my opinion, to get the most out of this course and to really begin to understand everything, a lot of the readings must be done which are really time consuming, and thus if a student already has a fairly packed schedule, I would not recommend this course.",
    "if you want an in-depth learning experience, yes. if you want a good grade (unless you're a chem GENIUS), take 161",
    "Yes, teaches you much more beyond gen chem",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for other students, especially those pursuing the premed track. This class is an introduction to many different topics that may or may not come up on the MCATs. I was also able to understand AP Chemistry more through this course.",
    "Yes! Essential to truly understand chemistry",
    "Yes, it was a good first battle",
    "Yes I think if someones looking between 161 and 163, this course I feel will prepare you more for orgo in the future.",
    "Yes! I grew from being able to learn Chemistry in a new way that focused on concepts rather than calculations, and the course really inspires me to learn more chemistry. The content of the class was exciting, and I often found myself thinking about the content and course throughout my day. Professor Mayer is a great teacher, who really enjoys engaging in students questions, and cares about the class's understanding of the material.",
    "Yes, I would. Though the workload is very stressful at times, especially right before the exams, I really learned a lot in this class. I was a bit scared coming in because I had learned A.P. Chem in my sophomore year of high school and thought I would be at a disadvantage because I didnt remember much, but soon enough most everyone was on the same level and we were learning entirely new things. This class was challenging, but it gave me a new perspective on chemistry",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who loves chemistry, because the topics are really interesting, but due to the challenge level\/workload I wouldn't recommend this to someone simply trying to fill a gen chem requirement.",
    "I would recommend the class. It may be difficult, but it teaches people to think more critically, and that is very important t.",
    "If the student has the opportunity to take 161 instead and doesnt need organic chemistry, like me, I would not recommend it because of the much more difficult conceptual work and greater workload, but if they are pre-med or plan to continue studying chemistry, I think its a very throrough place to start and help get students ahead.",
    "Maybe... It has interesting material but that material is not conveyed as well as it could be.",
    "Yes; it was challenging but I thought the TFs and professor were great. I wish I had been able to understand the concepts more but even so, I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to determine if they should study chemistry in the long term. This is an excellent class to determine what a future career in chemistry looks like and if you are up to the challenge.",
    "If youre very interested in chemistry and the concepts behind it.",
    "I would recommend the course to any first year who is confident about his knowledge in chemistry from high school and is eager to learn new topics. If the student does not want to end repeating AP or IB chemistry all over again in General Chemistry then I recommend Chemistru 163.",
    "Perhaps, if the student was willing to put in a lot of work outside of class to understand what is being taught. I would recomment it to students who have great interest in the more theoretical, conceptual side of chemistry.",
    "I would if they had a strong interest in chemistry but not if they were attempting to fulfill a science requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who was prepared. I feel prepared to take future courses as a result and am happy with my choice to take it, but I think it could be too much for someone who didn't have as much chemistry background in high school.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Yes! Although, note that if you think this class will 'just be AP chem again' or is the 'easier alternative to Orgo' it is not. You will definitely need to work to learn new stuff, but it is incredibly rewarding and will help you understand future chemistry classes better (as I've been told and really hope is true).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who did well in AP Chemistry, and is looking to pursue an education deep into chemistry. The knowledge of organic chemistry will be invaluable in later courses, and will help tremendously. Furthermore, if one already has a solid foundation in the basics of chemistry, the regular general chemistry course will be repetitive and potentially boring, so this class fills that gap nicely. There is barely any work, and none of it is busy work. All of the Saplings and problem sets actually help teach the material and enforce certain points that the professor wants the students to know.",
    "Yes. the course is very challenging, but you learn a lot and are better prepared for other college-level STEM classes.",
    "Definitely, if seeking an intellectual challenge",
    "I would only recommend it if they really love chem. If they're only taking it as a prerequisite, I wouldn't advise it since they'd spend much more time in front of their chem notes than they'd probably like.",
    "Yes, I think this course is necessary for any student taking chemistry because it helps you approach the subject with a qualitative, and not just quantitative, understanding.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is very interested in chemistry or who is thinking of majoring in something chemistry related. I would not recommend this course to someone who is just trying to get their science requirement out of the way.",
    "I would recommend this course if they feel strongly in chemistry.",
    "Absolutely. This course was neither too hard nor too easy, the workload was significant but definitely manageable, the teaching was excellent, and I learned a lot. For all the things I've generally heard about intro science courses, this class made me very pleasantly surprised.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is genuinely interested in Chemistry and want to take their knowledge of the subject to another level. For students who are interested in just taking a Chemistry course to fulfill requirements for their major, or because they need a Gen. Chem. class because they are pre-med, I would probably advise them to pick a different class.",
    "I would recommend this class to a first year who has taken AP Chemistry or an equivalent in high school and has an affinity to chemistry. I would also recommend this course to students who have taken Chemistry 163 and want to continue their chemistry education.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who took AP chemistry in high school, but maybe don't feel completely confident in orgo and might have taken it awhile ago.",
    "Yes, it is a wonderful course for anyone who wants to have a comprehensive knowledge of university chemistry.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a strong grasp of high school chemistry that wouldn't have very much to gain from taking 161.",
    "Yes, it's an engaging course, recommended for hard working students.",
    "I would recommend this class if the student must meet chemistry requirements and already took AP Chemistry in high school. However, I would probably recommend trying to test into Organic Chemistry as a first year because I hear although that class is challenging, there is clear feedback and structure to that class. I would not recommend this class to someone who does not need it for a pre-med \/ major requirement.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. I believe it would be better to just take freshman organic chemistry, as this course seems to be unnecessarily difficult compared to the other general chemistry course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While it is difficult in the moment, the course really does push you to learn a lot. Also, it is rewarding to be able to say that I have learned so much about really distinct areas of chemistry, and I can use these tools to help me succeed in upper-level STEM classes such as organic chemistry.",
    "Yes! But only if you are confident in your abilities in chemistry. The class was super interesting but also super hard--I was really good at AP Chemistry in high school but I often struggled in this course. I would say this class is for anyone who really likes chemistry and is looking for a deeper understanding of it, and I think it was especially helpful for people like me who are deciding whether to major in chemistry or something else. Overall, it was difficult, but worth it.",
    "It depends. If they have a strong background in chemistry and are passionate about it, I would recommend the course. However, if they are like me and are only seeking to fulfill some prerequisites, then I would recommend considering a different course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has any interest in chemistry and is prepared for a challenge.",
    "I would, but only to students who had already taken AP Chem but weren't ready to go into Orgo, as was my situation and many others'. Also, I would probably only recommend this for potential chemistry\/chem eng\/biochemistry majors, where the more advanced information can actually be applied\/useful in later classes.",
    "Yes! I loved getting to know Mayer and his teaching style. Hes truly passionate about chemistry, and it shows in his lectures.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The workload caused me major stress, to the point of needing to use mental health resources. Considering that this course is primarily offered to first-year students, the unbalanced workload is simply too much for students who are simultaneously juggling so many new adjustments. If this course is offered in the future, it should be weighted more than Chem 161, meaning that it should not serve as the same prerequisite as Chem 161. (Regardless of whether students take Chem 161 or 163, the next step for most chemistry students is to take organic chemistry during their sophomore year.) As it is, Chem 163 goes into depth on topics that are unnecessary, though interesting, considering the layout of undergraduate chemistry courses within Yale. (For example, graduate students that I spoke with admitted that concepts covered in the quantum mechanics and transition metal units in Chem 163 may not reappear until graduate school.) The course also does not cover any AP Chemistry material, so unless a student is extremely strong with that material, they are missing fundamental knowledge by not taking Chem 161. Chem 163 is presented as a course for students who have AP Chemistry knowledge but simply need a bit of a refresher yet fails to review the majority of concepts taught within AP Chemistry.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course because it is challenging and helpful. Prof. Mayer demonstrates his love for chemistry really well, and as a result that makes the course very engaging.",
    "Yes! Very interesting and youre never bored.",
    "I would, but only if they have a decent amount of previous experience in chemistry and are willing to commit a lot of time, in and out of class, to learning complex concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who not only has the course as a requirement, but also has a fine and keen understanding of the AP Chemistry Topics beforehand."
