    "I suspect I will be in the minority in having this opinion, but I actually found this class to be the most useful course I've taken at Yale--and enjoyed it at some points. Make no mistake: This isn't an easy course, and the p-sets at times would leave me absolutely baffled. However, the content alone of this course (probability and stat theory) and also the general mathematical intuition gleaned from living up to Prof. Brunel's rigorous standards, are really useful to learn if you're into analysis\/higher-level math\/actually understanding econometrics and doing research. The topic itself can be really dry at times and Brunel didn't do himself any favors by not using a textbook and thus spending all of the class writing down proofs on the board. However, at the end of the course you'll actually have learned much more about the subject. Also the grading isn't that bad at all, so if you put in the work it won't hurt your GPA. So in sum, if you're interested in economics, good at math, and willing to put in the time to your studies, I would very strongly recommend this class. If you're just looking to get your econ major and leave a bunch of time for everything else, then yeah maybe just stick to Econ 131. Also, a last word of advice: this class doesn't really require any knowledge of actual economics, so you can essentially do it as early as you want with no pre-reqs. However, it's more of a math class, so you will probably fare a lot better if you've already taken Math 222\/are in Math 250. The topics don't overlap so it's by no means necessary, but it's helpful to just have been exposed to all the mathematical notation, etc. I'd recommend taking this as a soph if you're a prospective Econ\/Math major.",
    "This class was terrible. Material that is deliberately made complicated and rigorous simply to make students struggle, and Brunel is a new and awful grad student teacher who refuses to provide textbook\/online notes\/HW solutions in order for you to learn outside his made-up notation lectures. No clear curve means I wasn't sure if I'd pass the entire semester. I hope for your sake Brunel is not teaching this.",
    "ECON 135 is an important class for students majoring in Economics. However, the instructor should be changed from next year. Unless, you should not, never, take this class.",
    "ECON 135 is a course you have to take if you are an econ major. It is probably very different without Professor Brunel, but precision are rigor are essential to do well in this class. Very challenging and time consuming problem sets, especially as the semester goes on. Exams are very hard. That said I think I got a lot out of the class, but with Professor Brunel it should not be a 100-level class by any means.",
    "A good class. If you really don't enjoy theory or if you want to be guranteed a grade above a B+, then this is not the class for you. If you need to take this class for the Econ and Math major, good luck, and review your notes often.",
    "Looking back--yes, recommended! But this course was the bane of my existence. There's no textbook, so you need to be quick at note taking. The professor expected us to know math (especially proof based) that is not in the prereqs. That said, he'd clarify anything if we asked. The midterm was easy but graded strictly; the final was longer and we have no idea what our grades will look like (is there even a curve?). But the professor definitely knows what he's talking about, and Noriko is a great TA. Go for office hours and find a study group.",
    "I would say only take this if you're interested in the theoretical foundations for statistics, or if you're a math\/econ major. If you're either of these though, you'll find the material super interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - but I would warn that it is a lot of work and that Professor Brunel can be mean. However, if you keep at it, Professor Brunel is a great teacher and you will learn a lot from the course - how to write mathematics, the theoretical basis for probability and statistics.",
    "If Victor is teaching this class, do not take it. I beg you, implore you, plead with you not to do it. It was by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. If you don't have previous experience doing \"rigorous proofs,\" then forget about it; even if you do, your proofs probably aren't rigorous enough for Victor. The home assignments were gratuitously long and difficult, the exams were tough (half of the class failed the midterm and was saved only by the opportunity to redo the problems at home and resubmit them), and class was grossly unpleasant. The worst thing is that it didn't have to be this way--compared to prior years, Victor's version of Econ 135 had skies the color of hell flames. Noriko, our TA, was the saving grace; I think she may have been an angel sent from heaven to relieve our suffering. That said, life is too short to take this class, and it's not even like all of the effort paid off. I doubt we are any more skilled in statistics or better prepared for econometrics than someone who had taken ECON 131. Unless you are a masochist who gets off to this type of thing, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "no if Prof Brunel is teaching it. You will die.",
    "Take if you want a pretty good understanding of probability theory. I would say it's actually better than Stat 241.",
    "My experience of this course only applies if Professor Brunel is teaching. He made the course extremely theoretical and rigorous, more like a course in the math department than in economics (which meant it was far more difficult than I ever expected, but also made me love and appreciate math much more). So I have no idea how it will be when an econometrics professor teaches it again. All I can say is, if you're struggling in the class, 1) apply for a Science & Quantitative Reasoning tutor 2) review the notes after each class 3) see that Yale Math and Science tutors 4) go to your professor's and TA's office hours every week",
    "An introduction to probability theory and statistics. Had I known what professor Brunel's version of this class was like, I would have differed the class for another year. But that's the difficulty with guest professors, your take on the course means nothing. I recommend this class to an Econ\/Math major, assuming it will be taught with the original syllabus and not this advanced (non-intro) one.",
    "Professor Brunel is very passionate about the material, I'll give him that. But he expected us to know a lot more going into the class, which was not required by us as students. In preparation for our final exam, he gave us last year's final exam which he claimed was very easy compared to our final. And it was. This year ECON 135 does not even compare to previous years. I don't know if the department had asked him to teach it this way and make it harder, but that's what happened. The final was very difficult, and it took over 3.5 hours (and most of us still did not finish). It was also hard because we didn't have a textbook for the class. I respect Professor Brunel a lot. He was always willing to meet with us outside of class, and he wanted to challenge us to push us to be the best possible students that we could. But sometimes the challenge was so big that it just resulted in confusion. I really hope that this class either becomes less difficult or requires students to have certain prerequisites. Until then, for all of you up for the challenge, good luck.",
    "Yes! but your GPA may suffer unduly. The defining characteristic of this course was Prof. Brunels teaching, which was ambitious and difficult and even harsh. His expectations for the students were sky high, which ended up being a double edged sword. On the positive side, we were all forced to work incredibly hard in this class. The amount of material we were exposed to in minute detail was immense. Problem sets regularly took 10+ hrs, even with assistance from the TA and working together with classmates. Because there was no textbook, every word must be copied down exactly during lecture (I filled two composition books back to back this way). This effort we necessarily exerted I regard as positive. Our TA, Noriko, who worked alone to grade ~30 10-20-page-long psets with proofs, every week, in addition to delivering section and office hours deserves a medal. She was truly an angel of self-sacrifice offering salvation to those of us lacking an incredible background in mathematics (Real analysis would have, at times, been helpful in this course). On the negative side, I believe that although this course has pushed its students harder than ECON135 has ever done in the past, we will all receive worse grades than these past students... NB: If fewer students dropped this year, it is likely because we took our first real evaluation (the midterm) on the drop deadline and were unable to see our scores. Overall, it felt like those who performed well in this intro class were those who possessed a lot of prior coursework in math (350, 351, Real analysis), and those of us who worked hard but only met the prerequisites (Math 120, Linear algebra), were unable to compete. In summary, I do not regret taking this class because I feel I learned probability and statistics to a much more rigorous level than ever before. Prof. Brunel is an incredible lecturer, teacher, and mathematician.",
    "I am not sure if it was just this year with Brunel teaching it, but ECON 135 was very difficult. I learned a lot, improved as a student, and certainly do not regret taking it, but it was definitely a challenge. If Brunel teaches it next year, take it only if you love math and rigor and are willing to put in hours and hours into the problem sets. If a different teacher is teaching it, I have a feeling this class really won't be that difficult.",
    "This is moot as Professor Brunel is leaving next year but if he is teaching again I would only recommend it to those who really love math and are good at it. Do not think of this as an eocn course it is a pure math course. Also do not think this is a 100 level math course it is much more advanced.",
    "Introductory course in probability theory. Rigorous and proof-based treatment of topics, more than you'd expect from the syllabus. Professor Brunel is clearly highly knowledgeable and informed about his subject. His lectures are extremely well-organized and cohesive. However, the course was more theoretical than expected and he can be overly pedantic."
