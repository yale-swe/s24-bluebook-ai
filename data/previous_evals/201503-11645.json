   "comments": [
    "Professor Lenski is incredible and very engaging. He makes the class interesting and goes out of his way to revise our papers before we submit them. The workload was fair, with mainly readings, one presentation, and just a couple papers along with a research paper at the end.",
    "Not an over-bearing workload, and if you are interested in the material it can be a lot of fun. Professor is an awesome guy.",
    "Would recommend - in-depth learning about a pivotal time period in the Roman Empire and the rise of Chrisitanity to become the religion of the empire. Very interesting both in terms of learning about Rome and the development of Western thought.",
    "A great way to be introduced to seminars at Yale!",
    "I think this class was good and would recommend it to another student, especially if they are interested in Roman history or Christianity. If you are not particularly interested in history of this period however it could get a little boring. However, the professor is great and the workload is fair.",
    "2 4page papers and a 10 pg one, along with a presentation. Not a huge workload, and is very interesting if you are at all interested in early Christianity",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The material was interesting and well presented, and the workload was very manageable and well spaced out. Professor Lenski is clearly an expert in the field but is also very approachable and willing to meet with students.",
    "The Age of Constantine is a freshman seminar that covers Late Antiquity. It is a lot of reading, but I would recommend it because you get to do interesting, specialized writings, and you learn a lot with little stress.",
    "In this seminar you read about 100 pages before each class. In class, a student or Professor Lenski presents that information as a powerpoint. Afterwards, you discuss what you learned with guided questions. There are three papers but they are straightforward and very doable."
