    "yes, relatively easy course that is informative and covers a broad range of topics in physical organic chem. easy to understand and learn but covers topics not taught in other courses.",
    "I would recumbent it for a physical organic chemist and or physical inorganic chemist. Helpful mostly for them only",
    "good class, would recommend. Advise to stay interested",
    "I would summarize the course as a great class. I would definitely recommend the class to another student, because it's a good representation of what a graduate course should be.",
    "It's an interesting course to take. It addresses many problems in organic chemistry from a rather theoretical perspective.",
    "The course highlights some of the very important concepts to know as an organic chemist.",
    "This course provides a foundation of physical organic chemistry that is essential for further studies in a variety of chemistry fields. It provides a background in bonding and non-covalent interactions that will be needed in any chemistry research career. I would strongly recommend this course for any chemistry graduate student.",
    "I would encourage them not to take this class. Physical organic chemistry is a very useful and interesting field but this class is terrible",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in advanced chemistry courses. The material presented has relevance to other areas outside of organic chemistry. The course can be summarized as a introduction to concepts and techniques in physical organic chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "Although it was not applicable to my discipline, specific concepts are general and helpful i.e. solvent effects",
    "definitely helped explain some underlying trends and where to find those answers in the future",
    "The class elaborated upon the chemical phenomena behind undergraduate organic chemistry courses, which can further one's understanding of chemical reactions.",
    "It helps answer many practical questions from a theoretical perspective and also reexamines some taken-for-granted concepts. It also covers some aspects of drug design, which is helpful for my research.",
    "The course introduced some very important concepts and ideas that are crucial to furthering my career as an organic chemist. The knowledge gained in this course will be used every day throughout my dissertation\/research.",
    "This course greatly deepened my knowledge of physical organic chemistry, which will help enormously with my research and my whole chemistry career. It also provided a great source for reference data that will be useful in the future.",
    "It didn't",
    "The concepts here will aid in solving problems related to natural products total synthesis research."
