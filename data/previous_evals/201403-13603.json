   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed critiquing all the projects.",
    "I found it very informative when we would discuss the play at the beginning of class, before we did our critiques. Ming and Michael would bring up a lot of important points that most of us did not realize when we were designing. For having almost no design experience in sets, it was very helpful when I was given a very hard critique.",
    "I thought that vast variety in opinions and thoughts when critiquing and discussing certain designs and plays was very helpful and provoking.",
    "I like the way this class is run, that we get to offer feedback on everyone's design and hear Ming's critique. There is an expectation upon walking in the room that we are going to be here for a while and we are going to engage with each other honestly and with support. I think it creates a camraderie among the students, and I find that really inspiring.",
    "Great format. Loved the readings and working on designs.",
    "The critiques were always way too long, but interesting. The best part was listening to Ming just talk about the plays.",
    "I think the format and the content were very good. First, the selection of the plays - a wide variety of styles, periods and genres. Secondly, the fact that every other week we're moving to another play, gave a good pace to the progress of the class."

    "I would prefer if it didn't take so long because I mmiss half the class.",
    "I wish we would discuss the play before we would design it, instead of it being the day of our first presentation.",
    "I would stay with a set time to get through certain course material because it is difficult to get feedback on the work you have prepared if you have to leave early for a work call.",
    "I had to leave this class early nearly every day this semester because of responsibilities at the Rep or for YSD rehearsal. I only once got to stay to the end of class and really participate the entire time. I wished I could have been there for the entire class more.",
    "1. To match, even partly, the list of plays to these we, the directors, are already working on during the year. First, because of the extremely heavy work load we have. Secondly, because we can only benefit from designing a play we're dealing with and exploring in other senses (acting, directing, etc.). 2. I think our work load is so heavy in the second year, that it is too much to expect from us to come with a portrait gallery, pictures of inspiration and a sketch of the stage for each play we're working on. It just takes a lot more time than we have. Instead, I would prefer to have discussions in class with the designers regarding THEIR designs, as we did with our Shakespeare project (and as we're doing once in a few weeks with Ilona and Jane)."

    "I would like it if we could speed things along a bit.",
    "I truly enjoyed this Saturday class and am very thankful to have been a part of the many discussions.",
    "It may be better to have an intermediate day to discuss rather than crits every single class.",
    "I think this is an extremely important course. However, since it is basic in its approach, I would suggest that the directors will take it in their first year, and not in their second. Also, I felt that Ming's approach is usually literal. Again, maybe it's because this is only the first year of the designers. However, I felt that I'm missing other approaches to stage design, especially a metaphorical thinking about space, rather than literal and \"real\/realistic\"."
