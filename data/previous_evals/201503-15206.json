    "MATH 115 is a good class. Of course you have to put work and effort into it. Watch the videos. Do the prep problems. Go to class. Missing class will set you back a lot. Always do the homework. Math 115 is a great course to learn Calculus 2. Try to take the class with Professor Addicott. He is the best out of all of them in my opinion.",
    "It is an okay class but I can't see why anybody would ever take it unless they were placed into it or need it for a distributional requirement. As far as I know, the material is not particularly valuable.",
    "It definitely depends on who you talk to about this course and how much previous experience you have with Calculus (like what level you took in HS). Overall, the problem sets are very doable and they provide enough practice exams to make you feel prepared. I would recommend the class.",
    "if you have the right teacher, it's a great course. However the inside out classroom would not work with out a professor like Ethan.",
    "Great way to study Calc BC if you did take it in high school or as a review before Multi-Variable.",
    "I did not take BC calculus and the corse was challenging but it's manageable if you put in the effort. The beginning is not too bad and mostly integral, but after the first midterm we get into sequences and series, which I found very difficult because I was not familiar with it. Defintely take this course with Ethan addicott if possible. Work load is weekly problem sets and videos and prep problems due every class. Overall not too bad",
    "A good, comprehensive overview of integral calculus. Yes, I would - I think it gave me a decent foundation from which to continue my study of math.",
    "I would recommend it if you have taken BC. If you're someone like me, who has only taken AB, I think it would be a wiser choice to take 112, and just get yourself accustomed to college life.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if they can take it with Ethan. Look at previous responses.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student, because I think the flipped classroom style made it unnecessarily difficult for us to learn and to really understand the material. If they got rid of the prep videos, I would recommend the course.",
    "I would essentially summarize MATH 115 as a college level rendition of AP Calc BC. I would recommend this class but with an emphasis on the fact that it is done in a reverse classroom setting which does not necessarily work for all students. I would absolutely recommend the particular section I was in due to the instructor."
