    "This class allowed me to look at India and Pakistan from a historian's perspective and engage with some important writings about the subcontinent. I have a much better understanding of the challenges that the region faces, and have a working knowledge of the politics of a region that holds over 1\/6 of the world.",
    "Understanding of the second half of the twentieth century in India",
    "The ability to critically evaluate the understudied history of south asia as well as to understand current historiography of the region in the context of grander narratives of history",
    "I really enjoyed the way this class interacted with different historical questions. Not only did we have to contend with different time periods, including very recent history, but also several locations and questions of interpretation. Coming in without knowledge of the region also challenged me to think critically about the different sources.."

    "Strengths: Engaging, well-organized, consistency with respect to going through the chronological history of the region Weaknesses: I felt like we dwelled on the earlier part of the history since 1947. I would have liked to spend more time learning about Pakistan post-Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and India post-Indira Gandhi.",
    "Detailed understanding of the politics",
    "strengths: smart curriculum, good syllabus, small class weaknesses: lots to cover in a short period of time, no focus on facts of history, maybe too much focus on doing historiography",
    "I really liked the style of the class. The lecture\/seminar format was really good for both providing base knowledge and for creating a space for discussion. I also thought the readings for the class were thoughtfully chosen and diverse."
