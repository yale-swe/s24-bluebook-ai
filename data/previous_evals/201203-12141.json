    "Excellent course - a tremendous syllabus; dynamic, varied, and insightful lectures. A strong overview of the period that does not sacrifice depth for breadth. Ruth Yeazell is brilliant, kind, and basically everything a student could want from a professor.Shop sections: some are bad.",
    "This course is amazing. Beware the reading list (Victorian novels are SUPER LONG), because you'll have to really put the work into it if you want to get a lot out of it, but honestly, I would 100% take it again. Ruth Yeazell is MAGICAL and has the most interesting, poignant things to say, and lecture was always a pleasure to attend. Plus, when else are you going to get a chance to read Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations (my unexpected FAVORITE of the semester--turns out Dickens isn't so much of a dweeb after all), and Tess of the d'Urbervilles for homework?? All your friends will be complaining about their problem sets and you'll be reading about Heathcliff over your breakfast. The choice is yours.**Nota bene: my enjoyment of this class was largely dictated by my discussion section, which was far and away my favorite thing every week. My TA's name was Andrew, so definitely sign up for his section if you can. He's hilarious, super sweet, and also incredibly relatable. He also totally understands that these books are super long and that it's okay if you fall behind a couple times. Trust me, though, you'll love this class so much that you'll be motivated to catch up.Except when it comes to the Moonstone, the Moonstone is terrible.",
    "I would recommend this class if the subject matter interests you! Professor Yeazell is a great lecturer, you lean a lot, the course work is not overwhelming at all as long as you do the reading, and the books you read are great. However, if reading something like Jane Eyre doesn't sound great to you, don't take it.You have to like that kind of novel!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Professor Yeazell was wonderful, and the reading list was everything I wanted some day to read. It was so informative, and I felt valued both by my professor and my TA. This class is great if you enjoy Victorian literature. The reading can be heavy, so just keep up with it.",
    "Yes",
    "Basically, if you''re the kind of person who likes snuggling up with a long book in the library or your bed, take this course! You will read some great literature and the characters in these books will stick with you for a long time after the course is over.",
    "It's a great class if you like reading Victorian novels! Really great reading list, but it sometimes hard to keep up with the reading. Professor Yeazell is great.",
    "Great reading list! sometimes kind of boring",
    "Take it, for the readings and the lectures. Be prepared for a lot of reading though. It's worth taking even if you've read several of the books to hear Professor Yeazell's take on them.",
    "Take it.",
    "Wonderful class. The novels, and Prof. Yeazell, are wonderful. Definitely a lot of reading - these books are long - but completely doable. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend it for people who just love to read and discuss what they've read!",
    "This is a great class! Middlemarch is a book I don't think I would have picked up on my own and I am SO HAPPY THAT I READ ITFOR THIS COURSE!! It is a fabulous example of literature from this period and is innovative and rebellious in so many ways. George Eliot is awesome! The reading list for the rest of the course (minus the Moonstone) is equally awesome! Take it!",
    "Professor Yeazell is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. While I loved some books (yay Brontes!), I didn't enjoy others as much, but it was a great opportunity to be exposed to some lesser-known novels of the era. As a non-English major, I was a little scared about the papers, which I ultimately didn't do too well on. I don't know if my TA was a tough grader or if I didn't do enough close reading, but that's something to be wary of. Take it credit\/D to try it out.",
    "If you are even only slightly interested in the Victorian novel, Professor Yeazell is fantastic and makes it a class worth taking.Keep up with the reading because that's what makes your education worthwhile. If workload were based on what you actually turn in, it would be average. The reading list makes it above average.",
    "I loved this course! It's a really great survey of the Victorian novels, and the books we read are really interesting. Middlemarch was a bit of a struggle because it's so long, but the books are kind of pleasure reading--something I'd curl up in bed with. That said, it's a pretty heavy load of seven novels through the course of the semester, so don't pair it with other classes that are ready-heavy like I did or you might drown in text. You can make it through by skimming, but the books are really quite good (and if they aren't you can complain about them in section like my section always did) so I'd recommend only taking the course if you can invest in doing the reading--if so, it's really rewarding. Not bad in terms of work--two papers over the course of the semester, an in-section midterm, and a final. Most of the work is reading the books.",
    "This was a great class, one you should take before leaving Yale, if you are all interested in reading Victorian literature. The readings were classics that you should read before you graduate from college, and if you had already read them, Prof. Yeazell puts them in a refreshing new light that makes it a pleasure to attend lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend English 265 to a fellow student. Though the readings for this class tend to run on the heavy side, they are definitely doable with good time management, especially if you are able to read during downtime at work or during break. The best part is that the novels that we read are great so it doesn't even feel like work. Also, the workload and exams are not so heavy and difficult that they should deter a non-English major from considering this course.",
    "Absolutely wonderful class. If you like Victorian novels already then you will love it (if not, take it anyway!). The reading list is great, and Yeazell is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. The reading does get pretty heavy in the second half of the semester, but the workload otherwise is manageable, and the class is still worthwhile even if you don't get through every page of all 6 novels (and you'll be prepared for the exams if you take good notes in lecture). I highly recommend it.",
    "Great class. Ruth Yeazell is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot about a time period I'm not particularly familiar with (or fond of, though that has changed). But beware of the reading! DO NOT FALL BEHIND (even though you probably will). Do not count on using breaks to catch up on reading, because it just won't happen. But this class is really good, and for me it was worth the reading. Tess of the d'Urbervilles is also a fantastic novel -- definitely one of my favorites and one of the top reasons why I loved this class.",
    "This is an amazing class. Just a treat to spend the semester in the company of these novels. Reading load isn't as bad as everyone says, because you'll find yourself reading a chapter or two at spare moments just for fun, and then before you know it you're done with the book.",
    "You read great books and learn why they're great.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material. If Professor Yeazell is still teaching it than you should definitely consider it.",
    "Great course-- the books are wonderful (even the ones I hadnever heard of before)-- and are definitely more than meets the eye. Professor Yeazell is very nice and makes good points, often tying together many of the authors. The reading list is definitely worthwhile and comprise some of the best books in the english language worth reading.",
    "Take it if you're interested in reading a lot of Victorian Literature. Middlemarch is worth it, I promise.",
    "Definitely yes.",
    "This was a fantastic experience. Professor Yeazell is a brilliant lecturer, and her syllabus was wonderful. I have never been a particular fan of Victorian literature, but this class offered some really excellent experiences and insights. The workload was heavy - reading assignments were dense, and often very long - but I found myself taking greater pleasure in this classwork than I have for most of the classes I've taken at Yale. I'd recommend this class wholeheartedly to anyone who's willing to take the time to do it well.",
    "Take it if you want to read Victorian novels!",
    "Yes, only if you are ready to do a lot of reading and think seriously about victorian literature.",
    "This class was AMAZING. I didn't like the fact that it was a lecture with section, but only because one 50-minute section a week to talk about such long novels was not enough for me - they're just too good! The reading list was so great, I loved reading every one of the novels. Long, but SO worth it.",
    "Very interesting class, definitely recommended if you're into Victorian era literature at all, even if you're not an English major! Professor Yeazell is an amazing lecturer and the workload is fairly light even though reading can be heavy.",
    "Great overview of some key Victorian novels. I would recommend this course; Professor Yeazell is a great lecturer.",
    "I would take it if you've read Jane Eyre and liked it. If you didn't like it, do not take the course because the other novels are more dense. If you want exposure to the novels and haven't read them before, you can take it, but the midterm is difficult."
