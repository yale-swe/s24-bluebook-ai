    "I gained a better knowledge of how sleep functions, why we need sleep, and how sleep is represented in art and literature.",
    "I learned generally about the biology of sleep, circadian rhythms, sleep deprivation, dreams,and public health consequences of sleep deprivation, among other topics.",
    "I sleep better now and I prioritize sleeping better. The best thing that this class has given me is the knowledge to take care of myself and my health better.",
    "I learned a lot about sleep. Now, when people complain about their sleep issues, I have some insights to share",
    "You learn a ton about sleep science! Without actually going into the nitty-gritty hard science about it. It's cool to learn about the methods of study and the theories behind them, and we read a lot of scientific texts or secondary sources on the material.",
    "how important science is",
    "You learn a lot of practical knowledge. It teaches you how to sleep better in some sense. You become more conscious about certain things related to sleep after taking the course.",
    "I learned to approach the topic of sleep from multiple perspectiveshistory, art, popular culture, neuroscience, and psychologyand how to connect them and develop them to fit my own projects and pursuits.",
    "This course taught us a comprehensive understanding of sleep science, from its artistic representation to its measurement styles and functioning.",
    "I learned how to be more aware of negative sleep patterns and gained an appreciation for the far-reaching world of sleep through science, psychology, art, and literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - interesting topic, light workload Weaknesses - I think it could be formatted as a lecture to allow more students to take it. It's not really structured as a discussion-based course so I think making it a lecture would make more sense.",
    "The strength of this course is how welcoming it was to non-science majors. A weakness is that some of the material got very repetitive. Many of the same slides with very basic material were used over and over and over again.",
    "Strengths: The professors truly care about teaching and making the material interesting. I was always engaged during class. I enjoy how sleep was discussed in the context of sincere but also the human experience. The class covered a diversity of topics and the topics were integrated well across each other. The creative projects were particularly memorable and added to my understanding of the topics to have to come up with interesting ways of presenting the course information. Weaknesses: Students receive little feedback. Additionally, we don't get any practice exams or quizzes before our graded assessments.",
    "The professors were very understanding and adaptable to our levels of knowledge and what we wanted to learn",
    "Strengths: cool subject, relatable content, accessible form of the class. Weaknesses: the class doesnt really go above or beyond in any way, it simply communicates.",
    "lectures are boring but the few minutes spent on discussions are actually fun",
    "This course was very helpful in terms of providing information that you could apply to your own life. I think the material might be slightly more suited to a lecture format rather than a seminar.",
    "It is taught really well and the instructors are great. It offers a great balance between science and non-science. The course is not very scientific and is very accessible.",
    "For a seminar, it was only really lecture. While the professors welcomed conversation and questions, I think the style of the course classes was less conducive to discussion. However, this was still a very informative and engaging class.",
    "This course only had strengths. The professors taught in a very engaging way and enabled students to get much out of the course. Each lecture touched on a different topic but was inspiring in its own way. The professors made it easy for the students to study effectively and was well-organized, giving just the right amount of work for students to expand on their understanding of sleep science.",
    "This course's material was too general and non-specific. It also would have worked better in a lecture format.",
    "The course does a good job of introducing students to basic sleep science in a stress-free environment. Guest lectures are interesting, field trips were fun, and the class has many creative outlets. I loved the chance to explore sleep in philosophy in one paper, and sleep in literature through the project and the last paper. One problem is that slides are often repeated on the power points, and information sometimes doesn't build from week to week, but merely repeats."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this course to humanities majors who need a science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as an easy science credit. If you're interested in science, then this class will probably be too basic. But for a non-science major, it was a great class. Drs. Kryger and Baddam let us incorporate our own disciplines into the 2 five-page papers and final project. The two exams were 30 multiple choice questions but you only had to answer 25.",
    "Please take this class if you can! The class was supportive, engaging, and I learned material that influences my lifestyle now with sleep. It is one of the few classes at Yale that changed my immediate life and the topic of sleep is important for everyone to learn well.",
    "Highly recommend. This is an important topic that people should learn about that impacts daily life at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a relatively easy science credit or a fifth credit; while the course covers many interesting topics and discoveries in sleep science, it isnt particularly intellectually rigorous. Im not a STEM major by a long shot, but I often felt myself wanting to get more into the weeds of it because skimming across the surface of each subtopic within sleep science usually didnt fill up the two-hour class time. After a few weeks, I felt like all the lectures were just covering ground wed already covered, with just the occasional variation in angle or slant. Be aware that this course is more of a lecture than it is a seminar; theres not a terrible amount of discussion, or really any opportunity for discussion, because often what happens is unanswered questions result in a we dont know (perfectly legitimate) or this goes into greater scientific detail, which you dont have to know for the exam (Hang the exam! Ill brave the science if it means understanding better!) Then again, professors Kryger and Baddam have both expressed the view that this isnt so much a class as a medical intervention in the sleep health of Yalies. Which, after taking this course, I can say is a definite health concern.",
    "Great science class for non science majors",
    "Highly recommended for anybody curious about sleep. It is a fascinating and new discipline with many unanswered questions.",
    "Yes absolutely. I would recommend this class to someone wishing to dip their toes into a scientific topic while maintaining a strong social sciences and humanities backbone. This was a very accessible class. No need for prior experience or knowledge.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. The material learned in class is not only interesting, but fundamental to the way we live and essential to know, especially as a sleep-deprived college student.",
    "No, not unless you want free medical advice about your sleep issues.",
    "I would recommend this class to a Humanities major -- there are several opportunities to connect science to the Humanities through the two papers and project."
