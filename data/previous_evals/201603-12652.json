    "I came away with a much stronger understanding of the problems that have motivated recent work in EM social history over the last several decades. I was familiar with some of the observations that social historians have made and their place in a larger debate concerning methods of historical research, but I hadn't had the opportunity to discuss in detail the process of writing social history and the problems of evidence and interpretation that it entails. It was great to learn a bit more about what kinds of original records are available, what problems they pose, and what debates exist concerning their interpretation.",
    "Practice writing short papers and coming to grips with the literature on a subject. This will be helpful for writing introductions to research papers or a dissertation. I learned a lot of things about the social and cultural history of early modern England. It would be difficult to summarize, but in general after taking this course I think I could recognize many names of historians who have produced very interesting work in this field, and my curiosity has been piqued to read more about many subjects, including religious beliefs, clothing, crime, money and credit...",
    "I developed a solid background in the secondary literature of Early Modern English history. This was something I didn't have a background in before.",
    "Good insight into early modern British history. Good short papers helped focus on crux of readings."

    "I think that the course design is great-- the breadth and comprehensiveness of the syllabus renders it a great resource, even outside the framework of the course. The element of flexibility built into the reading list also, I felt, contributed in productive ways to our discussions, as people with different research interests could come to the table with observations that reflect their own area of concentration. This, of course, is also the risk inherent in the course design, but I felt that it worked well in the end, and most weeks, we managed to establish a lively conversation, even when everyone came to class with a very different knowledge set.",

    "Yes. Great course and fascinating period."
