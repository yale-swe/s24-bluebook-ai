    "The course should have been better organized. The aim of this course was to provide the tools\/knowledge to be able to perform modeling of geochemical systems. However, the instructors did not teach us neither to do modeling nor the essence and specifics of the geochemical systems modeling. It was a waste of time. I suggest that the instructors at least try to organize the course, begin with some geochemical background of the carbon cycle (as they did), then give some modeling background and tools (not just a list of existing techniques) that the students can experiment with and then expand on the geochemical modeling particularities. Once a solid background is achieved, each student could delve into its own project.",
    "Strengths: Ed and Noah are nice and feel like some of my only professors who remember\/understand what it's like to be a student. They both were willing to give extra help whenever I needed it, and checked in with me which was nice Weaknesses: Noah can be a bit unclear in his lectures sometimes. Hard to follow."

A low-key class, just a few homeworks, and you'll get as much out of it as you put in - don't have to put in much, but if you do you'll learn a lot",
