   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength is that you get to learn from professors who are at the top of their field (although you will never get to know them). Another strength is that this course is very well structured and the lectures for the most part built on one another. One weakness of this courses is that the professors clearly don't know about what the other professors teach, so sometimes lectures can seem very repetitive. Also, as with any course with rotating instructors, some are better at teaching than others.",
    "Strength is that students get leaders in the field to teach on their specialties. The TAs were also great for tying together all of the knowledge. Weakness was that there were too many professors and they did not seem organized among each other. We often would learn the same thing twice or learn something assuming we had already learned the requisite material. The class could be improved with better tests and better\/more frequent homeworks. I felt that the tests were rather poorly written and open ended essay questions didnt feel like the best way to test the type of things learned in this course.",
    "This course was overall very good, and it seems like they listen to feedback (the 30 minutes at the end of the final were helpful, especially since I could barely finish the midterm). It is strange to have so many professors, but there was not too much overlap or assumed knowledge. Some were stronger than others. The TAs were essential to the class, and were very good. It could be improved by more application-oriented things, such as looking at the types of questions on the exams or homeworks (like \"this is what's wrong, what gene could have caused it\") in lecture, or at least getting sample exam questions. Also, an upgraded camera for the lecture recordings (which were VERY useful to have) would be great. Also: please tell all the professors that the class ends at 10:15! One would exclusively end at 10:20 and say he was letting us out early, which made getting to a 10:30 class difficult."

    "I would strongly recommend this course if you're interested in understanding more about the immune system, especially as this is the only undergraduate accessible course that really teaches about the immune system. There is definitely a lot of content, but I don't think it's an ungodly amount of content as long as you keep up with the course. Also, the lectures are recorded (at very low quality).",
    "Yes, this was a solid upper-level MCDB course. I learned a lot of material and the work week-to-week was minimal. I'm generally not a fan of having the entire grade be determined by a mid-term and final but the class is designed mostly for the grad students, so I can understand the reasoning. 8\/10."
