   "comments": [
    "learning to see different cities in new ways and think about how they came to be; learn about development",
    "Professor Garvin's course outlines the fundamentals in urban planning and real estate repositioning and development. The course draws on analysis of historic urban planning and renowned urban theory.",
    "I learned theories of urban planning and city development in addition to learning the important life skills of how to participate in a planning project from a variety of different roles. Learning how these processes might play out in the real world was fascinating.",
    "Urban Planning, cityscapes, the interplay of all players in the city system",
    "Learned how to think about cities and what makes them good places to live in",
    "Great history of urban planning principles and understanding of these ideas in real cities.",
    "Very practical class. I learnt a lot about cuty planning, strategy, the logistics of it and the different roles and characters within it. I also learnt a lot about real estate.",
    "I learned more about city planning and real estate pro formas.",
    "Basic understanding of the fundamentals of urban planning\/urban studies. A grounding in what impacts an urban environment.",
    "One thing I learned in taking this course was how to obtain a bank loan to buy a multifamily residential building, evict the existing tenants, renovate the units, and either rent out the units at substantially increased rent or sell the building for a profit. Professor Garvin called this process 'repositioning,' although it seemed to me straight out of the textbook on 'gentrification,' a word that did not come up once in the entire semester. Among the many topics we did not discuss was the entirety of Jane Jacob's urban theory, perhaps the most influential urban theorist ever. Garvin did briefly discuss the work of Planner Robert Moses, including the Hudson Parkway and park and highway infrastructure throughout NYC and Long Island, but conveniently left out the more controversial aspects of Moses's projects, including slum clearing and his documented racist tendencies (see the section of his Wikipedia entry titled \"Racism\"). It was disappointing at best and disturbing at worst."

   "comments": [
    "in order to understand what is going on in the class you need to reach out to the TA because we never talked about how to do the homework and it often felt like we needed previous experience to be prepared for the games. I often felt like the students were on their own and it did not feel like a positive environment where we could discuss different ideas about a topic; i feel like we often just got roasted in class",
    "Wonderful course. Good amount of work but very interesting and on your own hometown which is great.",
    "Strengths: The Games were an effective way to convey the material while also creating engaging fun in the classroom. The Course generally builds well in its movement across different components (starting with broader things like population growth and economic sectors and moving to more specific things like public space and parks) Weaknesses: I felt like some of the assignments required a lot of legwork and understanding that couldn't be acquired inside of the classroom. Like the technological understanding required for Illustrator projects was a little much as was some of the things for the games. Based on different roles, the games required a vastly different amount of work which seemed somewhat unfair.",
    "I wish i new commercial real estate modeling better",
    "not sure about the structure being entirely based on discussion of everyone's cities - it made me feel like I wasn't learning much in the course.",
    "The games and ability to share about hometown were the biggest strengths as it made you really get into the material and actively learn.",
    "The readings could be condensed to make them more manageable and improve the quality of knowledge retained.",
    "Professor Garvin tells very interesting stories and it was cool to hear about the cities of the other people in the class.",
    "Strengths: interacting role-playing games, Prof. Garvin has a tremendous wealth of knowledge Weaknesses: repetitive assignments, repetitive lecture material, too much sharing out of homework\/not enough concrete teaching."

   "comments": [
    "not really. it was really stressful and i feel like for no good reason",
    "I would recommend to any student interested in learning more about their own hometown.",
    "If you're into cities, urban planning, or real estate this course is a must. Professor Garvin is a legend in the field and getting to hear him and engage with him for a whole semester is an incredible opportunity. The course has some deficiencies, but it's well worth it if you're passionate about the topic. SS",
    "If you want to become a city planner, architect, real estate developer, or a member of any part of government, this is an extremely useful course for you.",
    "I definitely would if you are enthusiastic about urban principles and learning about your hometown.",
    "Yes, highly interesting, significant and I left feeling like I learnt a lot and that what I learnt was meaningful",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting topic.",
    "I think it's a unique learning opportunity, so if you're interested in the material, sure.",
    "I would not recommend this course. For a class titled 'study of the city,' we covered almost none of the topics I had expected, including urban theory, policy, or history. Instead classes usually consisted of students sharing information on their hometowns--maps, population graphs, economic charts etc.--and Garvin sharing mainly anecdotal evidence from when he had visited these cities (if you're from Detroit and decide to take this class, don't ever mention the people mover). Needless to say, it gets repetitive very fast. If you're hoping to learn about urbanism, I would recommend Elihu Rubin's course American Architecture and Urbanism instead. It expands on the work of famed architecture historian Vincent Scully and offers an overview of architecture and urban planning in a much more engaging lecture format."
