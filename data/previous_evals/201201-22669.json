    "This is a great class. It will definitely help improve your speaking and writing skills. Professor Savo is amazing.",
    "Daily homework, 2 tests plus a final exam and an oral exam. Two presentations (one short, one 20 minutes, both with partners), which were helpful. Expect to speak (not a strong point for me) every day in class. Participation is definitely important. I guess I would recommend it if you truly love Spanish or must fulfill a requirement.",
    "A really really fun class where you learn a lot about Spanish culture, read a cool book and watch movies. Your discussion skills will certainly increase.",
    "yes of course",
    "Take it! If you worked all the way to L3, might as well! The work isn't bad, and even the book we read was very manageable. As for professor Savo, I do not know if she is returning, but if she does TAKE IT WITH HER! You will not regret it.",
    "Yes its not too hard and pretty fun!",
    "Spanish 140 is an intermediate Spanish course that provides a strong foundation in grammatical concepts and vocabulary for future Spanish coursework. It improves all areas of language use--reading, writing, speaking, and listening comprehension--and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to use Spanish in any context.",
    "I would recommend it even if it's mandatory, if you are serious about improving your Spanish.",
    "yes, i would definitely recommend it to fulfill a language requirement",
    "Students should definitely take Spanish 140 because this level integrates more Hispanic culture into the course than lower levels."
