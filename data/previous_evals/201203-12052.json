   "comments": [
    "Best class ever. You need to take it. Whether you're an HSAR major or you've never taken a single art history course before. The readings are tough, but so interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class. I learned quite a lot about the art from the late 19th and early 20th century. The lectures are engaging and informative. The graded workload is very light--just a short paper, a midterm, and a final. That being said, you probably shouldn't take this course without some background in art history because the readings get a little heavy (which makes section incredibly painful because no one has actually done the reading).",
    "It's fun! Prof. Zeidler's voice is way too low. Apart from that, interesting lectures and even more interesting discussions.",
    "This is more a class on Zeidler's interpretations of art than it is about the defining features of various movements in art history. I learned more about the latter from the (very good) textbook. If that doesn't bother you, and you are prepared to interpret paintings in erotic, Freudian, Marxist, feminist and other -ist ways, then take this course. The workload is entirely manageable, with easy exams, one paper and not a lot of reading.",
    "Take this class, even if you don't have any background in art history. I had never taken an art history class in my life, and I found it to be very manageable and interesting. Professor Zeidler is honestly the best lecturer I have ever had, and I would take any class he's teaching because I think he could make any topic interesting!",
    "It is an excellent class that every art history major should take, if only for the pleasure of hearing Zeidler's lectures.",
    "Take it. I had never taken art history before and I loved this class -- Prof. Zeidler's lectures are both interesting and accessible for those who don't know anything about art.",
    "Take it only if you are interested in early 20th century art (but not just art in general!)",
    "I strongly recommend this class. It covers the important artists, works, and movements in art from the late 19th century into the first half of the 20th. And it does so effectively and enjoyably.",
    "It would be a nice art history class for a non-art history major",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. Professor Zeidler is an excellent lecturer.",
    "Take it!!! So interesting. Manageable and zeidler is incredible",
    "This course is a must-take, regardless of your level of interest in Art History. It is full of juniors and seniors, but it is also open to sophmores and freshmen. No previous knowledge in the field is necessary as long as you do the readings and attend the lectures (all of them, fantastic, with no doubt). Take this class!",
    "Absolutely--great lecturer, great sector of Art History to know about.",
    "This class should be called late 19th and early 20th century art. There's a lot from the 1860s-1860s, including by Caillebotte, Monet, Manet, Seurat, Degas, and Rodin. It is a solid introductory class to this art through the art of the 1940s.",
    "take it!! the work load is totally doable so non art history people who want to understand why Picasso is famous, or questions like that, take this course for the answers and a lot lot more without the fear of being a non-major",
    "Whether your an art history major or pre-med, if you have any interest in the matter take it !!",
    "a great course on great material. if you're interested in modern art, take it. i enjoyed going to class.",
    "Take it!",
    "I loved this class, and wouldabsolutely recommend it! I didn't want to miss a single word Professor Zeidler said, and felt like I was really learning new stuff all the time. It was inspiring, and it made me look and think in new ways, at art, at historical forces and at the world in general.",
    "A great survey that tells a narration of modern art. Good for students who have never taken art history. The second half of the semester is not cumulative in terms of rote memorization but in terms of broad concepts.",
    "Definitely recommended. A solid class.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "Definitely take this class, fascinating stuff, wide range of material, straightforward assignments, not much reading and it's worth doing, very good lectures.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to my fellow students. Many of my friends who took this class were at first not very interested in art, but at the end of the semester, they were eager to find another art history class saying that this class was much more than what they had expected. I always thought of art history as my major, and this class deepened my interest and passion in arts. The best thing about this class is that you come to see art in a way that you never did before.",
    "Exactly what it says - major movements from 1945-present, focusing on 3-4 artists per period in the beginning then just 1 or 2 per movement towards the end, but that may have also been a result of us running out of time.",
    "A good alternative if you want to take a survey art history course but want something more focused than the two main surveys. That said, the first half is great and covers a wide variety of famous artists and paintings, while the second quickly narrows and focuses on off-beat German and Soviet Union art.",
    "Yes, I would. I really enjoyed this course. Professor Zeidler is wonderfully wacky and loves his art. My only complaint about him was that he speaks very quietly, so if anyone coughs or flips their notebook page too loud you will miss something.",
    "This is an engaging course on modern art \u00e2\u0080\u0093 take it if you're interested in thinking about different modes of figuration while listening to an entertaining lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in history of art or modern art, I recommend that you take this course whether or not you are a history of art major or not."
