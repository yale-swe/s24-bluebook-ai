    "This was very useful for getting acquainted with the members of our department and for gaining professionalization tips. I always looked forward to attending. I hope that this continues for next year's first-year cohort, as it also gave me an opportunity to get to know my cohort-mates. It gave me an opportunity to learn more about the academic\/personal backgrounds of many professors, many of whom I do not encounter on a frequent basis. It showed me how welcoming and supportive the sociology department is.",
    "I got to know all of the faculty members and how they became sociologists. There were chances to get a glimpse of their personality, advising style and their values as a researcher."
