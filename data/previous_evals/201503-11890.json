   "comments": [
    "A great class, covering the breadth (if not quite the depth) of Western tragedy. This class is perfect for students considering Directed Studies but worried about giving up so much of their freshman year, as well as anyone with a literary or classical bent and a morbid streak. The class can be very fast-paced, sometimes to the detriment of the analysis of the works. 4 papers and a final. The class will hold your hand less on the writing than, say, 114 or 115. The papers are literary analysis papers, prioritizing a strong thesis and clear logical argumentation over style or fluff. Stem majors and students who worry about their ability to write creatively or artistically need not fear this class. The only thing it demands (besides a great deal of reading) is the ability to create convincing, well-organized arguments about deep questions of existence.",
    "This is a fun course, if you're willing to read a lot. I'd definitely recommend it. I feel like I've definitely expanded my knowledge of literature and of tragedy as a genre.",
    "This is a very interesting course, and I would definitely recommend it to freshmen if they feel confident in their writing abilities, and feel that they have time to do the reading.",
    "Intensive course on tragedy and western canon. I really enjoyed it."
