   "comments": [
    "It involves reading a lot of short medieval plays or looking at artworks and then discussing them. I would highly recommend it as an interesting, if not particularly challenging course.",
    "If you are very interested in plays, you would love this class. Otherwise, after a few weeks, it gets a bit repetitive. There are only two papers and a final project, so the workload is not bad.",
    "In this class, several types of medieval drama (Google \"cycle drama,\" \"morality plays,\" and \"liturgical drama\" if interested) serve as the core reading. Essays on performance and on medieval drama also shed light on\/increase background knowledge of these dramas. Finally, modern renditions of medieval dramas and modern artistic reactions to medieval dramatic themes and motifs fostered deep thinking on medieval drama.Because this course connected medieval theatre to drama in general, and because drama does make up such a significant part of literature, I recommend this course to every one of my peers. Our class discussions on performance, perspective, theme, intent, and related topics greatly deepened my understanding of all literature."
