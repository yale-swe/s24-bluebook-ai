    "Instructor: Luisa Cortesi \u00a0Strengths: engaged with readings, desire to help, helpful feedback on abstract - particularly with useful readings that would go well with the paper room for improvement: 1) was more focused on having each commentator say something for the sake of saying something than having an interesting discussion, 2) asked us to email you what we wanted to get out of the class and could use help with for our paper, but there was no follow up on your part to do so, 3) seemed to come across as frustrated with class when we weren't on same page as you, for example with writing sessions for the paper. That was a great idea, but we'd get what came off as passive aggressive emails when nobody would sign up. The emails did not encourage me to take part.",
    "Instructor: Luisa Cortesi \u00a0Luisa was incredibly accessible and patient. Sometimes it was a bit hard for her to communicate concepts to us at our level, but it was helpful to hear her more experienced take on things, too.",
    "Instructor: Luisa Cortesi \u00a0The teaching assistant was very devoted to student learning and set up special sessions to work on our paper, which I found useful. Her feedback on my papers were very helpful and she helped facilitate discussion during class well. I learned a lot from the lecture she organized about her own research. In the future, perhaps more emails explaining or reminding when assignments were due and the instructions for them would be useful. At times I was a little unsure.",
    "Instructor: Luisa Cortesi \u00a0Regular office hours should be set up. Communications were generally unclear. Later attempts to start a writing group were appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Luisa Cortesi \u00a0The teaching assistant was very open to individual questions and able to clearly give answers for specific questions. The area I think could be improved is leading discussions and asking students to engage more with the information."

   "comments": [
    "The discussion was a complete waste of time in practice. It failed due to a combination of 1) poor structure (it's awkward and pointless to have each commentator summarize a reading when Dove just spend two hours doing a great synthesis of the readings), 2) poor time management (sometimes we'd have 30 min, others an hour), and 3) lack of engagement on part of some students who hadn't read or thought about the readings. I like Karen Seto's structure of discussions - each student writes a commentary each week and commentates on one of them - that gets an engaged discussion. Within the current framework, I'd drop the ask of commentators to summarize readings, and instead just get straight to the questions. The readings were also somewhat outdated. While I appreciate reading seminal works, it seemed the bulk of the readings emerged in the 80s and 90s. Question is - if they are still relevant today, then does that mean they didn't accomplish their goals of changing the discourse? If they didn't work, then how seminal are they? If they did work, then we should be reading the current versions of those readings that are addressing current challenges of development. Frequently it seemed that I had to take face value many of the assumptions of the readings because I lacked the context in which the readings were developed. Would be helpful to have a few context articles, such as for green revolution. The paper was confusing in the end. It seemed that to apply the course material best, we'd essentially need to do an ethnography, which you can't do for the paper. Lot left to be desired on the paper, would have been helpful to have more structure.",
    "It would be helpful to make the class a bit more discussion based. I felt like we never really had time to flesh out our understanding of the material through discussion, though I often found these discussions to be some of the more interesting parts of the course.",
    "The reading load was a little heavy considering the work required to write the final paper. I valued all of the readings, but felt hard-pressed to read some of them so I could work on my final paper instead.",
    "The discussions",
    "More class interactions please!"
