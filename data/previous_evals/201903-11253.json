    "I learned how to think about problems and to keep going and to throw everything I know about a topic together in solving a question.",
    "I learned how to find area by taking integrals",
    "Integration techniques, sequences and series, etc. Basically all standard calculus II topics.",
    "A deeper understanding of calculus.",
    "Calculus",
    "Learned calculus.",
    "I strengthened my knowledge of Calculus through taking this course, and also learned a couple new things that I hadn't previously known.",
    "Integral calculus w\/ applications, sequences, series, polar coordinates, curves, and parametric equations",
    "Integration, Series, and Polar\/Parametric Equations",
    "I learned how to study for math effectively, other than all of the skills I learned in the classroom as well.",
    "This course gave me a thorough understanding of Calc 2 concepts.",
    "Not only did I acquire calculus skills such as evaluating series and integration, but I also developed a strong study regime which was necessary for my success in this class.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of calculus 2 and how to apply it in different ways",
    "I learned many details of BC Calculus I previously struggled with.",
    "I gleaned a better understanding of techniques of integration and exposure to series.",
    "Before the course I was very shaky on integration methods and intuition as well as understanding series. Now I have a good understanding of these concepts, and am able to think about the mathematics on a conceptual level.",
    "I became more comfortable with calculus.",
    "I developed what feels like a very complete knowledge of this section of calculus while taking this course, but that is only because I was lucky and got into a section with a very competent professor. What I took away from Math 115 is that success in the course is based heavily on the professor, as the teaching skill level varies immensely among professors."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: Your experience in the class is completely based on who your professor is. They are not consistent in their teaching methods or even what they choose to go over in class. Strengths: If you get a good professor, you will have a fine time. The homework is the same every week so there are no surprises, but some PSETS are much longer than others.",
    "The grading scale for the examination is harsh and does not encourage discovery or new methods of solving problems.",
    "I think the class work should relate more to the problems on the exams",
    "Strengths: well-organized, follows the syllabus; midterms are graded online with clear feedback for all corrections Weaknesses: nothing much; weekly homework is sometimes a bit long but still manageable",
    "the psets arent too helpful they dont help with deeper understanding just the surface.",
    "Itziar is a great professor. If you're taking MATH 115 you have to take it with her! She gives lecture notes which are life-saving",
    "Strengths: held students to a high standard with plenty of support from peer tutors. Weekly explorations were not that helpful and became more of a chore than something that assisted learned outside of class.",
    "I think that this course was strong because it provided many opportunities for students to learn and keep their grades up. I think that the weekly explorations, however, didn't do much for me and were more of a nuisance than a learning opportunity.",
    "For a student who only took up to AB calculus in high school, the course seemed more challenging compared to my peers who took BC since they had already seen the material and it was review for them. My section was well taught in the way that it was taught like no one had prior knowledge on the topics. However, the depth of knowledge and understanding that were required to do well on the midterms were demanding seeing the material for the first time in contrast to students seeing it for a second time and already gained that sense of understanding. The explorations didnt really help at all and was just another extra task I had to remember to do, so for future students, I suggest not including those. Furthermore, Psets should not be due the week of the midterm. This created a lot of stress for my peers and me because it was difficult having to split time between finishing the pset and being able to study well for the midterms.",
    "The teaching for me was good; the material was tough which is somewhat harder to improve.",
    "This course could improve by having a better teaching strategy. The teaching was very fast and hard to understand.",
    "The class was solely based off of engagement with classmates, but some of my classmates were not willing to help me during class, which made things a little more difficult.",
    "This course was well organized, and the homework was an accurate and useful reflection of the content.",
    "Despite the sheer number of sections in this course, it seemed very organized. There was a helpful umbrella canvas page which included information for all sections and it seemed that no matter which teacher a person had, we were all given the same information.",
    "A strength of the course is the course material is interesting. A weakness of the course is the speed at which it goes.",
    "Diverse material was a strength. I did not like that exams werent cumulative until the final.",
    "Strengths: the teacher and how it was taught! Loved her way to teach",
    "P-sets are heavily emphasized in the course but do not have significant weight in the course. I spent several hours a week doing p-sets, but they did not help in test preparation.",
    "My class was very organized. Each topic was broken down and explained step by step and was also well organized in relation to other topics.There was also plenty of time for practice problems in class. One thing I did not enjoy were daily quizzes. I felt those were not well integrated into lecture and ultimately were not useful in understanding the concepts presented in class. Another problem is that some concepts seem to be rushed for the sake of the exam. On our second exam we were tested on a concept we had just learned in the previous class not even a week earlier. This was similar for polar and parametric graphs on our final exam. Some of the concepts are not given the time they deserve in class to ensure we understand them well.",
    "None. Itziar and her packets each class were amazing.",
    "Itziar Ochoa de Alaiza is one of the strengths Math 115 has as a course. On the other hand, some of the professors teaching the course are a weakness. The biggest problem with Math 115 is the immense variance in teaching skill-level among the professors. This variety causes a discrepancy in the skill level of students in this course, not by their own fault but by the fault of the low expectations of each professor."

   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it or get a highly reviewed and liked professor. If not, it might not be worth it.",
    "Yes, to a student very strong in math skills and is passionate about math",
    "If you need to take this course as a calculus requirement, then yes, I'd recommend it. It's generally a good class and you learn a lot of interesting calculus topics, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. Quality of the course is probably highly dependent on the instructor; Itziar is great!",
    "Yes. Take it with Itziar.",
    "Yes, great course to gain a solid foundation in calculus.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it's intellectually stimulating, but not to the point where you'd be buried underneath a ton of work you don't understand.",
    "I would only recommend it to students who are required to take the course. If youve only taken AB calculus, be prepared for a challenge and feel at a disadvantage compared to your peers who had taken BC in high school. However, take advantage of your professors office hours and peer tutoring to better understand the material to make up for seeing the material for the first time.",
    "No; not unless it is required for your major.",
    "If they needed it for their major, I would recommend my teacher, but for a humanities major, I would not recommend this level of math.",
    "I would recommend this course. I would also recommend shopping for the right professor, because it truly makes all the difference.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to take a challenging yet totally doable math course.",
    "I would recommend it if your are someone who is genuinely interested in calculus\/math or if it is a prereq. Its very fast and requires a lot of application of the concepts taught in class.",
    "Yes, if you are genuinely interested in math. If you dont really like math but you take this class because you placed into it, you will probably be frustrated and stressed by it.",
    "Yes, it was a challenging course with many opportunities for learning.",
    "Yes, if you want to\/need to take math 115 take it with Itziar. She is truly amazing",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have already been exposed to calc 2. Otherwise, the course is extremely fast paced and often difficult to follow.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, however, for those who have never seen integration before, it would be challenging because the course goes by very quickly. If you have been introduced to the material before, the course becomes a lot more manageable.",
    "Yes. Great intro level course",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student if they have the chance to take it with Itziar Ochoa de Alaiza or another professor with the same teaching ability. Otherwise, taking this course will set students up for a long, confusing semester."
