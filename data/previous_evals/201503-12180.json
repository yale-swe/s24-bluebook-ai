    "Take this course. Seriously, just take it. Professors such as Rosie Bsheer are the reason why Yale is special. This class will challenge you. It will make you question beliefs that you've held towards democracy, the United States, and, of course, oil. More than that, this course is probably the best way to prepare yourself for four years of college. There's a good amount of readings, and many of them very challenging, yet you will come out a better person. I should make a slight change to my first statement: take this course if you want to challenge yourself and are willing to make the most out of it. If you're going to just read a couple of the readings and sit quietly through class, you're honestly just wasting a very sought-after spot in the course.",
    "This course will change your perspective of the world around you and the lens with which you analyze and perceive world politics. Take this course if you have the ability and enthusiasm to work extremely extremely hard for the rewards.",
    "It's a lot of work but great.",
    "This course blew me away! It taught me how to read history for the first time. Professor Bsheer challenges everyone in the class and manages to tease out the best out of your amazing peers. This class is a lot of work--but well worth it!",
    "This course was an interesting course. The readings are diverse and teach you about the politics of knowledge production, relation between politics and economics and lot more. You will learn a lot about the middle east and oil history.",
    "This is a a class on the history of oil, the makings of the contemporary imperialism, and seeing through false narratives. The lessons learned in Oil and Emp go far beyond what we read about. Each class is fascinating and engaging, and the work is incredibly fulfilling. If you like writing research papers, take this class. If you don't like writing research papers, also take this class, because it's worth it.",
    "Oil and Empire is very challenging but it is also hugely rewarding.",
    "This is a great course that delves into the history of oil and the U.S. interests related to it. The readings and class discussions were all amazing, but you have to be willing to put a lot of work in. Each week there was a lot of reading to do, but it was all interesting so I didn't have any regrets.",
    "This is an amazing course. I learned so much content: a global history of oil, a history of US empire, and about the history of the Middle East. Moreover, the course teaches skills necessary for continuing in the humanities (particularly history, of course). I learned how to read texts from different disciplines, how to complete lots of reading, how to participate in seminar discussions, how to write a response paper, how to write a research paper, how to research, and more. I am SO happy that I was lucky enough to take this course! I feel much more prepared to discuss international affairs, to research and to write, and, more generally, to succeed in future courses. I often felt disheartened by injustice in the world but also inspired by Professor Bsheer. Now, I am considering majoring in history and I want to further study all of this material. Professor Bsheer is a gem of a professor. Even if you can't take this class, take any class you can with her.",
    "A fantastic class- I would highly recommend anyone to take it. Your views on oil and the United States as an imperial force will be forever changed.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in current events (especially in the Middle East), people who just love history, or to people who are more interested in STEM but still want a more modern history class.",
    "I would recommend this class, because it teaches you how to open your mind and question what you hear. Professor Bsheer is incredible and the class forces you to push your boundaries in workload. Professor Bsheer holds the class to high standards and forces the class to have incredible discussions. That being said, this is a time intensive course and your course schedule should adjust for it.",
    "This is a must-take class. It's far, far more than just a history class. Through the close examination of the history of oil in the modern world, the class is able to dive into the complex and varied topics of race, sexism, politics, states, and so on. It genuinely transforms your understanding of not just recent history, but numerous concepts and ideas that you take for granted. The readings are long, dense, and heavy, but they are more than worth it, as the class is incredibly rewarding. Definitely highly recommended.",
    "HIST 042 01 was basically a class focused on analyzing how oil influences world governments. We covered a range of countries histories from all over the world, looking at how oil was discovered in the country, how the industry expanded, and how it shaped the country today. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned so much and I feel like its such a relevant topic today, plus the discussions were really fun and interesting to take part in.",
    "Oil and Empire is an eye-opening class which provides a rare look into the way the United States functions as an empire abroad. A lot of it is focused on the dynamics of the Middle East and how oil has changed the political landscape there. However, I don't think you have to be interested in these specific topics to find it fascinating! It's very rewarding, but be prepared to spend a LOT of time doing the readings throughout the term, and even more time on the final research paper, which is a huge project. Professor Bsheer is the kind of professor whose respect you want to earn, and that takes a lot of effort. Her experiences in research are incredible to hear about, and her overall knowledge makes the class more than worthwhile.",
    "A hard, but yet rewarding class. Couldn't recommend it any more",
    "This course covers the influence of oil since its discovery, particularly how it became a primary motivating factor in interventions and conflicts around the world. The class discusses how information itself is created and how it has repeatedly been construed to fit certain narratives. While this class is very time-consuming and slightly intimidating for non-humanities majors, the class is almost essential to understanding modern conflicts and politics. It will force you to become much more critical of governments and industries in general, beyond even the scope of oil."
