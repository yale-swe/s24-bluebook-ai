   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Especially if Amy teaches it again. The play will come so easily with such inspirational (and notably young) reading material. Such a cool little lab to try out writing and get really constructive feedback about how to craft a play.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "If you are interested in having a true workshop experience as a writer as well as continuing to expand your horizons in contemporary theater, this is a great class to take. It is rewarding, challenging, and inspiring.",
    "If this class is ever offered again, you should absolutely take it. Not only did I learn a huge amount and leave with a workshopped draft of a play and a knowledge of some awesome new broadway and off broadway texts, but I looked forward to this class as a fun break from the stress and anonymity of school. The class setups of the three different playwriting classes offered are fairly similar, so the main difference is the reading list and the teacher. This class had my favorite of both. It was also entirely busy-work-free (!), and there were some awesome guests from YSD and the Yale Rep who came in to talk with us (not just playwrights but people from a variety of fields who could answer questions about the specific works we had read, and about writing in general from both a creative and a more career oriented, pragmatic standpoint)."
