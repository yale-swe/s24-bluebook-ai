    "Basic L4 French, Madame Koizim is awesome, really great teacher and makes class really fun and interesting.",
    "I've had a verygood (though limited) experience with the French department at Yale, and French 140 is no exception. Though the workload is a significant increase from 130 (expect to be reading 40-50 pages a night towards the end), it's doable, and not often entertaining. Koizim was an amazing professor and one of the people I've enjoyed getting to most at Yale. (You might want to choose a different professor if you don't like sarcasm, though. It was never directed at students of course, and I personally found it highly entertaining. French 140 was one of the classes I really looked forward to!)",
    "This class is great! You should definitely take it if you make it past L3 which has a lot more work than L4. You really learn a lot, and I feel very prepared for L5 courses. The readings are also great.",
    "I would reccomend this class to another student because it introduced harder\/more idiomatic grammar topics and was a good introduction to reading longer texts in French.",
    "It is a wonderful introduction and continuation to the French Language course. I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "YES! Especially with Mme Koizim."
