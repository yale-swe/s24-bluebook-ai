   "comments": [
    "Maybe mandatory office hours once in a while to check in would be helpful",
    "The M\/W\/F classes have too little time. If each class were an hour then it would probably give more time for practice and asking the instructor for clarification on certain practice problems.",
    "I honestly really dislike the whole \"flipped classroom\" idea and thought the pre-class videos were largely unhelpful. By the end of the course I didn't even watch them and instead just read the textbook, which was much more relevant to the problem sets and exams. I also felt like the practice exams were always easier than the actual exams. For some reason I always seemed to be able to do the practice exams, but then I came into the exams and found them quite difficult (maybe this is just a reflection of my own test anxiety, but I know others felt the same way and it has never been an issue for me before).",
    "Organization.",
    "The flipped classroom was very hard to deal with but it was a good learning experience.",
    "I think the homework should be more similar to the exams.",
    "I think that a major weakness was the disconnect between the flipped classroom videos and what we learn and are tested on in class. Many topics are glossed over in the videos.",
    "My teacher didnt a good job of dividing the class into tracking time and review time along with keeping people paying attention",
    "Flipped classrooms are much less effective in getting the lesson clearly across",
    "This course can be improved if attention is given to students understanding these concepts and being given the space to experiment with the ideas and techniques learnt on thier own.",
    "I hate the reverse class room it is the worst idea. Although Yale is a great college their math department is in dire need of improvement. The grading system is also very ineffective and this course is based on much memorization.",
    "This course taught concepts through formulas and rules but I think if it were framed with more connections to what calculus is used for would have seemed more worth while."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "No. Id suggest they pursue other math areas. However calculus is very important to many fields so they probably have to take it."
