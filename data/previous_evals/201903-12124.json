    "I learned how to approach the senior thesis in ERM. I can't believe other majors don't have this seminar as a support system! I learned how to organize my sources, crystalize my argument, and continually be considering and revising my project.",
    "This course taught me all of the steps needed to write a thesis\/research paper. From developing an initial question to writing a preliminary literature review, this course broke down all of the steps needed to write a successful research paper.",
    "How to narrow down a thesis topic, how to approach a large research project, how to write a literature review"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course sometimes felt a little unecessary but in the end, I appreciate the assignments and deadlines as they helped me narrow down my scope of research and what I was trying to say.",
    "The strength of the course is creating a space for ER&M seniors. I think it is absolutely crucial that this space exists. However, the course structure was not the most productive in terms of time usage. The number of guest speakers is not needed. A useful change would be applying the skills learned in the Writer's Manual (which is a useful text) and coming into class to work on them. While this class structure resembles more of a study hall, it provides students the ability to use class time to apply the skills colloquium seeks to offer. The students should list goals coming into each class period for what they want to achieve regarding their project. during the last half hour, everyone checks in and reviews what they have done, and the professor suggests new goals for the next week. This format would be the most productive and helpful for students.",
    "While this course was helpful in that it forces ER&M students to be proactive in working on their theses, certain classes were less helpful than others. The units on writing literature reviews, editing papers, coming up with guiding questions were very helpful but during some weeks, we read works by professors that were very different style-wise from research papers. As a consequence, I felt as though the time we spent discussing their papers was not as helpful for me when it came time to work on the final project.",
    "I think this course really needs some crucial changes to make it facilitate the senior thesis writing process a lot more than it currently does. I would be immensely helpful if we had someone from the IRB review board come to speak with us and guide us though the basics of the process which is really confusing and overwhelming to do on your own. I also think this course is difficult to prioritize as a senior when so many other course require immediate work to be turned in rather than long term planning for a thesis yo might not even be writing until next semester. I think if the assignments were a bit more spread out and not so front and backloaded it would make it a bit easier to chip away at the work. Having 1\/2 the lit review due before Thanksgiving break, for example, would've pushed me to get it done before all my other finals came hurling at me.",
    "A difficulty of this class is working with other students on their topics which are all vastly different from one another. You can provide as much help as an outsider, but typically, your professors and peers have no clue about the field of studies surrounding your topic. I wished the course facilitated more meetings with our advisors and faculty members who are experts in our specific areas. I enjoyed that our class welcomed a multitude of guest speakers who gave advice on writing academic theses. In the first half of the semester, there were 3 short assignments and that were effective in keeping the class accountable to working on your project. However, after that, you are suppose to work on a final assignment. It depends on the type of student, but we didn't have many readings because our homework is to research for our thesis. One must keep themselves accountable to achieve progress and be in contact with professors and librarians to ensure that you are on the right track. Basically, more status updates and advice from professors. Also, I hope a future iteration of the class will include more student workshops in groups. We had three of them in the beginning of the semester, and it was awesome to get constructive feedback from your peers throughout the process.",
    "I think this class was helpful in guiding us through the process of coming up with a topic for and writing a large research project. It might have not been necessary to meet every week, and instead meet as a series of workshops twice a month or so, since the most helpful parts of the class were workshopping and setting deadlines."

    "Since this course is required for all ERM seniors, I can't exactly recommend it, but I would say to anyone who has to take it, just look on the bright side and appreciate that this course keeps you moving on your senior thesis! Which you need to graduate!!",
    "This course is required for ER&M seniors.",
    "Required course fro ER&M seniors so we all had to take it but really hope some changes are made to it in the future",
    "This course is mandatory for the major in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration. I recommend it because it is extremely helpful in completing a type of essay in fulfillment for your thesis. However, you need to be self-driven and extremely passionate to truly receive benefits from the class. A majority of the readings were about learning how to write a research paper or thesis - which is helpful, but other classes should have taught us these skills earlier in our academic career. When you take this class, I suggest being vocal about your goals and your steps to achieve them throughout the semester. Professor Tran and Professor Habchi were very supportive, and with my fellow peers, we created a community together. It's a very nice class, but has unfulfilled promise. Hopefully, it will achieve that potential in the future.",
