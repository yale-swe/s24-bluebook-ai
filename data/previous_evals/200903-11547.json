   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're required. Probably not too interesting otherwise.",
    "I enjoyed the material in this course. It's a new way of thinking, especially for those without a lot of math experience. That being said, try taking it with another professor. Feigenbaum thinks everything is intuitive and obvious to the whole class, and that makes asking potentially trivial questions problematic.If you stick with it though, you'll come out with a strong appreciation of, and aptitude in mathematical proofs and thinking.",
    "It's pretty much required, so yeah, but I would def. check out MATH 244 first.",
    "if you don't absolutely have to take this class, DON'T TAKE IT! problem sets were a weekly nightmare, lectures were both boring and totally unhelpful, and the textbook was long-winded and confusing (a bad combination!). the material is dry and much of it doesn't seem to apply to computer science at all. also, fair partial credit is not given on exams. in summary, this class is a huge workload with little benefit, and you will certainly regret taking it if it's not completely necessary. of course, this could all change if professor feigenbaum isn't teaching it....but if she is.....don't put yourself through this. this class actually caused me to start grinding my teeth at night, and has made for a wholly miserable semester.",
    "Relatively easy concepts, but tricky tests and homeworks, so hard to get a good grade.",
    "Umm required class so I'm guessing you have no choice. Material is actually kind of interesting. Do well on the homework, its worth %50 of your grade.",
    "If you're a CS major, you have to take this course. It's not very much work, so you probably won't care. If you're not a CS major, why would you take this? You probably already know most of the material, so I would recommend the math dept's discrete math course instead.",
    "Take it. You learn a lot of interesting material.",
    "Probably wouldn't take it if I wasn't trying to fulfill prereqs for upper electives, unless you really like discrete math.",
    "202 is a great class for computer science-oriented students. While it may not go as in depth as Math 244 into the theory of discrete math, the material is much more useful and applicable for algorithmic analysis. Even without a computer science background, it's a fun class.",
    "I took this as a required class. I wouldn't take it, if it wasn't required, but it still isn't a bad class.",
    "Bad course. Poor instructor. Not very interesting, often tedious. Little connection to computer science discussed Only take it if you must. Redeeming feature is its low workload.",
    "Take it if you need to. If it's not a requirement do not torture yourself.",
    "Pretty easy course (I had Joan Feigenbaum). Though I hear Jim Aspnes is a better teacher (though the course is harder). (Jim Aspnes is an awesome guy and teacher; you should definitely take a class with him if you can.)This is basically Discrete Math (the CS department equivalent of MATH 244). Not nearly as much work or as difficult as any of the requisite programming-based CS courses, like 201, 223, or 323.",
    "If you're a computer science major you have to take this class. I feel sorry for you. Professor Feigenbaum was simply not a good teacher.202 was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale, maybe the worst class I have taken in my entire academic career. I managed to struggle through this class while learning nothing of use. All of the material seemed super obvious and easy until I went to lecture. The teacher managed to take simple concepts and make them incomprehensible and complicated every time. The book the class was taught out of was awful. I can't count how many times the book explained a concept and then said \"we've saved the proof of this concept for an exercise.\" Why not just teach the concept rather than having the student sweat it out in a proof.The problem sets were either ridiculously easy and had 0 pedantic value, or ridiculously hard and also had 0 pedantic value. A lot of the problems involved isolated instances of \"mathematic creativity\" that could not be applied from one problem to the next. There were too many theoretical math questions and not enough applied math questions.The professor did a lousy job explaining how any of the stuff we were learning related to computer science.For the final we had to memorize pointless tables and formulas that I know as a computer science major I will never EVER have to use.I hated Computer Science 202, the only consolation is that I took this early in the computer science major, and I won't have to take it later in my Yale career.",
    "It's a required course, but it's still pretty interesting. The problem sets ranged from easy to difficult depending on the material. The professor who taught it this semester normally teaches higher level courses, and things were a little unrefined. Still, overall, a good course.",
    "I loved the material in this class but Prof. Feigenbaum just absolutely killed it for me. She was awful - her explanations were poor, she clearly had no interest in teaching undergraduates and had very little interaction with students by relaying all our questions to the TA and her assistant. I went to every lecture but learned close to nothing from her - I learned everything from the book and online lectures that I found. Course moves very quickly so keep up. The TA and my love for Math were the only things that made this course bearable. If you can substitute this course with Math 244 give that a try before you go on to take this course with Feigenbaum."
