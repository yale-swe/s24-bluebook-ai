    "if you are looking for a writing credit but want something that will \/actually\/ improve your writing rather than just make you write a research paper about farming or instagram or something, and you like literature, and you want to read a good survey of specifically american literature, and you've always wanted to read moby dick (side note: do not take this class if you do not intend to read all of moby dick. your paper and frankly your learning holistically will suffer. i am soooo glad i powered through and finished it. really, it's phenomenal.), and you want to read some poetry and get better at reading that too, this is a wonderful class for you! professor roffman is absolutely amazing and i would highly highly highly recommend taking any class with her.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 127 to students of all majors! It's a great introductory English class and it's a lot of fun even if you're not an English major."
