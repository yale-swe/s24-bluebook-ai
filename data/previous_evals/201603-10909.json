However, I wish the class gave more context to a lot of the equations that we were following step-to-step on the lecture slides."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, I would recommend this course -- the material is dense but the course structure also makes it pretty doable (biweekly psets and a take-home final). Sometimes I felt like the focus of the lectures was more on going from one line of a derivation to the next as opposed to understanding big picture what was going on. I also in general spent a lot of time just trying to figure out the math to fill in the steps for derivations, which was simultaneously good practice but also frustrating at times."
