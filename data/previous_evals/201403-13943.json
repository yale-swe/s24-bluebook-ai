    "I would definitely recommend this class for someone to take. Even if you have no prior experience with music or interments, like myself, you would fit right in with this class. I am really happy that I chose to next this class this semester and now I have a foundation in music.",
    "Yes with Marissa! Fun and not too hard. A great 5th class, and works well as a cr\/d.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student who had little to no grasp of music theory.",
    "I would recommend it. I would tell them some parts are easier to understand than others. Overall a very fun class and is nice to have because it is different than regular courses.",
    "Music 110 is a fun introduction to understanding music - from popular to classical. If you have no theory experience at all, the class will definitely be challenging (as people with experience will definitely be taking it with you) but the professors (particularly Glynias) will be most understanding of this and adjust accordingly, so don't be afraid. By the end of the class, you'll have composed two pieces of music with actual depth and you'll understand why they work. You'll also functionally be able to play simple songs on the piano and annoy your friends by analyzing all of their favorite songs that pop up on the radio. The class is worthwhile and for her first year teaching, Marissa Glynias did very well. I was originally bummed that I couldn't take the class with Lalli but she was a much better fit for me anyway and she has fun injecting her love of world music into the course (something other sections don't get the fun of doing). If you have to have a 9:00am crawl class, this is a great choice. No matter what, you'll be semi-happy to wake up and it's a good ease into the start of your day."
