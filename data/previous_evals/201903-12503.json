    "Yes! Its an unorthodox class, but you will thoroughly enjoy it.",
    "N\/A",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, even though I would certainly recommend a lot of the reading material to another student. Professor Syrimis made me uncomfortable numerous times... a lot of his lessons and his ideas just seemed untrue and unprofessional."
