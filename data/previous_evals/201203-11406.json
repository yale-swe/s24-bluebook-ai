   "comments": [
    "This class provides a good survey of the literature and film made in the Post-Stalin era through the present day, covering both official and unofficial literature. Because this is a time period with many different movements and a lot of creativity, it is obviously impossible to cover everything in one semester. However, I think this course does a good job of providing an overview of this period. I would recommend this course to a student interested in studying the literature of this time period, because I think that there was a good mix of mainstream and more obscure works, some of which I and others had never had the chance to read or see.",
    "The course is a survey of Russian literature post 1945. There is a lot of focus on the earlier section of this time period, so very contemporary literature gets swallowed a bit by the end of the semester. I would recommend the course, and the syllabus contains a number of important texts and films.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student, particularly if one wants an overview of literature and cinema of the period.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student, with the caveat that they can easily read large amounts in Russian. Not a suitable course for MA students.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course to any student, even non-Slavic majors"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the course deepened my knowledge. It provided a good foundation in modern Russian texts, but I would have preferred more focus on literature and less on film.",
    "It most definitely proved helpful for my discipline\/profession as it deepened my knowledge of literature of the period as well as contemporary Russian film.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of the discipline, and I expect that it will very much influence my future research."
