   "comments": [
    "This course taught me a wide breadth of geologic knowledge, and a lot of what I learned is applicable to my daily life and interactions. I appreciated the professor's teaching style, and I certainly learned a lot of new and interesting things.",
    "I learned about various earth-related topics such as types of rocks, the ecosphere, climate change, mountain building, the earth interior, weather patterns, etc.",
    "This was a transformative course. Coming from a perspective in biology and urbanism, it 180-ed my understanding of energy flows over deep and recent geologic time, thoroughly enriching how I see the world we live in. This might sound fluffy or high-level, but it's not. I learned nuanced details exactly how a desert, storm system, or water systems work; I learned high-level concepts from how we understand climate fluctuations, to what fossil fuels are, to soil depletion and erosion . Maybe one of the biggest insights I got was how the earth has fluctuated between hothouse and ice-box levels in deep history, and how to really contextualize the changes going on right now. A few weeks after the final exam, I can still draw out and remember the details about this I remembered. The material was just that gripping!",
    "learned a lot about earth processes & how they relate to society, and how they worked in real life through our geological portfolio projects",
    "A survey of the forces the shape our planet and the implications they have for human life",
    "This is definitely an intro course. I dont know much about geology that I didnt learn from this course, but I felt like it covered a lot of bases very well.",
    "I gained a very broad and deep base of knowledge regarding the processes of the geosphere, as well as the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and the interactions between these systems. I learned about the approaches that geologists take to understanding earth's extensive geologic history, and how the earth's physical structure is intertwined with our economic and social systems. I also realized the urgency of anthropogenic climate change, viewed through the lens of geologic timescales. Through this course, I gained a great appreciation for geology, and more broadly, for the complex natural systems that the earth cycles through.",
    "This class really walked me through and helped me learn the basics of geology. I had no experience beforehand, and I feel like I have a much better understanding of general overarching geological processes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course covers a lot of information, which is a positive in some respects, but I also believe that I would have been able to internalize and understand more material had the scope been slightly narrower. The biggest way to improve the course would be to change the structure of the exams. As it is, the exams require a lot of rote memorization, not really of course material, but of the specific questions that may appear on the exam. Because the questions are given in advance, students are required to memorize the specific answer associated with each question in addition to the \"extra information\" that is not specifically asked for in the question but is needed for full credit. Because of the test structure, I believe that the majority of what I learned from studying was specific to the exam questions, and was not actually class material that could be applied to real-world scenarios. The exams were also graded extremely harshly, such that it was nearly impossible and in many ways a guessing game of what the specific grader would be looking for as they graded your exam. Overall, I believe that the exam format actually prevented critical thinking and deeper learning, and this course could be dramatically improved by a different exam format.",
    "The strength is the breadth but that is also a weakness because it makes the tests harder to study for. A weakness for this course is you won't really ever get full credit for short answers on the tests and it's hard to be able to learn everything to the fullest.",
    "The course was fantastic, and I couldn't have asked for more. I learned so much about more concepts that I could have imagined, but NOT in a jumbled way. Everything was assembled in an effective and creative way; the powerpoints were so helpful in summarizing key concepts, and the readings (textbook) were captivating. I actually loved the exam format. It really did take a second pass at *everything* to internalize and synthesize them. However, I wish we got the exam questions WAY earlier! Please! It was really hard to manage it sometimes, with all my other classes. Don't shy away from the course, and stay attentive in class. You'll get way more out of it than you'll expect. but also realize this is NOT a gut class, you simply won't succeed nor absorb this great material if you tune it out and plan to \"leave all the work until the end\". Also, I liked the hw assignments because they helped us understand a slice of what \"real geologists do\". It was so fun! I love the mars assignment, please bring it back! The portfolio was personally enriching too.",
    "lectures could perhaps require more class participation in some way",
    "Strengths: Overall topics covered Weaknesses: Tests felt like they requrired too much memorization to study for (I.e. not giving us the hidden questions), and the sheer breadth of material may have been too much. Problem sets could have been better connected to what would be tested",
    "Good week to week routine. I liked the homework sets. The two half-term exams were very hard, and it felt like some of the material was unfamiliar.",
    "Overall, this was a great course. The lectures were engaging, informative, and memorable. The assignments were relevant, straightforward, eye-opening, and informative. The geological portfolio compiled throughout the semester was a great way to tie in the course material to a place that we know and are familiar with -- and to view the location in new geological and historical perspectives. Through this course, I gained a great appreciation for geology, and more broadly, for the complex natural systems that the earth cycles through. One of the primary weaknesses of this course was the heavy load of assignments during finals season. The second-half term exam (essentially a final exam), combined with a final presentation and short paper seemed like a lot, especially for an intro-level geology class. Although each of these final assignments undoubtedly contributed to my knowledge of geology, I think that the same comprehensive summation of the course could be accomplished with a less strenuous workload. Also, there seemed to be a lack of a good feedback mechanism for me to know how I was handling the course material until I got my grade for the first exam. I wish that there were more methods for feedback when it comes to evaluating how students are understanding the course material, maybe through smaller quizzes or prep exams. Despite those minuscule things, I still thought the course was great.",
    "The lectures were excellent, 10\/10. I found them vey engaging and super interesting. I liked the final project an awful lot, and I thought it was one of the most impactful parts of the class. I thought that the style of the two midterms was not very conducive to my learning, as I basically had to memorize every little detail of each answer and what the question actually even wanted you to say. It was exhausting and time consuming to answer the questions, let alone memorizing them. It seemed impossible to do well on the midterm if you just studied and didn't memorize exactly what the questions required."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to put a lot of work into learning the material, but only if the exam format is changed. With the current exam format, I believe that the students ability to learn is limited, so I would encourage only G&G majors to take this course unless the exam format no longer involves specific questions with difficult to interpret answers and purely rote memorization.",
    "Yes, if you need a science credit and don't mind working a little work (studying for tests\/midterms and doing psets) for it. Keep in mind that you probably need to do more than what the study guide tells you to get at least 15\/20 for each midterm question. It's very hard to produce answers they see as deserving of full credit or near full credit because of the breadth of the topics.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite course this semester and I didn't expect it at all. I'm not originally from the department, but it was the class where I was most frequently introduced to questions that kept me up every night. I really loved it. Drop in during shopping period and see how you feel! Also David Evans is so fun, charismatic, and wonderful.",
    "Yes. Its a good intro course.",
    "Yes; I think everyone should take a course studying the natural processes of the earth. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is generally interested in learning about geology or more broadly the earth's natural systems. Although I wouldn't say this science class is a gut, the workload wasn't bad and was always interesting and engaging. This course is manageable. Also, Professor Evans is a great guy, and has super informative and entertaining lectures. If possible, take this class with the lab if you want a more hands-on approach to geology -- the extra work is worth it. I learned a ton in this class, and I feel like I know way more about earth's natural systems than I did at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Definitely, if anyone was even remotely interested, I would recommend it. I really enjoyed the class and found it super interesting."
