   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Before this course, I had not yet completed an academic book review at Yale. I found that this exercise was instrumental in allowing me to strengthen my ability to analyze the works of other scholars. The reading assigned in this class were thought provoking and intellectually stimulating and the weekly discussions and reflections successfully to deepen my understanding of the principles presented in the readings.",
    "The course helped me add a great deal of background and foundation to my knowledge of modern Japanese history and especially do so in a framework of legal and gender studies. I found that the course also helped me parse out arguments and historiography of scholars in the fieldand as a consequence, get better at parsing out arguments and historiography in general. I especially appreciated the wide geographical swath of readings that we were able to read, especially since we were able to take what we learned from Korea, for example, and ask questions about a certain topic in Taiwan. I am also happy to say that I felt I was able to become a better participant in discussions, not only through preparing my own discussion leader role, but by seeing others in action and listening to my classmates insightful responses. The framework of discussion as very open-ended was especially fruitful to creating a lively discussion.",
    "There were many different types of writing that we had to do such as weekly reading responses, a book review, and a final historiography\/synthesis paper. Each of these require different skills and techniques that I had to learn and develop. I also gained a lot of input and ideas about analyzing sources and what makes a good source from others. Sometimes there were readings incorporated for us to notice things wrong with the author's stance and writing that I have been exposed to in other classes. Also the content of the class was highly informative and made me understand come current debated surrounding Japanese imperialism such as comfort women.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze and critique both primary and secondary historical documents. I also learned how to properly research and write an historiographical essay.",
    "Tools to study and learn about Gender and Colonialism in the Japanese empire. Gained much knowledge of the history of the region in given timeframe.",
    "Exposure and engagement with a wide range of primary and secondary materials on a very fascinating and underrepresented aspect of studies about Japanese empire. The readings and discussions also were incredibly relevant in that the topics addressed continue to be matters of contemporary concern.",
    "From taking this course, I gained a deeper understanding of how Japan operated as an empire in its colonization of Korea and Taiwan in the years leading up to World War II. I also learned how this period of colonization affected women in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as well as led to institutional sociopolitical changes in the aforementioned countries. Additionally, I gained broader historical thinking skills, as well as learned how to write an academic review of a monograph and a historiographical paper.",
    "The many ways in which law and gender become entangled with imperialism. The history of modern Japan's relations with Asia. The nature of historiography, e.g. what makes a good argument or paper. There are SO many insights and 'aha' moments to be had in this course - I won't spoil them for you!",
    "We thoroughly discussed often-overlooked topics in speaking of the history of Imperial Japan, and had intellectually stimulating conversations about everything from fashion to eugenics. The readings provided an intriguing foundation for an understanding of the timeline for the Japanese empire and the territories that it interacted with. We explored the mimicry of the west that may have been relevant in Japan's imperial motivations, and had deep intellectual discussions on sensitive topics that ultimately enlightened me to many perspectives I would not have otherwise realized on this subject matter. Professor Hahm's classes started with a presentation on the history behind the topic each semester, and these presentations were concise and engaging, giving a fabulous basis for understanding of our discussion topics. Her expertise on the subject matter made it easy to communicate with her about any questions, and it was ultimately the best class I've ever taken.",
    "A very concrete knowledge on the Japan empire and its colonies, civil codes and domestic rules. I didnt know much about colonial history (especially Japanese colonial history) before taking this class, but can now examine themes in the period very confidently."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great readings, meaningful assignments, scintillating class discussions (which were often led by students, therefore forcing us to take responsibility for the readings and material) Weaknesses: during student led class discussions, there were some periods of awkward silences if no one knew how to respond to the question being asked by their peer. These pauses sometimes stilted the larger conversation and negatively impacted the flow of the class. Also, a couple students would consistently not participate in class discussions, so perhaps a larger emphasis should be placed on graded daily participation.",
    "I think the course's largest strength was its border crossing framework. While one might presume that the course would only deal with Japan, or even Japan's perspective towards empire, it incorporated many different perspectives, and especially perspectives of those colonized. I was also happy that we were often able to take a synthetic look at how the week's readings were related to the course's larger themes. For example, if we were talking about translation of various western concepts into Japanese, I think we were able to step back and ask how this relates to law and gender. By doing that, it helped uncover many previously unthought of connectionsit was like reading documents in a different lens. I think the course could have benefitted from a bit more lengthy background lecture at the beginning of each class. While we were able to easily have discussions, I think a 20-30 minute lecture on the historical circumstances that our readings covered would have helped broaden our understanding and allow us to make more connections than just those in the readings.",
    "The class was organized very well and all of the readings were relevant to the assigned topic for that week and also could be compared and contrasted to past weeks' readings. The discussion based structure allowed for me to hear how my peers analyzed readings and how sometimes their own experiences, backgrounds, and areas of study affected how they saw the readings which made me think a lot more about the topics and the many ways in which readings can be interpreted. Many times, my peers or the professor would point out things that I had completely glossed over. I think I would have appreciated a wider range in sources such as film, propaganda, etc. to better enhance student understanding and creating an image of what circumstances were like during Japan's imperial reign.",
    "Professor Hahm is an incredible professor who was always available to answer any question I had. I have no complaints.",
    "I thought it was a very engaging course with a challenging but not discouraging workload. It taught me a lot about writing and analyzing texts like a historian and gave me the tools to handle even more advanced classes in the future. I loved that we always had an extremely clear rubric for all our assignments and received timely feedback on work and drafts\/outlines to facilitate improved performance on assignments. I was also thankful for the level of engagement the professor had with us because Hahm would make sure that we all had a chance to talk but also made sure that we could learn more deeply about the subject through the powerful insights she gave us at the beginning and end of the class- the recipe for the perfect seminar.",
    "Strengths: A great selection of recent texts and introduction of a number of interesting issues that tend to get overlooked in history courses. Weaknesses: The readings were sometimes too long to fully process.",
    "This course had many strengths. First, the course had a carefully curated, meaningful selection of required readings. All of the assigned articles and books that we read for this course were not only relevant to the course themes, but also genuinely interesting and engaging. The fact that the works in themselves were educational yet fascinating made discussion of them during our class time all the more intellectually stimulating. Second, I liked that the course was designed to give substantial flexibility to students with regards to choosing essay topics. In both of the major writing assignments of this course (that being, a book review and a historiographical paper), students had the liberty to research and write on topics and works that genuinely fascinated them, and I thought this well facilitated students' learning.",
    "The course readings are genuinely fascinating and eye-opening. The weekly 300-500 word reflections encourage you to synthesize your learning - and also give you an excellent record of the insights that most gripped you in the course. Furthermore, Prof. Hahm often chooses readings that need to be challenged, which forces you to take a critical eye at all times. And Prof. Hahm is AMAZING: she is kind, helpful, understanding, and flexible, and she creates a welcoming learning environment in which everyone feels safe participating. I do wish she took a greater role in discussions (which are student-led), because everything she says adds so much to our understanding of the readings.",
    "The class was incredibly well-organized, with a well-defined structure and Professor Hahm's fabulous attention to detail. My favorite part of the course was when she put all of our project titles together on a sheet and categorized them as if we were all speaking at a conference. She did a great job of grouping our relevant interests together, and Q&A panels following each category's presenters made the presentations fun and engaging. In addition, the readings were spectacular and were something I actually looked forward to doing each week! I can't think of any weaknesses of this class - it was well-structured and very engaging all around.",
    "The grading rubrics are very clear, themes and readings are always interesting and everyone knows what they should be doing all the time. Its overall a very strong class and I dont see many weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "This course and Professor Hahm have been instrumental in developing my knowledge and understanding of not only law and gender during the Japanese colonialist period, but also the broader societal trends present in East Asia from the 1800s to the end of WWII. The small class size was fantastic, and the interdisciplinary mix of students made this class one of the most dynamic courses I have taken at Yale. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in either the law, gender studies, or East Asian studies. Personally, I found this course to be one of the most fulfilling that I have taken so far and any student would be remiss to not take this course if it is every offered again in the future. Professor Hahm is passionate about the subject and clearly wants every student to grow as a global citizen.",
    "I would recommend this course especially since it forced me to observe both historical circumstances and individual documents in new ways. I found it intellectually fruitful because, even as malleable students, we can find ourselves increasingly locked in a specific frame of mind. The course helped me apply a new lens to much of my work, which I think will be fruitful further in my academic career and life. I also think it was a helpful crash course in Imperial Japanese history that took a look at events and perspectives that a survey course would not typically look at. Even without a background in Japanese history, I think students would easily be able to participate.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Even if it isn't related to your field of study, this class is highly relevant to ongoing debates and secular phenomena in addition to the fact that this time period and history is very distinct and interesting to learn about. It is well structured and the scope of this class is very wide in its use of different topics and sources surrounding gender.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale, not just East Asian Studies majors. The class was engaging and enjoyable, and the skills in critical analysis and writing that I learned will be useful throughout my Yale career.",
    "Yes I would because Professor Hahm is the most brilliant and amazing instructor and I truly had the best time in her class. Hahm forms deep and meaningful relationships with her students and facilitates close community between peers. It was a joy to attend every week and I am honestly so sad that it's over.",
    "Yes, absolutely. You can easily get the \"standard\" political\/historical overviews of the Japanese empire in many other texts\/courses but the topics drawn out by the instructor and the texts for this course nuance these understandings in important and meaningful ways.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students, especially those who are interested in history relating to East Asia and\/or colonialism. The course was taught well and was well-structured with engaging readings and discussions--truly a gem.",
    "IF you are lucky enough to have this course offered while you are at Yale, TAKE IT! Among all the courses I have taken at Yale, this is possibly the most eye-opening. And take it for Prof. Hahm, who truly is incredible.",
    "If you have any interest at all in Japan, territories negatively affected by Japan's imperial actions, or even just the history of women's rights, you should definitely take this course! It has been my favorite course ever at this school and Professor Hahm does an incredible job of presenting the material in a digestible format that makes discussions interesting and engaging. I absolutely loved this class and wish that it wasn't over, and most of my classmates definitely agree! Professor Hahm did an amazing job in creating a fun course that was just so great to attend each and every week. I will miss her, my classmates and our discussions dearly, so please do not hesitate and take this class while you can!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Jooyeon is a wonderful instructor and Id recommend students to take other classes with her too."
