    "I really appreciated the opportunity to practice the research skills that I learned during my first year of the MPH program. It showed me what research looks like as a career, real-world practices, common issues, etc. I built a great relationship with my PI, who also introduced me to other researchers at Yale who I would have never met if I had just taken another class. I also got to build actual research experience for my resume, which was super influential when I was job searching for post-grad life.",
    "Working with the Cornell Scott Hill Health Center took longer than expected to get going on the project, but once the project was started it was a very exciting and interesting project- we were able to actively be engaged in the DM clinic and observe how the clinic runs each day. Moving forward, future projects with CSHHC may benefit from making sure that the necessary paperwork and forms are completed prior to starting the project.",

If you are looking for this type of project to apply your public health skills in the New Haven community, I would highly recommend this course and Cornell Scott as a community partner!",
