    "Would definitely recommend to people interested in politics, and side interest in technology. There is a big focus on statistical political science\/social science research, people with background in traditional campaign strategy literature, social science of the Internet, etc. will get the most out of it.",
    "This was a terrific course. I learned so much. Professor Hersh was excellent across the board. Energetic, engaged, and engaging. I recommend this course highly. Three interesting assignments. Great weekly readings.",
    "Info, Tech, and Political Power was a great course. The amount of reading fluctuates every week- although there are some dry readings (especially law reviews), most of the reading is accessible and interesting. The course provides a survey of all the many ways information and technology affect politics, focusing on a different area each week. Each week has a different feel: some focus on general information theory, others on actual politics, others on the study of politics. Make sure you'll be interested, and, if so, definitely consider the class!",
    "I would recommend it and thought it was a very good course. The three essay assignments and the presentation were very interesting. The course itself was not too demanding, but did vastly expand my understanding and awareness of a lot of very pressing current topics. I definitely enjoyed doing the work for this course and feel that the readings were worthwhile.",
    "The course was one of the best I've taken at Yale because of the teaching. I appreciated when the instructor explained the concepts by drawing on the chalkboard - that always cleared things up when there was confusion. One suggestion I would have is to stay more true to the title of the course (or change the title- it was a good course as is), as information was discussed readily but many aspects of technology beyond voting technology were missed. Of course, this is the professor's strength and was interesting and new to all of us, but with the title of the course comes an assumption that many more technologies will be discussed. The amount of reading was manageable and the short papers were interesting to write because of the level of open-endedness allowed. I would definitely keep to the short papers as opposed to the long seminar paper; people procrastinate on those and doing the shorter ones leads to probably more enjoyable reads for you as well as more educational experiences for us. Thank you for a nice semester.",
    "This is a fantastic course whether you are a political science major, a computer science major with a strong technological background, or anyone who is just interested in contemporary government. I can only see this course getting better and better each time it's taught, as more and more technological issues pop up in the political sphere and more and more questions arise in the field. Most discussion of any seminar I have ever taken, which made me genuinely excited to come to class each week (even though I had swore I would never take another class before 10:30). Wide variety of interesting topics. Professor Hersh helps make very technical concepts understandable even to those who don't necessarily have that sort of background. Workload is more than fair: three short, fun, unique papers and a presentation. Guest visit from former Senator Gordon Smith was awesome!",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student. The three five-page papers was a manageable workload especially for an underclassman interested in taking a seminar.",
    "Take it if you get in. This seminar was a lot more popular this year (probably because of the evaluations last year) and did not disappoint. This was the class I looked forward to most every week this semester. Overall, this is a survey course on political perspectives on technology and also how technology is used in politics. It's not quantitative. The material is so broad and relevant that you'll probably find something you're interested in even in the dryer readings. Workload was manageable (3 short papers. a presentation, and weekly blog posts). Even if you're not that interested in the material, consider taking it for the professor. You know how some assistant professors treat undergrad teaching as a necessary evil of the tenure track? Professor Hersh is not one of them. Easily among the best professors I've had at Yale. Cares about students, approachable, helpful with assignments, fair grader.",
    "A great class on an area of polisci that is becoming increasingly relevant. A lot of reading, but only three papers and a project. Professor Hersh leads really interesting discussions and is definitely willing to help you with your papers. Take it!",
    "This class strikes a really nice balance of providing a healthy challenge through the papers while not being overwhelmingly difficult. The material and subject areas are all really interesting and timely. We get to incorporate a lot of \"hot topic\" events that are currently in the news into the discussion. Professor Hersh is also a great prof to work with. I highly recommend this course to all political science majors and anyone with an interest in the intersection of technology, society, and government.",
    "Not a phenomenal class, but Hersh seems very committed to taking suggestions and improving it, so the next time he teaches it may be much better. There's a lot of reading that doesn't seem directly applicable to what we're discussing in class, and the syllabus is certainly a political science one. That is, you read stuff that political scientist academics write, and sometimes just pray that you can get through the nebulous terms and jargon. That said, Hersh is a dynamic seminar leader, and is obviously really enthusiastic about this material."
