   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about business related Chinese vocabulary, learned about reading more news style articles in Chinese, and also continued to develop speaking and presentation skills.",
    "The cultural background and language foundation necessary to work in China.",
    "This class was incredibly useful in honing writing, speaking and reading skills, as well as equipping us with the vocabulary needed to talk about challenging economic issues.",
    "Better speaking and writing capabilities in more professional terminology.",
    "This was a great way to refresh the Chinese I had already learn and build new Chinese vocabulary.",
    "I learned to write more Chinese characters and more grammatical structures that aid me to write more coherent and academic papers. My Chinese pronunciation also improved a lot over the course of the class. My professor helped me practice my pronunciation and she also helped me think through possible career plans for the future.",
    "My Chinese has definitely improved immensely because of this course. Learning how to use business terms not only in my writing but also in speaking was challenging yet incredibly rewarding at the same time. The course pushes the students to actively use the vocabulary learned in class instead of promoting rote memorization. The kind of information discussed in the coursework is also very relevant to today's world, especially with China's role in global economics and how businesses are able to succeed in international markets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that you learn a lot. Weaknesses, at least from the viewpoint of a non-native speaker, is that you will definitely be at a disadvantage as compared to many Chinese heritage speakers in the class.",
    "Strength: Very effective course. News focused, most relevant Chinese course I have ever taken and my ability to read the news has massively improved, as much as multiple years of course work before. Weakness: Very rigorous course with high work load. Only 1 credit, but hard to manage in a schedule, especially since it has a high pre-requisite requirement, it would be taken by upperclassmen with more intensive schedules.",
    "This class was very well-structured and had consistent assignments, which I found helpful in reinforcing what we had learnt.",
    "Teaching style is excellent, very engaging. 10\/10",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and really put a lot of effort into it - not only did I attend the classes, I got a tutor from the CLS, met once a week with the professor to discuss a Chinese documentary, and I met weekly with a Chinese language partner through the Tandem language cafe. I certainly learned a lot and improved my Chinese. However, I think there was one flaw with this course that should be corrected in the future: using the same metrics to evaluate heritage and non-heritage speakers. There was one other non-heritage speaker in the class, and he also had to take the class Credit\/D because the demands of the grading were simply too high. For us who started learning Chinese as freshmen in college, it seems a tad unfair that we would be held to the same standard to those who have grown up speaking Chinese and regularly speak Chinese with their parents and relatives. In the lower level Yale Chinese classes, heritage and non-heritage speakers are split up into different classes. It is only in the higher levels that they are mixed - but this does not necessarily mean that these students should be graded on the same criteria. It seems like a different framework of assessment needs to be considered in order for non-heritage speakers to not become discouraged.",
    "The students in this class are of varying levels and thus, some find the material too easy and others too hard. However, I feel that the professor makes an effort to customize the course for each student by assigned individual work. For example, when I said I wanted to improve my writing skills, we worked together to come up with an additional writing assignment for me.",
    "Strengths: The class involved a good amount of \"hands-on learning\" (i.e oral presentations, debates, writing essays) instead of merely teaching from a Powerpoint each class. The class is also very interactive and discussion-friendly where everyone in the class is encouraged and sometimes even asked to share their opinions on cases we care currently evaluating (this could be due to the professor's teaching style). Weaknesses: The workload was a little too heavy, where sometimes I believe there were assignments that I considered more to be \"busy work\"."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to students looking to continue past 155\/156 at a more rigorous level, where we still have a textbook and set vocabulary, etc.",
    "Yes would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has intentions of working, not just in, but anything related to China. The vocabulary in the course is tailored to be the most common phrases used in a professional setting that you would not learn in a more general language course. My ability to read the news massively improved and I was finding myself using new vocabulary from the course that I had just learned in job interviews conducted in Chinese during the semester.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to take your Chinese speaking\/writing\/reading skills to a more advanced level. It's also just really useful in giving you the technical vocabulary to talk about topics like trade and the global economy.",
    "Ms. Chen is an amazing teacher and the curriculum is very well balanced.",
    "This class is a great way to learn more about advanced vocabulary relating to businesses in economics, but also to learn about real events in China's current and past economic path. As long as you put the work in, there is a lot to be learned in this class. Professor Chen was extremely helpful to my learning and was very gracious in giving her time away to give me extra help. She is also just a very kind and nice person, who treats her students very graciously. You can tell how much work she puts into this class and into her students.",
    "Yes, it is a fun class and I learned many new things.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend this class to another student. You learn so much relevant information that also improves your language writing, reading, and speaking skills. I highly recommend this class to students who are looking to use Chinese beyond the conversational level. If you are looking to elevate your understanding of Chinese to another level, this is the class for you."
