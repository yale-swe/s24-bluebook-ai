    "This class, regardless of the topics, will be among your defining educational experiences at Yale. The study groups and the structure of the class meeting aren't replicated anywhere else in the undergraduate curriculum and, regardless of what you learn, will teach you a lot about how you learn. The class meetings are the fastest two hours I've ever spent in a classroom. You create a great rapport with the other students that comes out in the high level of discussion. You're never bored in class because you're always involved, and there is never a day when it feels as if class members are unprepared. Sure, it's a bit more work than some seminars, but don't get scared by that. It's not really any worse than any other one with 200 pages of reading and a 500-word response. And when the study group meetings are at Miya's or Cask, they're really not that much of a burden. JBS cares about you, and takes the whole class out at the end of the semester. You won't regret taking this class.",
    "Absolutely everyone should (try to) take this class, and plsc 260. These are simply the best-taught courses at Yale, and incredibly refreshingly vibrant seminar experience compared to the usual in poli sci and econ.The course goes through 12 topics of education policy in extreme detail, which this semester were voucher schools, charter schools, home schooling, 'no excuses' charter schools, teacher prep\/evaluation, ELL, special ed, technology, socioeconomic integration, and a couple others. The readings are large course packets that the professor carefully assembles to give you a full sense of the topic, and the classroom discussions are small-group exercises extremely well designed to get you to fully process the material.JBS is probably the best professor you'll have at Yale.As for 240 vs. 260 - they really make excellent complements to each other. Do both!",
    "Of course - if you can get in, you have to take it",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you can get in (which I'm assuming means you're very interested in the class) TAKE IT, no matter what class it conflicts with. JBS is the best and most dedicated professor I've had at Yale. Every week, you have about 200 pages to read and a reading response to write, which is a lot. However, you will learn more from this class, both personally and academically than you have from any other class at Yale. JBS does not conduct class himself, but breaks you up into small discussion groups to talk about a specific question or issue, and ultimately come up with a policy solution, etc. It simulates the policy making world in many ways. If that's something you're thinking about doing, TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "The readings brings you into contact with a lot of sad things that don't seem likely to change soon. Hopefully, some of the ideas formulated in class will someday have real world applications.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Take this class.",
    "Yes, take the course. But only do so if you truly care about the issues and aren't shy about formulating\/defending an opinion to a group of smart people.",
    "This course was the best course I've taken at Yale, hands down. Take it no matter what field you come from. It touches on everything that I have thought about here, and it is a course that really challenges the status quo and emphasizing really thinking about solving the problems of our age.",
    "Take this class. Always. Best educational experience at Yale.",
    "JBS IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT YALE. Just look at the reviews of all of his classes for the past few years. This class goes beyond just learning about public schools. If you want to see how seminars SHOULD be run, this is the class for you. The reading are very manageable, and the classroom discussions are all group activities, so it's a very low-stress environment. If you're interested in education, this class is absolutely essential for you to take. Even if you're not interested in education, this will still be one of your favorite classes.",
    "I'm not sure I can add more to what everyone's already said about this class - other than it's the only class I've ever done literally every single page of the reading for. JBS puts so much time and thought into this course, resulting in an incredibly fulfilling academic experience. I will warn that the class is a lot of group work, but because the in-class group discussions are well designed and the students in the class are generally very motivated and passionate, the focus on group activities only adds to the classroom experience in my opinion. I also thought the workload wasn't as bad as the class's reputation at all. If you can get into this class, take it! You won't regret it, and you'll learn a whole lot.",
    "I just wrote my evaluations for all my other courses this term, and JBS' class was the barometer against which all those classes were measured. I have rarely encountered such a dedicated and intellectually rigorous environment anywhere -- classroom or otherwise. Don't be afraid to apply year after year. And if you get in, take it. I left this course with a deeper understanding of the material, more friends, and more personal growth than with any other class at Yale. Go for it.",
    "This is an incredible course that I would absolutely recommend. A couple notes:1. This course is really difficult to get into. If you don't get in when you first apply, try again the next year. Good luck!2. It is a lot of work, but absolutely worth all of the work.3. Your experience will depend a lot on the composition of your study group. Some are awesome and some are less awesome.",
    "If you think anything about this course sounds interesting - just take it. If you are scared by a lot of work, don't be, you'll love doing every minute of it. You will not regret taking this course, you will regret delaying it or not taking it at all - I wish I'd taken both classes a year earlier."
