    "This course helped me understand ethical concerns behind research, gave me information for the reporting of sexual harassment, helped me think about what kind of mentor I would like to have, and taught me how to avoid plagiarism or data manipulation.",
    "I thought it was a good opportunity to think about a lot of the ethical questions that come up during research.",
    "It was an introduction to ethics in research, and we broadly covered a variety of topics, including animal research, human research, data manipulation, bias, and mentoring.",
    "About authorship, mentoring, ethics and a lot more",
    "I learned about important aspects of ethics in research.",
    "I learned valuable information on the more practical side of research; things like publishing, being aware of bias, etc."

    "strength: engaging speakers who encourage participation and discussion",
    "Prof. Bewersdorf did a good job trying to keep everyone engaged with the material. The sexual harassment portion of the course was much too short (was shortened to 20 minutes from a full class period), and even though she gave us a bunch of handouts, she didn't really clarify at all what to do in the case of sexual harassment. Also, I think this course could definitely use additional courses on racial bias and lgbtq discrimination. For the Science Diplomats (presenting in the sciences) lecture, I think it would have been helpful if we had been told to prepare something beforehand to present, because it wasn't very helpful to get feedback on something we hadn't really prepared for at all.",
    "Group discussion is great But I would expect more realistic examples to discuss",
    "I thought that some of the classes for the course were very well done, it felt like the instructor had prepared materials and had specific goals of what to discuss and teach during the class period. Other lectures felt very disorganized and unplanned, and therefore I didn't feel that I got much out of them. Additionally, the talk by the title IX coordinator from the medical school was awful, I know many people left class that day feeling offended or concerned by her attitude and comments.",
    "I was prepared to not like this course, but was pleased to find it relevant, informative, and enjoyable. It was great having different, engaging speakers every week, and discussing the aspects of being a scientist that are not often directly addressed (publishing, bias, etc). I think adding a section on soft skills where students can discuss things like respectful communication, being a professional working closely with others, etc would be beneficial. These things seem elementary but I have come across countless examples of clashing personalities making the lab an uncomfortable workplace."
