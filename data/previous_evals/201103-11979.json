   "comments": [
    "The class will probably be taught differently in future years because the professor is very responsive to students, but if I had to take what I'd done over once more, I wouldn't do it. The workload was horrible - I felt like I was trying to learn an impossible amount of information, and lectures often went over my head. However, the latter part of the course was fascinating, and I felt as though my world view changed because of this class.",
    "It is a lot of information, in a lot of different contexts. One must be prepared to memorize a lot of names, and must be able to synthesize vast amounts of information because the textbook is long and dense. However, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about MENA. It is a comprehensive history of that part of the world, and Professor Wyrtzen really strives to make the history relevant.",
    "I would not recommend the class to another student. If you are ok with a lot of work in the form of quizzes, short papers, etc, then take the class. There is no doubt that I learned a great deal from this class, however, I am not sure that the amount of time and work that I put into the class is proportional to the amount of knowledge I got out of it.",
    "Depends on what you're looking for. This should not be listed under the sociology department, and is more of a fast-paced historical overview of what has been happening in the Islamic world, what empires rose and fell, what various forms the religion took in different parts of the world, etc. It was interesting in its own right, and I probably should have looked at the syllabus more closely, but I expected a bit more focus on Islam and family, Islam and cultural creation \u0096 more than just Islam and politics.Prof. Wyrtzen is a GREAT guy, my TA Gulay was awesome (she made section worth it), but read the syllabus before taking it.",
    "I didn't like this class much. This course covers a lot of history, from Muhammad to present day (Arab Spring, etc). The course was largely about Islam, but grew to be more of a Middle East studies class. Interesting stuff but the professor expects you to know A LOT. There are 4 quizzes, a midterm, 4 short response papers (2 pages each) and a take home final exam (research\/term paper). The quizzes were brutal, the first 3 of which tested us on (on average) 75 terms. The fourth quiz, on the other hand, only tested you on 12 terms. That was strange. Speaks to the organization of the course material and history distribution (spending too much time on the most recent 60 years of the Islamic world and much less time on the 1450 years before that).The professor was also terrible at staying on topic or actually explaining anything (because he's so passionate and excited about the work). You had to rely on the texts and the internet to learn. He threw around a lot of theory and then gave really, really specific examples. There didn't seem to be a middle ground for Wyrtzen.I don't really recommend this course. It's too much work for so little reward. I learned a lot, but not in the best style.",
    "If you want to gain a cursory knowledge of Islam around the world from its beginning in the 7th C until today, and would not mind not being able to go into depth in into any particular topic or region, then this class is not bad. The amount of material that professor Wyrtzen covers in one semester is absolutely ridiculous, and makes it very difficult to really internalize everything you are learning. Furthermore, lectures are definitely not the best. However, I am leaving the class with a huge amount of broad, general knowledge of Islamic history and the role of Islam in the present day, which has been very helpful in understanding current events in the islamic world. So if you want to have a basic knowledge of everything Islam I would recommend to course, but do not expect engrossing lecture.",
    "If you want a lightning course on Islam take it. Beware of the quizes though, they're bloody annoying to study for. LOTS of information retention. If you're good at that and good at skeleton essays, you'll get a good grade.",
    "I feel like Sociology isn't the right department heading for this course. It was much more of a history course (IDs, TONS of history covered very quickly). Second half much better than the first, although the first contained a lot of worthwhile information about Islam that is necessary to know for the second. Readings are long, more interesting towards the end. Lapidus (the textbook) is way too dry. I got through this course on good memorization skills and friends who know a lot about Islam. I did maybe two readings the whole semester but still managed to get As on all four of my short reading responses.",
    "I took this class because I wanted a better idea of social dynamics and politics in the Middle East and North Africa. I definitely did learn a lot. My issue with the fact that the class was so comprehensive is that it was difficult to truly learn the material at more than a surface level.We also had the privilege of speaking with Mona Eltahawy, a prominent Egyptian journalist, who we would later learn was featured in the Time issue of \"Person of the Year\" due to her experience in Egypt as a protestor.Take this class if you're looking for an overview. In terms of work load, there are 4 quizzes which are a bit tough to prepare for, given the unfamiliarity with the subject (lots of Arabic terms) and the amount of material that's covered (the first part of the class is based heavily on history--and its a lot of history, from Muhammad to the present). The midterm was fair and we were told exactly what would be on it. I enjoyed writing the final paper, and what I learned throughout the course of writing the paper will probably be what I take away from the course.",
    "This class is an excellent way to get a foundational understanding of the way Islam has been expressed in various societies around the world. Although a little broad in scope, it is a good way to start off studying the Middle Eastern region in general. A good course if you are interested in the the socio-political and cultural implications of Islam rather than the theology.",
    "Take this class. It is well-taught, interesting, and really helps the student understand the Islamic world as it is today. The reading material is always interesting and Wyrtzen is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "A good course about the general history of Islamic Empires. The second half is very good for learning the context of current events.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in Islamic history as it related to contemporary issues. I was very happy with the content I learned and the professor. A key to making this course great, however, is to be in a section with a TA who knows their stuff about Islamic societies.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. Although the material was interesting and Professor Wyrtzen is a nice guy, the lectures themselves are not organized effectively. The lectures provide only cursory outlines of the information you are expected to know, rendering them pretty much useless. Countless times the professor would skip over an important slide or theme, saying, \"Oh, you can read about it in Lapidus.\" Although I did all of the readings, I felt that I had to go back teach myself the information before each quiz or exam because it simply was not taught during the lectures. Most of the terms we needed to know were either barely, or not at all discussed in class. This was pretty frustrating, considering that I took pretty thorough notes. And, although the textbook itself is useful as a resource, it's not necessarily the most memorable or interesting read, which made teaching myself the material even more annoying.",
    "This course covers a lot of information about the origins of Islamic societies, and does not cover a lot of information about modern Islamic societies. If you are looking for a class that focuses on early Islamic history then this is a good class to take, but if you want to focus on the modern societies then other classes might be better for that.",
    "this class is a perfect introduction to the Muslim world, the readings are a little intense but it definitely gives a better understanding of major political issues elated to the middle east today by putting them in a larger historical context",
    "I would summarize SOCY 135 as a really demanding and rigorous course, and would not recommend it unless you know you're set on majoring in this field.",
    "A good broad-based introductory course to the history of Islamic peoples up to the present age. Be prepared to piece the big-picture narrative for yourself because there is a lot of detail the course tries to cover. Also, there are constant quizzes and reading responses to turn in regularly."
