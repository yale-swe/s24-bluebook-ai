    "I have mixed feelings about this class. You read some great books -- Tarzan, The Lost World, Heart of Darkness, The Lost Steps, to name a few. Plus, you watch Indiana Jones! The seminar was unconventional since Professor Gonzalez didn't cap it, so there were about 30 students. Professor Gonzalez is charismatic, hilarious, and brilliant in his own way, but he was often looking for a \"right answer,\" which can be frustrating in a literature seminar (the answers weren't always that compelling, or they were so obscure you would never guess them). He's also full of himself, and very stringent about minutiae in papers (i.e., spacing, page numbers). It was counterintuitive to spend two weeks on shorter books, but only two classes on really dense ones like Tristes Tropiques (though I would have preferred that one to have been taken off the syllabus entirely). Sometimes I don't feel like we penetrated into the very heart of the books. Overall, it's not that much work, considering there are two 5-7 page papers and a take-home final. I took it CR\/D, which I guess was a good choice, but I still read all the books but one (since they were great books for the most part, and since he does cold-call).",
    "Great introduction to quest narratives in the jungle. Frames the books within the industrial revolution and the world wars. I would recommend it a hundred percent, don't leave Yale without taking a seminar with Roberto Gonzalez-Echevarria.",
    "It's a fun class and the books are fun. Some were a bit boring, but the class discussions made up for it. Although, reading a novel a week can be harsh sometimes, so be ready for that.",
    "Good class, although you'll have no idea how it's being graded (two papers, a take-home final, and class participation are the components of your grade, but I don't know how each is weighted). The books range from good to bizarre, but the class is pretty enjoyable if you like G-E and his teaching style. Be prepared for lots of tangential stories and eyebrow wiggles.",
    "I thought I would love this class, but I ended up hating almost all of the books. Prof. Gonzalez refused to acknowledge the overt racism implicit in all these Jungle Books, and made fun of students for pointing out instances of homophobia and racism in the texts. It was more of a lecture than a seminar, partially because most of us didn't read any of the books (you're never really tested on them), and partially because that's the way Prof. Gonzalez preferred to run the class. On the bright side this is one of the easiest classes in the world (2 papers and a take home final, and the professor is a REALLY easy grader), and if you happen to share Prof. Gonzalez's hyperconservative stance on literature then you might really love it.",
    "This is a great course. The prof. is interesting, entertaining, and his lectures are thought-provoking. The only thing I'd say is that if you're looking for a class where you can participate in discussions easily, this is perhaps not your best bet. That said, that may have been due to the size of the class, which may be changed in following years.",
    "YESSSSSS TAKE IT. OMG AN AMAZING COURSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The professor is legitimately awesome--like he's this kind old man with a wonderful heart and always has a story to tell. Class is never boring. The one criticism I would say is that, if you're looking for a small personal (senior) seminar, this probably won't be it. He doesn't believe in capping class size, so there were like upwards of 30 people in the \"seminar.\" I really didn't mind, but I heard some people commenting on how they wished the class was smaller. He grades REALLY fairly (read: really easily), and is just a really lovable guy. The books we read are really interesting, and I bet you haven't heard of most of them before. we also watch some awesome movies--indiana jones, the lost world--and with like, one book to read a week (sometimes less), there's absolutely nothing to complain about. if you're a lit major, this seminar is golden for your requirement--if you're just looking for a fun writing requirement, this is always perfect :)",
    "Jungle Books is a great class. The novels are all great and enjoyable to read (perhaps with the exception of Green Mansions and\/or Tristes Tropiques), and Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria is fantastic. He has personally interacted with several of the authors that we read, so we were often regaled with funny anecdotes that you won't find elsewhere. Despite his lit critic career, Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria is a very generous grader on the papers, and is receptive to different ideas in class. He is also committed to getting to know everyone in the class (he declined to have a TA and read all 30 papers himself every time), and although he can be a little arrogant and old-fashioned in his views at times, he is really a brilliant man and you WILL learn a great deal from him.",
    "This class is an overview of a genre of literature that has to do with journeys into the jungle and their consequences. Each novel in the syllabus presents a different interpretation of the genre, and it's interesting to see how earlier novels have influenced later ones. The class has a lot of reading, but if you stay on top of it and bring a few interesting points or questions to class you'll do well.",
    "Yes, by all means, take it.",
    "An okay course. Professor Gonzalez is a famous literary critic, but not the most amazing professor (although he tells amusing stories). The class was too large to really be a seminar (he doesn't like to cap courses, which is generous but unfortunate for those who really want to be a seminar) and he didn't stimulate enough discussion for people to really be involved. The days I felt best about the course were when there was a rousing discussion, but these were few and far between. On the other hand, the books were good and there was less pressure to do all the reading on time since the class was so big. But I still think it could have been much, much better. It's too bad, because the syllabus and the professor had a lot of potential.",
    "Great class. You would never imagine what the jungle books are all about and the lessons you can take from them. Sometimes the readings are a bit dense so try to pace yourself.Definitely take this class if you are looking to break away from the monotony of your major or just want to have a good time. The class will teach you a thing or two about ancient cultures and will make you notice things in daily life that we all usually take for granted.",
    "Take it! The professor is EXCELLENT--so lively, passionate about literature, and full of interesting anecdotes. You will never be bored in this class. Sometimes the pace is a bit fast (this is coming from a non lit major--I guess a book a week is pretty standard after all), but for the most part the books are fascinating. You get to learn a lot of background about the authors and you get a good sense of the times in which the book was written, as well as a bit of geography and world history thrown in there. Above all, Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria is so much fun! If you like really animated professors who love what they teach, you'll like this class."
