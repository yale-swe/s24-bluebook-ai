    "Lectures were good. Sections were pretty useless.",
    "Abby is a great professor and this was a great overview to Microecon. The material is very well broken down. Contrary to opinion, the format of the slides are simple and easy to understand. The lack of formatting is a benefit to the slide rather than a detraction. In order to improve, I wish that the homeworks were counted for the Another great thing she did was the fun videos and games that helped to illustrate the points. grade. This should substitute the quizzes. There are people who take the time to the homework every week and this is a better way to keep up with material rather than a short pop quiz. Also, there are some in depth math calculations. It would help if Abby took the time to break them down better in class rather than just kind of glazing over how to do them via PPT slides. Lastly, I did not like the format of the last class. It was a very complicated and dense article that could be interpreted in different ways. The students were confused and the students presenting confused the students even more. Would have benefited from Abby teaching the lesson. The self teaching could be reserved for another easier lesson .",
    "Very challenging course. Difficult test, there should be more opportunity to get points other than on exams, this really focuses on one learning style. Overall excellent teaching and TAs. I like having the class once per week.",
    "There were several times when the professor had to correct mistakes in the practice problems. It would be great if the materials were checked before distribution.",
    "Material is poorly applied to health care in the format it is taught in. I understand why it's a requirement, but we need a professor who better understands how to apply the material to things that matter and make sense to health care professionals. Get rid of nonsensical and demoralizing pop quizzes at the start of classes that cause people to completely shut down for the rest of the lecture and not listen to a word the professor is saying! Instead, have us submit practice problems that require considerable exploration of the material that we submit and can have constructive feedback on. This is what other professors at YSPH do and it works very well. It's not an \"easy\" path that all of us \"slacking cheaters\" are going to exploit - it's a productive one that is effective!",
    "Strength: The teacher has an amazing presentation style. She's articulate and can engage the class well. Weakness: Her words do not always match her actions. Her exams cover topics that sometimes are only briefly mentioned. She's also a little paranoid that her students are constantly cheating, which we are not.",
    "Strengths - lectures were easy to understand, interactive, and stimulated a desire to take further Econ classes",
    "The course was taught well with great examples to making the learning of economics as easy as possible. The biggest weakness is that the final is such a large portion of the course grade. This time of the year is the most stressful and to place such a heavy weight on the grade didn't seem fair. Also, I was told this economics class would have a health focus and it did not seem like a health economics class until the last few lectures. We used a few health examples but really I don't see myself using a majority of the material.",
    "This was a great course! The teacher really tried to apply the concepts to real work situations in the healthcare field and I appreciated that. The assignments were a great way to make sure I understood the material along the way. Overall challenging but great class!",
    "I thought this was an excellent course that truly enriched my knowledge and understanding of economic theory. It had been several years since I had any encounter with formal economics education, which initially created some stress that I would be entirely lost throughout the semester. However, I felt that the pace was good and content information was presented in an understandable manner. Granted I may not have wholly understood topics like welfare economics, externalities, deadweight losses, etc when presented in class, all of the material was afforded to me in lecture slides, practice problems, and office hours. I found the TA sections to be very beneficial, and I appreciated how the course materials flowed together; in fact, as I studied for the final, I noticed how pre-midterm material consistently foreshadowed materially covered post-midterm. I felt that I was actually using my brain in this course, analytically deconstructing problems and determining their solutions, rather than simply memorizing formulas and definitions. I never thought I would appreciate economics in the way I have throughout this course. Well played.",
    "This is an extremely difficult course (especially for someone with an extremely limited economics background). However, it is critical for a student in the Health Care Management or Policy departments. Especially with the instructor's methods, lectures, and practice problems, it allows students to tease-out and understand some of the key aspects to the healthcare system and have a working knowledge of both consumer- and firm-decision making processes.",
    "the homework is very useful for the capture of knowledge.",
    "Course was awesome and challenging and I learned a ton, but kind of annoying at times. I literally haven't seen a pop quiz since 1998. I don't understand why you can't just tell us there is a quiz. We don't all have time to dedicate to the course EVERY week and if you had a paper or project in another class which happened to fall on the quiz day you were screwed. Do away with those they are just dumb. Consistent quizing, however, is not dumb and i like the idea. Just tell me about them so that I don't walk in and then become infuriated because I feel like a child that has to be given a pop quiz.",
    "I liked the class and the instructor. I felt I know way more about econ than I knew before. I would have liked if it met more than one time a week or if the problem sets were graded. Having the final be worth so much does not leave much of a buffer.",
    "Good organization of the class. I wish the class actually had 2 lectures a week since it's a lot of material to learn and it would help solidify the concepts. The professor did a good job of encouraging students to work outside of class in order to compensate for how the class was structured.",
    "The course was very well-thought out. The assignments allowed us to practice the concepts and kept us engaged in the course. I enjoyed Dr. Friedman's creativity on them. Lectures were top-notch. The tests were very difficult and could have been shorter. I never finished on time. I think more time could have been spent applying what we were learning in class to real life problems.",
    "The more extra sessions offered outside of class to review material, the better. I also think people should have been encouraged to go to Professor Friedman's office hours, as those were very helpful.",
    "Strengths: Though this class may have been one of the most difficult courses I have taken, I felt that I came out of the class having learned a lot. The slides for this class were very well organized and thorough, and Professor Friedman was very engaging. This was a new course and some issues at the start of the course were fixed promptly. Weaknesses\/Suggestions for Improvement: 1. The beginning of this class was very challenging between not being allowed to use calculators for quizzes, separate section and lecture problems, and not having the slides posted prior to class, resulting in the need to transfer notes. However, as noted these issues were taken care of within the first weeks, which was appreciated. 2. I think it is important to realize that not all students are coming into the class with the same background. Much of this course was mathematically driven. In section, calculus was often referenced, though many of us (mostly health policy) had never taken a calculus course. 3. To that end, because we do not all have the same math background, it is important that students have a resource that they can pull this information from. While the textbook was good for conceptual purposes, it did not go into the math that we needed to know. If the course if going to be taught from a very quantitative perspective, then the book should also focus on this. 4. Pop quizzes were a challenging component of this course. Much was said in this class about how problem sets did not accurately test people's knowledge, because they could work together, while formal assessments, such as exams and quizzes, would allow the true distribution in the class to be seen. However, I do not see why this would necessitate the use of pop quizzes. If quiz dates were announced, we still would be tested on our own individual merit. 5. I am also personally in favor of having section be mandatory and for problem sets to count towards the overall score. The syllabus basically said the problem sets were necessary for success, but those of us who consistently did them were not rewarded for our extra effort. I think the credit for this could easily be taken from the final exam - I do not think there was a reason that exam should have been worth 50% of our grade. 6. Scaling for this class was another major issue. The grade of honors was given to very few people, and with so many people taking the class who had already taken economics courses before, it made it nearly impossible for someone who did not have that background to achieve an Honors grade, even if far more effort was put in by these people. Additionally, with the High Pass range being so broad, it was a little disheartening for those who while close to an Honors fell just short, knowing that we could have scored over 20 points lower and received the same grade. 7. Clickers would be exceptionally beneficial for this class to gauge understanding. A lot of the time a vast majority of the class was lost, yet those that understood tended to be more vocal, making it seem like the class had a better understanding than we did. 8. I wish the relevance to health policy was more clear throughout the semester. I understand that we need to know the basics to build up to an understanding that would be applicable to health policy, but it was hard to connect to the material when we were answering questions about the coffee market. 9. I also feel like we should have been given more time on the exams. Some people simply work faster than others, or as stated before have taken economics before, so simply scaling our grades does not put everyone on a level playing field. I know I personally would have done much better on both exams if I had an additional 30 minutes to work.",
    "Not very useful in health care setting. It was basically a microeconomics course with very little to do with HC.",
    "Strengths: Great coverage of material. Loved the sequence of the course and its relevancy to current healthcare trends and problems.",
    "This class is pretty essential to understanding how a lot of policy works, so as a required class it makes sense. However, I think it can be better from structuring it a little differently. If there was a model similarly set up to Epi in the fall (2 lectures, taught slower, and more focuses tests) it would be easier to master the material. Talking to Dr. Niccolai might be a good idea. The class moved very quickly, and while some excelled, many of us had a hard time keeping up. The pop quizzes were not helpful at all, and felt more like a baby sitting or 'gotcha' technique than anything. They did not reflect what we had learned at all. If Abby wants to quiz us, fine, but just let us know so we can better prepare. Also, section should be required, because that is where a lot of the learning really happened. Also, the whole hesitancy about using calculators was strange. Losing points for mental math is unproductive and makes people stress more than they need when they are really trying to understand a very new and complicated concept.",
    "Strengths: great overview of microeconomics (at least I felt that way), related concepts to health care towards the end of the course, clear\/crisp lectures, pop quizzes (kept students like myself incentivized to do the \"optional\" problem sets) Weaknesses: question wording was very confusing to me in many instances (on pop quizzes, exams, and problem sets), very fast-paced lectures (especially since I do not have any economics background, I felt this way; though I understand there is a lot of material to cover - maybe in the future the class\/lecture hours should be increased)",
    "Really clear lectures, engaging activities. Tests are way too long. Not an accurate way to assess capabilities if you're not given an adequate amount of time to think.",
    "Strength: good overview of micro economics that are relevant to health policy.",
    "The course is a great way to dive into microeconomics, learn the language, and start applying it to health policy. The course had strong material, a great textbook, a good layout, and understandable process. The exams were dense, but Professor Friedman fixed that with a curve. I think this course could be served best by including a final paper, requiring students to tackle a problem they are interested in by applying the economic principles from class. Pair this with a shorter, smaller final and I think we'll have a better assessment of student performance, that I think will align more with the goals of the class. Overall a great course.",
    "-less time on activities, although they are helpful, they shouldn't take up as much time as they do -TA's weren't very confident-- this translated into some insecurity on our part as students -material is challenging, definitely keep the scale on assessments",
    "good overall",
    "I was expecting a more advanced level of microeconomics, however the Mankiw textbook is an introductory textbook and usually used for Econ 101 in undergraduate - so the content could be \"beefed up\" more. The topic does not become relevant to \"health care professionals\" until the last several lectures when we started discussing insurance\/physician\/patients. Granted, that if the MPH students have never taken an economics course this is the class to take - but I wish the content would be more relevant.",
    "A poorly organized course. Frustrating to have micro-econ second semester. Difficult to learn material in slide presentation format. Interactive class exercises were not helpful.",
    "Excellent! I have always looked forward to acquiring skills micro-economic theory and so I looked forward to Professor Abby's class. In terms of strengths, the class delivered on its promise. The learning was available and the skills were there for the student who went the extra mile to pick. The use of TA sections really helped and it is certainly a key strength of the class. Although the \"pop quizzes\" were a pain but they proved better than weekly problem sets and helped me learn the subject better than I would have without \"pop quizzes.\" I am glad she had those pop quizzes. Areas of improvement: Professor should consider to solve more questions in class rather than leaving questions to the TA sections. I mean, Professor Abby \"getting her hands dirty\" in the traditional chalk and whiteboard manner. :) She's an excellent professor and I enjoyed being in her class; however, I believe I would prefer that she rolls up the slide board and solves more problems in class.",
    "Decent. strengths: practice problems are helpful for prepping for exam quiz - i appreciate i get a gauge on how i'm doing throughout the semester, rather than waiting till the midterm or final arrow article! - would have preferred more thorough of a discussion\/teaching on this than one group presentation class weakness: a comment more on the department's curriculum requirements: between Prof. Cooper's US Health Econ and Prof. Friedman's Microecon for health prof., you get decent amount of coverage on US health econ. If you've already taken microecon and will be taking the US health econ course, I don't think it should be necessary to take another micron econ class specific to health pof. I thought it would be useful to, but realized that pretty much everything was review. Prof. Friedman offers students who've taken microecon in undergrad to show her a syllabus, but I hadn't taken microecon since high school. It would be helpful if there was a test out option as well.",
    "Course moved too quickly. Perhaps too much weight was given to final exam. Pop quizzes did not reflect exam in terms of difficulty, especially considering that quizzes were meant to be an appropriate indicator of mastery of material. Multiple opportunities for extra credit were very helpful. Good that lowest quiz grade was dropped and that class participation was factor in course grade. Sections were helpful.",
    "I thought that the course was taught at an appropriate level, that the testing was an accurate reflection fo the course material, and that the concepts were well-explained. I would have liked a bit more of a healthcare focus. This course had the feel of an ordinary microeconomics class, but rather than calculating the supply of hot dogs, we were calculating the supply of vaccines. Overall, not much of true healthcare angle."

    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Professor Friedman talks way too fast.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0I have never written a poor evaluation on an instructor before, but there is a first for everything.. I do not doubt that she is doing excellent research and is very competent in her area of expertise, but that doesn't guarantee a good or even decent ability to teach. She is ruthless and comes across as power hungry. She has a terrible \"gotcha\" mentality and treats students like we're in high school or undergrad and need to make microecon our own profession to pass the class... She fails to understand that we are able to comprehend the hundreds of dollars PER CLASS we spend to be present and prioritize the education enough to pay for it and be engaged with our professors who don't speak down to us and treat us like lazy children. Her pop quizzes and practice problems are all over the place with examples that don't make any intuitive sense... From houses in circles and people paying tax in the form of their time to minimize a well going dry... Because they are just getting one pale of water anyways... Pop quizzes include things that even when I knew the answer to, I knew not many of my peers watched until the last 30 seconds of a Beautiful Mind to get the irrelevant answer to a quiz question. And even if you read the microecon chapters as assigned, if you didn't become an expert in the topic and pick up on the tiniest of concepts before you came to class, forget about getting points on the quizzes because it's the nuance questions she asks - not the important foundation questions! By the end of the course, I and many of my peers essentially gave up on trying to keep a reasonable pace with the terrible teaching style of this professor. Additionally, when we were allowed to provide feedback earlier in the year on how the class was going - she came back to us and summarized the themes she heard in our comments, but then proceeded to justify her teaching style and instead point a finger at us and tell us that WE needed to change what we were doing and the time and effort we were committing to this course...",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Strength: The teacher has an amazing presentation style. She's articulate and can engage the class well. Weakness: Her words do not always match her actions. Her exams cover topics that sometimes are only briefly mentioned. She's also a little paranoid that her students are constantly cheating, which we are not.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Strengths - Responsive to students' feedback, engaging lecturer, liked how she gave clear answers and how she responded to students' questions",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0I really enjoyed her presentation and speaking style. She spoke with confidence and really tried to make a difficult topic understandable to the majority of the class. She started the course with breaks to get an understanding of how much the class understood the material but stopped after a while. I think getting back to this would help although it would certainly slow down the pace of the lecture and even course.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She was great! You could tell she really planned the lectures and practiced how she wanted to present the material. Sometimes it was difficult to follow a concept if she used a lot of jargon, but that may just be because econ has a lot of complex jargon you have to learn.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0I really enjoyed the instructor. She presented material in a very methodical way that seemed to promote the most efficient learning experience. At times I felt lost in lecture, but she was very approachable and I always felt comfortable asking her to re-explain a concept. She was also very receptive to our critiques of the class; it's her first semester teaching this course and she seemed to take our advice into strong consideration for next year. The way she assessed our knowledge of the material through pop quizzes, practice problems, and exams was very fair. I did not feel that her expectations of us were beyond our capabilities, and she pushed us to critically think about the material.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abbie is a fantastic professor and truly one of the best that I have experienced at YSPH. As a whole, I feel that she is able to breakaway from the traditional \"death by PowerPoint\" that YSPH professors seem to be accustomed to and it is greatly appreciated. Her added commentary, illustrations, excellent speaking, and understanding of the content make it an enjoyable two-hour lecture. To potentially improve, I think it has been a fairly broadly-acknowledged thought that the exams could be better created for the constraints of time that students are faced-with. Still, Abbie has been fair with curving exams to account for this (or did on the midterm, at least) and this may be less of a problem. Additionally (this may not be reflective of the instructor), but the course could be improved if the TFs were better extensions of the professor. This may include the professor \"training-up\" TFs more comprehensively or ensuring their understanding of the material. While both Mike and Becky were extremely generous with their time and obviously far-more knowledgable about the topics than myself, by the end of the semester I elected that not going to TF sessions was more valuable to me than going. This was based on a number of frustrating sessions (culminating in the final exam review) when I felt FAR more confused by concepts and topics after attending the TF office hours than simply reviewing slides and attending lecture. This manifested itself in several ways including TFs doing the practice problems incorrectly, giving inconsistent answers, and general lack of clear explanations for common problems. If it may be possible to even find Economics PhD candidates, that may be an amazing way to complement the otherwise great course.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Prof Friedman is one of the foremost experts regarding HC econ and policy. You are lucky to learn from her. She is really great at taking complex economics and dumbing it down so that \"sciency\" people can understand what is going on.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0very good.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is BRILLIANT. I learned so much from her, and she clearly spent a significant amount of time preparing lecture materials and thinking through the best and most fun way to present comments - a rarity at Yale! Abby is so smart that it is, however, difficult for her to find the best middle ground for individuals new to econ. I often found it would be been beneficial to get more econ theroy heavy to understand things. So many examples were used in class, it may have been better to go through a few slowly, rather than SO many so fast - her brain moves really fast and explanations are also a bit fast. While it is evident Abby is genuinely interested in teaching and imparting wisdom, it is also evident that she really thinks we all want to cheat. Being so aggressive with timing of exams, administering pop quizes (those are super unnecessary - just tell us there is going to be a quiz and when so we study), makes us feel like children and patronized rather than like adults that are willingly going into debt for our education. I know cheating has been an issue, but it will always be - as free riding wouldn't be a economic theory if it wasn't. We just want to be treated as adults. I really enjoyed Abby and she instilled in me an excitement for econ and policy analysis. Thanks for a great semester!",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She is a great instructor and clearly knows the material well. Very responsive to emails.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Strengths: great organization and presentation of the material. The pop quizzes were a good way to test the comprehension of the material learned Weaknesses: Some concepts were taught very quickly, but that is more due to the short amount of time allocated for lectures.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Great professor. She explains concepts accurately. She cares about making a dynamic class.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Dr. Friedman did an incredible job this semester. Her lectures were engaging and thorough. She clearly spend an enormous amount of time on her powerpoints, which I really appreciate. She has a clear mastery of the material- one that I will never achieve. She is tough, but spent time thinking about how to be fair to each individual in class. I really hope she is the teacher for next year- she deserves to be recognized for her efforts in this class.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Professor Friedman is a very engaging lecturer and is clearly very knowledgeable about economics. I understand that this is the first time she has taught the course, and I believe with a few changes, this could be a great course. I appreciated all of the chocolate over the semester!",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She tried to make the course interactive, which I appreciated. But her practice problems and tests were difficult in regards to what we learned in class. Also, as this is an introductory course and there were no prereqs needed for this course, I thought that she didn't give us enough time on the midterm and final to complete our exam. I think she needed to understand that most of us were not econ majors and having an exam be that lengthy and no time to complete them was frustrating--even the TAs could not finish in time when they took the test and found the exam to be difficult.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Strengths: Amazing professor. Used many different teaching styles to convey the material. Made the course very engaging. Only wish is that she taught more classes.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0For a first time teaching a course, I think Abby did alright. She is obviously very talented in the field and has a remarkable mastery of economics. I think there was a lot learned from this class that can be addressed and changed in the future. The activities in class were a good way to break things up and try to illustrate a more practical use of the concepts. Some were better than others of course, but this can be further refined as well. I would definitely encourage her to slow down and not assume we all are understanding things as they are presented. Even after reading the material a lot of concepts are confusing. One other thing to keep in mind is the general tone some things are conveyed in. We are all new to the material but we also aren't children. Just a little less of a 'talking down' feeling would be appreciated.",

    "it's a very interesting, relevant, well taught course. the midterm exam was fair. I enjoyed the calculations, unlike many of my classmates, but it is a calculation heavy class. The activities etc in class were fun and a good way to break up the monotony. Appreciated the 5 minute breaks at the halfway mark.",
    "Professor is great. Great introduction to Microecon.",
    "Difficult course, with a great deal expected of you, but very rewarding.",
    "Great for providing a basic understanding of microecon.",
    "I understand why it's required - but if this professor is teaching it next year and with the format and mentality she came in with, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE IF YOU CAN.",
    "It's an ok class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for a fellow student who is interested in learning more about econ, especially within the context of healthcare. Both the course material and the lecturer were fabulous.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. It was definitely difficult and time consuming but worth it.",
    "This is a crash course in microeconomics, and it is not to be taken lightly. The professor is very knowledgeable on the subject and presents material in a methodical manner. While she affords you the necessary tools to understand beginner and intermediate level economic concepts, she does not hold your hand and walk you through the material. It is up to you, in your own time outside of the classroom, to sit with the material and synthesize information if you do not initially understand it. The professor and TAs are great resources if you need further explanation on concepts, so you should utilize those services as needed. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding market behavior and consumer choice.",
    "This is an excellent course and gives a great overview to some of the fundamental issues with the healthcare system. The course does require quite a bit of outside class work, but is still highly-recommended. Abbie Friedman makes it a worthwhile and enjoyable class, and you will be sure to leave feeling like you learned something.",
    "recommend this course to students who want to acquire the basic knowledge about the microeconomics",
    "YES",
    "Good intro class to ECON, I would recommend the class with Prof. Friedman she seems to care about her students",
    "good.",
    "Great course as an introductory economy course",
    "Excellent course on economics. Dr. Friedman is tough but fair. It is a difficult course and certainly challenging, but it is interesting nonetheless. I want to take more economics classes due to this class. HIghly recommended.",
    "This is a required course for policy and management and I would recommend it to those that have an interest in economics or are mathematically inclined.",
    "It's required for HPM and its a useful class in regards to understanding some concepts, but don't think you'll come out of it understanding microeconomics.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "Overall, the class was pretty good. A lot of the info eventually gets well understood but it is a lot of work and a new language to learn (much like epi). As painful as it can be, it is useful and we're better for taking it. A good TA is vital to really understanding the material.",
    "Must take for anyone in the HPM\/HCM courses. Helpful to have econ background but not necessary.",
    "Yes. Will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who do not have econ background. However, for students with a bit of econ background (i.e., took intro microecon or more in undergrad), this course is might be a bit too redundant. I would suggest those students take econ courses at the Economics Department outside of the School of Public Health.",
    "Good overall",
    "If you know some economics already - consider waiving this course.",
    "An important course but not taught well right now. Hopefully future semesters will be more cohesive and administrative errors will be addressed.",
    "I would recommend this course. Micro-economics is a useful toolbox to have, going forward. No one should leave school without it.",
    "recommend to those who haven't taken microeconomics.",
    "Required for health policy and management students. More health applications could have been in course. Unless student has an interest in learning about microeconomic principles in general, I would not recommend this course.",
    "I waived out of this course - I'm not sure why I have to complete a course evaluation"
