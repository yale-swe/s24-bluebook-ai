   "comments": [
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in the field of public health. I enjoyed doing the readings and then having discussions about them in class with Professor Bradley. It made a lot of sense to do a great deal of groupwork in this class since teams were the main topic we discussed, and I enjoyed the groupwork a lot. Though the second paper was the most challenging group assignment I have ever done, it was also the most rewarding and I think my best product of a group assignment. The papers were interesting, but I thought very challenging and sometimes wished I had more direction.",
    "This class was amazing! I learned so much. The readings were really interesting and lectures were incredibly engaging. One recommendation I would make would be for the groups to have a one-on-one meeting with Erika or Betsy.",
    "MY FAVORITE CLASS OF THE SEMESTER. I GAINED A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL SKILLS THAT I HAVE ALREADY STARTED INCORPORATING INTO MY DAILY LIFE.",
    "I thought it was great. I think the final project should be a presentation. This would draw on more skills and strengths of the groups. For those who are not the best writers they were at a huge disadvantage. Public speaking is key to leadership role and management.",
    "Excellent course. Readings were very thought provoking and discussions made me eager to come to class every week.",
    "Such an important but overlooked topic. Love the group experience and interactiveness of lecture and section. I recommend including more group experiences though, perhaps small challenges\/puzzles to solve during each lecture with different groups. I also suggest eliminating the final paper-- the group experience was much more climatic and this paper seems a little out of left field, definitely lacking momentum and motivation.",
    "Really very helpful. The name may seem vague but this is the single most useful class I have taken over my Fall. The concepts learned can be used for a lot of different settings.It can be improved may be by adding some cases to solve and making better use of the time allotted to the discussion sections.",
    "This was an interesting experience, because it was the first semester this course was offered. As such, it was a little rough around the edges: there is room for improvement regarding the format of class assignments (which we have processed as a class at great length). The reading list was also dynamic, in that what we actually were asked to read for class differed from the syllabus about half the time. I can appreciate that real-time adjustments were being made to refine the topics covered; however stability was sacrificed a bit. For example, I would want to start the week's reading a week ahead of time, but found that half of the things I read were then jettisioned by the instructor at the last minute. I responded by starting the reading only a few days before class each week; however this made it more difficult to balance the coursework from my other classes because of the short lead time.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. The course concepts are applicable to any facet of personal or professional life, public health or not. I feel I now have an arsenal of strategies to use in group situations and leadership contexts. Best class I've taken at YSPH.",
    "strengths are Professor Bradley, how involved she tries to get students (even in Winslow), and how she makes concepts practical.weaknesses are just the size of the class, and final paper did not feel like a good culmination of class.",
    "This course was quite good. The readings were usually excellent and I learned a lot of relevant information for future group work.",
    "Great course. A must course at YSPH",
    "Great course.",
    "Biggest strength- INSTRUCTOR!!!! And syllabus, classroom discussions, team dynamics exercises, required readings...everything.",
    "This course was a good course. It opened my eyes to the whole study of leadership. Dr. Bradley is a knowledgeable, energetic, and dedicated teacher. She chose some interesting readings. She attempted to teach us in an \"experiential\" way about areas of leadership, with varying degrees of success, though she deserves credit for trying. The one downside of the course is that we had very little reading on certain subjects and talked about them only superficially in class, but we were expected to understand and apply them.",
    "Feedback has been given to the instructor and TA already.",
    "Strengths: Real world application of conceptsWeaknesses: The lack of a case book or public health related case studies",
    "Great in-class discussions that elicit unique responses from students who are often encouraged to draw on personal experience. The group essay was quite difficult, and perhaps that process can be improved",
    "Excellent course that addresses specific aspects of leadership as it applies to public health and more generally as well. Significant emphasis on project teams was very helpful. Viewing attributes of successful leadership was critical, particularly as it related to complex challenges. Very practical basis for interaction in future endeavors.",
    "Strengths:- excellent, intentional, engaging instruction- breadth of leadership theories explored- lots of readings\/ examples of leadership in public health-related scenarios- lots of variation in schools of thought explored in leadership readings -- business, health, program evaluation, philosophy, etc.Weaknesses:- lack of casing (e.g., HBR case studies and problem analysis, troubleshooting-oriented instruction prior to the \"answer\"\/ course of action revealed)- assignments were all papers -- would have been very cool to have a practitioner present a dilemma (that they grappled with and determined a course of action for) to the class, class splits into groups (same groups or new groups) to work on a solution and slide deck describing solution, have each group present to class and practitioner and receive grade based on content, leadership landscape analysis, presentation skills, creativity, etc., and once all groups present, practitioner presents what their team's decision-making process and leadership landscape was and what course of action was. Then subsequent class\/ last class debrief would allow forclass discussion.",
    "Great readings, nice discussions in class, good job by prof.The fist paper was a little confusing. I wish the prof had taken more time in class to give examples of what we could have talked about and run us through writing it (like she did for the final paper). I spent a lot of time just figuring out what I was supposed to do for that paper; for example, didn't realize I could have used a personal example at the beginning.",
    "This course is fantastic and should be a required course for management AND policy students. The topics covered and lessons learned are applicable to so many situations."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy is great! I like how she reviews at the beginning of each class. I think she had her favorites in class, but that's ok.

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Dr. Bradley is a top notch instructor. She is obviously technically and academically astute and even more so, she gives every comment her focused attention and really makes people feel heard despite what they say! This is truly a gift."

    "This course covers main leadership concepts both in theory and practice. You learn the concepts through interesting readings, which are discussed and analyzed in the lecture. You do a great deal of individual reflection as well as group work in this course. There is also a discussion section that is used to flesh out concepts of interest and make them more meaningful for life after Yale. I would definitely recommend this course, but caution anyone taking it that it is certainly challenging!",

    "Highly highly recommend it!",
    "Yes, great course, lots to learn and utilize in daily life scenarios.",
    "This should be required of every student in the HCM and Policy tracks, and should be taken by anyone in any school who thinks they may ever have to interact with other humans as part of a group, and especially by those who hope to one day fulfill a leadership role within an organization, or in general in life. (Excuse the rambling...in summary- yes. Recommended to everyone.)",
