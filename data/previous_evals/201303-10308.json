    "If you do not try and take this class, then you are a fool. Great professor and very informative.",
    "Great seminar. The workload is extremely manageable- all you have to focus on is one individual presentation, one group presentation, and a final paper. I wrote my senior essay in this seminar, and Professor Krasno was very supportive by responding to email quickly and providing helpful suggestions and advice.",
    "This course teaches you an incredible amount about the United Nations and current issues relating to international security. It was a pleasure to go to class each week. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Good class. Learn a lot about the UN. Not too much work.",
    "I highly recommend taking prof. Krasno's class! Prof. Krasno is extremely knowledgeable in her field and has had plenty of experience with the UN. She is also a really sweet person! It was truly a pleasure to go to class every Wednesday.",
    "A lecture class billed as a seminar. Interesting material, but not engagingly presented. Do not recommend."
