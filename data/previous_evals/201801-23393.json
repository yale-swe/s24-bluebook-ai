   "comments": [
    "I developed a better understanding of the role of perspective in addressing environmental problems and how to utilize a framework to develop consensus around solutions to those problems.",
    "A lot --too broad to define. But if I have to sum in one sentence, it would be a careful insight about professional standpoint and how we relate to the world",
    "We learned about the problems that natural resource professionals get exposed to throughout their career. We learned a set of tools and skills that will help us to work through problems that we face in our careers.",
    "reflection, respect, deeper thought",
    "Great class.",
    "Policy process, introspection and explicit thinking, frameworks for analysis.",
    "I learned that people seek values through institutions using resources. The course discussed professionals\/standpoint, education\/experience, and society\/context. This class really made me understand how I think about myself, others, the environment, and society.",
    "Never before have I been able to bring my personal struggles (truly icebergs) into a class and take them on as the content and focus of integrated, dynamic discussion. On occasion, I have talked to professors and T.A.s after hours about aspects of my personal life, but always treating these personal issues as distractions and conflicts that get in the way of my pursuit of intellectuality and academic inquiry. In this class, I do not have to mask or ignore or negate the complexities of my selfmy many selvesand how I relate to others and find meaning in a consciously existential existence, I get to (to continue with the metaphor) break the whole iceberg into piece on the classroom table and have 20 other eyes help me see how they fit into each other and part of the integrated whole. What a wonderful opportunity it has been to be able to finally have the chance at thisbecause what is going to matter so much more than what I have learned about environmental history, communications, and policy, etc. is who I see myself as and how I orient towards the world to have real interactions with real people to derive REAL meaning and fulfillment.",
    "Awareness of constitutive problems facing society regarding natural resources and other issues, and reflective practices to identify values present in decisionmaking structures",
    "I learned a totally different way of approaching what I had historically perceived as purely scientific issues.",
    "Further insight on my own standpoint and how it relates to my role as a professional. A deep questioning of the idea of sense of place and its importance to success in conservation in the future. Better question-asking skills, both on the field trip and in class. The ability to parse out what's important in a conversation or interview and what isn't, given my values and the values of the other person.",
    "Another wonderful class spent thinking through human existentialism as relates to conservation. It was especially helpful to have a course focused on self, experience, society, and professionalism because it offered tremendous clarity before leaving FES."

   "comments": [
    "Challenged my expectations at times, but exceeded them in the end.",
    "Exceeding expectations! A well and comprehensive course unlike any others --it touches personal life as well!",
    "Reasonably well",
    "It did not really align with my expectations but for the better.",
    "Thought the class would cover different material, but I did enjoy the course.",
    "Way beyond expectations. Very powerful academic class in my life.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights aligned very well with my expectations.",
    "I think it is safe to say that my expectations for this class were spot on, although maybe I was a bit clued in already after joining Susan in Yellowstone and Global Change. Granted, too, my expectations were not very specific, mostly because I really did not know what (as in content) we were going to talk about in this class, but I surely foreshadowed the howby providing a 2-3 hour block each week for nonjudgmental, thoughtful, and even emotional discussion to deepen our understanding of the world and our place in it. Our discussions evolved through the semester from being satisfyingly unconventionalbut still in close relationship to conservation and our professional relationship to itto surprisingly, but very comfortably, personaltaking on the diverse challenges each of us were experiencing in relation to integrity, sense of place, identity, and other topics derived from our childhood, academic, professional and romantic lives.",
    "Not what I expected; thought it would be much more conservation-specific, but was pleasantly surprised to find it broadly applicable",
    "It both met and exceeded my expectations.",
    "It was about what I was expecting. I was hoping for something a bit more tangible, a bit more applicable by the end, but overall it was about what I expected.",
    "They exceeded my expectations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The only suggestion I have is to utilize the Policy Process as a foundational reading for the first class--portions were assigned thru the semester, but doing this reading first would put all students on the same page. With the concept of the Policy Process firmly engrained, students could then experiment with the other literature of the class.",
    "Strength of the course is the discussion and engagement. Susan and Gao made a terrific job by creating an environment where everyone's opinion is valued. However, the class was rather disorganized. I think it would have been better if they stayed on the planned course",
    "Strengths: Clark and Yufang are absolutely amazing people. All students should work to expose themselves to these instructors while at FES. Weaknesses: Clark's teaching style often lacks structure and clear guidance, which can make it difficult for some students to follow her trajectory. Personally, I enjoy this structure and think it lends itself well to the free-form goals of Professor Clark's curriculum.",
    "More structure.",
    "Class should be required to go to Yellowstone over spring break. Would help cement lessons of class in further. Was my favorite class I've take at Yale",
    "The discussions in class were authentic, engaging, and informative. Susan knows how to create a classroom atmosphere that is conducive to talking about sensitive topics. One weakness of the course is that it is so student-led that I wish I had heard more from Susan!",
    "Not much individual feedback; would be nice to know how we were progressing with reflections",
    "I think it could use a bit more structure. There were times when I would do a ton of readings that didn't get discussed or explained.",
    "It's a very philosophical course and very discussion based, which allows people to learn cooperatively, which is great. But it needs more structure. It seemed like many of the lectures that weren't guest lecturers were improvised at times, and the semester wrapped up without the opportunity to apply what we were thinking through in a real or pseudo-real professional environment. Still, lots of other classes have that as a semester wrap-up, so it's not as though every class needs it.",
    "Strengths: - Exceptionally thoughtful content - Great guest speakers Weaknesses: - Some assumed understanding of the Policy Process framework"

    "I would advise a student that the course is just as much about your internal process as the external.",

    "Be patient, ask lots of questions, don't be afraid to speak up with a question or just a random thought.",
    "This not a conventional FES course. This course will help you understand your existence and how your values and experience motivate your work."
