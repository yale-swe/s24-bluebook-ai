   "comments": [
    "Bad intro to quantum mechanics, lectures were essentially the book, minus any effort to explain the conceptual aspect, making going to class feel pointless.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. If Prof. Skiba is teaching it, then you should DEFINITELY take it (although the other profs are probably great too). Really interesting material, standard work-load for upper-level science classes. Sets you up well for an exploration of applications of QM in the following semester.",
    "a good intro to quantum taught by a good teacher using a good book. very hard, although not as hard as classical mechanics. interesting class.",
    "Take it. This is definitely one of the best classes in the major. The concepts are hard, but the course goes at a very reasonable pace. Skiba was an awesome professor- very clear, and insisted that everyone got all their questions out before he moved onto the next topic. Not a ton of work- compared to Doug Stone's 410, the problems sets were painless (exception: gaussian wave packet).",
    "Physics 440 was a great course. We didn't cover much material (far far far far far less than 410 with Doug Stone), but that allowed us to go over the material in great depth and really made sure we understood it. Quantum Mechanics is not really a subject you can rush though. The problem sets were fairly easy and straightforward, and the tests were difficult but fair. From what I know about the other QM teachers, Skiba is the best, so you should probably try to take it with him. If you're a physics major you'll obviously have to take this, but even a non-physics major could probably jump into the class and do well without much trouble.",
    "A good intro to quantum mechanics. Skiba is a great professor. The homework is calculation intensive and boring but pretty straightforward. Fairly challenging, but easier than 410.",
    "Pretty enjoyable. Physics 440 by Skiba goes at a much slower pace than Physics 410, giving you a lot more time to understand the concepts and appreciate the subject. The problems sets are also much easier and sometimes even interesting. Skiba also is a good lecturer and can answer most questions well.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if Professor Skiba is teaching. He is a good teacher and a friendly person, and he is flexible about deadlines and such.To understand the lectures, it is best to read the relevant sections of the textbook ahead of time, as Skiba's lectures can be a bit physically disorganized (on the blackboard), and the material is difficult.Ask questions. Skiba encourages this. He likes to stare at the class silently for a while if people stop asking questions.",
    "Quantum mechanics is fascinating. It would be better if it was taught differently. It isn't taught poorly. It just seems that we learn mathematics in the course and almost no physics. While Skiba is a very nice and humble professor, he doesn't teaches the course almost purely mathematically and gives mathematical answers for questions dealing with intuition. Then again, there may be no intuition in quantum mechanics. Take the course though it's definitely worth it.",
    "Physics 440 is a very mathematically and thorough introduction to quantum mechanics. It was completely worth taking if you are interested in math, physics, or some other science (seeing as having a good understanding of quantum mechanics is crucial for whatever you do in science). However, this course was reasonably challenging, and a fair amount of work, yet if you are willing to spend the time to immerse yourself in the material is is very worth the effort. Also be sure to take the class with Skiba, he is fantastic!",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially if it is taught by Professor Skiba. The course provides a solid background in Quantum Mechanics, and is a pleasure to attend. I would not recommend this course to students who only want a conceptual understanding of Quantum Mechanics, though.",
    "If you're in the major, even if you're not intensive physics, take it. I'm not intensive, and I'm really glad I did it. You cover the material to an enjoyable depth, and although it's pretty hard and a lot of work, it's a great class. Professor Skiba is the man. If you're not in the major, it might be rough competing with lots of physics majors, but it's really interesting, and Skiba really engages his class.",
    "YES! So I needed another science credit to graduate and I decided to take Physics 440 as a second semester senior. My choice was probably pretty stupid, but I really loved this class. It's very very math intensive but it's pretty rewarding and Skiba is absolutely wonderful. Highly highly recommended.",
    "Physics 440 is an excellent introduction to Quantum Mechanics. The problem sets are manageable and rewarding, and the material is fascinating. Professor Skiba is an excellent professor, and he makes the material fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend Physics 440, though most people thinking about it already know they will take it.",
    "there are a few classes that every student at yale should be required to take: basic drawing, engl 120, and quantum mechanics. How can one ever hope to be a good human being without having taken quantum mechanics? My point precisely.This course was incredibly good. Prof. Skiba was a fantastic professor -- perhaps the best physics professor I've had. I really hope he teaches again. He was really brilliant. Half of the reason I loved this course so much was because it was taught by Prof. Skiba, and as such, I feel it only appropriate to copy-paste my teacher-evaluation in here:--Pardon my French, but Prof. Skiba is the shit. He is the most awesome physics (and perhaps otherwise, too) professor I've had.He is incredibly lucid. Very good with chalk. Slides across the floor in his dress shoes (perhaps he's really hovering over the flow. I know!! he's superhuman). And fantastic at teaching quantum mechanics.Fantastic because- he's very approachable- he's really good at explaining things, even when confronted with them for the first time- makes one feel at ease- and overall, really knows his material.I am really going to miss having him as a teacher. I hope he teaches more quantum in the future; he really knows how to do it justice.--The textbook is griffiths, which is very readable.I do wish there had been more of a focus on physical interpretation; and sitting for 10 minutes and thinking after every problem about what the problem meant, but I guess it's hard to require that in a physics course. And particularly so in quantum mechanics, where building quantum intuition comes very slowly.",
    "Nothing much to say here. If you're taking it, its probably because you have to take it."
