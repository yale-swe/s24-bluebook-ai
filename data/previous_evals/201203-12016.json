    "Great course don't hesitate to take it!",
    "If you feel good about speaking and you want to improve your portuguese, definitely.",
    "best language at yale? yep.",
    "Yes, obviously if you want to learn portuguese take the course.",
    "It's a Marta class. She's lovely, the classes are boring, you learn bits and pieces of the language.",
    "Portuguese L3 is a great class! Marta is the best and cares about her students and also really values their opinion when it comes to improving the course and tailoring it to the students' needs. We read literature and poems, sang songs, watched news clips, some great movies, and did final presentations that were fun and interesting. The tests are fair and there is not too much homework - take this class!",
    "I believe Marta was really open to all our suggestions and really helped improve the class based on our input. It was a good class, although most of it was reviewing what was already seen in L2. Definitely take it as a stepping stone onto later portuguese classes that start dealing with portuguese literature.",
    "I would recommend Portuguese 130 to anyone who already feels that they have a firm grasp on grammar. That was my only qualm. I love the class otherwise though!!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning the language.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Marta does a good job of making sure you speak and write better by the end of the semester. Take this course."
