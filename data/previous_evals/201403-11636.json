   "comments": [
    "Chima is GREAT but I literally learned nothing from this course; it's not thematized -- lectures seem random and it's very unclear what the take-away messages should be. It's simply not rigorous enough and the fundamentals of health policy are not taught to us, at all.",
    "Strengths: Information presented makes sense as it is presented in chronological order Weakness: Too much information is covered in lecture.",
    "strengths: instructor's knowledge and enthusiasm weaknesses: overcrowding (not enough seats) --> diminished ability to and quality of lectures and interaction. should have split discussion sections in half, move to a second room, and have TA lead by themselves (why were there 2 anyways???)",
    "This course is fantastic. It is a large lecture that does not feel as such; I felt engaged by the professor each lecture, and felt like I was learning a lot. The course did a good job of imposing a structure and arch to material that easily could have appeared disjointed and unrelated. The course cuts through a lot of extraneous information to provide students with a very clear picture of the US Health System.",
    "Great course. Fun lectures. Gave good range of topics. Only weakness was the discussion sections, as I thought we should just have more lecture. Maybe this is because I just really enjoyed the lectures.",
    "Great professor who is really knowledgable and excited about the course. Sections were new to this course, may need to re-assess this and have a better structure. Lectures were engaging and understandable.",
    "This course is severely biased. The teacher could have provided opinions from the other side.",
    "I liked the lectures and found them to be useful. I did not feel like I gained anything from attending discussion sections. My main critique of this course is the instructor's refusal to move the final exam. It is too late in the semester, so flying home for the holidays is more expensive. Also, I had to stay in town an extra week only for this exam because all of my other courses finished earlier. Some other YSPH courses offered two final exam times, so this could have been an option. Another option could have been a take-home final or a final paper. I feel that it was inconsiderate of the instructor not to consider these options since so many students expressed their frustration with the final exam time.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to health policy and systems. The course has a HUGE amount of knowledge which can seem overwhelming at times, but Professor Ndumele does an excellent job of explaining the important parts.",
    "The overall concepts in the course are important, and Chima keeps you entertained while teaching it! I found the class to be very engaging. He also lets you out 45 mins every class, so you can't really complain about that either! There are a lot of slides to go through each class (50+) and you have to do it in like 1 hour. Sometimes feels overwhelming when you are trying to take notes and keep up. The weekly readings\/reflections aren't too bad and the midterm was a take-home midterm.",
    "It is a great introduction into the US Health system and Politics. I hardly can come up with any weaknesses.",
    "We didn't talk NEARLY enough about health care reform and what is happening today. The course was too historically focused, and catered to a denominator that was too low. I didn't get much out of the course.",
    "I came in with a pretty strong health policy background, and was expecting to be familiar with most of the material in this class - which I was, but I still felt like I managed to learn a lot along the way. I really enjoyed the material. Still, I would say that this class was definitely FAR better towards the beginning of the semester then towards the end - towards the end, the grading became randomly harsh, and Chima's lectures veered towards his personal opinion rather than current debates. I thought section was managed pretty well - and I loved the reflections! - but was disappointed that we did not discuss the assigned readings in section. (So, towards the end of the semester, I stopped doing them.)",
    "I really liked this course. Initially this course was really hard for me because I recently graduated from undergrad in a science field and did not know much about health policy, insurance, etc. at all. Once time passed I was able to participate more in the discussions.",
    "This class was extremely interesting and I definitely learned a lot! Having the class-wide discussion seems like a good idea, but I feel like a majority of the class did not understand what was going on.",
    "Well organized lectures, but my favorite parts were the section. The sections allowed us to more critically assess the material from the lectures and really discuss some complex topics.",
    "lectures were always interesting and sparked good discussion.",
    "Maybe have more basic theories? Seems like everything in this course is about specific examples",
    "It was a very enjoyable class",
    "Good.",
    "Great overview of health policy in the US. Professor Ndumele asks thought-provoking questions to help us think about health issues from different perspectives.",
    "I liked the way this course was set up in a discussion format - however, sometimes it was difficult to really grasp the main key points (until the final lecture).",
    "Really great, thorough intro to policy. I feel like I learned a lot for one semester and that I have a good foundation for more coursework in policy. I liked the international elements Chima includes, too.",
    "Important course to take! See my response to the following question regarding how the course may be improved.",
    "Dr. Ndumele is an excellent lecturer--he can deliver the content in an enjoyable manner, which is rare. I appreciated that this semester. I wish there were more lecturers like him.",
    "Health policy is rough because I feel like it's all a big circle of problems with no real answer or solution.. but I do feel now that I could articulate those problems in a more concrete way than I ever could before. I always knew our health system had issues, but now I really know what they are.",
    "It is an introductory class, and as such, can seem very broad at first. However, the intricacies of the issue at hand is discussed in depth so that the overall point of the class is delivered at the end of the course.",
    "Strengths: very broad overview of health systems; good comparison of international health systems and U.S. health system, touched on major points of U.S. health system, good history of how the U.S. system became so fragmented Weaknesses: hard to conceptualize some vague explanations of phenomena",
    "strength: discussion group is very effective to motivate students gain more understanding of the underline health system. weakness: the lecture slides are a little bit lack of connected. Sometimes even hard to fully followed.",
    "Interesting introductory course. Presentation was very interesting and engaging. I would have liked to see more specific examples of international health systems.",
    "The course was good at covering a vast array of topics related to health policy, and providing us with a basic understanding of the US Healthcare system. It also helped us to develop our own opinions regarding issues concerning the health system, and to consider ways in which we might improve upon inefficiencies in health care.",
    "This course covered the very broad topic of healthcare systems, and it was laid out in a coherent, efficient manner. I knew little about the U.S. healthcare system coming into this class and thought I would be lost during each lecture. Yet I found myself so engaged during all classes and I probably learned the most from this course. I really appreciated the application of course material to real-world issues. Our reflection papers encouraged me to critically think about a topic, eg physician reimbursement methods, and develop my own take on the matter. Some complained that topics were too broad, there was little understanding of what was expected of us to know, but I felt it was the opposite. While topics covered a lot of material per lecture, we had all the tools we needed to deduce almost anything on a deeper level. And course objectives were clear and detailed. Very happy I took this course and looking forward to the future policy courses at Yale.",
    "Ehh- would have loved to learn more about the ACA and implications.",
    "The strengths of this course are Professor Ndumele's spirit and expertise, and the way that each day was split between lecture and section. A weakness was the structure in which course material was presented.",
    "strength: lectures, case studies, reflections; weakness: in the recap, i think it'd be helpful to see a timeline of how the US health system has evolved (including the model of care, historical events surrounding it, and responses from various stakeholders). the lectures are organized categorically, which I prefered, but it can also be confusing when trying to synthesize the lectures and create a storyline, as i realized by the end of the course while studying for finals.",
    "From the course description I was expecting an international oriented course, which it was not. But overall I learnt a lot about health care systems in the end even though I struggled during the semester to figure out how every lecture was related.",
    "Maybe I misunderstand the point of reflections, but I think they are a formative learning experience, rather than a review of learning achieved, in which case they are probably over-weighted in the final grade. The feedback did not improve the transparency of the grade.",
    "Strengths: Very good comprehensive introduction. Taught in very clear manner. Weakness: Perhaps a little to introductory. Could have been a little more challenging.",
    "Great course. Professor is engaging and makes lecture interesting. The material covered can sometimes feel like we are barely touching the surface.",
    "This course was an effective introduction to the development of and challenges facing today's health system in the United States. The case study approach was a great way to evaluate other systems, outline parallels, and delineate differences. It seemed a little disjointed and rushed at times. The in-class discussion was helpful and engaging.",
    "The course covered a broad range of health policy topics, however there was not enough time in lecture to cover all the material in the detail that Chima had prepared. The discussion groups were good, but essentially unnecessary.",
    "Great course with great content",
    "Above average. Every class is like in a rush. Professor wants to divide every course into two parts: 1 lecture and a section. But I think the section is not necessary. Too many people in a room and not everybody could have chance to discuss. For a entry level of Health Policy, it is much better to provide us enough background information like the history of health care system & important individuals who make contribution or hamper to the health care system.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! I thought the lectures were great and built on each other in an understandable way. I enjoyed the use of clickers for the class, as it was interesting to see where classmates stood on certain issues and helped facilitate discussion. I also enjoyed section, as we were able to break out into small groups, which made for interesting small group discussions and allowed people, such as myself, to feel more comfortable participating. My one note would be that I think this class lends itself better to take home essay exams, which is what we had for the midterm. I felt that I learned a lot more and really came to understand the concepts better while writing the midterm, as opposed to the final where I simply felt like I was memorizing information. I would say that if an in class exam is needed, it would be better if this was the midterm, as having an essay final exam will allow students to go in depth and really understand the course concepts from the entire semester. I also think the essay question on the in class exam should be on something that was covered in more depth during class (not something that was covered for 3 slides out of 500+).",
    "Strengths - great lecture slides (and the use of current data helps reinforce the lecture materials); great lectures; seminar style lectures. Weaknesses - discussion sections (too many students in one room, instructors were not helpful, discussions themselves were not helpful); weekly reflections (these reflections were too short to say anything insightful and most of the time I didn't feel like I was learning anything. I would suggest either having two midterms to explore all of the issues covered in reflections, or having a longer written assignments for students to explore these concepts.)",
    "I enjoyed the \"the price is right\" game at the end of the semester; however, I think the game would have made a bigger impact at the beginning of the semester. The \"take home points\" were helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I have a much better understanding of the complexity of health policy. My favorite realization was that health systems are not necessarily built on ideology alone, but on past experiences\/history.",
    "Chima is such a great, animated lecturer. Even though I'm not that into health policy, he kept me engaged and it was probably the most interesting class of the semester. The midterm and final were fair assessments, and I appreciated the section assignments being real-life cases rather than more theory.",
    "This course was pretty good in making me think more about our healthcare system and what changes will need to be implemented in order to help America's system become better and in line in terms of success and lowered financial costs with other highly developed countries.",
    "The course was well organized, though a bit long at times during lecture. The discussion groups was a good way of learning about the material in a different medium, but I think it would have been more helpful to have the reflections for that specific topic due the week after it was introduced. I understand that it is meant to make us reflect on the topic before we learn about it, but it is also difficult to come up with an insightful reflection when you do not know that much about the topic.",
    "Strengths: material was made simple for us understand and lectures were engaging Weaknesses: Sections were not really helpful, time would have been better spent in lecture. Lecture slides weren't organized or well-edited with careless mistakes..sometimes distracted away from the material",
    "This class is a gem and a half. It's once a week with section right after. Chima is not only extremely intelligent but he's hilarious and keeps it so real. You need to take this. Literally the most fun and relaxed learning environments. I walked away with an incredible of knowledge with low Stress.",
    "This course provided a great foundation about health systems and US health policy. I feel that I learned a great deal in this course. My only suggestion would be to initiate discussion about the Affordable Care Act earlier in the semester, I was disappointed that it was discussed at the end.",
    "I thought this was a good introduction to health systems. We learned about various structures, systemic barriers to access, and current changes. I would appreciate it if discussion sections were tied to lecture a bit more - I occasionally had difficulty finding the relevance of our reflections.",
    "This course was a good introduction into health policy and covered a lot of material. While some of it may be redundant if people have taken more advanced courses, it provided a great overview of the US healthcare system and I enjoyed attending.",
    "My rating on the course is excellent. I have no comments about the course.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and well organized. Prof Ndumele is a great lecturer and his interactions with the students in Winslow helped us gain insight on solutions to the US healthcare system. Sections were well organized and helpful for discussing key concepts and making real world applications. The midterm was a take-home and a very fair exam. The final was unnecessary, and a take-home or final paper would have been sufficient in lieu of a final examination.",
    "An absolutely wonderful overview given in clear and succinct lectures.",
    "Amazing amazing amazing course!",
    "What a wonderful course! Engaging, insightful, and inspiring. The readings were related and fun to do. The assignments were very fair. The lectures were a bit rushed and might benefit from being streamlined and having a bit more didactic information, but overall great!",
    "I thought the course topics were well organized and found the slides to be useful and user-friendly as well. I know that answers in policy are not always clear cut, but I felt like some of the information that should have been more direct was a little convoluted in its presentation. I think that for me, the take-home message was sometimes skewed by some of the details presented. I did like the specific \"take-home message\" slides at the end, but sometimes felt a bit lost getting there until I went through the lecture slides once more. A lot of idioms were used (ex. skin in the game), and sometimes I felt a little lost as to what significance they had in the course (mostly because I was unfamiliar with the idioms, so it was another layer to sort through to get to the meat of the material). Additionally, I really enjoyed the discussions sections and reflection assignments about comparing hospitals for a procedure, choosing a health insurance plan, and end of life care. I found these really interesting to do as a thought exercise, and think other topics could be introduced in a similar way. I found these to be the most engaging and best use of discussion sections. I didn't think that the use of the clickers added that much to the course. I can see that they're a nice way to engage a larger lecture course, and appreciated that. Maybe tweak the questions presented for the clicker questions in order to engage more.",
    "Great course giving an overview of the US healthcare system. Well structured, readings were appropriate and interesting given the subject matter. Would have liked to learn more about special interests in healthcare - AMA, AHA- and how they positively and negatively affect system.",
    "This course is a policy overview course, so I understand the need to balance providing \"the basics\" with enough information to keep more advanced students interested. What I do not understand is how this course could not provide concrete answers. All of the lectures were taught with a \"no right answer\" approach, but the exams had finite answers. That seems confusing.",
    "The course definitely gave me a great broad overview of what policy is but I do believe the powerpoints needed to be better organized as it became hard to know what we as students needed to focus on for the course. I also do not believe discussion sections are necessary in this class. I would rather have listened to Chima talk than spend time in my section.",
    "Great course! A must for all YSPHers. Chima was great, and I really appreciated his big picture approach. The course is a necessary component to being a public health professional. The course probably provides more questions than answers, but I attribute that to the complexity of our health care system. There is a reason why people are so passionate about healthcare is so in our nation, and this course helps us understand why. I definitely feel more well equipped to have meaningful healthcare conversations in public now especially with those who think they have all the answers.",
    "Great class, I learned so much about an important area of public health I never had the opportunity to learn before! The structure of the course and lecture slides were really straightforward and easy to follow (although less wording on slides would be more effective). I do like that discussion sections followed each lecture, as it helped us solidify key concepts and allowed us to discuss other issues in a smaller class environment. The reflections were pretty helpful, although a bit tedious some weeks.",
    "I enjoyed HPM and learned a great deal from the class. The structure was organized well, but it would have been nice if the class was broken down into two lecture days. I also didn't like that we had a take-home midterm and an in-class final exam that seemed very different. I would have rather had two in-class exams or two take-home exams.",
    "I learned a lot about healthy policy so I feel like I can speak knowlegebly on the topic.",
    "very helpful to get a deeper understanding of american health system",
    "I came into this class not knowing a lot of about health care and policy, and I feel that I learned a lot. Sometimes it was difficult to tell in lecture what concepts we were supposed to be learning since a lot of material is discussed and covered. Some of the reflection assignments were very helpful, such as choosing an insurance plan, because the activity allowed me to learn and put to use some important concepts. There were some reflections however that I didn't understand as clearly what we were supposed to be answering. Also the grades were not usually given with a lot of comments on what to improve on.",
    "What can be improved here is basically the facility used in teaching the course. I do not think Winslow is an ideal teaching facility.",
    "strengths: engaging and interactive classes, smart and funny professor weaknesses: too many students for the TA session in such a small room, also several times the prof did not finish his lecture material in the class time",
    "As a survey core course, this class did a great job of covering a wide range of topics within the realm of health policy. As a health policy concentrator, I learned a significant amount from Professor Ndumele's lectures and the discussions he fostered in class.",
    "I enjoyed the course but my only critique is that the professor did not compromise on the final (although he said he had no choice) when a majority of the class expressed dissatisfaction with the set up.",
    "The discussion group was ridiculously too big and we could barely fit in one room. The power point slides we not interesting at all.",
    "Great introduction to health policy and systems.",
    "Chima made the course fun, but it was a bit disorganized. Expectations weren't clear (especially on our weekly reflections) and we didn't get that much useful regular feedback so it was hard to improve or even gauge how we were doing. A huge weakness of the weekly reflections was that we were expected to cover a very complex topic in only one page. They changed the page limit to two pages after hearing our feedback, but it would have been better to limit the scope of the questions. Sometimes the prompt itself was a page long.",

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Dr. Ndumele is excellent. I really liked that he kept the lecture discussion like to keep us interested. It was also great that we were allowed to challenge him and talk freely about different issues.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is a dynamic lecturer, and I would have liked for him to just lecture more. Trying to have a discussing with about 150 people is not an effective use of time. Additionally, when he liked something or someone hit a point he would say, \"Good, we'll come back to that,\" and we never did. As a result the key points that he liked, were often not communicated the class as a whole. Obviously, the class size is unfortunate and out of his control, but he needs to adjust his teaching style to the situation. Lecturing would have been effective.",

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Incredible instructor, dynamic speaker, smart, with a sense of humor. I think it is challenging to cater to a huge group of students, some of whom have a lot of experience in the topic and some of whom have none. I do think that the slides could have been a bit less dense at times, however - making fewer and simpler slides could have helped.",

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0strengths: passionate, humor, nice to students.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Fantastic presenter and facilitator.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is very fun and seems to love student participation and feedback. The only complaint I have is that lecture seemed to be a hodgepodge of information, and cramming too many slides in too little time.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Amazing instructor. For how large the class was, he still made each lecture feel like a group discussion. He rarely talked at us, but rather would present an idea and have us hash it out. He is very knowledgeable on the topic and made classes enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Dynamic, funny, and very knowledgable.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Awesome, easy-going, SUPER approachable, and wicked smart.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0strengths: lectures, clearly enjoys interacting with students even though the class is huge, approachable; weaknesses: unfortunate that only one discussion section got to have Chima in their section, poll questions",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Good speaker but has too many slides every lecture and has too rush every time to finish it.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0He's a good professor. He tries to challenge our ways of thinking.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Really good!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Great teacher. Page numbers for the readings could be clearer.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is very knowledgable, confident, patient, and fun. I enjoyed his course immensely.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0He is a charismatic and has a great overall presentation style. He made the course material fun to learn.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Teacher is good. During the class, professor Chimaeze ask many questions to students and of course we respond. Some responses are impressive and",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0I thought he was a really great professor! I really liked that during class almost no matter what an individual would say he would challenge them and present the other side of the argument - I thought this was great and really showed the complexities of our health care system.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Dr. Ndumele is a great lecturer. He immediately establishes friendliness and approachability with his students. His seminar style lectures are also fun, but at times I felt like the class was too big and the lecture time was too short for any discussion. I could see that he tried and wanted to have discussions, but he also had so much material to cover, and so I felt like the lectures never worked the way he wanted them to. Given that I did not enjoy the discussion sections, I would suggest taking out the sections and expanding the lecture to facilitate the seminar style class.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0I really appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to keep us engaged. I thought the written assignments were thought-provoking.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is so down-to-earth and intelligent. You can tell he's passionate about his work via his lectures in class. However, his slides are sometimes too dense and numerous that I leave class overwhelmed and feeling I didn't really learn anything because there was too much to remember. I suggest simpler slides with the main points stated and the rest verbally lectured to us.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is an engaging instructor and speaker. Sometimes it is difficult to know what the main point of the topic or slide is when we have a long discussion about it. I would recommend that after we talk about it, he points out what he would specifically like us to know. The midterm was fair, but I think we could have been better prepared for the final exam. Example review questions would have been very helpful, but other than that Chima was great!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Instructor knew the material and was fairly engaging. Could do a better job of responding to questions; would sometimes dismiss people in the interest of time, but questions were usually just as valuable to discussion.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Prof. Chima is literally the man. Brilliant, funny, insightful and extremely kind spirited. Whether you're a grad or undergrad you need to figure out a way to take a class with him or speak to him. He's just wonderful. 10\/10.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was by far my favorite professor this semester. He is likable, friendly, and very funny. He made lecture very interesting and encouraged discussion. He was responsive to mid-semester reviews and adjusted his course structure accordingly.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is a really charismatic, fun instructor who is easy to follow. I appreciated his clarity during lecture. I also appreciated how he occasionally polled the class for our opinions. However, there should be a limit to how much discussion occurs during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was a great instructor. I thoroughly enjoyed his lecturing styles and he did a good job fostering discussion during class and breaking up the class period with interesting polling questions. The format of the class was good as well--I enjoyed having sections and lecture in one period once a week. This was one of the most engaging classes I've taken at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Very interactive class and well organized teaching material. Great! Since the class size was very big, it was appropriate you were passing around while lecturing to get us focused on the lecture. The small class discussions and clickers were really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Professor Ndumele was highly interactive and his slides were very well organized. He transcended the themes of the class over the semester very well, and his knowledge of the material was incredible.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima kept things interesting and clearly communicated course material.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0One of the best teachers I've ever had.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima made this class 100 times better just by being the instructor. The material could have been somewhat dry at times, but Chima was always incredibly engaging during lectures. I can't begin to imagine how different this class could have been if Chima was not the professor. As someone who is not a policy person at all, I'm extremely grateful for how great of a job Chima did teaching this class!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0WHAT A GREAT LECTURER! Truly the best lecturer I've had at YSPH. He is engaging, brings difficult concepts to a relatable level, is intelligent and I always looked forward to this course.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Great. Wonderful ability to engage students and stimulate thought provoking conversation. Particularly enjoyed lectures where there was less emphasis on the slides and more interaction with students.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0He is funny, but I did not find the lectures useful.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was great!!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was great. Down to earth, funny, engaging, and knowledgeable. Class was fun, and I really appreciated his approach to learning. He raised pertinent questions and gave push back against a lot of misconceptions. He didn't give me hope that we'll soon figure out how to create a top notch health system in this country, but I feel much more in tune with the complexities that make that task so difficult.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Great instructor and hilarious! Really knowledgeable about his stuff and is definitely able to convey that knowledge to his students. Because of his teaching style and sense of humor, it was so easy to pay attention and actually learn in class- and a lot I did!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima's lecturing style made it easy to follow in lecture, but there were a couple times when we had reviews where we didn't do anything of substance. While I appreciated the Price is Right game show at the end of class, it didn't really add value and lasted for a long time.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Really great instructor. I learned a lot. However, sometimes you would go on rants and you would be like think about it. At the end, I would really have no idea what you just said or what I should be thinking about. I have never worked in policy and sometimes I would have no idea what you said or other people in the class were saying who were clearly more familiar with health policy than I was. I would just suggest that you dumb things down in the future because sometimes I would just walk out being very confused.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is a very engaging instructor and does a good job initiating and moderating discussion. He is very interesting and I enjoyed his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Excellent professor with demonstrated commitment to his students.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0He is awesome! A great and engaging lecturer. He did a fantastic job of making class interesting by posing discussion questions that sparked interesting conversations.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0His lecture style was good but him talking for 90 minutes was not enjoyable. The lecture always got tiresome and boring in the end.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Favorite professor at YSPH so far. Very engaging and absolutely great at lecturing!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Very knowledgeable and an extremely engaging lecturer. However, it was kind of clear that he didn't really want to teach the course."

   "comments": [
    "If you can get out of this course, do it because you won't learn anything if you take it.",
    "Students should take this class as it allows you to have an overview of health policy in the US and allows you to understand how public health is influenced by this.",
    "required course that is worth it for the instructor; could use overhaul on discussion section organization\/structure to improve",
    "A fantastic overview of the complexities of health policy and reform. Engaging, informative, and fun, I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I think anyone, with or without outside knowledge, could benefit from taking this course. It was a lot of fun and I would definitely take a course from the instructor again in the future.",
    "No.",
    "This course is required for my department. I would only recommend it to those very interested in health policy or those with very little background knowledge of the subject.",
    "Favorite class of the term. I would highly recommend it to a fellow student for its wealth of knowledge, professor, and useful reflection assignments.",
    "Great course. I would recommend taking this course to fill your Policy requirement because Chima is great.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, this is the basic course for any health professional. One recommendation from me would be to include somewhere in the syllabus that this course in about the US health system, as it is not obvious and might be misleading for the students with more global concentration.",
    "Overall, a very good class! The material is so important, and Chima did a great job of organizing it and presenting it. (Still, I would say that this class was definitely FAR better towards the beginning of the semester then towards the end - towards the end, when his lectures veered strongly towards his personal opinion...) Still, would recommend.",
    "I would summarize this class as a basic introduction to the United States health care system. I would recommend this class to another student. It definitely opens one's eyes to the many issues within the American health care system.",
    "A little bit repetitive if you've already taken HPM514 in the Spring - but the professor makes it worth it.",
    "Highly recommend taking this course for those without a background in policy. Interesting course, great instructor, and the workload is not overwhelming, even for someone without a background in policy.",
    "Fun course",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Great course.",
    "This was a great course. It covers very broad topics and involves critical thinking about important, current events related to health policy, so be prepared for that.",
    "A great introduction to the state of the health system and the challenges facing progress and reform.",
    "Great introduction to health policy. The material itself is convoluted and complicated, but the instructor does his best to introduce the material as sensibly as possible. If you complete the readings and engage in the reflection pieces seriously with common sense and thought, the seemingly nonsensical information about our health system will begin to make more sense.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "it is a great course to gain basic knowledge about US health care system.",
    "This class does not go into a great deal of depth but it gives an excellent overview of health systems and the instructor is wonderfully engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class because it puts public health into a broader framework and helps us to understand why we need to study public health. By learning about the inefficiencies of the health care system, we realize that public health is a solution to many of the issues, such as reducing health care costs and increasing quality of care.",
    "Take this course. You will learn so much and won't regret it.",
    "Take it. It's an excellent survey course of the health system, and you will undoubtedly learn something new. It's taught by an awesome professor and you will enjoy going to lecture.",
    "perhaps. its a fairly introductory, broad strokes type of course.",
    "An overview of how health care systems work. It is a difficult course when you have no background at all in this field but you learn a lot at the end and it makes you understand some things from your own health care system.",
    "The course exceeded my expectations; it was a great grounding in health policy, especially US policy.",
    "Great course. Do the readings!",
    "Essential to understanding health policy both in the US and around the world.",
    "The course provided a great overview of the U.S. health system as well as health systems around the world. I would recommend this course to students; the course was taught by a good instructor who effectively provided detailed information about the U.S. health care system.",
    "Recommend for audit.",
    "This course will give a broad introduction to health policy in the United States and is definitely recommended.",
    "It's a great course to take! The workload is doable, the material is understandable, and the lecturer is awesome! Just be cognizant that his slides may contain too much information but other than that, I thought it was pretty easy.",
    "This is a great introductory course to US health policy. It is broken down into very understandable terms and lectures. It is interesting and does make you reflect on how the US health system is structured and why it is done this way. Overall, I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Course is a good summary of health care system and relevant to what's going on today. If you want to learn about the history, ACA, and nuts and bolts of our health care this is a good intro course. Coursework isn't bad, but the final felt like a high school memorizing type exam.",
    "Very good at teaching the basics of health plicy",
    "I would highly recommend this course with Chima as a professor. He made the material interesting and applicable. Great job!",
    "This is a broad overview of health systems and the current challenges we are facing with the U.S. health care system. I would recommend this course to American students who are interested in remaining in the U.S.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for those who don't know much about health policy.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students especially for medical students and clinicians who would want to understand the complex US health system.",
    "Great intro to health policy and systems! Be warned, Chima might convert you into loving Health Systems and Policy! Don't be afraid to ask simple questions...I definitely did! Studying in groups was helpful for me in this course.",
    "An overview of health policy in the US, how our system compares to others, and how our system came to be the way it is. I would recommend this course.",
    "A great course worth taking to understand broad concepts related to US healthcare policy.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because it did not seem to be very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course as the professor was great and I learned very new information about policy.",
    "Probably my favorite course of the semester. It was a great intro to healthcare systems and was taught in a big picture manner that I could relate to. I think every YSPHer should take this course. Chima was great, and the course is fair. The workload is not overly burdensome, and many readings are interesting. Conversations were lively, so lectures are very engaging. I think his goals for the course were accomplished unequivocally.",
    "Even if this class is a required core course, I would still recommend it to others anyway. I learned so much in just the first lecture! And obviously every other lecture after that. It is so important to be able to understand and be able to discuss with others health policy and current issues (in the US and in other countries), and the class really allows that to happen.",
    "Great class that follows the US healthcare system and shows why it is what it is today. I really enjoyed learning about the challenges that are faced and found the class to be awesome.",
    "Great course. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "good course",
    "Summary: This course not only provides a detailed overview (more like a birds eye-view) of the health care delivery landscape, it also provides knowledge on the core drivers of value (costs and outcomes) within the US health care system. It also does this within the context of comparative health care systems. Any student with policy interests should take this course",
    "great course, you will definitely learn what you need to know about the US health system",
    "I would not recommend this course. The class size in discussion groups are too large and you feel disconnected. There are some interesting material that is covered but not enough coverage on the ACA. Least favorite subject of the semester.",
    "I strongly recommend the course to any student considering public health.",
    "Fairly painless fulfillment of a requirement with a very charismatic instructor. Why not take it?",
    "Interesting material. Grading is harsh."
