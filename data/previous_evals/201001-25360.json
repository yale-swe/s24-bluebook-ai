    "I would definitely recommend this course, regardless of your background in dance. You don't have to be a dancer to really appreciate the material. The workload is very fair with around 70 pages of reading a week and around an hour of film viewing that you do on your own. We have weekly reading responses due. At the end there is a standard research paper. The reading list is very interesting and the films you watch are awesome. You will learn a lot about American dance if you take this course! Very interesting material. Also, we had some amazing guest lecturers come in who were famous in the dance world. We also had a mandatory field trip to New York where we saw a Tharp performance--it was amazing. Also, Professor Coates is wonderful. She knows so much about dance, being a legend in the dance field herself, and really faciliates discussions well. Take this class!!! You will learn a lot!",
    "This course fundamentally changes how you think about dance performance and movement. Emily Coates is uniquely equipped with incredible connections and personal experience with many of the choreographers she teaches. The emphasis on modern and post-modern concert dance in America can feel a bit narrow, but really goes a long way to give a more mature and informed perspective on what it means to dance and make art.",
    "It's a class on twentieth century western dance that delves into some tango and African as well. I would definitely recommend the class, as it wasn't too much work, the material was really interesting, and the discussions were always lively. The weekly dance viewings were always enjoyable as well.",
    "Absolutely. The readings are riveting, the class is always interesting. Time flies during discussions",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Great overview of 20th century, mostly American concert dance. This class will completely change the way you see dance and theater, both as a participant and an observer. The readings aren't too heavy. There are a lot of films to watch, which can be time consuming. Still, it's totally worth the time. Class discussion was consistently engaging and interesting. Emily Coates has personal experience dancing and collaborating with a lot of the people we studied, and she's a complete wealth of knowledge about the field. She also brought in fantastic guest speakers who had totally different experiences, which was fascinating. If you're interested in dance at all, this is a great option for learning more about it, especially if you're more interested in reading and writing about dance than choreographing."
