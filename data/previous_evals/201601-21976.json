    "Take this if you want to learn about historical performance and enjoy a great group of people making music together!",
    "Take it! Grant is amazing!",
    "Take this class if you love singing early music! A great and enjoyable fifth class.",
    "A lot of fun and a unique class.",
    "An interesting, fun class that should be taken by all musical Yalies!",
    "A fun sight reading and performance music course.",
    "Musi 334 is a friendly introduction to renaissance music and a reminder how history affects interpretation. The theme and program changes yearly. We celebrated Cervantes and Shakespeare with pieces mentioned in or relevant to their plays. I gained a new perspective to imagine how composers think about their cultural environment. I also realized that playwrights have long been thinking about music. Grant is great at showing musical details by performing them himself. His musical program flows very enjoyably, which I did not realize while we practiced the bits. His friendliness encouraged me to try new styles and instruments.",
    "An easy class, but not a gut by any stretch of the imagination. You'll get out of it what you put into it, and there's potential for that amount to be extraordinary. I strongly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in music, as you'll see a facet of it you probably hadn't considered too strongly before."
