    "Unless they change this course, I wouldn't recommend it. It's pretty bio heavy, not terribly interesting, and there is a palpable lack of interest from basically all parties involved. I don't want to blame this entirely on the professors because there's only so much you can do when your students are just sitting there, but the air was pretty dead, both in lecture and in section. Biology>>Issues, which makes it not awesome for a non-science major such as myself",
    "Don't take it. There are better and more interesting courses available to fulfill the science distributional requirement (coming from an English major who struggles with science).",
    "This course was FAR more stressful than it should have been. Although there is not much work during the semester, the exams are very difficult and graded harshly. There are three different lecturers for each of the three modules as well as several other guest lectures. As a result, a wide range of material is covered which is frustrating for the exams. I do not recommend this course, there are far better science classes at Yale.",
    "Issues approach to biology was a very enjoyable course. It is perfect for the non-science major looking for a science credit. The work load is ideal.",
    "Fine for a science credit, but not worth it otherwise.",
    "It could have been a great class. The material, on paper, looks interesting. In practice, it's by far the most boring, generally bad course I've ever taken. Do not, do not, do not take this course.",
    "I would recommend if you want\/need a relatively easy science credit that is still intellectually stimulating.",
    "It's an interesting class for non-science majors if you actually go to lecture. Some modules are better than others, but you should be fine as long as you pay attention in lecture. Because it's bio, it requires memorizing but not a lot of work otherwise.",
    "Overall interesting course with a great perspective on different aspects of biology. Most of the professors are pretty cool and bring interesting views to what we learn. Dieter Soll is quiet so try to sit really close and remind him to speak up. Only take this class if Wyman is not teaching. I left every single lecture i went to with the ever offensive, racist, rape apologist, and insensitive Robert Wyman sick to my stomach and thoroughly disgusted. I walked out in the middle of lecture several times because I couldn't handle his disgusting attitudes. He is also incredibly condescending to non-STEM majors.",
    "This is not a gut science class. It's a terribly taught, hard, biology course falsely advertised to students who are non-science majors. I do not recommend.",
    "An Issues Approach to Biology in its Spring 2015 form should not be taken, especially if you're looking for an easy, approachable science credit that doesn't give you stress. Module 1 was great, but the course took a distinct turn for the worse afterwards. Module 2 is unbelievably boring, presuming that Dieter Soll still leads it. Module 3 is controversial.",
    "The class is fine. Just fine. Nothing better. Nothing worse. Over half the class gets about a B+ or better. Section is chill. The first module is all biology and while hard, the test is doable. Patrick Sung is an angel The second module is all of the interesting things; most people did worse than expected (because this is college) but not bad. This module had a rolodex of professors. The third module is a a complete mess. Robert Wyman was all over the place. It was all about rape and sex in primates, which was A LOT. The test was fine, though. Get Audrey or Karlina as a TF, while avoid Tenaya.",
    "You learn things, just be warned that the tests are harder than you might anticipate. I'd probably take it again if I had a better attitude going into the semester.",
    "Good class for non-science majors. Definitely take more time to study for the tests.",
    "It wasn't a lot of work, but it still made me miserable.",
    "MB&B 105 involves a lot of memorization for the three tests. It's a good general overview of some important topics in biology, though. It's definitely not a gut science credit, but it's not conceptually difficult at all (you just have to memorize a lot of disparate facts).",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to a non-science major. Very confusing material and sections were not clarifying. I ended up having to do most of the learning for tests from youtube and the internet. The exam term lists took forever to get through because of what little prior knowledge I had on the topics. Ended up being hugely time consuming for something that isn't going to be helpful for my major.",
    "This class has very little reading but that does not mean you cannot do it. Reading is an integral part of the tests, especially second half of the semester.",
    "This is an unenjoyable class but a fairly easy science credit. However, do not expect to be able to coast by. The course is not well-organized enough to miss lecture, as not all professors upload notes and lectures. I would not take this class again and would not recommend (and I did well in the class for the record).",
    "If your favorite part of a class is the final paper, that's not a good sign. And that was my favorite part of this class. Boring, random, and inefficient. Plus the tests are impossibly difficult regardless of the time you put in studying.",
    "The course seems to vary from year to year but covers a few areas of biology with social or political implications. We covered topics such as ebola, HIV, the ribosome and studies of it for development of antibiotics, primate behavior, nucleic acids, etc.",
    "if wyman and soll aren't the professors, then i've heard this is a pretty good class. if either of those names are in the bluebook, DO NOT TAKE. they are not good at teaching and you will leave class wondering why on earth you spent 50 minutes there.",
    "The concept behind issues approach to biology was fantastic. I think there is a huge need for business leaders, policy makers, and other members of society to have basic scientific literacy, and exposure to key issues. However, the class was unbelievably dry, the grading totally unclear, and it seemed like many of the professors didn't put a huge effort into their lessons. It was fine overall, but the gap between it's potential and reality was frustrating.",
    "This was the worst class I took at Yale. Please don't do it. Take a higher level bio course so you'll actually learn something, and you'll do better because it will be taught well.",
    "This is a fine survey course, some of it is interesting and some of it isn't. I would caution that the work load was heavier than I thought it would be and they graded harsher than I thought they would. But its a fine class to take just to get the science credit",
    "I heard great things about this class but think they switched the professors for this semester. An overall awful experience - even for someone who had an original interest in biology.",
    "Pretty good for a science credit. Not too much work, although a good amount of preparation is needed to do really well on the exams.",
    "An Issues Approach to Biology wasn't my favorite class this semester, and it seemed unorganized and all over the place.",
    "I would recommend this class to be who are trying to get a science credit. It's not the easiest class in the world but if you study the power point slides hard the class should be good. Also, a very interesting class.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a student looking for a science credit, and I imagine that it is too easy for a really science-focused student. I think that the course has a lot of potential to be great, if ethics are more clearly integrated into the syllabus.",
    "Take the course. Not a ton of work pretty interesting.",
    "great",
    "Take it - but only if they change their syllabus to something that is not straight biology - otherwise the exams will be asking you technical questions and nothing related to policy or issues.",
    "Science class for non-science majors!",
    "Unless they change the format of the course and make it less detail-oriented, I would not recommend this course. I had taken AP biology in high school and was very interested in biology, but I was not able to use this course as a forum for important issues in biology.",
    "It was a bad science credit to take, don't do it",
    "I would not recommend this course; it is no longer a gut if that is what you are looking for. It is very unclear and the grading was very unfair.",
    "Easy science credit and decently interesting. This year's class was much harder than previous classes but I would still recommend this to non-science majors in need of credit. The lectures can be boring depending on the instructor but doing the reading and the slides is usually enough to do well.",
    "It is a class",
    "Good course. Do the readings.",
    "Issues is just a basic biology course that relates the concepts to societies and cultures.",
    "This class is very interesting. I feel like I learned a lot, however you have to be willing to put in the work and do the readings. I don't think it was too bad (as a non-science major) but you definitely had to put in work to get a good grade. The test were hard so you had to study. During the weeks of tests you really had to study hard. My TA helped me a ton. She did a great job of explaining everything and breaking things down. This course can be confusing at times, so don't be afraid to ask your TA for help. They care a lot and I found they were more helpful than any of the professors.",
    "Don't take it. Go elsewhere for a science credit. This class sucks, and I hated every minute of it. The lectures were often completely incomprehensible and a waste of time.",
    "A good science credit if you interested in some basic science but don't have a background in science. The course covers a wide variety of topics that are very interesting especially if you are into ethics, but don't expect to discuss the ethical\/moral issues very much. The material is a bit scattered but generally very interesting stuff. I would recommend this class to people who enjoy some science but aren't particularly strong in that area.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The end.",
    "Issues Approach to Biology exposes the serious problems Yale has with science classes for non-science majors. Because humanities majors cannot take distributional science credits Cr\/D, we end up taking useless classes such as this while we could be taking more interesting, albeit harder courses that would be much more rewarding. Because the landscape of accessible science classes is so grim, I would recommend Issues, with the caveat that it was far from a good class. The lectures were often boring and disorganized, and sections were not interesting or helpful. Students do gain some useful scientific knowledge, but that small positive was very much outweighed by the poor teaching and organization of the course.",
    "Disjointed and not that rewarding. The professors seemed out of touch with each other and not that interested in the class.",
    "This is definitely the worst class that I've taken at Yale. It seemed promising at the start; Patrick Sung is great. If he had taught the whole class, it might not have been so bad. As soon as the first module with Professor Sung ended, the class seemed to lose all focus. The lectures were worthless and nearly incomprehensible. It all just seemed so arbitrary. I knew that the class wasn't going to be cumulative, but it seemed to have no real direction at all. I would advise you to take ANY other class. Even if you're just wanting to knock out a science credit, this is not a class that is worth taking.",
    "THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT. I repeat, it's not a gut. Take this class only if you love rote memorization. There are 3 tests which aren't cumulative so you can essentially cram the night before the test and forget all the stuff the next day. This class is more science heavy and you definitely earn more biology than you do issues. FALSE ADVERTISING FOR SURE - I have so many issues with issues",
    "Take it but study for the tests",
    "Up until the last module, this was a pretty straightforward class with an array of interesting topics which were pretty random but relevant nonetheless. However, the last part of the class was really different from the rest , and had nothing with biology. A lot of it was on monkeys and sex, which was not what I signed up for. The test was random and suddenly we had over fifty readings to do. I wish the class was more standardized and the topics were more related to each other. Nothing we studied really built off one another. If the last module is changed, I would recommend this to non science majprs looking for a sc credit.",
    "It's not going to be the easy, interesting science credit you think it's going to be. You'd be better off taking something else that is traditionally more difficult, but is at least more structured and will hold your attention.",
    "A class in which you learn nothing that corresponds to the syllabus.",
    "Absolutely terrible course with brief periods of mediocrity. Do not take this course. Ever. If you are a non-science major, this course will be infuriating, irrelevant, and too hard. If you are a science major, this course will be infuriating, irrelevant, and still TOO HARD. My roommate is a B.S. MCDB major and was shocked by the stuff we had to know. If you need a science credit, this is the last one you should consider. I sincerely hope Yale cancels the course.",
    "Dont. It's not the class you think it will be, and since they bring in different professors each time you're essentially rolling dice when you decide to take this class. Stay safe",
    "do not take",
    "NOT A GUT. take it if you have an interest in bio\/have taken AP Bio before",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, even for one who is looking for a light and interesting science credit. It is unorganized and not engaging, and I did not learn much that I will take with me beyond the tests for this course.",
    "Interesting yet tasking",
    "Good if you want a science credit, can be technical but not too hard and the TA review sessions are helpful. Three midterms and a final paper but no final. Some of the guest lectures my year were good, but don't go in with very high expectations of the class.",
    "Don't even think about taking it, you will regret it immensely.",
    "No, its so much work and definitely not for non-science majors as it is advertised.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit and don't want to do an more rigourous science",
    "Don't take it unless the structure of the course radically changes. The only course I have taken that has been genuinely poor.",
    "The material is not that hard, but this class is so incredibly boring and they grade you really harshly for no reason. Obviously only take it if you need the credit.",
    "If you are one of those students taking it as a \"gut,\" that's silly. Take it because you are passionate about and genuinely care about the subjects being introduced. I personally really enjoyed it and had a great time learning about so many different topics. It does require a good amount of work and studying but it's pretty fair if you do what is necessary.",
    "Easy science credit. You literally won't know what grade you're getting all semester because no one does well on the exams. But I'd take it. It was fine. Most kids don't go to lecture, so if you go and listen, you're already ahead of most of the kids in the class."
