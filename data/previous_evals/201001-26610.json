   "comments": [
    "the body of material was very strong. the student presentations were also good in terms of engaging the class to talk about the topics but the themes presented for each class as proposed by prof petit weren't always thoroughly explored. more time for lecture and less for presentations would be better.",
    "I found the course material interesting and provocative.",
    "I thought the sequence was fine; I wish that there were a follow-up to the presentations before the final paper was due.",
    "The professor's attempt to categorize the architects into themes was interesting. Although the themes did not always seem to apply to some architects' work, they provoked excellent discussion in class and overall it seems like a successful technique to organize the material.",
    "The first half of the course was provocative and well organized. Professor Petit represented its content truthfully in the introductory session at the beginning of the semester. As intended, he provided the foundations to a compelling and unconventional discussion about postmodernist architecture and allowed enough space for individual exploration with student presentations and a final paper. Because the course takes place spring semester, I would have found it helpful to have submitted a draft or detailed outline for the paper in the first week after the break. In addition to other non-negotiable deadlines (pertinent to class advancement or graduation) that now come so soon after our final reviews, I think the paper would have been better developed if I had been required to give it more attention up to three weeks before final reviews and had been done with it by the second to last class session.",
    "Body of the course was expertly developed and well-executed. Structure of readings and their relationship to class presentations\/discussions was very good."

   "comments": [
    "my expectations to learn about different perspectives on post modernism were very well met.",
    "My expectations for the course were high and they were met very well, although I thought and wished that there had been more discussion - though that might have been as much a function of the students as the professor.",
    "I expected more impersonal student conversations to occur during the seminar.",
    "I expected enlightening class discussion and informative presentations. My expectations were very well met.",
    "With shamefully little knowledge about the work of these contemporary architects, I expected more exposure. Indeed, as Professor Petit has demonstrated on several occasions in other lectures, substantive theoretical underpinnings influenced their semantic manipulations and, more mainstream notions of postmodernist architecture notwithstanding, critical contributions to the discourse.",
    "Expectations met very well. One of the best seminars I've taken at YSOA."

   "comments": [
    "this course was very valuable to me.",
    "It helped my question many of the assumptions I previously held about the subject matter. It helped me realize that there is much left to be learned from the period of architectural thought in question.",
    "This course was very valuable.",
    "The course was valuable in understanding and learning how to discuss and talk about architecture. It provided a different avenue to follow and an opportunity to allow creativity into a very disciplined field of study - arch history and theory.",
    "It was an important course in teaching me to think more critically about more recent architectural theory. I also learned to think in a different way about a lot of the work that I was already familiar with. The assigned readings were very insightful.",
    "As disconcerting as it is to find how much my own thinking and attitude towards architecture can be aligned with postmodernist ideas (!), the experience was enlightening. In as much as we react to Modernist notions, we remain in the Modern existentialist crisis. It is better to know.",
    "Very high value. Sophisticated texts, complex readings of historical phenomena. Instructor engaging, energetic and polemical. The main problem with the course is that we consistently ran out of time. PLEASE EXTEND THE COURSE NEXT TIME!"

   "comments": [
    "petit was always well prepared and enthusiastic to talk about the topics of each lecture.",
    "The material was taught in a clear and directed manner.",
    "I thought the teaching was superb; my only complaint would be that I hoped that Emmanuel would be more open to discussion from students.",
    "Great enthusiasm and energy. Would have liked to see more discussions come out of the topics presented in class. Maybe follow up each discussion with a set of questions for the students to answer.",
    "The teacher's presentations were very informative. Unfortunately, because the discussion in class was so good, we were frequently unable to finish the instructor's presentation. That's not really a problem. It just proves that this was an engaging class.",
    "Professor Petit rerouted discussions in an out of architectural boundaries, but always effectively led us back to the topic at hand.",
    "Damn good professor. I was lucky to get in the class and when I did I was far from disappointed. I would take it again if I could."

    "option for midterm paper or presentations to save time for more lecture time and also allow a start for a paper going into the final one.",
    "This was an intellectually challenging and comprehensive class. Readings from a diverse-cross section are great. And once we moved into the flow of student presentations, with Emmanuel speaking intermittently, instead of only students, the class balanced out well.",
    "I thought the course was excellent.",
    "The class was very well organized and presented, however it might be useful to find a different approach in encouraging students to talk and not feel pressured to have well thought out comments.",
    "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:Student presentations were given much too much leeway. While we were required to meet with Professor Petit individually to refine the presentation beforehand, we were somehow given an infinite amount of time to present what occasionally amounted to book (Wikipedia) reports. I would have preferred short and concise student presentations following the hour-long presentation Professor Petit had already prepared for each week.",
    "Not enough time given for so much reading\/presentation\/discussion. Really needs to be longer if its going to find its full potential as a class. This is the last sentence I will ever type, affiliated with Yale university.. its been fun, thanks everyone, I won't forget you!"
