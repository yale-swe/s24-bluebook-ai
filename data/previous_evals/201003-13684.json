    "This was an OUTSTANDING course. The best one I've taken at Yale so far. The level was perfect, we learnt a lot from leaders in their fields. We had access to people I would have never thought I would - and had lunch with them. I was looking forward to this course every week, I wish I could take it again.The only \"drawback\" is the 8,000 word essay students have to write, which is a little bit on the long side. I wish that requirement could have been for a slightly smaller essay. Overall though, the course was so good, I'd write a 20,000 word essay if I had to!THE BEST COURSE!!!!!!!!!!!! Congratulations to Drs Pogge and Ruger and a big THANK YOU to them for making this happen.",
    "really enjoyed the guest speakers, excellent line up.",
    "Strengths: brilliant speakers, novel topics.",
    "Excellent group of lecturers",
    "strength: various perspectives to approach health issues and many distinguished lecturers.Weakness: More helpful feedback for class preparation but a smaller project for the final.",
    "This is one of the most unique classes I've taken thus far here. The variety and diversity of speakers we had was amazing and awe-inspiring. Dr. Pogge and Dr. Ruger are both amazing as well--this class truly was a treat.",
    "This was a great course. It is absolutely amazing to get a chance to hear so many different points of view. My one recommendation is would be to offer some guidance on the final paper. Perhaps a required meeting with the professor or an outline. Of course people could probably do these things on their own and there is no need to baby graduate and professional students but some minimal requirement could have been helpful.",
    "The course was amazing and invited very good dialogue on topics relevant to the class. One of the best classes I have taken thus far.",
    "Strengths: Exposure to really high caliber lecturers. Also, the course allows you to do the majority of the work (concept papers, final paper) on topics of your choosing.Weaknesses: Inconsistent in discussion format; also unclear what the aims of some of the lectures were.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics. Lunch is a good idea. Best lectures: Emmanuel, Benn, (Ted) RugerAreas for improvement: Seems a bit HIV centric.Nix Ruger's lecture. Associations are meaningless without exploring how they may be or if they are causative factors. Not allowing questions during that lecture really rubbed me the wrong way, since a lively discussion is more important than another smattering of associations that hold no meaning. Also, forbidding question is at odds to the mission of learning. OR cut the content in half and allow discussion... the connections are important, but they need to be backed by discussion."

    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0In this course we didn't have a lot of teaching directly from the instructors but I know they spent a lot of time organizing the course and in that, they both did a great job. Dr Ruger participated by asking pertinent questions in the class room and during the lunches. I would highly recommend any course that she's involved with.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Good.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Very good at facilitating the dialogue between the guest speaker and the students",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Finebut, more interaction with students is expected.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0She was excellent and a very knowledgable woman. I enjoyed her genuine interest in class discussion and interaction with the guest speakers.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Very nice, very intelligent, but not much interaction\/engagement with students. Could be improved by commenting on concept papers.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0In this course we didn't have a lot of teaching directly from the instructors but I know they spent a lot of time organizing the course and in that, they both did a great job. Dr Pogge participated by asking pertinent questions in the class room and during the lunches. I would highly recommend any course that he's involved with.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Bright.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Likewise, he always had great questions and comments to keep the discussion moving in interesting directions",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Fine, more interaction with students is expected.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0He is an amazing professor and an asset to this class - he defines constructive criticism in his reviews, allowing for an excellent understanding of positive and negative aspects of the papers. He also engaged in class discussion with genuine interest and was a very understanding and caring individual.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Very helpful and responsive. Always answered my questions\/got back to me, and gave me helpful comments on my concept papers.Both instructors' teaching could be improved by giving some more guidance on who the speakers are and what we should try to get out of their lecture."

   "comments": [
    "This course gives you access to the leaders of the Global Health ethics field. It is extremely interesting and covers a lot of different aspects of global health. I enjoyed thoroughly and would HIGHLY recommend it to other students.",
    "it would be nice to receive additional comments and feedbacks on assignments so students can get a better idea of their strengths and weaknesses on topics discussed",
    "Perfect.",
    "Excellent course to do diverse readings in global health and gain exposure to new ideas and potential areas of interest",
    "As a course focusing on ethics, economics and politics, this course is quite different from the usual science courses we have within YSPH. Thus one may feel lost when doing the reading or listen to the lecture. But overall, I find the topics are quite interesting and even if you don't choose this course, I think you should try a similar one to know something about social science issues on global health. Workload is not so much except for the final, 8000 words paper!!",
    "Fantastic course that gives you a deep understanding of a number of important global health problems and what kinds of work some remarkable people are doing to change them.",
    "This class was a seminar style class with a different speaker each week who gave a perspective on a global health topic.I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in global heath issues, international development, bioethics, and political science.",
    "An excellent course that anyone interested in health and ethics should take.",
    "This is a great course if you are not a law student, but still interested in these topics. Not every lecture will suit everyone, but there are lots of different important topics. It's a great way to take advantage of Yale's ability to attract interesting and important speakers.",
    "It's a decent class and is similar to the Global Health Seminar. Youhave guest lecturers each week and there are assigned readings that usually- but not always- are related to what the lecturer is going to talk about. However, it is a lot of work. Three 4-8 page essays and a 32-40 pager. Don't take this class if you aren't a writer."
