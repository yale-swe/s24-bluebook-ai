    "For me, it was hell on earth. The work was time-consuming and stressful, and the first midterm was straight-up demoralizing. This is because I suck at exams. My strength is in papers, which this class of course has absolutely none of. If you're good at math, this class will be a breeze for you. If you are unsure and are just considering this for a QR credit, don't do it. Only take this class if you need it.",
    "MATH 112 is beginning calculus. It's good for someone who needs a QR or needs a basic class in calculus. Overall, a good course.",
    "A typical math class for a QR credit or a prerequisite for a major.",
    "It went too fast. very impersonal. they just taught you something a new theory during class, then showed examples, then you had a homework and that's it. I didn't feel like they took the proper time to explain and go over the example or homework.",
    "A math class. You get what you expect."
