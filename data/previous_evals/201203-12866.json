   "comments": [
    "Definitely, the class is a great class to take even if you're not interested in majoring in English.",
    "Take it! The reading is great and you become a better writer. ENG 120 demands a lot of writing, but this class is worth it.",
    "A quintessential Yale class, and justifiably so. Take it. I left the class with a far greater appreciation of language and of creative nonfiction, and the course teaches you not only how to improve your writing but truly how to think differently. If possible, try to take it with Professor Fred Strebeigh.But be warned--it's very fast the first four weeks (two drafts and two revisions).",
    "In 120 you'll write a series of essays that incorporate the effective aspects of various pieces you read in class. Group editing is scary, but very helpful.",
    "Would definitely recommend to students who see themselves writing extensively in the future.",
    "ENGL120 is a very strenuous writing course that, like many have said before me, can change your writing, your thinking, and your life. You will read many wonderfully written nonfiction essays -- all short ones -- and for most people, you will be introduced to a world you've never seen. The amount of reading in this course is trivial compared to most other English\/humanities courses, but you will spend time analyzing single words and phrases, identifying the techniques used, and thinking why the author wrote it that way. For those already well-acquainted with essay writing, you will greatly enjoy this course. For those who wish to become a better nonfiction essayist, you will work a lot -- perhaps the most you've ever done -- and by the end of the course, you will be surprised by how far you've come.",
    "Do not assume you are ready for this class. If you have no experience in creative non-fiction then you should not take this class. Do yourself a favor and take 114.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys writing and who craves to learn about writing. This class requires creativity within borders, so it is ideal for students who enjoy thinking outside the box, but who don't mind conforming to a specific format for assignments and most importantly, using the rules and formulas we derive in class from masters' writing in their own work. I would not recommend Professor Strebeigh's section to anyone who gets very fussed about grades - as I mentioned, getting an A on a paper from him is next to impossible.",
    "A stereotypical Ivy League English class, but effective at improving students' writing. It is more challenging than English 114 (the default that most students take) and definitely more stressful at times, but if you devote time to the class and take the professor's suggestions to heart, you will be fine. As a science person, I found it to be my most challenging course, but I always enjoyed class and know I benefited.",
    "Absolutely. Take this class, then take it again. A lot of work, but enjoyable work. Professor Strebeigh is amazing; I have never learned so much in a short period of time. The individual attention he shows is incredible, and I feel like much better writer after this class.",
    "i highly recommend this class",
    "Great class - definitely would recommend it."
