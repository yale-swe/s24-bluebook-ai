   "comments": [
    "Extremely disorganized, professor seems to assign grades arbitrarily, and has numerous readings as well as documentaries and entire movies that you have to watch. Not worth the immense amount of time and effort you put into the course only to receive poor marks. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. There are easier ways toearn a WR (and I didn't even take this course as a WR student).",
    "Great course, and a great way of fulfilling the writing credit. Karen is a funny, interesting lecturer and coming to class was very rarely a chore. Just beware that a lot of the assignments are based on (sometimes odd) creative writing, but you still needed to fully use the readings from that week. But I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have little knowledge of Japan.",
    "Yes take it. it's a great class. writings are fun. not too much work",
    "Here are some warnings: the WR section is a lot of work if you want a decent grade. On the WR and class papers, they want you to cite AS MANY READINGS AS POSSIBLE per assignment. I cited seven sources for a four-page paper and they said to use more!!! That said, if you aren't in the WR sections and don't do the readings your paper grades will be much worse because they care more about collecting facts from the readings than your own thoughts. Also, ask how grading is done early in the semester--what they posted online at first was misleading and in some ways wrong, and we found this out after the mid-term.",
    "I would totally recommend it. The weekly writing assignments aren't that long, and they're fully guided by the readings. The lecture notes are all online, which is super helpful. The content is very interesting, and it's a WR credit.",
    "This class takes some work, but it is usually enjoyable and you will come out with an unbelievable understanding of Japan. Lectures are interesting and Professor Nakamura is very dynamic. Sometimes the readings can be a bit tedious, but often give insight that cannot be gained from lectures alone. For the sections (required for WR credit), how enjoyable they are really depends on the TF, but the nearly weekly assignments are the same for everyone and not terribly difficult. I would recommend this class to someone looking for an alternative WR credit rather than an English class, although it is not any less work. I would strongly recommend this class to someone whois interested in learning about Japan.",
    "interesting class on an interesting set of material. the readings are good. the assignments (especially if you take the class for WR) are pretty much a waste of time but you will learn some interesting stuff and won't be too stressed by anything in the class so overall its worth taking.",
    "You have to take this class. you learn a lot and it isn't that hard.",
    "All about the writing so you dont need to go to lecture.... but the lectures are good so you probably want to go. If you have the right style, you can do well, but if they dont like your writing style, it is very difficult to get good grades. not as easy a writing credit as i thought it might be.",
    "Very broad overview of Japanese culture... a little shallow at times, and in depth on weird points, but not a bad class.",
    "A lot of people took this class for the writing credit. As far as writing credits go, there is less writing in this class than in an essay writing class or something. Papers are about 500 words long, and there is one each week. Then there are three major writing assignments that are from 1000-3000 words. There is a bit of leeway, where students can choose to omit a minor assignment or two.The lectures were interesting, but it was nice that since there was no final exam, just papers, one could miss a lecture and not be worried about having to catch up on missed notes.If you're looking for an easy writing credit, and like watching MXC, at least shop this course.",
    "A great survey of Japanese anthropology.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Japan and\/or want a writing credit. But way too many extra credit opportunities.",
    "take it if you wanna learn about contemporary Japan. Definitely worth it for me.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for an easy way to fulfill the writing requirement. It is a good introduction to some very basic ideas about Japan, but doesn't really give you any kind of indepth look.",
    "It's a pretty good WR choice. The material and readings are interesting and the work load isn't too bad.",
    "Insight of modern-day Japan how it is and isn't what many Americans think it represents - absolutely amazing. Interesting and thought-provoking, I'd recommend it to any student interested in Japan.",
    "A great class if you're interested in Japan. The lectures are divided into three modules - modern, dark, and cool Japan - so don't expect it to be all about anime, though that is a component. Professor Nakamura is a very entertaining lecturer, and this class is a good way to fulfill the social science requirement.",
    "This class helped us to get a better understanding of the changes that Japan went through from pre- to post- WWII. It helped us understand the social, culture, and economic aspects associated with such a powerful country and the steps it had to take to get there. I would recommend this class as a writing credit to all of my friends.",
    "Fun class. Interesting as long as you have some kind of interest in Japan. Lectures are great, not really got much content to them but easy to listen to. Definitely broadens your horizons. Great WR credit. And would be easiest class ever if taken non WR",
    "More work than you would expect. The weekly reading assignments and sections require you to read all of that week's readings. The writing assignments include many creative writing prompts which I had never done before and we were not given very much writing guidance for the assignments. The class seems more interesting than it actually is and you could probably find a better WR with the same amount of work or less.",
    "Quite a bit of reading and writing. Not too stressful. Three papers, first is 1,000 words, second is 2,500, third is 1,000. Weekly writing assignments of about 500 words each. You get to watch videos every week. Section is fun. The TAs are nice. You're graded more for your content and ideas than for writing style.Interesting look into Japan. The culture is very very different and I'm still confused after taking the class but definitely feel like I have a greater appreciation. I think to really understand Japan better, especially modern-day Japan, which is changing so fast, you really have to spend a summer or semester in Japan.",
    "Take it! I first had doubts about taking this class-the topics had little relevance to my major (biology) or my interests. However, the material is well presented, the writing assignments are easy and fun, and the teacher really takes in account student input. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale- has motivated me to learn more about Japan and to take more classes to get a better understanding of qualitative research and anthropological work. Also, if you need a writing credit, this would be a really good class to take- just don't expect your writing level to improve much.",
    "Yes, it is good as an introduction to anthropology and also to Japan. It helped me with writing and gave me good ideas for new perspectives to add to my senior thesis. Lectures were fluffy and you won't get much out of the class if you don't read, so don't take this class if that bothers you.",
    "I would recommend anth 254. It's a good introduction to the Japanese society, culture and values. It's a easy writing credit too.",
    "I thought it was very interesting and I learned a lot. I think if you are especially interested in Japan it would be a fantastic class. I was not before but now am.",
    "just ok material. but the creative writing assignments made it the BEST writing option. definitely take this class if you need a writing credit.",
    "Yes, if you find Japanese culture somewhat interesting. There are weekly assignments that aren't graded too easily. The three long papers are okay and it's nice that you have to hand in an outline first. It's a good and interesting class for WR credit, but you won't get too much feedback. The Prof. makes the lectures fun and she's flexible.",
    "Take the class, it's a great class.",
    "This class had a lot of reading, and the writing assignments were somewhat strange. I stressed out a lot about this class because I always felt like I was behind, but in the end it turned out to be okay. If you are looking for an easy WR, I wouldn't necessarily take this course. The material was interesting, but I feel like there are better ways to get the WR credit, perhaps by taking an intro writing\/lit course.",
    "This course is amazing. If you have any interest in Japan, then you must take this course! Professor Nakamura is an excellent lecturer, and I learned a lot despite having taking previous courses that covered related issues."
