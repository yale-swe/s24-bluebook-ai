   "comments": [
    "The material is interesting. Class is a mixture of so fast it's hard to keep up and really kind of boring at the same time, but DON'T FALL BEHIND. don't skip class or skip concepts because you'll come back to them later. You have to do the work, if you fall behind you will be left behind, not on purpose, but you just won't be able to catch up. Weekly problem sets, a midterm, a GIANT project, and a final. Get excited.",
    "A very difficult, specific class. I wouldn't recommend this class unless they have a specific interest in protein activity.",
    "Most BME majors have to take this class but don't fret, this class is perfectly manageable. Workload is generally fair. There's a weekly pset, a midterm, a project, and a final exam. The first midterm shouldn't be too bad as the concepts covered in the first half of the semester aren't as difficult as the second half's. The project is can be a bit of a doozy and will consume a lot of your time if you can't your system working. Matlab is required, so I would advise taking 249 before this class. I'm told, however, that they're thinking about phasing it out, so you might not have to worry about it. Overall, 351 was an interesting course that was pretty well taught! KMJ is a good lecturer who gives an organized overview of the material and is really accessible to students.",
    "This is a great core class of the BME major. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Required course. Not impossible. The project is really long and super finicky so its best to get it done early. Midterms aren't impossible but pretty hard and so are the psets. Definitely a lot of work and the material isn't the most riveting especially if you're not interested in kinetics and transport. Miller-Jensen cares a lot about making sure the students don't get way in over their heads, so definitely go to her if you need help.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "It's a great class, and KMJ teaches the material very well!",
    "If you're majoring in BME, you have to take this course. If not, you may want to consider again, because it is hard. Overall, it's a very interesting class, but there are a lot of derivations that your life may be easier without.",
    "Alright, so this is a really wonderful course. Professor Miller-Jensen is fantastic, both in and outside of class and is truly devoted to ensuring that you find the material both interesting and tractable. If you're BME, I'd recommend really trying to get into the class, because the material is really really fascinating and because it might not seem so ahead of time. If you're not BME, I'd really recommend taking this course simply in general, but specifically if you're interested in achieving a more mathematical\/quantitative\/fundamental understanding of biology, including mass transport, protein-ligand binding, enzyme kinetics, and so on. 0 complaints about this class. Take it!",
    "If you take this, just go to section frequently to ask questions, take good notes in class, and you should be fine. It is actually quite enjoyable and gives you good applied math skills.",
    "BENG 351 is probably the best of the required classes for BME majors. KMJ is very nice and the material is challenging but doable. Aside from the group project, it's also a totally manageable amount of work. On the whole - a great survey into the kinetics of biological system.s"
