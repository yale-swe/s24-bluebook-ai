   "comments": [
    "On midterm, one little mistake resulted in relatively high point substraction",
    "strengths - great crash course in data management and analysis through SAS, very practical",
    "Supposedly useful for internships, but as I will be using SPSS on my internship, pretty pointless. Lectures were extremely long, conflicted with all other classes I wanted to take, and I certainly would not have taken it if I was not required to.",
    "Very good SAS class.",
    "Great course! I feel very confident about handling data now. Although i recognize the importance of cleaning and preparing data, I only wish we had gone through that part of the course faster so we could spend more time on analysis.",
    "Strengths: the course is necessaryWeaknesses: the course is difficult to understand",
    "this was a very challenging course but overall i learned a lot about sas that will be useful!",
    "Tough but totally necessary.",
    "strengths: it started from the very beginning of SAS. This is good for students who need a dummy-proof introduction to the software.weakness: The class should meet twice a week so the lecture wouldn't be so dense.",
    "Absolutely crucial in order to learn programming and writing SAS code. The added benefit was that we were shown how SAS output translates into table shells and typical write ups. He explained a lot of the theory behind many of the statistical tests we use, as well as giving us concise instructions as to how to interpret the results.",
    "You will learn SAS by hook or by crook.",
    "Excellent.",
    "Very clear! Very practical. Lab was very helpful",
    "Great approach to SAS and between lectures and labs you really learn how to apply it.weaknesses: none.",
    "very, very useful",
    "This course is excellent. Mayur is a great teacher and I wouldn't change the course. The only potential change that I suggest is to to separate the course into a 2*week lecture since 2 hours in a row of SAS can be a bit much especially at the end of the day.",
    "Data Management is a useful course for gaining experience with SAS. The labs are very helpful. I found it difficult to learn, however, from the lectures. The lecture notes provided useful reference materials, but it is hard to absorb information on programming methods during a 2 hour lecture.",
    "Lectures are very clear and well organized. Labs were extremely helpful. This class taught me the logic behind SAS. Now I feel like I know how to tell SAS what to do to make it do what I want, instead of having to rely on being spoon-fed the code.",
    "I would do away with the lecture portion of the course and have two labs a week instead. That would be really, really helpful. One lab could teach us how to do the material, and the next lab we would have to program the same material on our own. We could come in before class with it done or program in class. That would help prepare everyone for the daunting tests.",
    "great course and every student should have it",
    "Great class, very useful",
    "Mayur is awesome. Learn more from labs than from class. In fact, could skip class altogether.",
    "i would have liked more time on mediational analysis. more information on full and partial mediation. also more training on analyzing moderated mediation and mediated moderation that are gaining popularity in the literature.Also sample size calculations when surveys are used.",
    "It is a must. This class puts it all together... from how to turn the computer on up to how to choose the appropriate variables for you model!!",
    "By far most useful class- even if the most challenging- I have taken at YSPH so far. Actually learned how to do something that might be useful in my career!",
    "Strengths- Dr Desai is very thorough and exciting.Weakness- My TA was good, but he moved through the labs too quickly.",
    "Overall, students develop a broad skill set related to SAS programming.",
    "Incredibly useful course when taken before summer research\/internship. Strengths include the lectures (the slides are thorough and coherent) and the professor (Desai was able to mold an inherently mundane subject into something interesting.)",
    "Excellent. Made SAS understandable and fun.",
    "The course is obviously a wonderful one. SAS is a great skill to learn. I really enjoyed it. I can't think of any weaknesses. Strengths: SAS is a tool which I think every MPH graduate should be able to use. The course ensures you learn what you need to know about SAS.",
    "This was my favorite course of the entire semester. Not only did we learn core concepts about data management but we learned so much SAS. I loved it! This was precisely what I wanted biostats 1 and 2 to be, but not what happened. This class was challenging, and we covered a great deal; Prof. Desai recognized that we had covered concepts, but never did I feel what that there was overlap because his version was either (a) more through and\/or (b) more detailed\/more SAS\/more fun. This could also be that I'm extremely math\/data oriented. Especially given that my summer internship is going to require a lot of data management skills, this is truly the only class that I think will have a practical effect. This also disappoints me because I wish there were more classes like this during the first year.This course should be moved to fall semester. Biostat can fuse into one course. Dr. Desai should teach some version like Data Management II second semester where we get into it further\/other programs. That would have been so useful.",
    "The course is incredibly helpful in that it leaves the student with an overall proficiency in using SAS to perform data analysis. The course also served as an excellent complement to biostatistics by providing a second opportunity to review and employ each of the main biostatistical methods. All students are forced to work their way through the assignments and exams which really is the best way to master the material and practice self reliance.",
    "The labs were really helpful. the lectures were just too long. it was so hard to pay attention.",
    "The class is a necessary evil that is taught in the most amicable way possible. I learned a great deal and am much more comfortable with SAS as a result. It may not have been the most interesting class, but it is by far the most useful one I have taken this year.",
    "This class actually teaches students how to use SAS and how to analyze and clean data. In my other two stats classes I never learned SAS to the extent that I learned it in Data Mgmt.",
    "I liked this class a lot and found it very useful to learn SAS in a context of real data analysis. The labs were helpful and the exams forced us to really learn the material. The only real weakness I can think of was that the lecture was somewhat dry at times, but I think that is mostly because SAS and data management are somewhat difficult to talk about in an engaging manner.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester! What I appreciated most about this course was the opportunity to build a practical skill set for data analysis.",
    "This is a great course to learn SAS. A 2 hour weekly lecture is not necessary, the labs were enough to understand the key points. This course should be more hands-on and less lecture-based.",
    "I very much enjoyed this class because it was very applicable. You get a little bit of exposure to SAS in the Biostatistics classes, but it was in this class that I really LEARNED SAS! I learned skills in this class that I will be using in my internship to clean and analyze data, opening the door for me to publish articles - without those skills, these opportunitites might now have been available. The one drawback to this course was the lecture time - Wednesday from 3-5 PM - this was at the end of a very long day of class and two more hours of lecture made it hard to concentrate and really absorb the new material.",
    "This was a great course. I feel that I am far more competent with SAS than when I began. This course is really great for getting practical experience especially in preparation for the internship and further work.",
    "The course taught me a great deal of SAS. While there was not a whole lot of \"in class\" time, a great deal of time was spent completing labs and exams.",
    "This is a very dry, boring class, but it taught me how to use SAS much more thoroughly than did Biostats I and II. The midterm and final were appropriately challenging and engaging, and, dare I say it, I enjoyed them.",
    "Great course but quite repetitive. There is an extraordinary amount of crossover with Biostats 2.",
    "Really helpful and great class. Really difficult midterm and final - challenging but fair.",
    "Great course for understanding how to utilize SAS in a very relevant approach. Excellent instruction and very well organized",
    "Excellent. You really learn how to use SAS in this course.",
    "The lectures were clearly laid out to learn the material. The topics covered were very helpful in the structure of internship data and analysis.",
    "NOTHING. ITS A GREAT COURSE",
    "This course is very useful for future study",
    "Fantastic course that is taught by a great professor. The course provides students with the fundermentals of SAS and in my opinion, it should be one of the first courses students as it gives a good foundation.",
    "Excellent and very practical course. I finally feel like I can program in SAS. The homework was very useful and the tests were fair.",
    "excellent and challenging",
    "Good TA, very useful class, required much more work than any other class I took this semester",
    "One weakness is that the student must be willing to teach his or herself the material.",
    "Not a fan of SAS, but the course was incredibly helpful.",
    "Very important and useful class. I would recommend it to all public health students and believe it should be a requirement.",
    "Excellent course!"

He is brilliant but unassuming and empathetic to the plight of the SAS everyman and incipient epidemiologist.He really knows how to motivate the students to become SAS regulars ... and to eventually make more breakthroughs than breakdowns in SAS.Dr Desai motivates us because he earns our respect through:(1) his meticulous preparations(2) his spirited, lucid, and engaging presentations (tremendous variety of relevant, public health examples of using SAS in epi detective work, including some of his own accomplished investigations at the CDC)(3) his unmatched dedication to helping students who come asking questions (yours truly included) and always treating them with cordiality, dignity, and scholarly precisionWith his luminous mind and smile, and with his proven record of moving in and out of so many important epi research areas so adeptly ... Desai is a daily inspiration ... a virtual Renaissance man ... and, perhaps most importantly, a tremendous teacher who is a singularly glue-it-all-together figure for many of his students, past and present -- including practicing physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, leaders in the field of infectious-disease research, and pharmaceuticals.Long live, Dr Desai!",

Unreasonable in expectations of students and encouraged rote memorization rather than understanding. Although labs were stated to be collaborative on the syllabus (with only write-ups; aka summaries as individual effort), she did not show understanding of this concept.

    "this is a difficult class and takes up a lot of time (midterm and final) but is necessary for a career in pubic health if youare ever going to do data analysis (which most of us will!)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially for students that do not have prior SAS experience. This class is an excellent introduction to the software and gives a step by step description of the basics.",
    "I think it is crucial that every student takes this course if they are going to be doing any sort of statistical analysis. It totally clears up all of the questions looming from Stats I.Would've been even more helpful if there were two lectures a week, just so that we would've been 100% comfortable with the material - sometimes it seemed rather rushed, especially since we cancelled three lectures, and it only meets once a week.",
    "Take it with all your might.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone as I feel I finally learned SAS in this class (with no prior SAS knowledge). This class is very helpful.",
    "If you need to know how to use SAS, take this course ... and then you can you can go forward with some confidence on how to continue to build your SAS skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend. Good intro to SAS and practical for research",
    "Highly recommended intro to SAS.",
    "Only take this course if you have to use SAS for thesis project or other reason.",
    "the most useful class I have taken yet",
    "This course is \"SAS: a how-to guide\"",
    "I would recommend this course for building skills in SAS. There is a lot of overlap with Biostat and Epi, but this is the one I would keep for developing programming abilities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it is great for learning SAS.",
    ".",
    "Absolutely recommend, esp. for students w\/a choice between Epi II and Data Mgt. Epi II is easier but Data Mgt is a much more useful class!",
    "Highly recommend. Good for acquiring sas skills.Good workload. Good structure.",
    "If you want to learn all the basics of SAS coding and data analysis, this course is ideal - definitely a must before the summer.",
    "A Haiku:First I hated SASThen came Data ManagementNow, \"Hey SAS, what's up?\"True story. SAS was awful in biostats, now it's actually a lot of fun. Dr. Desai breaks everything down into simple, easy to understand steps, and teaches you a \"cookbook\" style of coding that really helps you keep a handle on things. Lectures are very helpful, and actually fun. The labs are a great help in practicing the skills so that when the midterm and final roll around, you're very well-prepared. One of the best, and most practical, courses I've taken at EPH.",
    "I recommend this course. Like I previously stated, SAS is a tool which every MPH should be able to use and use well. Dr Desai makes it easy to learn because the course is structured in a 'cookbook' format.",
    "Great course. It was challenging and SAS-centric. My favorite course by far of this first year, and Dr. Desai teaches it, and he's one of my favorite instructors at this point. You will walk away with tools\/program techniques that you will see yourself using in the very near future.",
    "Excellent course for anyone who plans to use SAS in the future. Enhances practical skills and gives you the tools to do your own research - excellent for thesis preparation.",
    "The midterm and the final are super tough and they take forever. It is almost impossible to do well in this class.",
    "This course teaches students to take a data set and clean it, code variables, and run statistical analysis on the data. It is by far one of the most useful classes that I have taken here at YSPH, and I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially one that may be collecting their own data for their thesis or for a summer internship.",
    "Data Management and Analysis deals with using SAS software to organize and statistically analyze large sets of survey data. The subject matter isa bit dry, but overall it teaches useful skills applicable to, and useful for, anyone working with SAS.",
    "This course is immensely valuable in solidifying theoretical knowledge of statistical analysis as well as building a practical skill set in SAS. This course will be useful in any career in public health.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is helpful in learning how to use SAS to perform statistical analyses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I know some students have a choice between taking this course and Epi II - and personally, I think this course is more applicable to all kinds of research. Dr. Desai is an awesome instructor and the course is challenging, but very useful.",
    "This is an excellent course in data management. you will learn SAS very well and feel confident in performing statistical analyses and constructing questionnaires in a logical and data management-friendly manner. I would definitely recommend this course, especially in preparation for summer internships.",
    "An excellent way to become more familiar with SAS.",
    "This class is dry and tedious at times, but it will teach you how to use SAS. The weekly labs, midterm, and final are totally reasonable--appropriately engaging and challenging but not overwhelming.",
    "Very informative and practical but repetitive.",
    "Yes! This class is essential to understanding SAS, and to working on thesis data.",
    "Great course. A must take for any serious epidemiologists.",
    "Learning how to use SAS to analyze a variety of data. Reinforces SAS skills learned in biostats.",
    "I found this course extremely helpful in organization and the analysis of data sets provided in public health settings. The class is a real world application of the biostatistical analysis learned in other classes.",
    "YES FOR SURE. A VERY USEFUL COURSE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE IN THE BIOSTATS TRACK",
    "A must take course in YSPH! Highly recommended",
    "Take this course. Absolutely.",
    "Useful but a lot of work",
    "I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "very important and would require everyone to take it",
    "Yes, if you are comfortable with SAS.",
    "Absolutely! The best course I have taken at Yale!"
