    "Take this course. The workload isn't too bad and the teacher is fantastic.",
    "This class has a lot of work for a freshman seminar. The amount of reading is overwhelming, and there are four quizzes that resemble midterms on top of two papers (a midterm paper and a final). The benefit is that this class is basically a crash course on cancer and after getting through the readings and testing, you gain a wealth of information and a new outlook on how to view news regarding new medicines.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about cancer or just some genetics and biology in general. It was definitely one of my favorite courses this semester.",
    "if the subject interests you, you should take it, but beware there is a lot more science than expected in this course",
    "For me as mentioned before, the structure of class and lack of emphasis on the science of cancer were my major turnoffs from the class. However I found the material to be for the most part interesting and engaging.",
    "This class is a mixture of original studies and news reports that discuss the history of cancer, basically. Some days the class was intensely focused on the science behind cancer, and others not so much. The readings were a bit much, and generally repetitive. The readings were so extensive that it was hard to find time to actually digest what you just learned, so I feel that I really did not learn as much about cancer as I had hoped in this class. However, what you do learn is pretty interesting. If you do take this class, the \"quizzes\" are practically hour long tests, or midterms, if you will, and therefore you should prepare for them as such. Honestly, I highly recommend that you do not take this class. As a disclaimer though, there were some people in our class who really loved it, so I would say go for shopping period, as what you see there is basically what you'll get the rest of the semester, and decide then. It really depends on the person, I suppose."
