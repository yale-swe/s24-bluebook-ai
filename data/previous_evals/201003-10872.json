    "I'd recommend that undergraduates take this course earlier than their senior years so that they can pursue more opportunities in artificial intelligence while at Yale, whether through research or other courses.",

    "If you want to know what AI is all about, take this course. If you want to build a huge project and need to know-how, this course is not for you.I would definitely recommend this course to anyone since it gives the students a very broad perspective and works well in kindling interest in the field.",
    "Yes. In this course, not only will you learn and implement interesting algorithms like minimax and GA, but also you will gain a big picture about the whole field."
