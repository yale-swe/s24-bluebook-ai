   "comments": [
    "I gained a very in-depth understanding of the process that a new musical undergoes from conception to putting it on its feet. I got a lot of insight into the writing process, the directing process, and how these components come together to make the musical happen. I also learned a lot about a very interesting community, which gave me more insight into the themes and emotions of the work itself.",
    "This course taught a lot about musical theater structure, the Amish, and how much work (and how many people) it takes to really put on a good show.",
    "Coming to this seminar as someone with less experience in musical theater (and who doesn't want to go into it professionally) made it an incredibly fruitful learning experience. There were all kinds of lessons about the craft of acting, choreography, and ensemble singing, but the entire course was a lesson in teamwork and drive--in how to execute an exhausting and encompassing project while always maintaining the joy!",
    "How to develop an original musical in a professional environment",
    "I began to learn what it takes to write and stage a brand new (good) musical.",
    "I have never learned more in a Yale College course than in this class. This is largely due to the tireless work of Professor Annette Jolles. I will never be able to fully thank her and Dan Egan and the Shen Curriculum for organizing this class and giving each of the 24 students enrolled a thoroughly life-changing experience. This is what professional theater can and should look like -- Annette is a wildly competent, perseverant, passionate and highly consummate professional, and she has been a guiding light to those lucky enough to follow her lead through this process.",
    "How to structure a new musical, the process of new musical development, every angle of musical production",
    "This course taught me how to be think critically about the development of a musical from both and actor and a writer's perspective. This course puts up a brand new student written show in just one semester so it is extremely time sensitive. This included the need for fast memorization and diligent work in the room.",
    "What goes into the creation of a new musical, how to do various tech-y things (like hang lights), probably the highest level of collaboration I've seen in any Yale course",
    "I learned more about the development and creation of a musical than I could have in any other setting. I learned valuable skills for the professional world.",
    "Practical skills regarding the creation of a new musical as well as studying the musical theater canon. Deep knowledge of the Amish faith.",
    "I learned a good deal about the process of creating a brand new musical, about the Amish religion\/culture, and I developed my skills as a performer in general.",
    "Incredible experience. Improved my acting and performing abilities. Got to work on a cool project.",
    "Truly inestimable growth took place for me in this class. I learned about the craft of assembling a musical from scratch, establishing flow in a theatrical performance, making an audience feel secure and landing surprises, creating a world that an audience can walk into etc. The fact of learning these things through the experience of putting on a musical rather than simply talking about putting on a musical meant that they are in my bones, that I can apply them to all of my art making in all forms."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would have liked to spend more class time discussing the intersections of the culture we were studying and the themes woven into the show, as well as get even more insight into the creative process of developing the show. Instead, we unfortunately had to spend our class time staging the show because it was such a large project that required us to utilize as many hours as possible to make it happen. I'd say the only way this course would be able to encompass everything is if it is for a much smaller-scale project -- maybe a one act show or something like that.",
    "This course takes up a lot of time, but is worth it. At the beginning it was a bit rough because we didn't really know what it would look like, but over the course of the semester it gained form and became more fun. I think it could be improved by having more time? Or the same amount of time spread over more of the week. It just felt very concentrated and there wasn't much to do between classes.",
    "Putting on a new musical requires a high level of commitment from the entire team. The format of a production seminar necessitates that commitment--it allowed us to put on the best product we possibly could while also facilitating a really close-knit community. The best seminars are often also the most intensive, and this is absolutely no exception. That is also, however, where the weaknesses lay. The seminar was a deeper time commitment than most of us were prepared for, it required us to prioritize the production over our other classes and extracurricular commitments, and the tech process was the most extensive I've ever been a part of. I wouldn't have traded it for anything, but people should know what they're getting into at the start of the term. Also, the class time was not always used as efficiently as it could have been--because we were sorting of improvising as we got new material, there were often moments where our time was not being used as productively as it could have been.",
    "Strengths: working on Rumspringa was the most professional and organized theater experience I have ever been a part of. If you have the chance to take a class with Annette, do it!!! The professionalism and dedication of the students and prod team was inspiring Weakness: the prod team didnt have as much to do in the beginning of the semester",
    "Its a production seminar, so everything depends on who is in the class and what role they have. Annette is great.",
    "Being surrounded by so many brilliant people all at once. Though, a four-hour class block is sometimes exhausting.",
    "Depending on your role, this class either is a ton of work or almost no work. I wish there was better balance. Also, it was a high stress environment.",
    "The rehearsal room should not be Rosenfeld Hall. It is impossible for a musical to rehearse in. Unclear what the fix is, but perhaps it could factor into all students grades to aid with set painting.",
    "I think this is a really wonderful type of class, an incredibly unique opportunity, and ought to be continued in the future. The process though sometimes challenging provided wonderful insight into the process of making a modern musical. The only thing Id improve upon would be making sure that everyone was working all the time during class meetings.",
    "An amazing opportunity for anyone who wants to be an artist. Tricky because the expectation for some was that the time commitment would be that of a class, rather than that of a musical."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking a course with Annette if you have any interest in theatrical performance because she is the hardest worker I have ever encountered and she is BRILLIANT. She's an incredible person to learn from. I learned so much from her work ethic and also understanding how she thinks. I feel very lucky to have gotten to watch her work.",
    "Sure. There is a big time commitment, which makes sense. This is not necessarily an acting class. It is a creating a musical class. It's fun and people really enjoyed the final product, which was a great final feeling",
    "Definitely--if the student has a good sense of the commitment it takes. I had a less intense academic semester this fall, so I was ready to really give my all to the course. But there were a lot of students who felt duped by the time commitment and that really hindered their engagement. I would also make sure that the writing team and product is one you believe in. The thrill of performing a new show that you really love is unmatched--the course would have been a lot less enjoyable if I had done it with people I trusted less than the writers we had. Be discerning! Ask questions about the content and commitment! But lean into it--this experience was incredible.",
    "Definitely! The production seminars directed by Annette are a truly unique experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking a class with Annette. I would also recommend taking a production seminar, but make sure that you prioritize it in your schedule.",
    "If there is ever to be another production seminar offered and you're a person interested in pursuing theater in any capacity, you must enroll in it should you get the chance.",
    "Yes! Annette is brilliant.",
    "Absolutely. This is an all-time favorite experience in theater and at Yale for myself and many others. It is a lot of work but it is worth it.",
    "Yes, because it's a very cool opportunity to see a new work from start to finish.",
    "Absolutely. There is nothing like working on a world premiere of a new musical helmed by a professional like Annette.",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely! Though only to people greatly interested in making musical theater. Otherwise, you might find yourself in over your head.",
    "Yes - take it if you have the chance!",
    "Production seminars are some of the most valuable educational opportunities offered to Yale students. If you have the chance, you simply must participate."
