    "DS will change your life!",
    "This course consists of effective study of foundational historical and political thought and demands rigorous critical thinking - at least Professor Slanski's section does, I cannot speak to the other sections. Her criticisms result in significant improvements to writing style and ability.",
    "A very demanding and richly inspiring seminar on how to read history and history itself. Recommended for students who need academic discipline.",
    "Slanski is tough, in terms of grading and otherwise; some grow to love her, other don't. Whichever of the two will happen, her \"So what?\" in response to your thesis will ring in your ears long after you have written your last essay. The good thing is that she will go past the baby steps and delve straight into the good stuff in the essential works of history and politics within the Western Canon, which might allegedly not be the case for all sections.",
    "Yes. Especially if you can get Prof. Slanski.",
    "The course gives one a decent awareness of the western political tradition. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in the humanities, but not any one specific discipline of the humanities. It may provide inspiration for one to delve into a certain subject more in depth.",
    "H&P has some of the best reading of fall semester but is also probably the most difficult, both in the reading and the kinds of essays you have to write. Or at least for Professor Slanski's section. Professor Slanski is one of the most demanding DS professors, and you should really think about what you want out of your semester before taking her. That is, because she is also an excellent professor, perhaps the best on the fall faculty. She just has high standards, in your essays and class discussions. For the serious student though, she is a must have. Our class was initially really intimidated by her, but grew to love her more and more. She is an extremely motherly person and a few times even brought Dunkin Donuts to class - much appreciated by stressed college freshmen. Professor Slanski is as great a guide through the fall semester classics as can be, if you're up to the challenge.",
    "Your Directed Studies History essay on Herodotus will likely be your first ever essay at Yale. And with Professor Slanski, you're likely to receive a scare. SO WHAT? You'll need a thesis with pith, meaning, and gumption. But in the end--you'll learn so much. And you will love this professor.",
    "I think Directed Studies is not for everyone: it's a really challenging program and the readings - especially in History& Politics - are somewhat tough and time-consuming. That said, if you're willing to dedicate to this program, I would definitely recommend it! DS History and Politics is an extraordinary class: the material is extremely interesting and the discussions in class were always thought-provoking and inspiring. And TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR SLANSKI! You won't regret it! She is a tough grader, but she really prompted me to improve my writing and critical thinking skills."
