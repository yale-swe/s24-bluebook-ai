    "Mathematical Logic was, in my opinion, the ideal type of Yale course! Though the material itself is very challenging, Sun-Joo's lectures, the very well-designed (and few!) homework assignments, and section really came together to help students of all levels of experience grasp these proofs. Though the homework assignments were challenging, they never felt tedious, unnecessary, or unfair. Instead, they were a really helpful way to force us to really grapple with the material. Sun-Joo is also one of the very best professors I've had at Yale!!! In addition to being unbelievably smart and very competent at conveying information, she is really really caring and really wants her students to understand the material. She's also hilarious! I will definitely be taking any other classes I can with her in the future. Also, first order logic is DEF not a real prereq--very few people in the class had taken it (I hadn't), and I really don't think it would have been helpful. Sun-Joo is also very committed to making the class accessible to people with varying levels of experience with logic, so as long as you're really interested in the material, it's worth taking!! In terms of workload, though there is very little quantity work (one pset every 2 or 3 weeks + one big final pset, no midterm, no final), it IS challenging and the psets take a good amount of time\/thought.",
    "The material in this class is fascinating, and you should definitely take it. Start it Credit\/D\/F because the grading can be surprisingly rough. Unclear if there will be an upward curve for final grades. You emerge from this class enlightened.",
    "If you are a math major you will be bored for the entire semester.",
    "Mathematical logic is a class I would definitely recommend. I'm not sure that the material is especially useful, but it can be interesting, and the class is a great way to improve your proof-writing skills. The class has no exams (only problem sets), which is awesome!! The problem sets are always fair. I was very happy I took this course because with no exams, it was a very low-stress class.",
    "Mathematical Logic is a class with a very specific, narrow goal that it wants to achieve, and it does so beautifully. The entire course is about giving you, piece-by-piece, the tools that one needs to prove Godel's Completeness Theorem for first-order logic. Sun-Joo does a wonderful job showing how each of the small details in the material, which can often get quite technical, fits into the overall scope of what we were trying to do. PHIL 115 is listed as a prerequisite, but is actually not all that helpful here since the class is all about stepping outside of the logical system that you worked with in 115 and, from the outside looking in, justifying our use of the system. Logic does not really become of philosophical interest until you take 267, which gives you a hint of the broader import and issues surrounding the systems to which 115 introduces you. Sun Joo, with her keen insight and wonderful sense of humor, is the ideal person for those looking to take that philosophical step.",
    "If you take 267, you will have a deeper understanding of satisfaction (\"truth\") and deducibility, their relationship, and why they are equivalent for first order logic. The class gets quite technical mathematically towards the middle of the course, so don't be fooled by the beginning. The course encourages a deeper understanding of logic than just \"oh, well obviously that makes sense,\" and for the mathematics inclined it is not very difficult. The problem sets are on the easy side in terms of length and difficulty for a math major, but probably a bit harder for people not used to that type of homework. It is a useful class to have taken.",
    "If you are interested in logic or the foundations of math, this class will give you a solid background. It builds up to the completeness and soundness theorems of first order logic (and the sequal class, which can actually be taken before this, covers the incompleteness theorem and the topic of computability). Ptrofessor Shin is a wonderful lecturer and all-around great person to talk to get to know, which is half the appeal of the class. I can't speak for people coming at it from the philosophy side of things, but as a someone with a decently strong math background I found the class also required very little work.",
    "If you are prepared to put in a nontrivial amount of work, you will get so much more out of this class than an understanding of Mathematical Logic. This course really changed my entire thought-process."
