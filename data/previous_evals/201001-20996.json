   "comments": [
    "That it's a great course! I would definitely recommend it to any student who is interested in French cultural history - even if they're not doing that area as part of their concentration.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class especially from a historiographical standpoint. This class was very useful to me because I learned all the important names in French history as well as a few up-and-coming historians. I also learned about the changing trends in the study of modern French history.",
    "The course provides a very good overview of some of the most interesting stuff in the field of modern French history. In a course with such a broad scope it is inevitable that some things will be of more interest to each student than others, but the course generally strikes a good balance between political, social, and cultural history. What is equally useful is the frequent discussions of more meta historical topics, such as how to write a book, how to frame research questions within a historiographical debate, etc.This course is a must-take for students of modern French history, and certainly interesting for ones interested in European history more generally.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who want to develop a better sense of how historians have constructed French history."
