    "No. There are many more interesting courses out there.",
    "Professor Chin is the reason to take this course - the material is also interesting, and I'm glad I got to read the Analects and Mencius, etc., but",
    "It's a good class, but the class seems to cover too much in one semester. i found it impossible to completely absorb all the Confucian texts and readings we had throughout the semester, but it was overall a good class. Definitely a good way to broaden your perspective on history and life and human experience, especially if you are only used to the western system of thoughts.2 short papers and 1 final paper.",
    "Take it.",
    "This is very much an intellectual history class: you read a lot of interesting works spanning a huge chunk of time without much context. The essays are more like philosophy papers than your usual history research papers (basically, DS-style). Discussion was usually interesting, and the writings on the syllabus were really fascinating. All in all, a decent course, but if this were one of only two seminars you took before writing your senior essay, you might be in trouble, because it wasn't particularly helpful for learning how to do history research."
