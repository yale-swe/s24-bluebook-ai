    "The nuances of trying to create coherent narratives out of material evidence or the lack thereof. The very productive discussions by scholars working at sites across the globe.",
    "The course focused on some theories of urbanism and introduced different examples of archaeology of cities. The materials were very interesting, and we covered a variety of sites. It was a good introduction to the archaeology of urbanism, and one could have developed a fair theoretical background on urbanism if he\/she spent additional hours, but just doing the course left me with just an introduction, meaning a pretty vague understanding of it. It was very enjoyable though."

   "comments": [
    "I think the structure of the course could be improved. We looked at a variety of examples, and the theories did not quite come into the picture. The examples were very interesting, but because the examples varied so much, it was hard to think in a structured way. I think it would be helpful if the articles were organized not just in terms of themes but within a theoretical framework."

   "comments": [
    "This was an interesting survey of a bunch of sites that have somehow contributed to the discussion on what urbanism looks like in the archaeological record. There's also discussion of more recent technologies and what they offer. It's probably best to have a region of interest going in, otherwise you'll find yourself randomly picking a site to do your presentation\/project proposal on (which is fine, you'll learn some cool things about that site too!).",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in urbanism, but bear in mind that it is a course on urbanism, meaning that we cover a lot of different sites. It sometimes is frustrating when we don't have the background knowledge in certain areas. Since it is a course on certain lifestyle, I felt that theories were really the key to tie all the examples together, but the course was organized in a different way. It was still very fun and intriguing to engage in discussions however."
