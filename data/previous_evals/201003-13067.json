    "Overall, a pretty good class. Discussions could be dull at times but the material was very interesting. Professor Weiss is very knowledgeable about the state and society relations, but doesn't introduce enough of this knowledge to the class.",
    "Very focused on the relationship between the government and the people, including the history of conflict between the two (from Tiananmen to the present). Different aspects are covered, such as nationalism, urbanization, and the prospects for political change.Discussion in class is not always very engaging, but that's more a result of the students not contributing than of the professor. Professor Weiss asks very interesting questions throughout the course.If you are interested in learning more about where China stands now from a more than media perspective, this is a good course.",
    "Recommended, especially if you're interested in China. Very informative, and discussions are good (though the best I've ever had). Certainly better than average as far as classes I've taken.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who is interested in China, but probably not a good class to take if you haven't formally studied China before.",
    "Take it if you're interested in China, it'll get you asking the right questions for future study.",
    "Good class to take only if you are interested in the topic.",
    "Don't take it. You WILL NOT enjoy it. If you have been to China, you will not learn anything new. If you have never been to China, you will not learn anything new either. Take some other class on modern China instead, you will learn more."
