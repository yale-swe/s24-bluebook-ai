    "Take this class! Joan is the best. She's a great lecturer and is super passionate about these topics. Going to class is always really interesting. The second half of the class is all student presentations, which is chill. There's not much work, and the work you end up doing is actually pretty cool.Lots of your grade is based on a 30ish minute presentation you have to do, which can seem intimidating to non-public speakers. If you're worried about this, don't be. The class is relaxed and low energy and even though I can be nervous about public speaking I felt fine in this class.Highly recommended.",
    "If this class is being offered, definitely take it! I was hesitant at first because of the pre-reqs, but Prof. Feigenbaum tailored the level to suit the background of the class. She is incredibly smart and a great teacher. The workload is fair: weekly readings, midterm, presentation, final. The schedule is perfect for older students looking for less weekly work and more long term. This class is very interesting and (at least for my year) attracted a great group of people, many of whom were not CS majors. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "This was a fantastic course, and absolutely my favorite Comp Sci class at Yale. The material struck a good balance between content survey and technical depth, covering quite a range of interesting topics (Copyright, philosophies of online identity, internet censorship, cryptography, NSA surveillance technologies, online Certification Authorities, et cetera). The second half of the class was run through student presentations, and this method worked really well.I also appreciated the moderate workload. The assignments are just readings, two exams and a presentation. The exams were quite fair and the class discussions were intriguing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Great course. Take it. Material is incredibly relevant, everyone has great thoughts on privacy and security. Learned a ton."
