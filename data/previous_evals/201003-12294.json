   "comments": [
    "I liked the class. The work and tests were both fair and manageable. The plays were pretty entertaining as well. Fisher is a good professor; he is forthright and engaging. Class was usually spent discussing Roman comedy in general and very little time was spent on the texts. The discussions were usually interesting, but I often left class unsure about what we had really learned and accomplished. I would have liked a little more focus on the plays themselves.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student. It's super chill and the material is really interesting.",
    "This class looks at the form and history of Roman Comedy and its place in the ancient world as well as today. Translation is completed at home and discussed in class alongside sight-translations. It is recommended for students with an already strong background in latin.",
    "This class was fantastic. Only take it if you are comfortable with Latin and are fine reading the vast majority of the texts independently. Besides that, however, it is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Roman comedy is, no surprise, a lot of fun to read. It's raunchy and silly, and that sort of reading is mostly why i'm in the classics major. Jay is great, but make sure you like his teaching style. Classes were about an hour of him talking about whatever comes to mind, and a few minutes of in class translation. You're welcome to participate, but he can easily fill twelve weeks of classes with his thoughts on a-z. There's not a lot to hold you accountable for translation until test time, so be conscious of that if you're not intrinsically motivated."
