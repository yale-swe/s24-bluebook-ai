   "comments": [
    "If you enjoyed 230, take 231! Prof. Hadari is amazing and the workload is slightly less in the second semester.",
    "Quoting Hadari: \"This course should really just be called 'Math.'\" The course description of course says Linear Algebra + Vector Calculus, but (at least with Hadari), we covered a lot of other material as well, e.g. Mayer-Vietoris sequence, De Rham Cohomology and the Poincare Lemma, etc. Problem sets are about the same as 230 (so up to 10 hours a week, depending on when you start it). The material covered (in the book) includes Quadratic Forms, Integration (a homework assignment has you characterize all Riemann Integrable functions), and Differential Forms. Everything is more natural in the language of forms. Overall a great class with a great professor - advice: go to class! Oh, and from what I've heard, this as a coreq with Physics 260 doesn't make much sense; we didn't cover any applications, which is great for some people, not so much for others.",
    "It is a must-take for mathematics majors!",
    "As Hadari has probably already explained, this is the integration half of the course. If you've taken 230, you will already know if this class is for you. However, don't take this class unless you've completed 230 in the same year.That said, this semester is much easier than the first semester simply because the material doesn't get any harder. Rather, you've just gotten better at math. 231 will guide you through some of the most exciting problems in analysis: Poincare's lemma, General Stokes' Theorem, De Rham cohomology and the Mayer Vietoris sequence, and so many others.Get ready for another intense and awesome semester!",
    "Math 231 is tough, though not quite as much work as 230. The concepts are a bit more abstract than those in 230, but the sheer workload, though still large, definitely felt more manageable. If you made it through 230, just power through 231 as well. You'll get a lot out of this course, and the bigger ideas you start developing in 230 are fully realized in 231. Even though the class is a ton of work, at the end of the year, part of you will want it to continue. It's that good",
    "If you survived Math 230 and enjoyed the class I would absolutely encourage you to take Math 231. The course becomes even more interesting and rewarding and prepares you further for the other math classes at Yale. It even has slightly less work than Math 230 (though not that much less).",
    "If you are thinking about this class, you have probably taken MATH230 last semester, so you know what you are getting. We got through a lot of cool stuff in math such as differential forms and cohomology. This class for me was still a huge time commitment, but it was actually not as time-consuming as MATH230. The psets were shorter (at times a lot shorter), but the concepts were harder to grasp, and I felt the problems to be somewhat more difficult, compared with 230.",
    "An in-depth, integrated approach to multivariable calculus and linear algebra taught at an entirely rigorous and theoretical level. Many excursions into other fields of math: topology, algebra (group theory), graph theory, etc. Few, if any, (direct) applications to outside disciplines (physics, economics, etc.). Math for the sake of math.If you truly enjoy theoretical math, take this class--you'll really like it. If you don't--and this could mean that you don't like math at all, or simply that you only enjoy math as an ends and that you are really passionate about, say, biology--don't take it. This class won't justify why it is important to study these concepts (except maybe in relation to other mathematics).Coming out of this course, I feel more mature as a mathematician--not only in being more comfortable with writing rigorous proofs, but I feel more mature in the ways in which I think about mathematics.",
    "Math 231 is a great experience where you will work hard, have your eyes opened to the awesomeness of math and make lots of friends who also love math and working on problems for their own sake.",
    "A hard yet very rewarding course. Takes up a lot of time each week yet at the end of the year, a special, close-knitted group just forms around the 20 or so students who stayed and the professor from constantly discussing problems and pulling late night sessions.",
    "If you took 230, you should keep going. It just gets better and better. And more abstract. It's awesome. If you didn't take 230, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into.",
    "If you've taken 230, you know what you're getting into. If you haven't taken 230, think really hard about it. It's a lot of work, but it's a great course (like 230) and in some ways it's easier and a lot more interesting.",
    "This course is an excellent continuation of last semester, Math 230. The workload does not ease up, and I still found myself taking many hours on the problem sets, though I became familiar with them. The second semester delves into integration, and we work our way up to a proof of Stokes's Theorem, eventually learning how to integrate on manifolds. We also had a lot of interesting side topics, including the Banach-Tarski Paradox. Overall, if you love mathematics and you are willing to work, take this course. Professor Hadari is a wonderful teacher.",
    "The natural continuation of Math 230, basically slowly building up the variety of tools necessary to prove Stokes' Theorem and some of its interesting consequences. The workload dropped off near the second half of the semester--problem sets were still interesting and challenging but they seemed to get a lot shorter.Asaf Hadari is fantastic, and takes the time to go through a lot of really cool stuff that's not in the textbook.",
    "Superb course, great teacher, fascinating subject matter. If you love math, take it! You won't regret it.**Warning: Be prepared for a whole lot of work (though I think 231 has a little less than 230), and take Linear BEFORE taking this class!",
    "Pretty much the same as first semester, but a little less involved homework most of the time."
