   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you find investing interesting! If not, let someone who will love the class take that spot. Don't forget to apply early and TAKE ADVANTAGE of the proximity to David and Dean since they are not only some of the smartest but also some of the kindest people at Yale.",
    "Amazing class. Definitely take it if you're lucky enough to get a spot in the class. David and Dean are great instructors, and meeting and writing about the investment managers who visit is a one-of-a-kind experience.",
    "must take if you can get in!",
    "Take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in learning more about finance and investment analysis, either from a standpoint of strong individual curiosity or an interest in a potential career.",
    "Unbelievable class. Definitely take it if you can get in. You learn an incredible amount about portfolio managent and different investment strategies. However, it is not an easy class. There are five five-page papers and one fifteen-page paper, on top of regular reading in prepare for seminar. So, a great class, but you have to work for it!",
    "Absolutely if you are able to get in.",
    "If you get in, definitely take it. It is a work intensive seminar, but extremely memorable and worth the time. Being able to learn firsthand from David and Dean is also a wonderful opportunity.",
    "Econ 450 is an exceptional course. Lead by two finance veterans that deserve great respect. As a student you have the opportunity to meet some of the top portfolio managers in the world today. The course is a solid mix of structured courses and manager presentations. The discussions are also a lot of fun.",
    "Take this course if you can get in!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! You learn a lot about Yale and other companies' investment portfolios. And you learn from the best. But know that this is a lot of work. We had 5 or 6 5-page papers due, plus long readings, presentations (that included papers), and different projects. Definitely worth it but this class took over my other classes, especially as I wasn't an Econ major.",
    "It's a lot of work for sure, but this class is 100% worth it. The guest speakers are amazing and so are Mr. Swensen & Mr. Takahashi. The TA's grading was honestly a bit all confusing in a lot of cases, but even despite those frustrations I learned so much and I'm so glad I took the course.",
    "If you can get in definitely take this class. You have the chance to learn with two of the most intelligent faculty members (and actually understand how the endowment works), listen to highly successful investment managers and learn crucial life skills about investing."
