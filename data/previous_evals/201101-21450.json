    "Summarize Rain Forest Expedition& Lab? Well, the name says it all, but I'll give it a shot. You have 2 problem sets, 2 quizzes, 2 papers, and 3 presentations. You get to take a 15 person seminar with Scott Strobel. You get paid, independent research over the summer. You get a paid trip to the Amazonian rain forest. You have one of the best experiences of your time at Yale, hands down.",
    "I basically want to burst out into song every time I think about this class. It's one of those \"too good to be true, yet still true\" kind of things. It's a lot of work, but it's so inspiring. You have the power to design your own projects, and do something real with your undergraduate education. Plus, the trip to Ecuador was the best thing ever. I can't comprehend why this class isn't more popular.",
    "Take this class. It is the best choice I have made yet at Yale. The trip is an unbelievable experience. I got to know the professors and TAs very well, and they are all amazing people. I haven't yet started the summer research, but I am really looking forward to it. I plan to continue with this research until the time I graduate.As far as course work, this class isn't too bad. There are two short papers and a few other assignment, but overall it is much more about learning specific knowledge to be prepared for the rainforest and lab than doing pointless assignments.",
    "Good class.",
    "Fantastic class and an incredible experience. Absolutely take it if you have any interest in rainforests, fungi, natural products or biodiversity. A very intimate class environment for a science class, the trip to Ecuador is eye opening and amazing, and the opportunity to conduct completely self-directed research into something you are passionate about is completely unique.",
    "TAKE IT! The trip to Ecuador is amazing, and the course is not too difficult. I've learned a lot, and I've had a great time in the lab, too. You'll really get to know the people in your class, which is great, and you'll have a great time throughout the course.",
    "I would very highly recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in taking it. It has been the single most innovative, exciting, and memorable classes I\u0092ve taken here at Yale. The spring break trip to the rain forest was everything I had expected and so much more. You get to do so many awesome things (including taking a photo-shoot under a waterfall, zip-lining, canoeing, and rappelling to name a few) and you meet many very interesting characters along the way. The excitement doesn't abate after you come back from Ecuador, and the summer research component is a great opportunity to do some full time research at a lab here at Yale with your soon to be best friends.",
    "It's an amazing experience. It's a class, a spring break trip, anda summer component so be prepared. But you will certainly not be disappointed whatsoever. Highly highly recommended.",
    "BEST. CLASS. EVER. I say this as someone who was somewhat ambivalent about science, particularly at Yale, going into the semester and who is now very excited about science and the idea of keeping it in my career. This class basically teaches students about rainforests, botany, and fungi, takes you to the Ecuadorian rainforest over spring break to collect your own target plants, and then challenges you to use biochemistry and lab research to apply the unique natural fungal compounds to anything that interests YOU. In effect, it's a class that teaches you how to think like and be a scientist while giving you ample room to tailor the project to your interests. It also is exciting to be at the forefront of scientific discovery -- endophyte research is diverse and just taking off, and most students will identify completely new fungi.The trip was amazing, fun, and definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but it's a true mark of the strength of this class that I first think of the research and everything I learned before I think of Ecuador. What I also loved was the scope of what we learned -- we had lectures on everything from ornithology to spectroscopy, as well as a field trip to the Peabody plant collections. Everything we learn in both orgo and EEB\/MCDB science classes connect so clearly...There is quite a bit of work packed around the trip, but it's completely manageable if you start thinking about it early, and there's next to no work for class for the majorityof the semester.All three professors and two TAs are absolutely FANTASTIC -- the best team I've had at Yale, and truly a team -- and having a small 15-person seminar made all the difference. People take this class for different reasons (some are premed and some aren't even science majors), but if you're interested in science at all and want to try out a great class and research experience, TAKE THIS CLASS! I am sure I will have many great stories and experiences that begin \"I took this one class in college.....\".",
    "I would highly recommend",
    "Great course.",
    "Rainforest Expedition and Lab (REAL) is the type of class that makes you realize just how amazing Yale is. REAL presents an excellent opportunity to create your own research project and establish yourself in two Yale labs (REAL and a second lab that you will partner with), collect plants from three distinct Ecuadorian habitats, and pursue your own passions within the class framework. Furthermore, the class is a lot of fun and the professors are fantastic. I would highly recommend this class to other students with an interest in research. Just make sure that you are ready to be excited about plants, fungi, and lab work because you will be working in lab full time (and often after hours too) over the summer. The work load in REAL varies from very light in the begging, to heavy before spring break, to moderate at the end when you will be working in lab outside of class hours. Even if you're not sure if you can take the class, I'd highly suggest shopping REAL and trying to fit it into your schedule if you're interested in the material."
