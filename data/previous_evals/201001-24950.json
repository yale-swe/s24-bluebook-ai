   "comments": [
    "The two times a day labe shtick is okay.The experimental\/lab component itself is fine...it can get long and tedious but all are doable. TAs are generally nice but not all of them are willing to help you on work.This course experience could have been 100000000 TIMES better if there were NO TEDIOUS, BORING, AND HARD-TO-WRITE-RIGHT LAB REPORTS. That is by far the WORST part of this class. This SHOULD have been a writing credit because by god, I dreaded the 4 reports we had to write.",
    "This class covers the basic lab techniques one will encounter in a biochemistry or molecular biology lab. I feel like it might be one of the department's best kept secrets. The class was pretty fun, and since it meets twice a week, you get to know your classmates pretty well. It may be a function of who you're in class with, but I enjoyed this lab a great deal. It's a full credit, and it feels like a full credit, but if you need to learn the techniques, this is definitely a great way to do so.",
    "Yes. I was scared to take this class because of the amount of time it takes up (two afternoons a week) and because i thought it was really intense being a full credit. But it was a great class. There are 4 projects over the course of the semester, and you feel like you are doing research in a real lab. It is great for learning techniques, but even if you have already worked in a lab i doubt you have done all of the techniques we do in this class because it spans a wide range of topics. The class itself is very laid back, but the lab reports took forever and were hard. The daily quizzes were usually pretty easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to another student. It is by far the best science lab I have taken at Yale (I also took orgo and physics labs). Though labs are longer and twice a week, there is no written work due every class, only four large lab reports spaced throughout the semester. Labs can be a lot of fun, especially if you have great TAs like we did. Plus you learn a lot of useful lab techniques that can be applied to further work in biochemsitry labs.",
    "I would recommend it--I think it improved my performance in MBB 301 and gave me skills I otherwise wouldn't have. There are 4 lab reports--they're long. Grading is variable, since some of the 4 TAs are harsher than others. If you can deal with 4 hours of lab 2 days a week (it's often shorter), take it! You'll have lots of time to bond with your classmates.",
    "Best lab at Yale. I'd heard rumors that it was a terrible class and of people not doing MBB because they'd have to do the lab, but the lab was great. The TAs are really helpful, and there's not too much work outside of class. The lab reports are long, so don't wait until the night before to do them.",
    "This lab was, surprisingly, fantastic, and is by far my favorite lab at Yale. Yes, 8 hours\/week is a lot of time to spend in an instructional lab. But the 8 hours are very laid-back, the TAs (or at least ours) were fantastic and so much fun, you get to know everyone in the class pretty well and get to form a little MB&B\/MCDB\/etc. friend group, and you get a lot of good experience with biology\/biochemistry laboratory techniques. Whether this lab is required for your major, or whether you need it as an inorganic chem lab credit for med. school, it's a fun and enjoyable way to fulfill the requirement and learn some valuable lab skills at the same time. My only piece of advice: the lab reports (there are only 4) are LONG, and starting them the night before can be a struggle. Try to take a few days to work on them, if possible.",
    "The long lab reports aren't fun, and some of your experiments won't work, but all things considered this lab isn't too bad. Our TAs were chill which helped. Probably better to get this lab waived if you do research",
    "Much more fun than I thought it would be. Four long nights for the reports, but I enjoyed it a lot otherwise. We listened to music in lab and hung out with each other. Fun."
