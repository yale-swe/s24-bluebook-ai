   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it was unlike any philosophy class I had previously taken. It is a lot of work and the essays were difficult to write but the subject matter is so interesting that you will be motivated to work hard.",
    "Karsten Harries is a sage, and Heidegger and Wittgenstein are perhaps the two most important thinkers of the 20th century. This class is a must-take if offered again and you truly love philosophy. Karsten's ability to analyze such large questions in such an organized and profound way over the course of an entire semester is nothing short of remarkable. Both thinkers, coming to terms with the limits of Cartesian thought, struggle with the search for a new grounding for reason. Watching Karsten take this search is an amazing opportunity and journey, and I feel like I grew so much as a thinker and student. The class is dense, but Karsten and the way he elucidates the two is nothing short of inspiring.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction to two of the most influential, least understood thinkers of the 20th century. Professor Harries does an amazing job choosing readings and creating a narrative in his lectures, and he managed to explain the texts remarkably clearly. As someone without much background in philosophy, I still found it accessible. The only downside was the unremitting lecture format; there was no section, so we didn't really get to discuss anything. Although this particular class may not be offered again, I would highly recommend any course with Professor Harries.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHIL 259. It is hard to find a better introduction to two very difficult thinkers. Survey of Heidegger and Wittgenstein's most important works as well as more obscure influences on their thought.",
    "An intense examination of the interrelation between Heidegger and Wittgenstein, couched within a broader exploration of theories of language and philosophy in general.",
    "Difficult course that only gets harder when you start reading Heidegger. However, it's fantastic and utterly rewarding. I recommend it to anyone looking to expand their philosophical horizons.",
    "Prof. Harries is the only one doing continental philosophy at Yale. This class gives you a general sense of what continental philosophy is like. Heidegger and Wittgenstein are two of the most difficult and controversial figures in the history of philosophy. It's great to get to understand their ideas and situate them in the context of the history of philosophy with the help of one of the most prominent professors in the field. Before taking this class, I had taken DS philosophy for two semesters. Continental philosophy is very different than the philosophy I was familiar with. This class questions the limit of philosophy and involves a lot of reflection on the history of philosophy and its purpose. It's good to have some familiarity with the history of philosophy before taking this class.",
    "Would recommend to students with an interest in philosophy. Not being a mere survey course it has been one of the most positively challenging courses that I have taken at Yale. If a student were looking for a simple overview of the texts they might be disappointed.",
    "If you want to learn how to think patiently through a philosophical issue this is the course for you. If you want to understand think as a state vulnerability and curiosity this is the course for you. Its a lecture and a lengthy lectures that go beyond the time limit, but is worth it.",
    "The course shed some interesting light on two of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. It is a pity that Prof. Harries is basically the only one in the Philosophy Department doing continental philosophy, the department would be much stronger if it gave at least some room to it. If Harries teaches this course again, by all means take it, it is the perfect introduction.",
    "Definitely yes. I put a lot into this class and it payed off. It changed my view of philosophy and it changed me as a person. After this course I gathered Wittgenstein is the most interesting philosopher out there. With Heidegger I had more issues--he is quite difficult to read and Harries does not really elucidate as much as assumes you understand and builds on that. but it isnt unpleasant--of course part of Heidegger's point is that philosophy should not be as easy to understand as perhaps the analytic current that dominates at yale tries to make it seem. philosophical problems are really not to be treated like mathematical problems, is on of the lessons we learn in this course. anyway, i could continue writing but my point is definitely yes. although i think it's unlikely that this course will be taught again, everyone at yale should take a course with harries, and should read about wittgenstein and Heidegger."
