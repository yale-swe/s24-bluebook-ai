    "I suppose it depends what someone is working on: it is definitely useful for anyone working with 19th century art.",
    "Difficult but worthwhile. I'd recommend this class, though suggest that they don't take it right away and ease into it.",
    "The class is a great place to read a lot, become familiar with a wide variety of sources, and to engage with a very specific, fascinating time period. The class is reading heavy, which makes for a seminar that moves quickly through a lot of material, but allows you to gain breadth in the subject area."

    "It was great to learn so much about aesthetics, since I never would have pursued this topic on my own. I wish, however, there had been more music theory. The curriculum was a little too light on theory.",
    "It was a strong introduction to discussions of aesthetics.It also gave a good historical grounding for theory I was familiar with.",
    "I learned about the roots of musicology as well as the great mindsof the century I intend to focus in!",
    "This course seems very useful for historians and theorists alike. It gives the students a chance to get to know a crucial time period from multiple perspectives."
