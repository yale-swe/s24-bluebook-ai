    "French 120 is the progression of French 110, the lessons pick up where the first semester left off. 120 is a bit easier than 110 purely because you know what to expect. Vysosias ensured that we didn't do unnecessary book work instead focusing on the important concepts which was really helpful to me personally.",
    "Vysosias was a great professor, and I definitely would recommend taking the class with her!",
    "This course is very much like the L1 course you probably took last semester. I found that the exams became less daunting while the compositions increased in difficulty and were more harshly graded. Everything else remained the same compared to L1.",
    "Yes. This class is difficult and can be a lot of work at times, but it's worth it.",
    "I recommend it if you're trying to learn French."
