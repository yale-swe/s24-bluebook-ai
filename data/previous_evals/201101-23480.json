   "comments": [
    "Especially considering this was the 1st time taught by a new professor - great class. Liked very much the incorporation of Prof. Gusmano's research for that public health, population level comparative insight. PPT slides got a bit wordy at times. Good choices of readings, and to not directly discuss these in-class. Readings are supplemental and enriching, but should never be the topic of lectures.",
    "Very good.",
    "I was really excited about taking this course. However, the instructor, though clearly brilliant was a little to scatterbrained for me. He never really taught the class by going through the prepared slides, but rambled on by various encounters in his past. I am sad to say that I learned absolutely nothing in a couse I thought would help me to understand the organizaiton of health care in the Untied States :-$",
    "Course was very policy based, but I was expecting more hard facts of the US healthcare system (ie how does Medicare and Medicaid work\/ how hospitals get paid, what are the different systems like PPO and HMO, etc)",
    "This class needed to be for policy students and not a general core requirement. The professor introduced the course as an introductory level course where he assumed we didn't know much about health policy in the U.S., but then immediately rambled about the healthcare system and used acronyms I had never heard of. He wasn't clear about his expectations for the paper and if you had a different opinion or argument that he didn't agree with, the paper was immediately seen as lower quality. I found that much of the course material was rather theoretical, whereas I think it would be more helpful for us to see how various policies directly impact us. In Dr. Formans lecture, he put up slides on specific insurance costs for Yale employees and how this changed with single\/married\/etc individuals. Seeing numbers and specifics such as this were so helpful.",
    "This course is a good policy introduction and a good choice for non-policy people looking to fill their policy requirement. The class ended up being very large this year and was held in Winslow, which was kind of unfortunate. The size and classroom made it easy to stop paying attention in the long lectures, but the class is worth engaging in.",
    "Subject matter was interesting but was presented in a philosophical\/historical style as opposed to hard numbers at the current state. That being said, I think this class is what first year students should have to take instead of HPA 510a. This course was more practical in that it described the current insurance and financing system (not corporate finance) as well as the repercussions of these.Still, I would have liked more discussion instead of lecture (partly due to students not speaking up) and more hard numbers around the problems in our system.Also, the class got moved to Winslow which totally crushed the hopes of discussion. The course should be capped and kept in a smaller room so that people are closer together and conversation takes place instead of people playing on computers. Computers aren't really necessary for this course anyways and should probably not be allowed.",
    "Interesting topics but too theoretical at times. Would have gotten much more out of the class if it discussed practical applications of the theories discussed.",
    "Practical information; wish paper topics followed that",
    "The course covered a lot of material that was new to me. Generally, I found that the readings were more helpful to me than the lectures. Although I did learn some basic aspects related to the healthcare system from the course, I feel as if I did not learn enough as I would have liked. I was still confused with many concepts when it came to taking the final.",
    "The course was great. The content of the course was fascinating and very applicable. My only complaint is that the class was moved to Winslow which limited the class's ability to have an active discussion\/participatory element.",
    "very dull class. the material that dr. gusmano presented was dry. i still don't think i have a firm grasp about that US health care system is like. readings assigned were very dense and philosophical. i came into the class with the impression that it will teach us the nuts and bolts of the US health care system, but i felt it was too philosophical for an introductory class.",
    "Great course--I think starting off with Praeto Optimality was a rough entrance into HCF&D.",
    "strengths-topics of lectures were very practical-course instructor is fun to listen to and very energeticweaknesses-sometimes hard to stay focused during class-I wish it had been a smaller class instead of a lecture in Winslow",
    "Its a good course. Mike Gusmano is definitely knowledgeable and that is made evident in his presentation of the material. If policy isn't your thing, its a bit difficult to follow.",
    "The course had very good readings and essay topics. I enjoyed the lectures. However, this is the first finance-related class for many of us and I felt a little bit lost in the various terminologies and economics theories. Perhaps a simple definition and background lecture\/worksheet will help improve the class.",
    "I had a lot of difficulty following the instructor in this class. Very rarely did I understand 'the point'. He just seemed to go on and on. This class need a more detailed guideline and more structure.The class needs to know the nuts and bolts, not so much fuzzy policy stuff.",
    "This was an informative class that offered a broad range of health care finance related topics. The reading assignments were very interesting and well worth the time, and the paper topics made you think critically.",
    "Excellent survey course! Provides a great overview of the US health care system in regards to finance and delivery. Lectures are clear, readings are interesting and all very relevant, and the assignments were constructive and useful (4 three page papers plus a take home final).The course would have been better if the class size was smaller, though.I actually enjoyed going to class!",
    "Should be more catered to non-policy students",
    "Good introduction",
    "next time not in winslow -- class discussion suffered from lack of participation",
    "More useful than most of the health policy sequence! Could have been more in depth, but as it was, a pretty good course.One random thing... would really appreciate some sort of file-naming convention for the articles on ClassesV2-- they were named in a random way that made them hard to keep track of.",
    "This class was a very broad look at some of the aspects of healthcare. It was very interesting and I learned more new material in this class than any other class this semester. However, it was hard to follow at times with no concrete answers and facts to really take note of. Classes were more of a discussion, which was great, but made it hard to make conclusions about what we talked about.",
    "Good concept, lectures could have been slightly more organized.",
    "The readings and assignment were really good. Did not think lecture was that helpful. But learned mostly from the papers and final.",
    "The course is much easier if you have had a background in economics. There are many terms used in lecture that are not well defined and explained to an audience of people with little or no background in policy. More comprehensive lecture notes with bullet points would be helpful.",
    "Overall, the course was a great introduction to the US healthcare system and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in this field. Readings were relevant and interesting, if sometimes perhaps too academic. The paper assignments were very constructive and helped me think about important issues in greater depth than we were able to cover in class.",
    "Overall, the course was good. I felt that there were too many readings and while the instructor was a good instructor, I felt that his lectures were tailored to a health policy audience. Given that this is not my background, I didn't get as much out of the class as I had wanted.",
    "too much lecturing, the content is repetitive",
    "great",
    "The course was a good overview of the US health care system, specifically with regards to the finance and delivery of health care. While the information was good, I felt that that course many times felt like a political theory class with no real practical application of the material we learned.",
    "Strengths: It covered many relevant topics that all public health students should know. It provided meaningful readings and the amount of work was fair.Weaknesses: The structure - it should have been a capped class in a smaller classroom to allow for meaningful discussions. I think a total of 10 people actually participated, 5 on a regular basis.The v2 Resources - the PPTs were not always organized or easy to read. I would have liked some consistency among the PPTs and order among their listings on v2.",
    "I felt it gave a good overview of the healthcare system in this country and gave me a better sense of where we are now in the healthcare model.",
    "Was too policy oriented. Was expected more finance."

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Excellent. I particularly liked his lecture delivery style (direct, sarcastic).",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr Gusmano is not a by-the-slides-only fellow -- thank goodness!He's well versed in the complexity of the many issues surrounding financing of health care in the US, and he's written some articles comparing world cities' health care programs and outcomes ... very thought-provoking stuff.In addition, he brings a great deal of good-natured humor and passion to the topics (eg, \"I think George Carlin was the greatest intentional comedian of all time, and Ronald Reagan the greatest unintentional comedian\").His willingness to stand and deliver each week was impressive.He's got guts, gusto, and he tackles the issues in detail.All this -- and he had the disadvantage of having to teach this year in the auditorium! But Dr Gusmano overcame this and cracked the students' interest ... and got them to engage despite the soporific\"sleep cave\" environment of Winslow.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0engaging speaker. Great guy. However, just rambled on a little too much for me. Lectures not always that structured. My learning style clearly didn't match his teaching style, as a result, I learned nothing, sorry :-$",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Interesting, good professor. I think a smaller class setting with policy students would better suit his teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was a very good lecturer and clearly passionate and well versed in his subject. Howie Forman is a legend for his version of this class, and I don't think anyone could possibly live up to it, but I'm glad we at least had a good replacement since Howie could not teach it this year.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano was interesting, candid and knowledgable while trying to get students to interact. Unfortunately the class was in Winslow auditorium so essentially turned into lectures which I think ended up hurting. The professor was prepared for class, had some slides to back things up and could talk on a number of subjects. I would have liked to see more slides and graphs (again, numbers) to help visualize some of the things he was talking about.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0interesting and engaging",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is very comfortable talking about the subject. He can do so without prompts from lecture slides. Many lectures had only a few slides and would not be available online until after the lecture. This was not very helpful for students, especially when it came to reviewing the material. Furthermore, although the class is meant to be for students without any background in this area, he spoke as though we were already familiar with many related issues such as those related to economics.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is an excellent professor. He is an interesting and engaging professor who makes the subject easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0very dull and dry lectures. not very engaging at all.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Enthusiastic and very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0very energetic and knowledgeable; lectures could have been more organized",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Unparalleled teaching style! Thank you for not reading your powerpoint slides, for speaking with knowledge and authority on the topics, and for having a sense of humor and allowing that to be displayed during class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He needs to have more substance to his lecture.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Awesome teacher, very helpful, great at responding to emails quickly, detaiuled feedback&responses to questions, good about linking different topics together",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a great lecturer, which made each of his lectures very interesting. His biggest weakness is providing timely and meaningful feedback. Unlike some professors in big classes, he will read everything you turn in, but usually his comments are limited to 1-2 generic sentences. Additionally, we turned in 4 essays throughout the course, only 2 of which were returned before the final which basically made it impossible to know how you were doing in the course.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is a wonderful lecturer, although sometimes his talks could veer away from the slides. He is engaging and a dynamic speaker. Additionally, he is always approachable and will reply to emails very quickly. He brings in stimulating debates and thought-provoking ideas, and he reinforces the importance of thinking critically through his paper assignments.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0FANTASTIC professor - YSPH is lucky to have him and needs more faculty like him. Clearly, he is extremely knowledgeable and has a gift for delivering lectures.He is the reason why I enjoyed going to class - he clearly articulated all material, effectively answered all questions, and was entertaining\/humorous all the while.He demonstrated an enthusiastic passion for both teaching and for the material being discussed.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very smart. Slides could be more helpful",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good discussions",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0PowerPoints could have had more detail, rather than just a few illustrations. But for the most part I found Dr. Gusmano to be a very effective lecturer. I appreciated the Ronald Regan recording too!",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is a very articulate speaker. He was interesting to listen to and knew much about the current healthcare system. Some of what he said sometimes was more in depth than I could follow since I have never taken a finance class before. Overall, I appreciated the topics of concern that he brought to light. I wish his slides were more complete.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Clearly very knowledgeable. The lecture hall worked to his disadvantage based on the model of the class ie interactivity didn't work in the big room.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Lectures are very colloquial and difficult to follow without structured points.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Mr. Gusmano is a very good, dynamic lecturer, and is very knowledgeable and passionate about the course material. He did a good job of covering important and relevant topics while making sure everyone in the class was on the same page. Would have been nice to get more feedback on graded work (ie. papers) but overall Professor Gusmano was an excellent instructor and I would recommend him and any course he teaches to my peers.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was a good instructor. I enjoyed most lectures but felt that the questions he posed in class had an underlying assumption of an understanding\/background in health policy that I didn't have.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0knowlegable",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr Gusmano was very engaging and tried to make the class lively nad interesting. It was clear that he is a trained political scientist.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is very bright and experienced in the topic, from an academia perspective. He always knows the answer to questions and has an impressive memory of historical health policy events. I did find him one-sided, though, and would have appreciated more balanced discussions concerning the politics of health policy. (He did sometimes give credit to the other side, but not enough to be considered balanced.) I would have also liked to hear more about his experience outside of academia, if any.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I felt he was a passionate and energetic instructor who clearly knows the topic. However, I felt he often got sidetracked and went on slightly convoluted jogs away from the topic that made it hard to stay focused.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Fine. Wish that he focused more on finance."

He guest lectured one class this semester and was excellent. I think either he or Dr Gusmano would be excellent.",
    "This course is supposed to be an overview of the health care system in the United States, but actually turned out to be weekly storytime with the professor detailing his experience in the field. Not really recommended unless you are a policy major, however the coursework is manageable, even more so than than other policy courses I'm told.",
    "This course is intended to introduce the delivery of healthcare in the United States.",
    "For non-policy students I would definitely recommend this as the class to take to fulfill your policy requirement.",
    "I liked it. The course was a bit different because of the new professor but was important subject matter for any policy or management student. This course should really be required for anyone intending to work in the U.S. as these ideas affect any portion of our system, even if you are a researcher or biostatistian it will be important to know what data is meaningful to a manager or policy writer down line.",

    "Healthcare Finance and Delivery provides students with information related to the U.S. healthcare system, covering topics related to quality, cost, and efficiency. I would recommend this course if the material was presented differently during lectures.",
    "This course was fantastic. I think it should be required for all MPH students as it provides a strong foundation in finance and delivery of health care in the US.",
    "i do not recommend taking this class if it's taught by dr. gusmano. take it with howie forman.",
    "Very nice summary of modern HCF&D.",
    "good for learning practical information about health insurance and the basic problems in the U.S. healthcare system; good for policy and non-policy students",
    "Not too much work, but hard to sit through.",
    "Interesting class overall. You just write essays for your grade, but don't plan on getting them back before the semester is over.",

    "I would recommend.",
    "V good",
    "Recommended for policy and other students who want to understand more about the complicated U.S. healthcare system. Is more of an overview than an in-depth explanation. Way better than most health policy courses at YSPH.Howie Forman's class was so popular that Dr. Gusmano had big shoes to fill, and I think he did OK.",
    "This course was a broad overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the US healthcare as well as the development of healthcare to what it is today. I would recommend it to students.",
    "Decent intro to health systems in the us.",
    "Great introduction to the US healthcare system. The course covers a lot of ground with a relatively broad brush, which is exactly what I was looking for. Professor Gusmano is dynamic and interesting, able to keep my attention for the entire two-hour block. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "The course provides students with an overall understanding of the healthcare system- delves into quality of health care, access, and how the finance and delivery of healthcare in the U.S. affect the quality and quantity of care Americans receive.",
    "very policy-oriented",
    "great",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student but must warn them that it is very much theory based and not necessarily finance based.",
    "This is a very theoretical and framework-based class. It investigates the history of health policy but doesn't go into much detail on the current reform - that was covered briefly, as was quality improvement. It's lecture style and you'll have readings for each weekly class. There are four papers and one final take-home exam.",
    "Still feel like it is an overall good class to take and the instructor is very fair and reasonable."
