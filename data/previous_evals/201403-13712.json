    "I found the presentations and readings totally useful and worthwhile. This is one of the only classes where I felt like I was at no time overwhelmed.",
    "The structure of one significant project every few weeks creates useful variation in an otherwise consistently full curriculum. This course is a place where students can manage their time in longer arcs than a single week.",
    "These course served as a welcome counterpoint to our other classes in terms of workload. It didn't require weekly submitted work so we could be more flexible with our time and accommodate the weekly work of our other classes."

    "I think we had really excellent conversations in this course and I like how everything built on the last session. I would have liked even more classes devoted to discussion and questioning.",
    "Professor Martenson's syllabi are consistently well-organized, logical, and easy to follow. The course structure and sequence makes sense, and each week builds on the work that preceded it.",
    "Ed has designed an impeccably structured course. It is clearly well thought out, and its structure is meaningful. I really appreciated his flexibility with the class structure when he found that discussion was going in a certain direction. He would let the class go with it, letting some oxygen to the fire in deliberate ways. It was so nice being able to pursue topics that interested the class so that we could really dig deeply."

    "I learned a great deal from this course. I just wish we had more time to sit together and discuss the topics brought up more often.",
    "Ed conducted the class entirely without notes (save for his powerpoint presentations). To say he knew the information well was a understatement - he created the information. And his responsiveness to the students was unparalleled in comparison to any class I have ever taken. This course exemplified the Socratic method, and to sublime effect."

    "This course is probably the most eye-opening and professionalizing experience in the Theater Management program thus far. I look forward to approaching each of its topics in greater depth in the semesters to come.",
    "This course single-handedly changed the entire way I perceive and consider the field. It had more influence on me than any single module of continuing education and professional development that I've ever engaged in. This course is worth the price of tuition. I realize that this may sound hyperbolic, but it's not. This course is best educational experience I've ever had."
