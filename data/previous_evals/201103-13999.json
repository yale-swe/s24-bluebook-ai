   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommend. Though taxing and challenging at times, much of the coursework is downright enjoyable and conversations in class were always thought-provoking. Professor Graham has a ton of insight to offer, and is friendly to boot.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Soviet history, Eastern European history, and modern Russian politics. The course thoroughly covers the late Soviet time period and the Russian Federation since 1991. I feel that this is the most applicable course that I have taken thus far during my time at Yale.",
    "This is not a course if you simply want to learn about post-Soviet Russian history. It is assumed that you know some of the basics. It is a class that will enable you to understand and discuss in-depth and with reasonable authority the issues at stake in Russian political and socio-economic policy-making circles. Be prepared to engage issues such as demographics and foreign policy from a very analytical point of view - it will challenge your assumptions, but enable you to think about policy-making in a much more enhanced, practical way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it highly. Especially to students interested in Russia and American Foreign Policy, but not exclusively.",
    "Yes I would. Especially to those that concentrate on Russia. In my case the course was very useful.",
    "A good introduction to Russia of the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, primarily focusing on politics and economics, but not neglecting social developments that took place during the final years of the Soviet-era and in the Post-Soviet era (nor the historical roots of many of the phenomena of the modern period). The course revolves around discussion of weekly readings related to a particular theme, with the professor leading discussions but ample opportunity for student questions. The professor's extensive knowledge of Russian history and politics as well as US foreign policy were the keys to the course being such a good experience.",
    "An excellent overview of modern Russian politics and the historical forces that produced them. The course was also helpful in understanding the policymaking process and how U.S. policymakers approach Russian issues."

   "comments": [
    "I felt that this course greatly improved my understanding of the material. It will be very helpful in my future research.",
    "This course was very useful in deepening my knowledge on Russia. It will contribute profoundly to my research on Russia's foreign economic relations.",
    "This course gave me the background I was seeking on Russia to be able think critically about Russia going forward, and it also acquainted me with the scholarship of many of the top academics studying the country.This will no doubt prove useful going forward as I focus on policy making in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, both regions on which Russia still exerts a strong influence.An excellent course!",
    "This course filled in a critical gap in my knowledge of modern Russia and European politics--enormously helpful to anyone studying modern Europe."
