    "I would tell them that it's a research-based class with a focus on developing an argument based on visual material (maps, plans, photos, etc.). The thematic content and readings didn't cohere very well, and the group of students came from such different backgrounds that discussion was disjointed. The main strength was getting to work with Prof. Hayden and getting her feedback on one's work."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped me think about using visual material as evidence. I had never been challenged to do this before, and I found it very helpful. I learned that whatever photograph\/plan\/map you use should very clearly support your argument, or make a sub-argument, and not just passively illustrate a minor point.I used this paper to advance a side project. I would say it didn't advance my dissertation research, but it definitely brought me closer to being able to submit this side project for publication."
