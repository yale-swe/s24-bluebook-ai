    "ECON 110 did not only give me the opportunity to learn economics in the context of, well, the economy, but in the context of decision-making in my everyday life.",
    "Basic microeconomics. Profit maximization, judgmental heuristics, cost minimization, market structures and some game theory. Based on my classmates who took the lecture version of this course, I think the seminar is more rigorous but (evidently) with more individual attention.",
    "General Micro-Economics and thinking techniques.",
    "I learned about how consumers and producers pursue their own self-interest and how that shapes the economy as a whole. I learned how consumers and producers make their decisions rationally, and thought it was interesting how the same procedures could be applied to my own decision making.",
    "This course has definitely allowed me to grasp the rudiments of microecon in theory and mathematically. I have a new view of world both as a consumer and someone active in the labor market."

   "comments": [
    "The end of the course seemed a bit rushed and flipped, where I was teaching myself most of the material. I would have moved faster through the first half of the course to allow more time for the second half.",
    "The only real weakness is that it is difficult to find practice problems with answers for the textbook or problems that closely resemble the exams. Maybe there could be more problem sets? The course has so many strengths. Tolga is an engaging lecturer and is extremely helpful during office hours. He'll answer questions ranging from very basic to very complex (and not necessary for the course) during office hours or after class. The problem sets are very helpful and I thought the book was well-written and informative.",
    "It's a great course.",
    "I really liked the lectures and learned the most from going to class. The problem sets were interesting, and I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "The strength of this class is definitely the small class size. We were allowed to ask a lot of questions whenever need be and could also move at our own pace through the material.",
    "Literally no weaknesses-perfect course"

    "Definitely! The manner in which the course was structured allowed for student engagement, especially with the smaller class size relative to the lecture.",
    "Take this course if you are planning to be an econ major as it will prepare you for the intermediate version. The class is competitive as most people here have a passion for econ. If you are not fully committed to econ, take the lecture.",
    "Definitely! Well-taught and interesting material.",
    "Yes! I think it is a great introduction to economics. Particularly, I think that the seminar structure lends itself to better learning than does the large lecture equivalent.",
    "Definitely. I enjoyed this course very much and felt like I had the support I needed to do well.",
    "Yes, because Tolga made the class so fun. He is really knowledgeable and his teaching style is super organized and informative, so I ended up learning a lot and found myself eager to go to class everyday.",
    "Tolga was amazing this semester, and any student to have him as a teacher would be very happy.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this course, even if you think you won't like economics. I went into this class unsure if I would enjoy it, and came out considering economics as a major.",
    "I recommend this seminar to anyone that is up for an intellectual challenge, but eager to learn microeconomics in concept. Definitely recommend to anyone thinking of majoring.",
    "Absolutely! Tolga makes the material fun and inspiring, and really knows how to well relate to his students.",
    "Yes, best course I've taken at Yale."
