    "Mainly Strengths: The course offers an intellectual challenge and a great deal of interest. The plays we discussed reflected different historical developments in the perception of the theater itself and the theoretical texts we have read have broadened, accordingly, the concept of performance and its relevance to theater, language, gender, and identity politics.",
    "Strengths: Impressive close readings that develop into broader questions; good discussions in class and welcoming, encouraging environment.",
    "Interesting and engaging class. Enjoed every session!"

    "Yes! It was a very interesting and thought-provoking course.",
    "One of my best classes this semester. Great discussions and overall learning experience",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone. It was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, interesting, insightful and thought-provoking.",
