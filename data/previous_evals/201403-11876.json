   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to someone who would benefit from and enjoy the course texts themselves. While Professor Robinson is well-versed in all the material, he does not mediate discussion much, making for very generalized (i.e.: not closely read) conversation about the texts. What you get out of this course really depends on how much you put into it independently.",
    "An interesting overview of American theater in the build to the modern playdefinitely a class for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the theater. Professor Robinson is inspirational to say the least, a professor who is eager to debate with his students to spur their ideas on to greater heights.",
    "This is a great survey of Modern American Theatre. Reading the big names is fantastic, and Professor Robinson makes sure that you leave with a fresh take on the plays no matter how many times you've read them. Some of the less well known authors can be a little tedious and abstract, so make sure that you are willing to make the commitment to some unconventional theatre before you start. As well, it sure be noted that the class focus more on the theatrical aspects of the plays and less on their literary value. All in all, a nice course and for me a great Senior English Seminar.",
    "This is a fairly good seminar. The readings are very interesting, and there are only two papers (plus a number of required blog posts). However, class discussions often fell flat, and the course did not seem to carry over from week to week. Depending on the readings, some weeks were great, and others were not.",
    "Professor Robinson is a passionate professor who is so knowledgeable and insightful about the subject. The syllabus is great and I'm really glad that I got to go through all of these plays and enjoyed reading most of the plays. The class discussion falls short sometimes but I guess that really depends on the class.",
    "Excellent course!",
    "this is a gem of a class. prof. is so engaging and obviously passionate about the material, which made for a fantastic seminar experience. the syllabus includes of the best known american theater (williams, o'neill, etc) and plenty of the should-be-better-known works, too (eg childress, bowles). really, it was just a treat to attend class every week. wish i could take it again!",
    "Interesting mix of well-known playwrights (O'Neill, Miller, Williams) and not-so-known ones. Readings ranged from phenomenal to mediocre. The course does give you an overview of American Modernism, but a fairly spotty and uneven onewhich is partially due to the nature of Modernism itself, but also because of a slightly incoherent syllabus. Professor Robinson is incredibly knowledgeable and shares a lot of interesting tidbits on various productions of the plays we read, but don't expect any grand takeaways about 20th century American theater."
