   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who is interested in structural biology because cryoEM is becoming a more readily used technique. You will learn all of the basics that you need to understand a cryoEM paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a primer on cryo-EM.",
    "The best introduction to advanced FT and image processing I've had (compared to x-ray crystallography with TS and Macro with YX). Fred is a great lecturer: approachable yet incredibly knowledgable and clear. Don't be intimidated by the math as the conceptual underpinning is readily explained by Fred!",
    "Definitely take it, you will learn a lot about an expanding field.",
    "This is a really nice course to take if interested in cryo-EM.",
    "I would definitely recommend MBB 710 to another graduate student. Understanding this technique is becoming increasingly invaluable for biophysicists, and the class is taught in a very approachable and understandable manner.",
    "A genuinely useful and excellent class."

   "comments": [
    "This helped me to learn more about methods in structural biology.",
    "My work involves a lot of TEM and may involve cryo-EM in the future. This course helped solidify my understanding of the basic principles of EM and informed me of the principles behind image reconstruction in cryo-EM. I feel prepared to read literature on cryo-EM methods and potentially incorporate the technique into my research.",
    "Indispensable for my (hopeful) future cryoEM studies. Also, the third time around I think I finally understand Fourier transforms!",
    "This will be very applicable if I do end up using cryo em for my research, which is very likely.",
    "It taught us not only the basic methods and techniques to use, but also like data preparation, and some of the ways people use to improve imaging quality.",
    "I'm not certain that I'll ever use the actual electron cryo-microscopy techniques, but knowing the theoretical basis and getting a glimpse of actual practice has definitely made it possible for me to understand structural biology papers as I never could have before."
