   "comments": [
    "Diaz is an excellent professor who will make Spanish easy for you. He wants you to do well, so if you take L4-he is the best choice.",
    "You probably already know what you are getting yourself into- class and homework everyday, an obscene amount of small assignments worth very little of your grade, and lots of busy work. However, all of this does help you become a better Spanish speaker. If you've already decided on taking L4 spanish, I would definitely recommend Sebastian- he is one of the kindest people I've ever met and he truly does everything in his power to help his students do their best.",
    "The best way to learn the language is to live in another country. I took Spanish for 4 years when my brother went to Buenos Aires for a semester. He was laughably bad when he left, and spoke better than me when he got back.Take this if you need the requirement or want to take L5. But it's a tedious class, and the Spanish department has a lot of annoying assignments.",
    "I wouldn't take it unless you have to, or if you are naturally good at Spanish. its a lot of work.",
    "Yes. Professor Diaz is helpful, warm, and friendly.",
    "I enjoyed this class with Diaz. A good amount of work but easier to skip out on than in Spanish 3. Take it with Diaz!",
    "A great course which expands on skills learned in 130. Less busy work than 130 but slightly more difficult.",
    "TAKE IT WITH DIAZ HE IS A GOD.",
    "This is a wonderful course and if you like Spanish you will enjoy it a lot. Also, if you were placed in this course and you feel like you should be at a higher level, talk with the DUS. But if you still have to take the course it will be okay. You will be so much better at the nuances of the language and even if you think you are amazing you will gain so much from this course.To everyone, this is certainly a course where you will get out just as much as you put in. Minimal effort = minimal enjoyment. Put your all into the course and you will love almost every minute of it.",
    "A continuation of 130, the only difference is the oral presentations, which are harder. there's two huge ones right at the end of the year. after you finish learning all the grammatical stuff, you read a fun book. Diaz is really good, take it with him if you can.",
    "i thought it was a great class.",
    "Sure, if you place into it or need it for the distribution. It's a fine course but not one of the best I've ever taken.",
    "It's the next course you take after L3, but it feels like a big jump at times. You may think you can breeze through it like L3, but this course takes a lot more concentrated effort, practice, and attention. Similar, but slightly greater workload with a focus on speaking and comprehension skills, especially through reading and presentations. Your speaking and reading skills will improve, but only if you put in the proper effort. Make sure you pick a teacher who can work with your strengths and weaknesses."
