   "comments": [
    "A basic AB calc class in high school. It's very short so you only get the basics of integrals. Most of the time is spent on derivative applications and techniques. If you have taken in high school, it should be a piece of cake.",
    "Math 114 was just a straightforward math class. If you took AB but were still placed into math 112 it's a good review and I don't regret taking it.",
    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "Math 112 is an intro to calc class that goes through Limits up to the beginnings of integration. If you have never taken calc before, take this class. It moves quickly so it's important to be at every class if you have never learned the material before. Some students in the class have taken calc AB or BC before and in that case class is less strenuous. If you place into 115 or even higher and decide to take 112, you will most likely be very bore d but you will get a QR credit out of the way. I recommend it wtih Tarik if you need to take a math class.",
    "Great intro to calculus. Having taken AB Calc in high school, most of this class was review, but it doesn't hurt to go over everything again, especially with Tarik's understandable teaching methods. Problem sets aren't too bad, the class is paced at a very manageable pace, and you never feel rushed. There are two midterms and a final, but if you keep up you'll be fine. The best way to study for the exams is to do the practice tests, which are online at ClassesV2.",
    "A great introductory math course if you are familiar with pre-calculus.",
    "I took this course because I didn't have a strong math background in high school, and I needed to take calculus for the pre-med requirements. It was a fine class, even though I am not naturally good at math in general. Reading the textbook before each class would have been extremely helpful for me, and I regret not managing my time better throughout the semester. Tarik explained the material in very visual and interactive ways, and even though I am not naturally skilled in math, I believe I would have struggled more with a less enthusiastic instructor.",
    "It's an introductory level math course. Take it if your teacher is good, shop around and see which section you like during shopping period. But be ready to put in work.",
    "I would recommend it with Tarik, but it may be really annoying with a bad professor.",
    "It is not really an interesting class, but Tarik is excellent and I would recommend his section.",
    "It was a good foundation for calculus, I feel like I am better prepared for further classes in calculus and math. But I would recommend that they really understand the material after a yet because it is hard to catch up on any topic for the final.",
    "Math 112 is your basic intro cal course, going through all of cal A and barely introducing cal B. I would recommend it a student who needs to get a (relatively) easy QR out of the way or wants a review of Calculus before going on to more advanced math courses.",
    "It is a harder version of AP Calculus AB. Would not recommend if you have already taken AB or BC.",
    "This is just a regular Calc class. Nothing special. It's just an accelerated version of Calc AB. Tarik is awesome though!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who has had limited experience with calculus. This class is thorough and was well worth it in the end.",
    "If never take calculus before, i highly recommend this!",
    "Sure",
    "Take it."
