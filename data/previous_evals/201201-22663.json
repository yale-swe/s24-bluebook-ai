   "comments": [
    "If you're taking it you probably have to. Do you homework because every assignment will affect your final grade. Quizzes can be a bit harsh because one or two answers wrong will significantly affect your quiz grade.",
    "Yes I would recommend Jennifer Darrell if you have to take L3 Spanish.",
    "You will cover a lot of the same grammar as L2 but expectations are a little higher. Jennifer is great! She's really sweet and a good teacher who cares.",
    "You review the things you learned in L1, but with more depth. I personally found it easier than L1, while still feeling like I learned a lot.",
    "The course was awesome and really deepened my understanding of the Spanish language. I enjoyed the readings and movie and would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Spanish 130 reviews much of the grammar taught in 120 and even resembles it structurally. There are units of grammar, listening activities to do online, short stories to read, and a small oral presentation. There are also a few quizzes, exams (written&oral), and many in class speaking activities.I would definitely recommend Spanish 130 to another student. The teachers are friendly, and everyone in the class is about at the same level as you are. This class meets five times a week, but it's not too much work. The homework assignments take little time at all!If you can, take it with Profesora Darrell! She's amazing!!",
    "It was a typical L3 Spanish class that builds nicely off of L2 (if you took it at Yale). It works to get that portion of your language requirement out of the way, but you will also pick up a lot of important Spanish grammar and vocab that will come in handy throughout any conversational Spanish you may encounter. If you can, take it from Prof. Darrell...she's a really fun and energetic teacher to get.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It helps improve your spanish and it is also possible to do well in the course without tons of stress.",
    "This class reviews the content of L2 to help you move from knowing the concepts in theory to actually using them in your speech. I would recommend it. Jennifer Darrell is fantastic. If you have the chance, take it with her."
