    "You probably have to take the class if you are reading this evaluation so good luck. It's pretty tough. The p-sets each week take a lot of time outside of class. You learn a lot of cool stuff about the mathematical modeling different physiological processes, but it is time-consuming. The tests are open-notebut they are still very challenging. No one ever finished before time. Prof. Fahmy himself is nice and you'll get along great, but sometimes the questions he makes up for the psets and tests are not all that clear and have to be clarified. Overall, the material is challenging but this course is great at demonstrating the practicality of all that you learn.",
    "BENG 351 has a lot of potential, but I think it is unsatisfactory because the material is disorganized. The instruction is scattered, the test and homework problems are poorly presented, and the professor, though friendly, does not giveenough effort to make this a fulfilling class. The TAs are very helpful, however. Take the class if you need to or if it improves. The final project also takes a while.",
    "You have to take it if you are a BME major. It's gonna be tough sometimes but work with your friends.",
    "I would recommend this course if you plan on being a BME major (it is a required course). It gives a good background (along with BME II) of the different fields of research in BME.",
    "This class was great, one of my favorite BENG classes.Take it if you have to, but Fahmy is an amazing person."
