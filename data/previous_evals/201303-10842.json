    "It's an incredible class, and maintains a very good balance between grammar\/vocabulary\/reading skills and literary analysis. As the semester progresses, we get incredibly better at the former, which lets us focus much more on the latter. We even write a short paper near the end of the semester. It's the perfect class to take if you're coming straight out of a high school Greek class that read Homer or something of that level--shop it or talk to someone in the classics department if you need to get a better sense of whether it's the right class for your level. I was totally fine taking it after not taking Greek for a year after high school. It really does act as a \"bridge\" between grammar\/reading classes and literary\/other L5 classes.Pauline is wonderful--turns the classroom into a space where making mistakes is okay, always kind and understanding, but also very committed to seeing you make real progress and willing to be firm to make you improve. She's also great at adjusting the syllabus to match up with the reading abilities of people in the class, so don't worry if the pace looks too fast or slow at first.",
    "This class was fun but challenging for a beginning Greek student. The course is mostly translation-focused and there is a literary discussion only on a basic level (that being said, there was a close-reading assignment for those more subjective observations). If you're a prospective student of Greek, definitely try to take a course with Professor LeVen!",
    "Take this class. It is challenging, but the work load is manageable and the professor is very understanding and considerate. I took this class having not taken Ancient Greek in 4 years, so I was very worried that I would fall behind. This did not happen,. The professor was very supportive and, since the class was so small, we could all help one another. I now feel confident in my approach to the language. The texts we read were very interesting. We covered Herodotus, Euripides, Gorgias etc , all different styles and opinions on Helen. There was plenty of textual analysis as well. The tests are all very fair.",
    "If it's offered again, or something similar, I'd absolutely recommend it. It was a great introduction to reading a variety of authors and styles, from Herodotus to Euripides, and to working with Greek texts in a more critical and literary framework. Almost all the reading was good and Professor LeVen ran a really wonderful seminar. I'd call it a challenging class (tests were fair, but never easy), but it did a ton to improve my Greek and I always looked forward to going to class.",
    "We covered three prose writers and most of a play by Euripides over the course of the term, reviewing and learning the nuances of Greek grammar and vocabulary while also thinking about the figure of Helen of Sparta\/Troy in classical literature. I would recommend this course to another student. It fit perfectly into my experience level, and I enjoyed the class."
