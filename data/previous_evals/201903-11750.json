    "The material was clearly outlined from the beginning of the course. Professor Wilson introduced each topic properly at the outset of each lecture, and he always connected it with the topics that were already covered or were going to be covered. Due to the high volume of information that was covered each week though, one thing that could be considered going forward is stressing which points are most important. However, given that previous material was often referenced in the lectures, the essential points seem to have been revisited."

    "Yes! Well, it is the only course that does anything with anicent Israelite religion so it is necessary information unavailable otherwise.",
    "Yes, because I think its really good foundation for other Hebrew Bible courses.",
    "Yes, the study of Israelite religion is imperative for any student of the Bible. The secondary literature that we were assigned was arguably the most beneficial aspect of the course for me, as I needed to be exposed to the most influential scholarship in the field, which Professor Wilson was intimately familiar with."
