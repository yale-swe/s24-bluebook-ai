   "comments": [
    "It was a excellent course. It moved very quickly, especially compared to Chinese 131 but as long as you keep along you will learn a lot and it will be worth it. In-class is very fun, you can get away with saying pretty much anything which is cool.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you grew up speaking Chinese at home or are very fluent in conversation, but may not know how to read or write. Start out with CHNS132.",
    "CHNS 142 is an enjoyable, engaging class for students looking to improve their Chinese. The workload is a bit on the heavier side, but the course is definitely worth taking regardless. It is a rewarding course, and is taught by the wonderful Liu Laoshi who is extremely friendly and approachable.",
    "An awesome class. Liu Laoshi is so nice and the workload is very reasonable. You have many opportunities to practice speaking in addition to writing and reading. I would recommend this class to people who have some knowledge\/exposure to Cantonese or Mandarin.",
    "Very hard but the class is good",
    "You will definitely learn Chinese, but it's a huge time commitment. Take it if you're prepared for that!",
    "I recommend the class to anyone who took CHNS 132",
    "Fantastic class. Compared to CHNS 132, CHNS 142 was much more discussion based, and my Chinese improved a lot. Liu Laoshi, as always, was amazing, and I can't imagine a Chinese teacher as talented, dedicated, and funny as she. She made class an utter joy and led discussions with a masterful hand. If you started with CHNS 132, you must continue with CHNS 142!",
    "It is a class that will take up a lot of your time, because you have to memorize a lot of characters. However, it is not difficult, just time consuming.",
    "Take this class!! Prof. Liu is one of the best language teachers I have ever had. She is fair, very knowledgeable, extremely funny, and also very compassionate. She never fails to make the class engaging- even when it's every morning of the week- and you learn to really care about her and the rest of your classmates bc she really makes an effort to bring everyone together. Even if you are hesitant about taking Chinese, Prof. Liu will without a doubt inspire a love of characters and sentences in you. Her enthusiasm is not overwhelming, but it is truly a joy to experience. Take it!"
