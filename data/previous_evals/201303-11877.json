   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone. I would tell them this is a class in which you apply math and physics to understand what's out there.",
    "This is a strong intro astro course. Louise Edwards is energetic, extremely helpful, fun, and kind. The material is perfect for students who don't have a strong math background. This is definitely a class where you have to \"show up\"...participation grades, weekly quizzes. But \"showing up\" actually equates to learning the material, so you shouldn't have to spent an obscene amount of time preparing for exams. I strongly recommend this course.",
    "It was a good course. It was a decent amount of work and a lot of math. The material was interesting, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it is a really good peek into astronomy and what it entails.",
    "I think the class was very interesting. It is very subjective to what you actually want to learn about the universe, but overall the class was satisfactory.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in what planets and stars do but not why they do it.",
    "Manageable workload, accessible QR credit as the calculations are nothing more than algebra. Louise Edwards is peppy and pretty engaging but her lectures were sometimes not too well organized. If you are genuinely interested in astronomy this is a good course; if you are just taking this is a gut, then you will probably not enjoy it so much.",
    "Quite a lot of emphasis on math and equations - but the math is quite basic. Definitely worth doing if you need to fulfil a QR requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student, especially one who may not be too confident in the QR area, such as myself. However, if one does not have an interest in astronomy, this class may seem dull.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are looking for a very reasonable way to fill the science distribution requirement.",
    "Good class - not overly mathy for a science creditinteresting stuff, not too hard to comprehend"
