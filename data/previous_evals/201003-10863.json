    "Yes I would.I would recommend it to a student who is interested in the intersection between biomedical sciences and informatics, particularly medical students and computational biology students. It offers a wide perspective to the different areas of research and the tools that are available, so that we are exposed to the general knowledge to allow us to pursue either one of them more in-depth if necessary.",
    "I would certainly recommend that to other student. This course could give them a big picture of the whole realm, which will help them a lot for future research and study.",
    "I would definitely recommend it (also to non-bioinformaticians). See my first answer."

    "It broadens my knowledge of the tools that are available for me to use in my research and also the sources.",
    "In this course, I learned more about the realm I will be working on in the lecture part. I also found a lot of interesting website and tools in the demo part. The final project makes me focus on a specific research topic and see how the researchers deal with the issue step by step. I learned a lot in all those parts.",
    "I now have much more experience in giving talks and writing and also feel that I have a broader view of research in bioinformatics (what's known, what tools are available to me, etc.). I believe that this will be valuable for my future research."
