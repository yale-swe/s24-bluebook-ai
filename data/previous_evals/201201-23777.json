    "Take it!!! You will not regret it!",
    "This is exactly the kind of class more people should take (though not too many more!) It was a small, discussion-based class about really interesting and important texts without the seminar type of work (book a week\/long essay). I got a lot out of it as a senior, and I imagine it would have also been a good intro to political philosophy. Pablo is wonderful.",
    "This class covers a lot of important thinkers and topics, but it's can be tedious at times.",
    "Excellent course! Such a better alternative to MoFoPo. Good introduction\/survey of main thinkers on IR, and I enjoyed the focus on international law\/norms\/conflict\/human rights. It was a great philosophical basis for IR, especially regarding themes of war among states and international norm developments that are relevant to the modern era. There was flexibility with the syllabus, which was a plus. We spent the time we wanted to and felt was necessary per thinker, not rushing to jump to the next one, but dedicating due time and attention to each. Class discussions were fun and I looked forward to them. Always felt like I had learnt something in class and that there was an application to current IR questions.Prof Kalmanovitz was excellent. His lectures were engaging and were never top-down, but included discussion and thought. Class felt more like a conversation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. He is an extremely good professor and genuinely cares about the progress and development of students. He gives feedback on all papers, which is more than many other Yale professors. He is also very approachableand helpful during office hours.If I were around for another year, I would nominate him for a teaching award. Worth taking a class with him while you can!",
    "Yes, it's a small seminar style class. You'll get plenty of face to face time with the professor."
