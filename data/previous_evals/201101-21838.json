    "Yes. Good lab class. Not too much worth throughout the semester. Fun. And informative.",
    "This lab was pretty fun as we were a small group and actually got to know each other and the professor and TA. Also, for the most part the labs were rarely simply \"Run a test and wait\" that wasted our time. All of our projects had legitimate products. That doesn't mean there wasn't an obscene lab report, but everything else was fairly reasonable."
