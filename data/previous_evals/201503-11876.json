    "I'd totally recommend this class! Professor Ehrgood is an excellent teacher who is engaging and funny. Definitely shop the class to get a feeling for his style, which is quite unique, but I do think it works for most people. As for the class, I was trying to decide between this and English 114. For me, as someone who felt fairly confident writing standard college papers, 120 made more sense and I was really able to polish up my writing a lot. Also, this class would definitely be useful to people of any grade.",
    "Take it! English 120 will teach you how to articulate your ideas with grace, a skill that is lost sometimes in teaching strictly academic prose but is essential to writing well. Professor Ehrgood is fun, insightful, and kind and the readings for the class never feel like work because they are so interesting. (If I have gained anything from this class, it's a new list of authors I admire.)",
    "English 120 is a fantastic class--I'd recommend every freshman to take it. It made English fun in new ways. Take it with Ehrgood--he's great! However, I think this course does tend towards those who already have a good foundation in writing, since it taught more about stylistic technique than grammar or content of argument. However, I'd say this class offers a chance to be creative and fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It truly changed my view on English courses in college. I know a lot of people want to take this class, and there's a reason. The knowledge I learned will likely continue to affect how I read and write for many years to come. The assignments are exciting and the course is both laid-back and challenging.",
    "ENGL 120 Section 14 was one of the best classes of my semester and one I always looked forward to attending. The readings are well-curated and the class is energetic and engaging. The professor is very responsive and insightful in his comments to students.",
    "If you care about writing, think you might care about writing, or think you might someday want to learn to care about writing, you should take English 120 and, if you can, you should take it with Professor Andrew Ehrgood. The course itself has been well tested by generations of Yale students, and in terms of professors Professor Ehrgood is about as good as it gets. He is everything you probably think of when you think of a Yale English professor and more and he will teach you more about writing than you probably think you can learn.",
    "Take this class. It has been my most rewarding class that I've taken at Yale, and it will change the way you approach writing. Ehrgood is the best there is, and he will go out of his way to help you succeed. The class structure is focused around 5 essays in a peer-review format. Each of the essays has a first draft (ungraded) and a final draft. Professor Ehrgood gives great revision advice, and is a pleasure to work with. If you care at all about how you write and want to make it more beautiful, this is the class for you.",
    "ENGL 120 is a fantastic class if you like to write and are confident in your ability to do so. However, you may find that you do not gain as much from the in class discussions if you already have an strong background in creative nonfiction. I went into this class with a background in fiction and academic essays and found it a great exploration of a genre I have spent little time with in the past. However, don't feel daunted if you have no experience with any kind of creative writing. Professor Ehrgood is amazing and works extremely hard to give you in-depth comments and thoughts about all of your essays, so if you want to take this class, take it with him -- regardless of your strengths, you won't regret it.",
    "A challenging English course designed for those genuinely interested in improving theist writing and reading good prose in order to do so.",
    "I would say that English 120 is a great class if you want to learn to experiment with different writing styles and voices. Most high schoolers are skilled in writing formal essays, but English 120 forces us to expand our writing capabilities.",
    "English 120 is a phenomenal course. You learn to write longer form articles akin to those in the Atlantic or the New Yorker. You also learn to be careful about the words you're choosing and the type of persona you're creating in your writing. As someone who hasn't felt challenged in an English class since fifth grade, my brain has never hurt so much in an English class. This course makes you think deeply and at an extremely high level about writing. I highly recommend English 120 with Professor Ehrgood. He is the type of character you would expect from Yale's English Department--he gets mad at himself when he uses a vague word in describing something, and brings snacks for writing workshops. Beyond what may seem superficial, Professor Ehrgood immensely cares for his students. I was amazed at the amount of thought and care he put into our work. He finds delight in creativity and new ideas, and wants his students to formulate them as best as possible. I don't know much about the other professors--it seems some are better than others, so I would be careful in reading his or her ratings. The workload is slightly heavy but manageable. You alternate between writing one essay a week and redrafting another the next. There are readings at the beginning of a new unit (5 per semester) that are a bit long but really interesting and enjoyable. Occasionally, you have to write responses to classmates' work and readings. It would be possible to scrape by with not putting in that much of a time commitment, but you would just miss out on the class. A big part of this class is thinking about what you want to write about and how you're going to accomplish it."
