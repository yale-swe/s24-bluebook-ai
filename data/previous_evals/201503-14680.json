    "This class is useful after taking the econometrics sequence. It could use a bit more direction, but the final project is useful.",
    "This is an extremely relevant and helpful class who will launch start--or if you are experienced, propel your understanding of econometrics methods. Although the name of the course is microeconometrics, the Professor also allows final projects that go into macro or time series, which is very understanding and considerate of him. I extremely enjoyed reading the papers, and discussing some of the questions with the professor after class--and learnt so much because there were so many insights and interpretations that I could not have discovered on my own. The Professor was very patient in discussing questions and prompted me to explore how best I could improve my understanding of econometrics, by asking me questions that showed where my skillsets were lacking. Above all, he is an very gentle and caring professor who cared about our growth in the class, and was very fun and chill to get along with. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It heavily exposes you to actual econometric methods and how to apply them, instead of just theory. It also is a great chance to get experience writing an economics paper, and would be very useful to anyone looking to write a senior paper."
