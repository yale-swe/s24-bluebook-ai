   "comments": [
    "Take it with Prof. Donahue if you're feeling uncertain about your philosophy prowess - he is very patient and helpful even if you have a weaker philosophy background",
    "Amazing class. You really get to understand different \"systems,\" or frameworks for the evaluation and explanation of morality, states and economic evaluation. Very rewarding. The readings are basically 50 pages a week on average so unlike in other classes you end up actually doing the reading!",
    "If needed for EPE requirement and the other sections seems a little too intense for your taste, definitely take it!",
    "For EP&E majors: it's a must, but shop different offerings of this course if you have the option.For non-EP&E majors: it's a course that's poised to do great things, but really there's not enough time to gain a good understanding of all those classical texts from the political, economic, and ethical realms. You can probably gain more from taking a class that specializes in one of those areas.",
    "If you are an EPE major, Professor Donahue is an great choice! He is rigorous in his approach to arguments and thoughtful in his responses to your own papers. For those who have taken DS: you may find the text and passage selection repetitious; there is an 80% overlap with texts selected for H&P\/Philosophy (new authors are Hegel and a few welfare economists, and you read new woks from Rousseau and Hume). Then again, you may enjoy exploring these texts again and asking more stringent and contextualized questions. The workload is not extraordinary.I would recommend other courses to non-majors. The arc of the course is a bit listless.",
    "Classics of EP&E is a fast-paced course which examines some of the foundational works of philosophy, political thought and normative economics. The course covers Aristotle, Mill, Hobbes, Kant, Rousseau, Marxian theory and a handful of modern welfare economists. Although the class has to move quickly to cover these works, the opportunity to delve deep into these works exists, as students usually have previously taken foundational courses.",
    "Classics of EPE is a reasonably good seminar on political philosophy that also touches upon requisite ethical philosophy as well as the underlying principles of modern economics, specifically welfare economics. While Professor Donahue is good, the philosophers areones you will read in other classes, so Professor Kapustin's class might be a little less stale."
