    "This class has potential, and due to the lighting practicals I did learn very minimal basics in how to hang and strike a light, as well as, how to think artfully about light (in a way that I hadn't in the past). Outside of that I thought the class was pretty terrible. The professor is clearly very knowledgeable about light design, but he does not know how translate that knowledge to the class, and in all honesty he could really benefit from taking a intro class to teaching. Not all professionals are teachers...Roberts heart was always in the right place in terms of wanting to teach, but he often overlooked student engagement, was very frazzled, and would be absent quite often. His absences often lead to us repeatedly going over the same information multiple times for consecutive classes. I would have loved to go over the theory of light, or how light can be a character in a play...I really don't think Robert should teach this class, or he should have a co-teacher (like Aaron) to fill in where he lacks."
