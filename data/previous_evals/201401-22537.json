    "Second semester of Mol Rad: much calmer and loads of fun topics! A required course. If Prof. Schmuttenmaer is teaching it you are in a for a treat.",
    "I would recommend this course as it will strengthen your background in spectroscopy",
    "This is a very useful class in spectroscopy. If you are in this field, definitely take it.",
    "This course is good to study spectroscopy. Rotational and Vibrational spectroscopy chapters were great.",
    "This was a good class. The problem sets make learning the material relatively easy. The exams were also very reasonable, however I wish we would given a bit more time to take the exams."

    "Deepened my knowledge very much. Experimental spectroscopy is not my field, but I am well prepared to argue with others on the science!",
    "It deepens my knowledge in the corresponding area.",
    "I used several programs (Mathematica, Phython, Excel, Origin and Prism)Problem sets are good to practice using different programs. It provides basic ideas about the programs which I will use in my research",
