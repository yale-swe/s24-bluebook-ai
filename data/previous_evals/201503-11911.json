    "If you want a hard class that forces you to really examine Romantic Poetry take this class.",
    "Your conception of yourself and your mind will change after this class. I barely talked in class, but I really think Brisman is the best discussion leader I've ever had. The poetry is all wonderful, but difficult. I took this as a sophomore, not having taken 125 yet, but I still got so much out of the class. I suppose maybe taking it later would have allowed me to understand discussion better, but I am so glad to have taken this class. Even when I didn't do the reading (DO THE READING AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, I am just a lazy person), I often came out of class refreshed. Most classes come with multiple revelations and multiple mind-benders. Brisman is intimidating, but really so nice. At the very least, you WILL love Keats after this class. Hopefully you'll love the rest of the poets too. My highest recommendation! I am also a much better poetry reader too!",
    "A great course. Take it for Brisman and his passion for the material in addition to the fact that Romanticism is fascinating, beautiful, and relevant. Workload is eminently reasonable.",
    "This class was really interesting. The reading is kick-ass. It doesn't get much better than Romantic poetry, and Leslie Brisman provides some really interesting arguments and suggestions about the poetry. He also does a good job of contextualizing it's relevance historically and today. The class doesn't have too much work. I was always able to complete the readings comfortably by class, and the class only has three sections. I would really recommend this for anyone who likes Romantic poetry, or is interested in British lit.",
    "Recommended for anyone with a serious interest in learning about the literature of the period, literature in general, or important questions about living. The worth and importance of the poems themselves aside, you may not find another person in the English department whose relation to these poems is as profound and accessible as Brisman's is. Class in ENGL 250 with Prof. Brisman is regularly amazing, and the concerns (and his lesson plans) are so varied that you end up with a DIVERSITY of fantastic sessions.",
    "Any English major should study these poets--every reading is worth doing. Leslie Brisman is a sensitive and knowledgeable guide to the material, which is primarily poetry (and a bit of prose). Seminar erred more on the side of lecture than discussion, partly because our class was pretty quiet. Brisman is generous with his time during office hours and particular about what he wants in essays, so go visit. One last thing: grades are not given on papers unless requested. Brisman is a tougher grader than most in the English dpt, so unless you are fairly confident or want to wait until the end of the semester to see how you've done, I would ask him how you're doing and discuss what kind of improvements you need to make.",
    "ENGL 250 was a wonderful survey of Romantic poets and themes. I appreciated the more in-depth considerations of individual poets and discussions on how different poets influenced each other. The course was a great way to fulfill the pre-1900 requirement. Professor Brisman was, as always, a superb instructor caring and insightful and Mr. Ellison was brilliant in the few classes that he led. Take it!",
    "Must-take!",
    "English 250 was a good class and Professor Brisman is very nice and brilliant. But you should know that he has a very specific teaching style that you might not enjoy. Each class begins with a fairly narrow thematic question, which we then discuss by trying to discuss very specific issues in a handful of short, isolated sections of the text. We examine these excerpts out of order, which can be frustrating. Professor Brisman always has a plan, which can be good or bad. The class is more of a lecture than a seminar, and when Professor Brisman opens the class for discussion, it's usually to ask students to take one side or the other of a question he has already formulated. But if you like Romantic poetry you should definitely take this class."
