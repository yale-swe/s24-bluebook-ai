    "Reading through a set of papers on the most recent developments in chemical biology within the past year has taught me how to critically evaluate the literature. Along the way I've picked up new or recent techniques used in the field, and the two presentations we each had to give (one individually and one as a group) was good practice. Many of the papers involved a drug design component that was extremely instructive and useful for me.",

    "The paper-a-week format (and quiz every class written by the student presenting the paper) was effective. Sometimes the quiz may have been a little harder or too focused on the details, but overall they were relatively fair. Some of the papers could have benefitted from being paired with other companion papers to help contextualize the focus and provide more details to help read the \"main\" paper.",

    "No",
    "The course is an excellent survey of recent developments in chemical biology via critical reading of papers in the field (all papers from the past year). In each class we critically evaluated the results and data of each paper and had a thorough discussion. For each paper there is a quiz in class, written by the student presenting that paper, and each student presents a paper at least once. There were two exams, one on the first half of the semester's papers, and the second on the second half of papers. Many of the questions were based on ones submitted by the student presenters, with some questions written by Professor Schepartz herself.",
