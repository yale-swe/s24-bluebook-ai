   "comments": [
    "Take this course! The work is very manageable and you feel like your knowledge of linguistics\/anthropology is building very organically",
    "Intro to Linguistic Anthropology is a great overview of the subject. It feels kind of scattered, since the topics covered vary widely and the connections between them are not always immediately clear. The subject is definitely a very niche one, so I probably wouldn't recommend this for someone just trying to get their social science credit out of the way. The foundational readings at the beginning of the year are brutal and dense, but class discussion helps clarify them and the readings get easier as the semester progresses. The midterm and final were fairly fun because we all got to write about topics of our choosing that we cared about.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student at Yale. It is fun, insightful, and the professor is excellent."
