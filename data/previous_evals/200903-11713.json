    "Pretty standard physics course. Problem sets can be a doozy, but the material itself doesn't go too far beyond high school AP. Then again, I've missed more than a month of class this semester, so I could be unreliable. Still doing fine, though.",
    "You're probably considering the other introductory physics lectures. I can't speak for the difference between 200 and 260, but 200 is definitely better than 150 and 180. Though, if you're considering 200, you probably have enough math background to skip over 150 (which doesn't use calculus and kinda presents you equations and tells you to go wild with them, without really explaining where they come from). 180 uses calculus, but is less rigorous than 200. Overall, I wouldn't say that 200 used that much math. Know what a derivative is (like, do you actually know what a derivative is, not just how to take one?)? Do you understand what an integral of one variable is? Do you kinda know what a partial derivative is (not really necessary...)? Then take 200. It won't be the math that really hurts you in this class - it'll be trying to figure out how to set up problems, which equations to use, and really understanding what's going on - but you'll have that challenge in 150 and 180 as well.Harris is a good teacher. Not boring, kinda funny, clear, comprehensible, and sometimes fun.",
    "YES. Great class, fun. I am not a clicker person so I loved the way this course went. ALSO, NO ONLINE HOMEWORK.",
    "Great class. If you're prospective physics\/physical science major, or someone who is generally interested in physics and has a decent math background, go for it.",
    "It's physics- you know what you're getting into. If you find it interesting then you will find the class interesting and if you don't then you won't. Luckily I like physics but the professor was dry (although occasionally witty) and didn't make the class incredibly engaging. I don't think it's outrageously hard although it is challenging... still physics will help change how you think about the world so it is an important class to take.",
    "Really difficult.",
    "An introductory physics course, focused on mechanics. It included kinematics, Newton's laws, work and energy, gravitation, momentum, rotational mechanics, a brief introduction to special relativity, harmonic oscillations, waves, and an introduction to thermodynamics. The course was somewhat more in-depth than AP physics, especially in the study of oscillations and waves. Some mathematical background, such as Taylor series and complex numbers, is useful, though it is explained in the course before it is used. Calculus, of course, is necessary. I recommend this course for anyone interested in physics, even if you aren't going to major in it, although people who have less mathematica background should probably go into lower levels. This is the kind of course that covers a lot of material in not so much depth, and makes me want to take more advanced physics courses.",
    "Highly recommended to students who want a deep understanding of basic physical principles without getting too theoretical. The mathematics behind the physics is very understandable and follow-able to students with sufficient background in calculus (both differential and integral). Great professor who presents the materials very well and in a way that is easy to follow. The homework might be difficult\/tedious, but working together with classmates definitely help.",
    "It's intro physics, a little beyond what you learned in AP Physics C in high school. None of the concepts were particularly difficult, but sometimes the problem sets took a while to figure out. However, if you haven't already taken physics, it might be a little difficult because basic concepts are taught rather quickly.",
    "I took Physics C and lectures were a bit on the boring side but the problem sets were challenging. Make sure you do attend the lectures and start problem sets early. But I am sure it isn't as difficult as 260.",
    "If you've taken calculus and are looking for an intro physics course, do PHYS 200 if nothing else because of Jack Harris. He's a great lecturer. I came into the class having literally no expectations for physics, and he made it a lot of fun. I always made sure to make it to lecture. He's that good. The class is difficult, of course, but it my eye well worth it.",
    "I took Physics C in high school, and the first half of the semester was material I'd seen before, but we went into more depth, and the problems were much tougher. The problem sets are very difficult, but you can figure them out together. Harris is clear, but class sometimes drags on.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 200 if you have a decent math and physics background in high school. It is a good overview of mechanics, relativity, waves, and thermodynamics. The lectures are a bit tedious at times, but generally very interesting. The problem sets are difficult but definitely doable.",
    "Yes. It is an interesting course that stresses derivation of laws more than other courses I have taken.",
    "I would take this class if you have to take an intro physics course - the calculus in the class is not that challenging, and it really gives you a better perspective on how physics works in our daily life. All in all, a good class!",
    "Physics 200 is for those not ready for physics 260 but with an AP Physics background. Take it!",
    "It's easier than with Shankar, but don't take it if you're premed unless you really love physics. It's definitely a step up from the lower levels and be prepared to put in decent hours for the PSETs and the exams.",
    "If you want a good solid understanding of physics and can handle rigorous psets, go ahead and take this class, especially if you want to be an engineering or physics major.",
    "Yep. Good course. The problem sets are very manageable, and it answers a lot of the questions you probably had in high school about how mechanics all fits together.",
    "A great course that will teach you a lot! Problem sets are hard. Facility in math is a plus. I took multivariable in highschool as well as both Physics C exams (but I had not done a QR since Junior year).",
    "This is a tough course, and definitely intended for those who have a background in physics and calculus (or math 120). It's not that much work but conceptually, it will be challenging. Professor Harris is the best professor I've had at Yale, so if he's teaching it, I would highly recommend this course (it made me switch from Phys 180 to 200). The work load is fair, and there's only one midterm.",
    "Physics 200 is a good physics course for students who have a solid background in physics. The course covers a lot of material, and the professor doesn't have time to get through it all during class, so a lot of questions go unanswered if you didn't already have a decent understanding of the material. That said, it's a nice course to ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of elementary physics before you go on to higher level physics courses.",
    "Physics 200 is a rigorous introductory physics course which covers the basics of mechanics, heat, thermodynamics, special relativity, static equilibrium, waves, and [simple]harmonic motion. The class consistently incorporates multivariable calculus and differential equations in lecture, yet homework problems typically do not incorporate more than algebra and, on occasion, single variable calculus. Overall, I would recommend this course to another student with a strong background in math and physics interested in learning about the physical world and the laws which govern nature. Professor Jack Harris is not the most charismatic of teachers; however he is truly a gifted physicist with knowledge and insight into the various topics covered in class. Weekly problem sets are assigned and are useful in gauging one\u0092s understanding of the previous week\u0092s material and are usually more difficult than the two exams which are of an appropriate level of difficulty for a 200-level course. Professor Harris also has the \u0093Amnesty Plan\u0094 which allows your midterm grade to be ignored if your performance on the final is better than your performance on the midterm. Overall, there is not much problem solving in class and the lack of problem solving sessions (outside the weekly study hall) is a major weakness\/flaw in the class and often the TAs aren\u0092t very helpful if you do approach them with a question.",
    "It was difficult for someone who had only taken AP Physics B and Calc AB, but if you want to be challenged give it a go.",
    "Professor Harris is the best math or science lecturer I've had in three semesters at Yale! His lectures were always clear and well-organized, and he wrote all of the important notes on the board. Most of the lectures were devoted to deriving equations, so PHYS 200 really requires a strong background in calculus and physics (I think most people in the class took AP physics in high school.) The TAs host study halls Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights of each week, and I ended up going one night most weeks to get help on homework.",
    "Strong intro, slightly beyond AP but certainly manageable.",
    "I liked it. Jack was a good teacher and hilarious to boot. The curve was fair but the midterm-drop policy, while potentially useful, did not matter in the end with a very difficult final. Psets weren't too hard.",
    "It's your typical calculus based Physics course. Definitely not an easy class, but managable.",
    "A challenging introduction to basic newtonian physics. If you have had a solid background in AP\/IB, then you would probably be prepared for it.",
    "Difficult Final and a little tricky at the end of the material.",
    "I would summarize the class as a somewhat dry, boring, but necessary class that imparts a fairly solid knowledge of classical mechanics, relativity, waves and thermodynamics. I would recommend the class to anybody who seeks this information, but it's definitely not a \"dipping-one's-toes-into-an-interesting-science-topic\" class.",
    "I liked this class. I don't feel like I learned all that much stuff that I hadn't learned in AP, but the problem sets were a good level, and Harris' lectures were both clear and enjoyable. If you've taken some physics so far and want to do problems that make you think without being too horribly difficult or challenging, I recommend this class",
    "Physics 200 is a very challenging and very rewarding course. Prof. Harris rushes at times in lecture and can bea bit dry, but he is always clear and articulate. The first half on mechanics was much easier than the second half on relativity, waves, thermodynamics, etc. Although the problem sets were difficult, the study halls were a great resource. Overall, I would recommend the course since it is a great overview to physics, useful for many distribution requirements, and contains a few brilliant proofs that are critical to understanding the physical universe.",
    "Its a great physics class. I truly believe that you should challenge yourself at Yale, and take the class that engages your mind the most, without going over your head. If you've seen physics and calculus before, take 200.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to take intro physics and has taken at AP or IB Physics in the past. I had taken AP Physics B and IB Physics SL and I think I was at about the right level going in. Be warned, however - the problem sets get tricky and you'll want to find someone with whom you can go over them before you turn them in.",
    "I guesstake it if you did well on AP physics C. This class has problems conveying information but you can overcome that with independent studying. Don't take 180 because you'll just be really bored... If you're good enough to be in 260 go ahead and take it, maybe they will teach it more conceptually and therefore better.",
    "A difficult but very very rewarding introduction into the mechanical physics. More appropriate for students that took some physics in high school and have a knowledge of calculus.",
    "Physics 200 is a continuation of AP C. You'll find yourself reviewing a bunch of the AP C mechanics concepts, but then you'll learn a slew of new topics. Unless you're a COMPLETE hot-shot at physics and think you can take 260, I'd recommend this course.",
    "Do not take this class without an adequate physics or math background. I took this class with only physics B, and it was a struggle since most people have seen physics with calculus before. Be careful and shop around to find the right level, do not simply choose the level that you were recommended for.",
    "I would recommend this course if you had a strong physics program in high school. The material isn't too hard, but the tests are. The professor is very clear and methodical in teaching the material, but that causes the class to go slowly sometimes. However, students are still responsible for material not covered in lecture (all 20 chapters of the book plus special relativity).There is some overlap at the end of the semester between the material covered in this class and Chem 118.",
    "This is quite a difficult course, especially if you don't have a lot of background in physics. The lectures were interesting; the problem sets can be quite difficult, however. The help sessions are always available; but if you never think through the problem sets yourself, you can crash and burn during the exams.",
    "This is a tough course that requires a good math background to make it through. If you're not an engineering or physics major 180 might be a little bit better. Jack Harris is an excellent lecturer and absolutely HILARIOUS lecturer, however.",
    "Physics 200 is definitely a challenge. If you really enjoy physics and are looking for a challenging course, go for it. If not, take 180.",
    "Decent introduction to physics, not a terrible workload. Compared to previous years, a lot has been cut from the course, so it will feel like a lot of review if you have good physics prep.",
    "Yes, if you want to know more about physics in an introductory kind of way.",
    "Yes- if you are premed consider phys 180. but if you are up for the challenge (ie never had physics in high school) then its worth it. Just be prepared to have to catch up from students that have taken physics.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who has ahd a background in high school physics, and finds the subject interesting. Most people end up taking teh easy way out in physics and take 180, even though they know all the concepts. I would encourage them to take this class instead. You definitely learn more, and that's really the point, isn't it?",
    "Physics 200 has the potential to be an exciting and informative class, however it really depends on the professor. The homework and exams tested one's ability to recall formulas not their ability to understand concepts. Lectures were unhelpful and often time would have been better spent reading the textbook. While I may still recommend this course to a friend, I would advise them to be careful when selecting a professor.",
    "This is a good course for prospective physics majors. I took it because I thought I wanted to be a physics major, but over the course of the semester I found out that wasn't really where my passion was. The course was generally well-taught, but the material was very technical and required significant amounts of work outside of class to understand. I had seen a fair amount of physics in high school, and I felt like this course was very challenging. Overall, the course is a good option for people who want to major in physics, probably not the best for those who don't.",
    "Great class. Learned a lot. Reasonable workload, but hard material so there was time to learn the material not just do work. Good lectures although class was much more focused on derivations (which were interesting) than p-sets and tests. Not necessarily a bad thing though. I learned a lot and honed my problem solving skills. Good choice after AP physics.",
    "If you've taken AP Physics in high school and would like to continue studying physics but are not thoroughly prepared for Physics 260, Physics 200 is a terrific choice.",
    "Physics 200 is a good introduction to calculus-based physics. Don't be fooled: the lectures may be easy to follow but there always seem to be problems that make you think a fair amount on the problem sets. That's why I like this class - if you don't have the time to devote to 260, but you want to still be reasonably challenged by your physics class, 200 is the perfect class to take. I'd recommend it.",
    "It was a good class, but I have no idea what my grade is going to be because the final was worth so much.",
    "Yes it's a good class, and fulfills requirements for many majors. Not too hard, but you should definitely like physics and science.",
    "A good introductory physics course. Will be difficult if you haven't had the math background. But the problem sets and exams are straightforward and not all that challenging.",
    "I'd recommend Physics 200 for students taking physics for the first time looking for a challenging intro course that covers all the basics of physics. If you've had a more extensive background in physics I'd probably recommend Physics 260.",
    "If you are interested in taking an intro physics class and you've taken a physics class in high school and are familiar with single-variable calculus, then 200 is a good choice. The workload isn't very demanding - one problem set a week that takes around 3 hours.",
    "Would not recommend. Take 180.",
    "If you are coming in at the right math level and with at least a basic introduction to physics, then this class is for you. Otherwise I would recommend starting at physics 180.",
    "Phys 200 is a great course that has a smaller class size and more generous curve than Phys 180 (as I understand it). You also don\u0092t have to deal with the buzzers that you do in Phys 180. The first half of the term covers topics at the AP Physics C Mech level (but not any more advanced), and the second half of the term covers the rest of the Physics C Mech topics plus some material at a more advanced level. A fairly basic calculus background should cover most of the math for the class, though multivariable can help. Prof. Harris is a great lecturer and is good at answering questions, well-organized, and clear. If you\u0092re comfortable with AP Physics C, this term will probably not be difficult, and the problem sets should not take more than 2 to 3 hours per week (that\u0092s the only homework). If you\u0092ve done AP Physics B or other honors Physics (non-calculus based), this class is still definitely doable, though it will require a bit more work. I would be wary of taking the class if you\u0092ve not done any Physics before, as the material is presented very quickly and the curve is biased by many students who have taken Physics.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who have previously taken calculus and physics and want a more solid foundation in physics.",
    "I would recommend it as a base intro physics class. however, it did not encourage much engagement with the material and I'm not certain I will continue to take the course next semester, in part due to my disinterest in that semester's focus.",
    "The class is fairly straightforward and basically covers the Physics C curriculum. It does not go into too much math, and the problem sets are good preparation for the test. Watch out, though - while the material is easy in the beginning of the semester, it suddenly gets twice as hard after the midterm. The class won't make you hate physics, though it won't make you love it either.",
    "This is an introductory physics class. We covered kinematics, Newton's laws, Conservation of Energy, rotational motion\/torque, special relativity, SHM, Waves, and the Zeroth and First Laws of Thermodynamics.Take this if you like physics and are looking for a little more of a challenge. Otherwise, find something else. The primary issue with this class is that we, at times, were asked to do things that involve somewhat advancedmathematics (e.g. line integrals for work, volume integrals for centers of mass and moments of inertia) without actually having developed these tools in class. If you are going to take this class, I suggest familiarizing yourself with multi-variable calculus so that when you do need to do these things you will know how. Granted, such instances were pretty infrequent. It was frustrating, though, especially since they gave little to no mathematical prerequisites for the class.Lastly -- there is a lot of hand-waving in derivations. If this bothers you, think before you take this course.",
    "The actual math is not bad at all but most of the students do have a very strong physics and math background. I took Math 120 freshman year, physics in high school (although not at an AP level), and then took this class as a junior and found it challenging. I did learn a lot, though, and ended up really really really loving the subject. Physics 200 ended up as one of my favorite classes.",
    "It was a standard mechanics course. Covered projectile motion, forces, rotational motion, universal gravitation, waves and an introduction to thermodynamics. Most problems that used calculus did not require much prior experience.",
    "Good lectures and clear notes but grading on exams is extremely harsh (I got 15 points deducted on a 20 point question for using the complement of the given angle rather than the angle). If there is a curve, it was never mentioned in class. Also know that there are no sections where you review or ask questions--just physics study hall where other students work on homework problems together.",
    "It is a decent course for those who think they won't be able to handle the more intensive 260, and does go into much more material than high school level courses. Assignments can be challenging but are doable due to the encouraged collaboration.",
    "If you are comfortable with the math required and used in this course (mostly derivatives and integrals and hardly anything more advanced than that), then take this class instead of 150 or 180. The challenge will either be the math or the physics problem solving skills, and if it's the latter, you'll have the same problem in any physics class. They accommodate students with weak physics backgrounds fairly well.If you don't particularly like math or science and are looking for distributional or skills requirements, take something else. This class isn't overwhelmingly difficult, but it isn't easy either.",
    "It's not an exceptionally engaging class, the book is less than desirable (read: atrocious) and Jack Harris, while starting the year off strong, gradually decreased in his lecturing quality. More importantly, though, if you have any concern for your grades, take it only if you have exposure to the material at a real level. I was placed into this on the basis of a subject test 800 and five on the Calculus BC AP exam, and felt overwhelmed throughout the semester by unfamiliarity with the problems and how to approach them, something compounded by the fact that all of my classmates had seemingly taken AP Physics B or C and had encountered the common problem types before. If you need to take introductory physics and have taken the APs in high school, I'd say take this. Otherwise, even if initially placed here by the DUS, I would recommend dropping down to 180. (You could also start with this, and if the first midterm mauls you make the switch; the physics department facilitates painless transfers between the introductory physics courses.)",
    "I would recommend this to a student who already has a fair background in physics and math. The weekly problem sets aren't always easy but the TAs in the study sessions are very helpful so you can always get everything done in time. Don't expect the lectures to be entertaining, Jack Harris is nice but he gets a little boring. I personally don't like it when professors teach\/ read out from their notes, so I didn't like the professor much but I enjoyed the class nonetheless.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it; it's a solid physics course with a decent amount of calculus support.",
    "I would not recommend you do what I do which is take 200 and have no physics background. Instead, swallow your pride and take 180 or 150. You will have a more pleasant life.Harris is a veryclear teacher. His one-two punch of clarity and composure makes physics a very sanitary, perhaps even clinical affair. Which is nice, because when you are freaking out before an exam, you remember your calm professor and for a moment, are calm with him.I don't know why this is relevant.If you have physics background, this course shouldn't be to difficult.",
    "A good class. If you've had a solid physics course in high school (AP), then you might have a tough choice. I hear 260 is quite hard and theoretical and filled with really nerdy and studious physics-lovers who have \"a flair for mathematics.\" The problem is, 200 is pretty tough too, but only a couple topics (relativity and harmonic motion, and a bit of sound) were new for me, so it was really boring. I hear 180 is really straightforward if you've already taken physics and are any good at math, so I wouldn't bother with it.",
    "Physics 200 could theoretically be a good class, depending on who is teaching it. I would not recommend it unless the quality of teaching and teaching support staff (i.e. TFs) is improved. The material is challenging, but the course was lacking on several accounts. Student-faculty interaction was not particularly constructive in this course, lectures could have been better organized and presented, the professor could have been a lot more passionate about the material, and the course failed miserably in teaching students how to be better critical thinkers and problem solvers.You get the material you've essentially learned in AP Physics C repackaged in a more confusing way, with some extra stuff tacked on, and no little, to no helpful guidance, as to how to actually DO physics, i.e. solve problems, how to think like a scientist, and how to be better prepared for future science courses.",
    "I would not recommend this class. However, this class really depends on the teacher and what kind of teaching style that the student is used to.",
    "I would recommend Physics 200 to those who have more preparation in physics classes. If not, I would recommend taking Physics 180 or 150.",
    "Be cautious. You really need to have taken AP physics before this class."
