    "THIS CLASS IS THE BEST EVER. Seriously, you would be a fool not to take it. The extreme epicness of CHEM 562 continues, only with MORE AWESOME. You probably won't be able to build a gigantic telescope next year :( but you'll learn a huge amount of valuable skills, I'm sure. TAKE IT!"

    "This class is absolutely essential for everyone from physicists and chemists to geophysicists. Without this course, I would be a skill less Neanderthal. Multitudes of undergrads and grad students use the SCL stundent shop on a regular basis. Please continue to support it generously and allow Dave to share his plethora of expertise with us lucky individuals."
