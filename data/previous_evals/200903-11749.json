   "comments": [
    "The work load is very manageable - the readings are concise but pertinent, the book report is on a book that isn't too long and is interesting, and the mid-term was doable for those who studied. Although Professor Allouche is great and really funny, note-taking can be very difficult, as his lectures seem to be slightly sporadic.",
    "I would recommend it as a good rest of world class for history majors. It's not too tough and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "For History Rest of World credit, yes.",
    "Interesting subject matter but not executed well. I would not recommend it if you want an interesting course because it is painful to sit through. But low workload option for pre-industrial and non-western requirements of the history major.",
    "Only if you're taking it for a history requirement. It's a good course for that category, but there are better classes if you just want a good lecture on the Middle East.",
    "The course is good for the material it teaches. I had a little bit of background knowledge about the Islamic world coming in, but Professor Allouche gave a lot more detail about themes that held true across the era. Not the most interesting lecture style, but good information. I would recommend the course to someone who either has an interest in Islamic history or needs a relatively easy non-western history course to fill major requirements",
    "It's pretty interesting and not hard, so yes. Especially if you need an \"other world\" class for the history major",
    "recommend it",
    "It's a good history lecture, but not a great one. The lectures for the first half were very well organized and straightforward, but in the second half they seemed very disjointed and kind of unorganized. By the end of the semester, though, I realized that it's actually just because the history after the first half is kind of disjointed itself. Allouche is very easy-going (you get used to his accent quickly enough), and the workload isn't bad at all. Decent ROW requirement filler, good intro to Islamic history, but can definitely be boring at times and hard to follow.",
    "If you want an easy third world history class, don't like section, and are interested in the time period, and do not mind boring lectures (for the most part), then take it.",
    "This class is a decent survey course of early Islamic history. The focus is on political and religious history, so those interested on social and cultural history will be disappointed. Professor Allouche does a good job connecting medieval history to current Islamic practices, but sometimes you wish that he stuck to the subject more. I'd recommend the class to those who know very little about Islam and medieval middle eastern history, but not for those who want to go significnatly deeper than the caliphates, sultanates, and Islamic sects.",
    "Intimate class setting, I loved it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Allouche makes Islam as a religion and force for empire during the period from about 600-1200 A.D. very accessible, and his expectations and assignments are very straightforward and fair. Weekly reading responses are required, which sometimes turns people away from courses, butin this case, I thought that doing the responses was valuable and kept me disciplined with the reading (which is not heavy), and a fair trade-off for not writing a major research paper, for instance.",
    "Fair assignments\/tests. Good readings. Have to go to the lectures even though they are often hard to follow. Allouche is approachable and knowledgeable. Overall, it's a good course to take and you will get out of it what you put in.",
    "I would recommend the course, but understand the professor can be somewhat disorganized in the second half of the course.",
    "Take this class if you're actually interested in the Middle East, and its medieval history. If you're looking for an introduction to the region, I don't think the class is quite dynamic enough to spark interest that isn't already present.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is a great way to fulfill the rest of the world requirement for the history major. You will learn a great deal of information about Islamic history, which is important to know about in the modern world. The one concern to have is that Professor Allouche's lecturing is fantastic for the beginning of class but then is very scattered at the end. Overall, a good history course with not too much work.",
    "Good choice for a non-US non-European history credit."
