   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! It'll make you want to be a History of Art major.",
    "Great course- fun, interesting, informative, and overall very enjoyable. I highly recommend this course, whether to count towards a major or just for fun!",
    "If you're interested in the material, yes, absolutely. If not, I guess consider that it is not a hard class and can sometimes be very interesting (and sometimes painfully boring). It really is kind of a survey, you don't learn very many technical terms, etc.",
    "i would if you are prepared to take it credit\/d",
    "Sweet professor, but lots of cramming\/memorization.",
    "I would recommend the course if you are interested in the subject. Otherwise, it probably gets a bit detailed and I would just recommend the Intro to Art History Survey.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ancient Greek Art and Architecture. This course may not have the luster of Nemerov's, but if you put in the time, you will walk away knowing an incredible professor and possessing a knowledge of the foundation of all Western art. I especially recommend the class for students coming out of Professor Kagan's Greek history lecture in the fall.Course requirements were reasonable: a 2 page response, midterm, 10 page research paper, and final. Although the material didn't always have me jumping out of my seat (you should have an interest in the subject at the outset), the knowledge I took definitely has me interested in pursuing other art history offerings at Yale. Overall, a solid class with an entirely reasonable workload and a great professor.",
    "If you care about Art or Art history or you study the classical Mediterranean, it is imperative that you take this class, along with either Roman Architecture or Roman Art. Prof. Gaifman is a good lecturer, incredibly knowledgeable and helpful; the class will teach you a lot without being too terribly taxing; you will also have a much greater appreciation for artistic traditions after the course is over.",
    "Interesting class, definitely worth taking. Not much work, just reading and then cramming for midterms\/finals can be tedious but not too bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in greek art and architecture. I came into the class not knowing what to expect and thought it would just be a boring class, but it was actually fun going to lectures and hearing about the greek myths. We learned a lot about Greek society and the gods and goddesses of the ancient greeks. The two museum visits were also very interesting as well.",
    "Keep up with the readings and lectures and commit the works to memory. Everything else falls into place nicely if you get the memorization out of the way and keep abreast of the course material.",
    "Definitely. You will learn a lot about very important and famous art and architecture, providing you with a solid foundation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about ancient Greece since you learn a lot about not only Greek art but also some Greek history and mythology. Professor Gaifman is also great, and she set up a couple of sessions in the Yale Art Gallery, which were really cool. The workload isn't too heavy, but you do have to write a research paper.",
    "Yes, definitely. If you have a lot of science classes, its a good way to think in a different way.",
    "A good overview of all Greek Art and Architecture. A tad dry at times, but overall pretty exciting and informative. Professor Gaifman is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, and does her best to keep kids involved and interested. Some of the material is really cool, particularly how it ties in with Homer. I would strongly advise doing the reading, it's crucial. A good elective.",
    "This course is a great introduction to Greek art. It covers a lot and teaches you the fundementals of Greek art. The readings and lectures are fun.",
    "This Greek art and architecture class is an extensive survey of the history of Greek craft from the early 13th century BC to the 1st century AD. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in either art history in architecture, and I am glad to have been able to experience Professor Gaifman's knowledge and guidance."
