    "This class gave me a set of tools that will be useful for both research and teaching. I feel I'm comfortable with the basic readings and authors in this field, and would have an idea of where to look for more specific questions or angles, in whatever comes next. I feel excited to take another history class where I could use some of the approaches we studied. I suspect this would open up some of the conclusions that were just coming together towards the end.",
    "To pause with an object, and try to look at its presence both in the past, and how it might move forward through time. Certain things today seem as though they have transcended decades because of their design and function, while others are fleeting. As a designer, its important to ask what compels us to hold on to things. Ive also become interested in the support system of objects, through the process of archiving and display.",
    "I learned the \"histories\" of various topics related to various subsets of 'material culture' I learned to respond critically and thoroughly to the history of things, that multiple histories are possible",
    "This course introduced me to material culture, its history, methods, and themes. I learned how to think differently about objects, as well as the study of history generally. This course enabled me to think in a much richer way about my own work."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - Great space to discuss ideas amongst students of diverse disciplines. - \"Bring an object to class\" was an excellent way to engage with the material. - Getting a chance to leave the classroom space via visit to conservation room was great. - Instructors have a lot of knowledge and expertise. Weaknesses: - Would be nice to have a more diverse set of readings that deal with material culture outside of Europe. If this is not possible (due to the contours of the field for ex.), then address why this might be so and include that in class discussions. - \"Bring an object to class\" should be structured like discussed on the last day of class - each person presenting 2-3 times in a semester in order to maximize discussion time. - Would love to engage with Yale through material culture (visiting different spaces, talking to different people throughout the institution, etc). - If it is meant to be a research seminar, the last few weeks should have less reading and perhaps provide a space like a working group for us to engage with each other on our projects.",
    "I think the difficulties of this class reflect difficulties in material culture. As a comparatively new field, it seems that much of \"doing material culture\" is defining what you mean by \"doing material culture.\" As a result, the fabric of the class sometimes felt threadbare. We were trying to talk between authors who might disagree with one another on multiple scales at the same time. This is different than compiling readings in a better-established field. It made the class exciting and open, but often I wished we might have spent an entire class session drilling into just one or two readings instead of 4, 5, or 6. I, at least, sometimes felt unequal to the task of bringing together many dense articles that often disagreed about the basic shape of their field. However, by and large, this class strategy--letting the class actually reflect and engage the uncertainty and looseness of the field--worked. And, I'm not sure how it could have been otherwise (except for perhaps concentrating on a few fewer readings). Professors Bertucci and Ramlingam offered a robust reading list and syllabus and we were usually able to stretch the discussion to accommodate the larger-order questions that emerged between our readings.",
    "This was my first course outside of the School of Art. I enjoyed the class discussions and looked forward to seeing everyones objects each week (I could see this practice working well in some of my past design courses as well). For me, the object presentations began to shift towards the digital because I could be more broad with what I chose I had so many physical things I had wanted to bring, but my collections are in storage. There could be a couple of alternate weeks where we could go more in depth with the collections on campus. I thought that introducing selected readings by the students was a good way to see through the lenses of our classmates: perhaps having one of these sessions in the middle of the semester would be a fruitful addition. The field trip was great, and really contextualize the readings during that week. Perhaps students could make a list of collections from their departments as possible resources.",
    "The course presents a new and relevant approach to history as a field, which I found interesting. I think the course could have benefited from more theory of a philosophical character, as I found the times we engaged with ideas about things more valuable. I also think less readings would let students engage deeper with each text both individually and collectively in class discussions.",
    "I think the course lacked a certain direction... Material Culture had various ramifications and possible definitions but the course never seemed to agree on one, or would rapidly shift between ideas of object, thing, material, art, etc. Often there were too many readings to be discussed and hundreds of pages would be condensed to barely enough time. I think if there more specifity within the syllabus or with certain \"goals\" in mind, this type of circular conversation could be avoided...",
    "Among many strengths, this team taught course offered unique perspectives from scholars of different time periods and approaches. I appreciated the way the professors alternated their comments--everything went very smoothly. I especially enjoyed our \"show and tell\" parts of the course, though I think we all agreed that the time spent on this part of the class would be reduced in the future. I also enjoyed our trip beyond the classroom, which added substantially to our discussions of the material. I did find the reading list quite overwhelming at points, and wished we had more time to read and discuss all of the fascinating articles assigned; however, that is more of a recognition of the constraints of time rather than a criticism."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I would, especially if the student was interested in a flexible class structure. I thought an exciting component of the class was the weekly student object presentations. We agreed as a class that it might work better with fewer people presenting each week, but I thought this alternative structure routinely opened up new thinking and let students learn directly from one another.",
    "Yes. I would recommend more students from the School of Art as well as other fields of study. Diversity in everyone's backgrounds keeps the conversations dynamic.",
    "I would not recommend this course. As a student outside the history department, I found this course was too focused on the methodology of history and therefore difficult to relate to my own research. I therefore found trouble in bringing my own research and engagement back into the course, making it seem frivolous",
    "Yes! I would encourage students both in and beyond history to take this course. Both professors brought authentic intellectual excitement to the course and it was contagious."
