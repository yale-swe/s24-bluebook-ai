    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I really appreciated Brad as my TF. He was willing to meet in order to discuss how to improve my paper writing and was responsive when I needed to email. His feedback was on point and helpful with the theological papers. I knew he was available if I needed to contact him. On a different note, I really enjoyed this class overall and felt I was stretched in important ways. It took me a while to \"get\" what we were working at, but now that we are at the end of it, I feel I have a much better idea how to reflect, think and write theologically for a faith community-- really getting in there and grappling with the text in a creative and imaginative way, even the difficult bits (maybe even especially the difficult bits!) I could never figure out what students were so upset about all the time-- I felt that both professors were professional, respectful, prepared and engaging. The rough and tumble of theological debates was interesting and, to me at least, always had a playful or at least respectful quality. The ability to \"do\" theology in this way was exciting and mind expanding (though at times I felt out of my depth).",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Available outside classroom--very accommodating A bit set in his ways regarding writing style",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I think he graded fairly. He occasionally gave helpful feedback about how to improve, but slightly more of that would have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Bradley East was fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0His written comments on my papers were good, and I once asked for advice on a paper in person and received good comments. I felt that more constructive feedback on my papers would have been helpful (most of his comments were critiques, which isn't bad but didn't help me for the next time).",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Brad was always friendly and available. More specific feedback on papers would have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0All they did was grade our papers, there wasn't really teaching to be improved upon.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0His grading was arbitrary; sure, he tried to make it appear as though he had a veneer of consistency in assigning grades, but ultimately he just looked for things to bring grades down (use of Greek, use of outside sources, discussion of grammatical exegesis). It was glaringly sophomoric.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam was so helpful and patient with me. He made time to meet with me and help me with my writing, and he wrote many helpful comments. I feel he supported the learning process in this class.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Helpful comments and I really appreciate that Sam was proactive, reached out to discuss my papers with me, and was more than willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0His handwriting was almost unintelligible. Very dedicated though.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0He was approachable to discuss throughout the semester. I hope that he will give students more detailed feedback.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam Martinez was a helpful and kind TF who wants his students to succeed.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0This is a difficult question to answer because there were no sections for this course. The \"Teaching Fellows\" were simply assigned to this course to help grade the weekly papers, so I actually did not get to see much of Sam's teaching style. Honestly, the only practical comment that I can offer is for Sam to grade papers electronically rather than by hand. His handwriting is almost illegible, so I believe his future students would benefit far more from electronic comments.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Strengths: Provided many helpful comments on papers Weaknesses: Grading seemed inconsistent from paper to paper, although I would say Sam was fair over the course of the semester as a whole",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0He was kind and considerate. He tried to make thoughtful responses to papers. Although his handwriting is atrocious. I couldn't make out his comments some of the time.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Samuel provided incredibly helpful feedback on my essays, and even provided me with additional article suggestions when I was struggling to understand some of the concepts we were discussing in the class. I found him to be incredibly helpful, and will also note that this is the second time I've had him as a TA. This is the first time this has happened at YDS, and it was really helpful to be be able to work with someone who already knew my writing, and I think it enabled me to make a lot more progress in my writing than I normally do in classes.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Samuel was a great teaching fellow. I appreciated the guidance that he provided with my work and how he applauded me for improvements. He was very clear with what he wanted to see from me, and I believe that helped me in my other courses.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Samuel Martinez was an asset to this class. He was available for help. His comments on my work were invaluable. It was obvious he took time and care in his evaluations of my work with the intent of helping me to improve my writing both conceptually and in terms of style. Additionally, he was a pleasure to deal with personally.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Mr. Martinez is an excellent Teaching Fellow. He was prompt to answer questions and was available to help his students. He is very knowledgeable of the field and his comments on my writing pieces were very helpful. He did a terrific job!",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel has a razor sharp mind and has a wide range of knowledge in numerous fields.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Sam did an excellent job answering any questions I had regarding my grades on my theological reflections. He also was willing to meet with me to discuss various items pertaining to class. I thought he did an excellent job as a Teaching Fellow.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0The strengths were in Samuel's knowledge and accessibility. If possible, more comments on the papers might have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Handwritten rponses to papers were impossible to read; I would recommend typed responses to papers going forward.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0I wish we had gotten to know our Teaching Fellows better by either meeting in section together outside of class or simple having small group discussions facilitated by the TF during our regular class breakouts. Samuel is very intelligent and had some profound things to contribute to class lectures; I would have liked to have more contact with him. I felt he was too tough of a grader when it came to our weekly writing assignments, but that may be due to the vague instructions that were given by the instructors.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Outstanding teaching fellow providing overall support and guidance to writing the first paper and effective review, consistent comments and grading. In the class, Samuel engaged professors effectively to offer alternative points of view or to offer clarifying examples of whatever it was under discussion.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0- Samuel provided insightful and constructive remarks in addition to the lectures and class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel was very nice and encouraging in his comments. I was frustrated, however, that I was unsure exactly how to \"tighten my argument.\" Some of the essays I thought were the \"tightest\" I got lower grades on. So if he could have pointed to specific sentences that were unclear or made the essay not \"tight,\" I would have felt like I had more direction in improving my performance. Overall, though, I did ultimately feel like he helped me improve my writing, but he had room to be a little more helpful.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0I enjoyed Sam's occasional contributions to the lecture discussions and found his comments on my papers insightful and helpful."
