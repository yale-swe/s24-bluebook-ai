    "Yes. Take it with Madame Koizim.",
    "French 130 is a course to review the basics you've learned in 1 and 2 and to introduce you to a few of the more idiomatic forms in french. A great review of basic french grammar",
    "French 130 is a very rewarding experience, as you will leave the semester with improved grammar, as well as more confidence in your speaking and listening. It is definitely a solid amount of work, with the readings and audio programs, but you should definitely do all of it as the tapes are so well structured and helpful.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed French 130 as a great introduction to foreign language at Yale. I feel that my French has markedly improved because of this class. French 130 is a comprehensive language course. French books and films comprise the backbone of the class and are used to teach a variety of vocabulary, verb tenses, and other grammar topics. The homework consists primarily of audio exercises that teach and reinforce these skills. This is where the course draws its strength. The heavy use of listening activities helps to improve comprehension immensely, along with helping to internalize the French language itself. Consequently, the homework is nightly and often requires large chunks of time. This is an unfortunate necessity. The regularity of the class (everyday) and the testing (bi-weekly), while at times tiresome, is ultimately extremely beneficial to the continuity of the course and language acquisition. In addition, the testing is very reasonable. I cannot say enough how truly fantastic Madame Koizim is. I was less than thrilled to receive an 8:20 AM section of the course, but little did I know I would be happily waking up for the class. She is so full of energy and passion for what she is teaching. It was utterly refreshing and made the class so engaging. Her teaching style drips with humor and a genuine caring for each individual student's well being (academically and otherwise). I was afraid that type of personal teacher-student connection would fall by the wayside in college, but Madame Koizim proved me wrong. She is extremely approachable and goes out of her way to be available to her students. I would be remiss if I did not mention her extremely impressive, if not approaching native, grasp of the French language. She is a dedicated, intense, and remarkable educator and I am very fortunate to have made my way to her section. I highly recommend that anyone taking this course try extremely hard to get into her section. She is simply the best.",
    "Its a good course but a fairly huge time commitment"
