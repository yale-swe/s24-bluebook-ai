    "I received an in-depth look at factors effecting social mobility and migration\/immigration in France and throughout the francophone world. I worked on close-reading in French, and engaged in meaningful discussion about the texts and the topics.",
    "My writing and textual analysis skills improved from this course!",
    "I learned about skills pertaining to literary analysis within the context of contemporary French literature. I also improved my communication skills within small discussions; Prof. Cadieu pushed me to become the best version of myself in the classroom.",
    "Think of this as a sociology and literature course blended together.",
    "This class improved my spoken French but was even more helpful in improving my written French through the several papers. It also made me more aware of the similarities and differences between American and French society, especially the role of women and immigrants.",
    "This course thought me technical aspects of close reading and textual analysis in French, even more so than intro french lit did. There was a significant social science aspect to it, and I learned a lot about the theories of prominent french social scientist as a lens through which to view literary works."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly, I think this is the ideal upper-level French course. Wouldn't have changed a thing!",
    "I think a thematic approach to writing could be more interesting than just close readings, but I am not from the English Literature academic perspective.",
    "This course was great for exploring current social issues in France through the lens of literature.",
    "I loved the booklist and thought that Prof. Candieu did an exceptional job at guiding us through it.",
    "The discussions sometimes got repetitive, and all our comments had to pass through Mme instead of having an organic discussion. The class presentations were helpful in that they forced the student leader to think about one theme or book in depth, and got everyone else who may not have done all the reading up to speed. One difficulty about the class is the very large volume of reading - if you get behind for a few days, it becomes very hard to catch up."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Any upper-level French student would benefit greatly from taking this course be it to improve your close-reading and analytic skills in French, or to engage in the topic.",
    "Professor Cadieu is an absolute delight!",
    "Yes. I took this course as a non-french major and still found it very enjoyable.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to somebody who is open to consistently reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are a student of French and interested in contemporary film and literature! The theme of migration and mobility was sometimes repetitive but ultimately an interesting and challenging way of looking at texts and French society in general. Mme Cadieu is a fantastic teacher, cares a lot, and is very clear and organized.",
    "A great course. We read amazing contemporary french works. I went on to read these authors on my own for fun. Professor Cadieu is an amazing teacher, and I recommend taking any class she teaches.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested not only in learning about french social dynamic, but also for students who are implicated in international affairs, since France is a key point in today's political platform."
