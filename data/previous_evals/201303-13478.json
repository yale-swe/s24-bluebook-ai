   "comments": [
    "I would summarize ENGL 114 as a course depending on the teacher that you got. I would recommend my section to other students, however I cannot speak for the rest.",
    "A good way to get the foundations of how to write a college level research paper, which I believe nearly everyone at Yale will have to do at some point. The course material may be interesting, depends on how you feel about the subject.",
    "Yes, the readings were interesting, and the activities (eg- film watching of Black Swan and the Hoarders) were fun.",
    "Great class! Lots of reading but I learned a great deal from them. Didn't help so much in improving my writing though.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who essentially wants more practice with high school English writing. I think this course emphasizes many valuable skills, such as concision, organization, and \"unpacking\" your evidence to improve analysis. However, if you've had your fill of high-school style English writing (perhaps because you've spent four years doing it already) I would say don't take English 114. If you want an English class that will change the way you think about writing and expand your horizons, this isn't the one you're looking for.",
    "Such a difficult, painful class for people who are not amazing at writing. I learned a lot about myself and how to make myself write a good paper, but it is so brutal. I would recommend this class if you do not need a definite A, have a lot of time to devote to it, and want to learn how to get yourself to write a good paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students hoping to improve their writing, and students who have any interest in any form of obsession.",
    "I would recommend this class as a method for improving your writing. Ayten is a great instructor and the class readings and discussions are interesting.",
    "A good class if you do not feel that your writing is at the college level yet. I thought the course material itself was very interesting. I would probably recommend this class to a student who really wants to improve writing, but I probably would not otherwise."
