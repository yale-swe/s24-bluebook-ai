    "I would say it's a very interesting course and one I'm glad I took (I'm not sure how much this will help me in my political science major, however). I would recommend it tentatively. (Definitely if Prof. Steven Smith taught it again, but not so sure if another professor taught it.)",
    "Steven Smith is an entertaining, charismatic lecturer, who infuses energy and excitement into what could be a potentially dry subject matter to lecture on; however, I believe that this will be Professor Smith's last year teaching the course. Still, you read a good number of highly regarded authors that are mentioned numerous times in everyday life. It is worthwhile to have a general understanding of each writer's arguments to be an informed citizen. As far as the class goes, definitely take it writing section. You get a writing credit, and only your rough draft is due when everyone else's final draft is due. Then, you get to conference with your TF (who ultimately grades your paper) about how you can improve it for your final draft. The workload is manageable: 3 papers and roughly 100 pages of reading each week with a final at the end of the semester. I would recommend this course to anyone who is unsure.",
    "A comprehensive, if predictable, introduction to the great thinkers of political theory. If you are not familiar with these philosophical greats, expect to gain a good understanding of their ideas. Don't, however, expect to be wowed by the content. Consistently unstructured and apathetic discussion sections also detract from the class.",
    "Defintely!",
    "This is a solid introduction to political philosophy. It has less reading that most reading-intensive classes I've taken, and has 3 pretty short papers. If you are taking this sophomore year or beyond, be prepared to have a section filled of freshman. Take this class for the WR even if you already have two writing credits: When everyone else has to hand in their final draft of their paper, you get to hand in a draft that doesn't get graded and will get to hand in your final draft a week later. There's really no reason to not take this WR as you do the same amount of work and just get more time to write your essay. Lectures can wander a lot and section wasn't that helpful for me (don't take it with Lara Chausow). Professor Smith is no longer teaching the class, so shop it before you decide to take it.",
    "Everyone should take this course. You get a survey of major works of political philosophy and Steven Smith is an excellent and entertaining lecturer. Make sure to take it for a WR credit, it's still just three papers but you get to turn in a rough draft, make corrections, and turn in a final draft that you know your TA will like more since they are the person that gave you the feedback.",
    "Take it, its great information.",
    "Yes. It is a great and very important course.",
    "Yes, and I would especially recommend trying to get Tatiana Neumann Suarez as a TA.",
    "I would really recommend taking this class for the writing credit. Not too much writing but still food.",
    "Pretty good intro class. Professor Smith was great, lectures were engaging, readings were (for the most part) interesting and not overwhelming, TAs were okay. Keep in mind tho that this course is up on oyc and Prof. Smith's lectures haven't really changed (at all), so I think a lot of people only took it for the writing credit or because they wanted class that they don't have to show up for.",
    "I would highly recommend PLSC 114. Professor Smith is a fantastic lecturer and the course covers a wide range of material that I think everyone should read and be knowledgeable about. Authors read include Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Locke, Hobbes, Rousseau, and de Tocqueville. The class covers important themes of political philosophy and you will definitely gain at least a basic understanding of how the treatment of political philosophy has developed over the past two millennia. The assessments were reasonable and well-spaced (three 5-6 page papers and one final), and the readings were lengthy (but you can manage in section and still take a lot from the course even if you don't have time to do them all).",
    "Good class for a first semester at Yale or a good fifth class! Lots of freshman in the class. Great way to learn about the basics of western political though. Master Smith is great! Get to know him. He's always happy to talk. The papers are pretty easy and the reading is not tedious.",
    "It's a good course but with the three papers and a final it's a lot of work. Only take the class if you're interested in the material and willing to put in the time.",
    "Take it for a good introduction to Philosophy in general, if you do take it WR CR, you get more time on your paper and it's a good way to get that credit out of the way.",
    "Political philosophy was a great course, however the final was very difficult. I believed that your t.a made most of the difference in the grading of this class, since they grade the three papers and final you turn in. So choose wisely, as a t.a that grades easy may make all the difference.",
    "It's hard to say what this will be like since Smith isn't teaching it anymore. Overall, if you want to say you read some of the most important and influential works ever written, give it a shot. The readings are long and tedious, but if you actually do them you have a good sense of satisfaction. TAKE A WRITING SECTION. It is the same number of papers, just with a draft. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and get frustrated, but in the end everything comes together and makes it worth it.",
    "This is a fairly standard intro class on the subject matter of philosophy. That means a few things. Professor Smith is engaging and fun...but he lectures to a large class of mostly freshmen. You focus on philosophy...meaning you read lots of essays by long dead people. If that's your cup of tea, by all means take it. If you think this will change your opinion about philosophy or open your eyes in a new way, I think you will probably be disappointed. If you do take this class, MAKE SURE to get a writing section. They make everything so much easier, as TAs will give you feedback on your drafts before you need to turn in a final paper.",
    "Yes, take this class! You learn a lot about political thought and itgives you a good basis in political science.",
    "The course gives an outline of the views of a number of philosophers over a rather large time span. It is a good way to get an overview of political philosophy. I would recommend this class, but only if you are truly interested in the material.",
    "This can be a really great class if you do the readings. Even if you don't do the readings, if you skim\/do sparknotes, it should be enough. it's just really important for you to do that not if you want to do well but to enjoy the class and understand what's going on. I'm doing well in the course, but now that I've reviewed all the material and have looked over the lectures\/readings, I think that I would've found the lectures less boring\/unbearable if I had actually read the material. Don't be intimidated by the readings; it's a lot, but you're totally capable of understanding them. And WR section is amazing--handing in drafts = major plus!",
    "This class is definitely a great foundation to a true liberal arts education, but it's a lot of very dense, complex reading, so only take it if you are truly interested in the subject matter.",
    "Really straightforward, great introduction to important writers\/thinkers. Super interesting, not too stressful. I definitely recommend it!",
    "Political Science 114 01 was a really good course, it definitely helped me familiarize myself with major thinkers in political theory: Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Tocqueville. One thinker for two weeks, you read 1-3 works for each thinker and Prof. Smith's lectures provided interesting contexts and ways of understanding the ideas. He's not teaching it in the foreseeable future though, and while I'm guessing the class is still going to be worth taking for the sake of exposure to these awesome thinkers, you might want to check out who the professor is and check out the workload. The way it is right now, if you take the writing section (and if this is still the same option you definitely should try to get into one) you'll get to hand in a draft before the final copy so it's really good. You dont have extra number of papers or anything. Try to get Luke Mayville as your TA if he's still TAing this course. Also the final wasn't bad at all, and the papers can actually be fun to write. If you care about the material, though, I suppose.",
    "Great class. Take it if you want to know a little bit about a number of the most pivotal philosophers of western political thought.",
    "In Professor Smith's last lecture he said he was done teaching this class :( If it ever comes back I would strongly recommend this class to anyone. I'm a science guy, and I am very glad I took this course. It allowed me to read great works of political philosophythat I otherwise would have never read.",
    "it is a really good class and a really good introduction to political philosophy",
    "I would highly recommend it, Professor Stephen Smith is a boss. Professor Smith is an amazing lecturer. His lectures have so much quality content packed into them that even when I fell behind on the readings, I would still understand that material and get enough information for my essays. This class epitomizes true education. In high school I merely memorized facts for tests, in this class I truly learned. This class gave me a new perspective on government, politics, religion, philosophy, and human nature. When engaging in philosophical discussions with fellow students at Yale who were not in this class, I found myself drawing from knowledge I attained in this class to better support my points.",
    "A fantastic class, take it if it is offered again. Even if you do not plan on becoming a philosophy major, it is still very worthwhile. The material is interesting and the professor is fantastic! There is a good deal of reading and the essays require sufficient effort. If you can, take it for a WR credit.",
    "Definitely take this class, even if you do it Credit\/D. I recommend this to anyone with a slight interest in philosophy.",
    "It was a great introductory course. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the great classical works. You'll really like this class!",
    "Smith's lectures are outstanding. Absolutely recommend this class.",
    "If you are interested in a basic undestanding of some of the most important political philosophers this is the class for you.",
    "This is a great overview of foundational texts. A must-take not only for people interested in political science or philosophy, but for everyone who wishes to examine the ways in which society operates and influences their lives.",
    "workload mainly reading, interesting concepts, difficult final",
    "Definitely take it. You learn so much about key works in the foundational history of politics.",
    "I would summarize Political Science 114 01 as an excellent overview course in political philosophy. I would recommend it to another student as it taught me a lot and gave me a really clear understanding of the major thinkers in the discipline and their views, as well as the key issues discussed in the discipline and their continuing relevance today. I would particularly recommend this course also because although it is an introductory level course, the lectures and the analysis that is both presented to us and expected of us is at quite a high level, so I enjoyed the feeling of confidence that was put in me from the beginning. Nevertheless, concepts were explained quite clearly both in lecture and in section, and I do not believe that at any point the course was generally \"over our heads\" as there can be a concern that philosophy courses can be.",
    "A good introductory course to Polisci. Not too much homework, and a good lecturer. Discussion section is also very interesting.",
    "I thought Poli philo was a GREAT class! I had never had any experience with any of these writers but I now feel I have a better understanding of state craft and political theory and am glad I took this class. Smith was the best! He gave analysis that seemed balanced, and very well thought out and occasionally involved the class to great success. I hope most of my instructors at Yale will be as knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their fields as Smith is about his.",
    "I would recommend this course to all individuals interested in political science or in politics in general; it is a helpful introduction to the qualitative, philosophical roots of the discipline, which have clearly been supplanted today by more quantitative analysis.",
    "Lots of great books. Read and learn a lot. Yes.",
    "A fun class to start a study in political science.",
    "I think that this course is an excellent introduction to a number of important political philosophers. Definitely take this course as WR - it does not involve any more work and you get an ungraded draft for each paper.",
    "YES! It is a great introductor course about political philosophy. Even if you are not going to be a political science major, it is an enjoyable course that really just gives you cultural literacy.",
    "This class is a basic introduction to many of the most important political thinkers of all time. It would be worth taking for the readings alone. Professor Smith's lectures are very helpful both in familiarizing you with the texts and giving you a sense of their historical context and what role they have played in the history of European thought. You will probably want to read more of whichever authors interest you the most, but this is a good point of entry.",
    "If you plan on being a poli sci major, this class is probably pretty important since the concepts might reappearor help you later. It's also great just to know these authors. If you've already read some of them it's probably not worth it since the analysis doesn't get too deep most of the time because we don't spend a ridiculous amount of time on any person. After a while I felt like I was getting the same out of lecture as I was the open Yale courses, but with the change of professor that may no longer be true.",
    "Yes, a great way to understand basic political texts",
    "A lot of classic, really great readings that include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Macchiavelli, Rousseau, and more. A great way for any student (of any major) to develop a good foundation in political thinking.",
    "Yes, take this class if you can; it will help you gain a profound perspective on the forces which have shaped politics.",
    "I would recommend the course if you find the topic interesting. In all honesty, Steven Smith really makes the course and I'm not sure how it will fare in the hands of another professor!",
    "Intro to political philosophy is a course that anybody interested in Polisci, or really anything, should take. At least, everybody should have some familiarity with the authors and concepts covered. The class itself isn't tremendously difficult, and lectures are generally interesting (Steven Smith). But mostly the course is about the works and the authors, so be prepared to read a lot outside of class. You can get by without reading everything, but honestly, if you're not going to read the material, don't take the class: it's pointless.",
    "This class provides a strong foundation of political philosophy in a vibrant and interesting manner. The selected readings contained ideas that are still thought about today, and Professor Smith's lectures were consistently enjoyable. While there is a good amount of reading to do, it isn't dull or painful. If you find yourself remotely interested about this class, be sure to shop it."
