   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of reading. Short paper and long seminar paper at end. At times, I got tired of Hume, but there is something really rewarding to spending an entire course's worth of time with one philosopher. Professor Winkler picks his reading carefully, makes sure to adjust if the load is too much, and makes Hume come alive in surprising ways. Discussion is very much student directed with Professor Winkler making insightful comments based on student contributions. Make sure to do the reading to get something out of class time. Only take, though, if you are either a) interested in intense engagement with Hume or b) find the topics listed in the seminar interesting. Otherwise, it will be very hard to find motivation to do the hefty amount of reading. Professor Winkler's comments on papers were all very very helpful. Also a great class to fulfill the Senior Requirement in for the philosophy major. Professor Winkler is very willing to meet outside of class to discuss possible senior essay topics.",
    "Take it if you're prepared to do a lot of reading and thinking. Then sit back and soak in everything Kenneth winkler has to say.",
    "Any class with Winkler is going to be great--don't doubt it. He is the most helpful professor in the philosophy department and an extraordinarily nice guy in general. In class he is enthusiastic, fun, and occasionally really funny. That being said, I wasn't so excited about this particular class. Although Hume is a really cool philosopher, I think I got a little bit bored of him by the end. On top of that, the scholarly questions that Winkler is most interested in are scholarly questions that felt sort of peripheral to the meat of the arguments that really interested me. I also really liked what I had read of Hume going in and then grew to a sort of lukewarm-ness. But it was great as a philosophy major to read someone who was a phenomenal writer--Hume is way clearer and more lyrical than most any other philosopher you'll read in the canon. The Dialogues Concerning Religion were particularly interesting. So still take this class if Winkler is teaching it. But be wary that you could find some of the topics quite boring after a while.",
    "A very good history of philosophy class. You will really study Hume and just Hume.",
    "This seminar on Hume delves into Hume philosophy of epistemology religion and ethics. Each week we focus on a different topic which allows for a comprehensive seminar on Hume's general philosophy.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes. Hume is interesting and important, and Winkler is great. There's a lot of reading, but it's mostly interesting. The discussion is good, and there's room for interesting work on the paper. A great class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend any class taught by Professor Winkler. This seminar involved a lot of weekly reading, but the material was interesting and Professor Winkler is a joy to have in class.",
    "Yes. The course is great."
