   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class! But if you're looking for a traditional course, don't take it. And also, the course's name is a little outdated, so don't take it that much for granted, although the discussions would generally be related to media and popular culture.",
    "The best class I have ever taken at Yale",
    "If you are a feminist, take this course. Its material is not easy, but it will push you to engage with feminism and gender ideas in new and exciting ways. The final project is super out-of-the-box and therefore, in my experience, both challenging and bizarrely (and wonderfully!) fulfilling. I found myself geeking out about this class to friends all of the time because the sort of work we did with Professor Wexler just made me excited. It's not always glamorous work, but it got me asking questions about gender and technology that feel so urgent now, and that I never would have considered before. Also DON'T LEAVE YALE WITHOUT STUDYING WITH PROFESSOR WEXLER. She's that good.",
    "A seminar with weekly readings and a somewhat sizable final project. This course was absolutely fantastic. Professor Wexler will blow you away every week. It turned out to be way better than my expectations, so you should at least shop it! 4.5 hours (with the lab) can be a turn-off, but you learn a lot of stuff like gif-making and basic photoshop."
