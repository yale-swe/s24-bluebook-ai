    "I had never taken a polisci course so I learned a ton about sovereignty, nationalism, and generally about how the state works. I also knew very little about existing criticisms of the human rights framework, so this class was exceptionally important for that as well and to learn skills to critically examine feminist\/anti-violence projects in general.",
    "This was a fantastic course -- challenging, great readings, and an incredible instructor. Highly recommend.",
    "Human rights are extremely important to the struggle to achieve equality, reduce violence (both physical and systemic), reduce poverty, and ensure that all humans are afforded the same rights to live with dignity. There are, however, many shortcomings and contradictions within the human rights framework related to its claim of universality. Among many things, this class has pointed to heterosexism, the universal-local paradox, and divisions of race, class, and gender as problematic for implementing a universal set of human rights. The human rights regime that focuses on state-perpetrated violations in the public sphere, for instance, obscures the human rights violations that occur in the private spheremainly effecting womenand undermines their ability to claim human rights. This class has provoked me to serious reflection and opened my eyes to many ways in which oppression and systemically reinforced marginalization pervade societies. In particular, it has made me increasingly aware of the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach in analysis and context-specific focus when looking at human rights issues. We have spent this semester focused on critiques of the liberal human rights framework, and we have done so via a multidisciplinary approach. I was surprised by the variety of our readings: some were heavily philosophical in nature, others appealed to economic arguments, and yet others emphasized identity politics. One week we were assigned two readings, both analyzing the Otieno court case. After reading the first piece, I was convinced by the authors claim that gender was the basis of how the case turned out; the case was symbolic of the tensions between the womens rights movement and the patriarchy. The second piece, however, provided a strong argument that the first piece had reached a skewed conclusion because it had neglected to seriously consider the economic context of the situationthe true driving force behind the controversial case. Neither piece reaches a right answer, but it illustrates the danger of failing to analyze issues through multiple lenses. In depth analysis through the lens of a single academic field provides valuable insight, but it cannot be left to sit in a vacuum, neglecting the more holistic reality.",
    "Critical reading and thinking skills.",
    "I was able to have a more constructive conversation on human rights rhetoric and why we should be critical of it while simultaneously using it for good.",
    "This course forced me to think critically about the ways in which our understanding of human rights and feminism are colonial constructions that have been wielded as moral weaponry to keep the Global South oppressed. We discussed the colonial legacies of Enlightenment, the ways in which human rights discourse seemed to conflict with cultural custom in the African context, the ways in which human rights are contingent on the existence of states, the ways in which ethnicity and class conflict, critiques on identity politics, and discussions of the ways in which rights might be conceived a emancipatory.",
    "My whole thinking process was changed by this class. Issues of gender, sexuality and human rights and how they relate to governments, communities and history and philosophy. Ossome taught me how to view these isssues as multi-faceted in so many ways that I will run out of space noting.",
    "This course introduced me to the intricacies of identity politics, how that relates to gender and the African continent, and the importance of context and further expanding one's own knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "This course was awesome!! Loved the size, teaching style, and materials. My only real complaint is that grading was 0% transparent, but that seems fairly minor.",
    "The readings were selected to each illustrate something different\/approach human rights from a different angle. The discussions were thought-provoking and open to all perspectives and topics.",
    "Strengths - Course content, readings, classmates,",
    "This course was very well designed! The readings were very manageable from week to week, often including opposing viewpoints to force us to think more critically about the subject matter. Though tedious at times, the reading responses each week really forced us to engage and think critically about the text before coming to class. In class, because we had all read and thought about the readings, the discussion was always very interesting. The two essays also forced us to flesh out an argument from the readings (often informed by a reading response), which helped us more rigorously engage with the texts."

    "Well, sadly Professor Ossome is leaving and I can't recommend another professor to teach this course. However, the readings were interesting enough that if the same syllabus is taught again I would recommend it to anyone. That said, it should be said for the record that this course was truly excellent and just really packed a lot of intellectual punch.",
    "Yes! Professor Ossome is brilliant!",
    "Definitely. This class critiques the liberal human rights regime and looks at how the alleged universal characteristic of rights in fact excludes individuals in its very attempts to be all inclusive. Very eye-opening, provided a much more in depth look at human rights than I have had before. Readings were assume and varied.",
    "This course is perfect not just because Professor Ossome is an incredible thinker and encourages her students to engage with her, but also because it attracts a great group of students who bring diverse perspectives to the class and care about humanity globally. I looked forward to going to class everyday and listening to both the professor and the students' thoughts on the readings. Her classroom also attracted a diverse group of students, complicating the conversations we had so that we had in ways that made them much more complete. The reading list was also a treasure and it was beautiful to see how much literature there was not just stereotypically in the Western canon but by Africans on issues of Gender, Sexuality and Human Rights.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class if Prof Ossome will be teaching it again. She is a gift.",
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal it is such a shame that Professor Ossome was only visiting for a semester. We discussed the shortcomings of human rights discourse and Western feminism and the ways in which in conflict with context-specific cultural practices or beliefs. Discussion was always very enriching because everyone had to do the readings in order to write the weekly reading responses. I would definitely recommend this class if Professor Ossome comes back to teach!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Ossome will change the way you think about issues of gender, race, sexuality, refugees and human rights completely. You will be amazed. It is not your regular gender\/sexuality class. It is not even close to regular. Take it and you will see"
