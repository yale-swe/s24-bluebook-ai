   "comments": [
    "The strength is that I really learned a lot from this course. The weakness is that sometimes the homework is to hard.",
    "Hope to cover less material but with more details in lecture with a slower pace.",
    "This is a fantastic course! I enjoyed it very much. Have learned a lot in class. Strengths: the course is not too easy nor too difficult; the instructor has a good sense of humor, which makes the serious theoretical course interesting. No weakness.",
    "The course covers a great variety of topics with application cases. However, the lectures can be better organized for more cohesiveness, and some aspects (especially derivation and understanding of the equations and conclusions) could be explained in greater details. Also, the exams attach a little too much importance to memorizing contents.",
    "This course covered a lot of theoretical topics, and helped us build up a more rigorous foundation in statistics\/biostatistics. The slides were clearer than the textbook, since the latter was a little old-fashioned (not necessarily in a bad way). The workload was moderate and appropriate. This course would be even better if more intuitions could be given on top of the theoretical claims - since it can be difficult but helpful to develop intuition based on so much algebra.",
    "The course was really difficult but the slides didn't cover the important stuff",
    "It is a very helpful course.",
    "Very helpful to my research.",
    "The course covers a wide variety of topics. Materials are well-organized. The content is theoretical and to some extent difficult for me. Sometimes I have trouble figuring out proper assumptions to make. It would be helpful to make lecture notes more explicit in a way that it specifies necessary assumptions and conditions.",
    "This covered important topics in generalized linear model. Lectures were well-organized with easy to understand lecture notes. Workload for this course was just the right amount that I practiced enough with having too much burden. The only thing I dont really like was that we had two exams this semester, while it used to be one exam and one final project. I hope to work on a project so that I can apply what I have learnt to real word problems.",
    "Great.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ma is smart and knows the concepts well. The lecture notes are clean and clear. Weaknesses: No homework solutions.",
    "This course covers most of GLM topics rigorously, and greatly enhance my understanding of GLM. One improvement I could think of is to put more detailed proof in slides so it would be easier for student to keep up with the flow of this course."

    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Prof. Ma is excellent!",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is very responsible. All slides are well-organized. This course is not only about GLM but also helps me review some basic concepts of linear model. Learn a lot from this course.",

   "comments": [
    "I will recommend this course to any biostat students.",

    "The course is useful for beginners in statistics and helps one to establish basic understanding of relevant topics. For more effective learning, one should spend some time after class since several important points are omitted, but the additional materials are helpful. I will recommend this course to students who wish to work on statistics of medical data, as it includes many cases of application on real data.",
    "It is a course covering many theoretical topics in generalized linear models. It emphasizes more of the theories than the application, and would be helpful for students who are interested in developing a theoretical foundation.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot from it.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. I have learnt really important stuff through this course.",
    "Yes.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ma is smart and knows the concepts well. The lecture notes are clean and clear. Weaknesses: No homework solutions.",
    "Overall, I fell like this course is challenging but helpful. Most of its content is quite hardcore, which requires lots of efforts for a comprehensive understanding. You do need to think over and over to get better sense of what's going on. And I hope the instructor can put in some of his chalk proof into slides as well."
