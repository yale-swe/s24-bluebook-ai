   "comments": [
    "Problem sets and readings took a lot of time, TA was really helpful.Presentations were with partners and matched randomly. Final was a bit surprising.Learned a lot, but someone who hasn't taken any econometrics would have a really difficult time in the class. (Was meant to be a lecture, but the class ended with 11 people.) I wouldn't recommend taking this unless you've taken Econometrics II",
    "Yes. Take it if you are interested in development economics.",
    "It's an extremely interesting econ course that applies what you learned in econometrics to the real (developing) world. I loved class but problem sets were difficult and VERY long; took many hours to complete, always working with at least one other person. I would suggest it to someone willing to put in the work. Still probably my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Interesting econ elective.",
    "If you like development economics, this is a great class. You read a lot of papers that are relevant and interesting, and the professor is really nice. But be prepared to spend a lot of time on problem sets.",
    "Take this class - I highly recommend it, although with a few caveats: 1) In terms of content, the course was centered around papers, instead of looking at the development field as a whole. Take the course only if you want a detailed perspective on a few choice (but very interesting!) topics. 2) To echo the other reviewers, don't take this class without an econometrics (or statistics) background. PSETs focused on walking you through econometric techniques, not necessarily the conceptual frameworks for the papers. That being said, I came in as a statistics major without having formally taken econometrics, and that was fine. Mainly, you should have some familiarity with linear regression techniques, and ECON 132 is helpful. The programming is in STATA, not R, and although what we did in STATA was very basic, often times most of the struggle with PSETs was figuring out STATA commands rather than interpreting the results. 3) The PSETs are long and sometimes tricky. The TA Julia Garlick and Professor Qian offer a lot of support, though, and you should take advantage of that."
