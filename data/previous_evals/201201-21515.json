   "comments": [
    "Yes if you really do want to learn French. No if you want an easy language class. Credit\/D\/F is a beautiful thing if this happens to be your second language...",
    "It's a lot of work. If you already have taken French in high school, go for it if you want to put in the work. If you just started French here, I highly recommend that you do take it.",
    "Yes. I took it as a junior, and I chose to take L2 CR\/D, which was a great decision. L1 was OK but L2 is a lot more work, and if you have already done your language requirement, CR\/D really frees you up to just try to learn to speak and read the language without having to worry about all the small grammatical stuff that comes naturally once you've just been around the language for a while.",
    "Yes. Solid class.",
    "I highly recommend the French program at Yale. You learn French at an unbelievable pace, but you don't really feel overwhelmed while you are doing it. Having class every day is tiresome, but you can't really get around that with languages. Definitely take it if you are even somewhat interested in learning French.",
    "Great class, well worth the time commitment if you need the language requirement or, like me, just want to learn French. Take it with Madame Hoffman--she is an absolute delight, a lot of laughs, and a wonderful instructor (she's also from Paris which means her accent is perfect and she's really, really cool).",
    "If you want credit for French 110, you have to take French 120. It's basically the same thing - French in Action starts getting old, but it's still a great way to learn the language. Try to get in Madame Hoffmann's section.",
    "It's more work than most other languages but your French really improves.",
    "I would recommend this course, it is very similar to L1 but you learn a lot faster."
