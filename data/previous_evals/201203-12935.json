   "comments": [
    "YES. It will help you appreciate New Haven. Also, one of our projects was to trace the history of a block in New Haven using three maps- I used this as an opportunity to do original research on the block of my residential college",
    "New Haven in the American City gives you a taste of the major themes in urban studies with examples drawn from New Haven and other cities such as New York, Seattle, Detroit, and New Orleans. The workload thus far has been manageable. Lectures can sometimes feel unfocused, but assignments are fairly open ended and allow you to really explore almost any issue facing urban America. I would not recommend this course for serious architecture or urban studies students, but for those looking to better understand New Haven or for an overview of current issues in urban studies, this course could be worth it.",
    "Yes, it's a great class on a subject that you wouldn't otherwise think much about (as an economics major) but is really embedded into the living fabric all around you.",
    "Great way to do your So. You'll enjoy the class whether you attend lecture or not. Chill section, not too much work. Loved it.",
    "It's at least better than the STCY class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, it is interesting and the papers are fun to write.",
    "Good easy social science class. Take it if you like urbanism. Otherwise, you won't like it.",
    "It is an interesting course, the material is applicable to Yale students living in New Haven. I would recommend the course",
    "I would recommend it if they're specifically interested in the expansion and development of US cities. Don't take it because \"it's a sociology class\" or because it's \"a history class\" because it doesn't really relate to subject areas.",
    "It's an introduction toAmerican urban history, with a focus on the 20th century, using New Haven as a case study and a lens through which to understand urban trends. If you know you like urban history, or if you're just curious about the city Yale is in, it's a fairly low-stress introduction. The lectures aren't mind-blowing but the readings and content of the course are interesting. And the projects are fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, particularly if you're looking for an SO credit. It was VERY easy, not that much work at all, but so enjoyable! It has changed the way I see New Haven and American cities in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anybody (and I have recommended it to a lot of people). It's interesting, relevant given our setting, and provides a fascinating picture of the American city. I think that the things I learned in this course are things that I'll truly carry with me.",
    "The class itself was pretty dry most times and went overtime. I felt like it could have been much more engaging and interactive. However, the workload is minimal. The grading of the papers is pretty relaxed; however, in my section it was basically impossible to get an A on a paper (everyone got an A-). I recommend doing the Community Based Learning (CBL) project instead of the final if that's an option next time.",
    "This is a great interesting introduction to studying American Cities. Everyone should take this class to reshape their understanding of New Haven. It will change the way you look at cities in general in any capacity (resident, tourist, researcher, etc). If the material at all interests you: take this class. That said it is also somewhat poorly arranged due to the sheer amount of content and material, yet the professors do a nice job weaving the themes of the course into each lecture and keeping lectures interesting and engaging. The Community Based Learning option is a great asset and something to take advantage of. In sum, this is a class full of potential in which you will get as much out as you put in.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are passionate about urban studies, or if you want to learn a lot about New Haven. If details bore you, don't take this class. If architecture bores you, don't take this class. If urban studies doesn't interest you, don't take this class. However, if you are interested in howthe city plays a role in American life, take it, it's fascinating. I enjoyed it, it's not a lot of work at all, and it's a good class.",
    "My gut is that this class will improve in the future. If it doesn't, I don't recommend it- too many pictures, too broad of a subject, and too many random readings.",
    "An interesting look at American cities. Definitely recommend.",
    "A broad overview of the rise and fall of cities. Not very difficult, especially if you read the City book by Douglas Rae, who used to teach the course. Be ready to waste an hour of your life in section every week, surrounded by bored jocks browsing Facebook, chewing gum, and just generally not contributed anything.",
    "Broad survey of New Haven's history and discussions in urban design. Open-ended assignments give you the ability to focus in on topics that interest you more without being overwhelming. There's a lot of reading for this class, but if you power skim most of it, you'll be fine. Final exam was fair. Low stress class, but the material can feel bull-shitty at times.",
    "It's a pretty good course. It is actually super interesting material, but sometimes it's presented in a boring way. Readings aren't bad. 2 papers and a final. If you are interested in urban politics etc., I would recommend this course!",
    "Take it if you are an Urban Studies concentration. It is definitely one of the best classes for that concentration.",
    "Short answer, yes. But take it credit d. There was no real organization to the lectures but they were pretty interesting and the projects definitely changed the way I perceive cities. I enjoyed it.",
    "No.",
    "Good for international students who want to learn more about the American landscape",
    "I'm glad I took this class because I got a lot from the projects and Community Based Learning, but I don't think that's a good reason to take a class. The lectures, while interesting, are disjoint. This class covers compelling topics, but tries to touch on too many in too short a time.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in city-life and New Haven as well. You get an awesome background in the city you are living in (something many Yalies lack) but you do this by looking at major cities around the world as well. I was very interestedin sociology when I signed up for the course and felt that we really got interesting insights into the relationship between people and their built environments, something I had never really thought about before. The course is also extremely interdisciplinary so it's definitely a good way to explore a range of different ideas.",
    "Interesting material. Frustratingly disorganized structure. Little work.",
    "Good course, although it becomes confusing at times, as it is cross listed between so many departments and tries to juggle a blend of concepts (sociology, history, and architecture). Not a ton of work throughout the year, with pretty easy final.",
    "Yes. The class is interesting. SUPER EASY.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in urban problems and the city of New Haven itself.",
    "I think that since we are living in New Haven, it's important to get in touch with the history of the city and to understand how things have come to be the way that they are. However, the class wasn't that interesting - I did an alternative projectinstead of taking the final and had to do a lot of outside research so I didn't do all the readings but they were usually interesting and not too long. I'd recommend it as an easier 5th class - the work load is pretty light (two short papers and a final) don't expect much out of it though.",
    "Pretty easy interesting class about the History of New Haven. I'd recommend it.",
    "This is a course that covers the city as a concept, an actuality, a history, and a scholarly movement. The city is viewed through the lens of literature, culture, art, transportation, politics, sociology, economics, history, urban planning, philosophy, ecology, and education. You will not see the city the same way after taking this course; if you are looking for a crash course in the city - in all that the term entails - take this class.",
    "I don't think I'd recommend it. Also, know the political bias going in: it's liberal, but sort of neo-liberal.",
    "I would recommend taking this class credit\/D. The lectures are quite interesting, but the readings are long and irrelevant (but you still have to do them for section and for the final).",
    "If you're looking for an easy, straightforward, interesting, and relevant course, take it! It can get pretty repetitive at times though, and a lot of your experience will depend on the quality of your TA.",
    "yes recommend, class is kind of all over the place but lots of interesting relevant material",
    "While New Haven and the American City is definitely a worthwhile class if you're looking for a light course load and have interest in the subject matter, be warned that it's a little all over the place. The two instructors plus the plethora of cross-listings makes it hard to separate the aspects of the course, or really define a focus: part history, part sociology, part anthropology, part architecture, to name a few - studying for the exam can be a bit overwhelming - especially since there is no midterm, and the two papers during the semester have basically no ties to the lecture\/readings. It's worth taking, but make sure to attend lecture, even if it's hard to motivate, or you'll be completely lost come the final. Workload definitely tends on the light side.",
    "Learn about how american cities work in broad sweeping lectures. 2 short papers and a final.",
    "This is an interesting and approachable overview to city planning, American cities over time, and New Haven history. It's pretty easy -- very limited on empirical data, some history, much more architecture than I expected.",
    "Interesting class, go to lecture",
    "I recommend this course to any person who lives in urban cities or want to gain an appreciation for living in New Haven. It will change how you view living in New Haven or any other city. It's a must for anyone who is interested in urban environment.",
    "Interesting class, can be a little boring and repetitive at times. A lot of readings which aren't very interesting, but overal not a lot of work.",
    "great course on the social, political, architectural\/structural history of the American city, using New Haven as a case study.",
    "Pretty light workload so it's not a bad option for a 4th or 5th class, but you will get out of it what you put into it.",
    "If you want to know some of the important problems and patterns surrounding cities today, this is a low stress class that you'll learn a lot of relevant information from. I'm glad I took it.",
    "This is what courses at Yale should be like. It's not too difficult, the exam and assignments are very fair, yet you learn a ton of interesting things about new haven and cities in general. The information is very relevant, and everyone should take this course at some point of only to find out more about the city in which they live during their college years.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning about what makes American cities tick. This course gives a broad understanding of the built environment, and what factors have created a strong impact on our daily lives today. The workload is manageable, although there is a good amount of readings. However, if you attend the lectures you will mainly understand the topics of the readings, they just elaborate on the topics for that week. The final seemed a bit out of the blue compared to what we learned through out the course, and I had a somewhat difficult time trying to study for it. There were image comparisons and essay questions, and some of the images weren't even on the study guide given to us by the professors. The essays were somewhat easier than the images, and therefore I felt well prepared for that portion of the test. Overall, I would recommend this course. It's interesting, engaging, and the workload isn't overwhelming.",
    "Absolutely! Take it! Not hard and very, very interesting.",
    "Good overview of the history of the American city. And you will certainly come out an expert on new haven. A bit redundant at times though. Some lectures dragged on a bit. Others were brilliant. The preservation and sustainability lectures were particularly good.",
    "i would recommend learning about this topic, but not necessarily taking the class. it is really important to know about new haven, but lectures are repetitive and kind of boring. like all classes, make sure you get a good ta.",
    "Nah don't take it. Not unless you actually like cities. It was poorly organized, and the section was a complete waste of time.",
    "Very interesting, not that hard, a worthwhile class.",
    "The class is a broad overview to urban design and prevalent themes. You also lead about new haven history since the 17th century",
    "Not really worth taking unless you want a class that you literally do not ever have to attend.",
    "I would not recommend it. Some of the material is interesting, but it is presented in a disorganized, dry way that made it really difficult to get excited about. I think there are probably more engaging urban studies classes out there.",
    "Good class. Great overview course of urban studies. Take it. You need a good TF though who actually provides feedback.",
    "Good introduction to urban studies terminology and the city of New Haven.",
    "An amazing course on urbanism and the concept of the city. Rubin and Plattus are great (yet sometimes wordy) lecturers and the TAs are knowledgeable and passionate.",
    "Yes. Take this class. You learn a lot about New Haven and its history -- which is actually really interesting! You also learn a lot about other cities. The workload is manageable and lectures are good.",
    "Great overview of urban studies, especially good for anyone who is interested in the field but doesn't have any formal education init.",
    "This class holds a lot of promise, but unfortunately it wasn't able to fulfill that potential this semester. The first few lectures might suck you in, but then the class becomes an disorganized mess of lectures on random (if interesting) topics. Plattus and Rubin are engaging and interesting lecturers, but I've never seen the team-teaching format work for any class, and it doesn't work here either. They end up either repeating each other or completely switching gears between two lectures. The two lectures by Doug Rae (who wrote the book for the class; he now teaches at SOM) were wonderful -- I wish he taught the whole course.I don't mean to make it sound all bad. The topics are extremely interesting, the readings are fantastic, and the two writing assignments are simple and a rewarding exercise. You'll come away with a lot of knowledge about New Haven's past, present, and future. If you haven't taken an urban studies course before, this is a low-key way to do it. If you have taken a similar course, even if this sounds interesting to you, this is probably worth avoiding because you'll encounter a lot of repetition.",
    "I would recommend this class to a freshman or sophomore. By junior or senior year, I think you're ready to look into issues more in depth, and you'll find that this class is tediously broad and only skims the surface in its earnest attempts to cover way too much material. That said, as a light course to add to your schedule, it's fine. Both professors are very engaging, even if the actual content of their lectures is a little fluffy and redundant. Try to do some of the reading; some of it isn't so good, but some of it really is, and it will give you a fresh perspective with which to look at any American city. It will also give you an idea of what types of urban issues you find most compelling, and what you might want to look into more deeply. There's no midterm, and the papers are super reasonable (and the second one is even borderline FUN!). Workload isn't bad at all!",
    "I don't recommend it. But it is easy. You learn a good deal about American cities. But you don't learn enough about New Haven and the rest of the material is simple repeated",
    "Not a very good course. The lectures are kinda boring and the class is unorganized. Not that hard at all."
