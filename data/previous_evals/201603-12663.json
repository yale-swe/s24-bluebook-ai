    "A lot of this lab was relearning basic skills like using excel, creating graphs and correlations, and using basic instruments like thermometers and barometers.",
    "I thought this lab offered little that wasn't in the class",
    "This course taught me data analysis, some aspects of field work, how to use equipment related to fieldwork, to read charts and interpret certain types of scientific charts and data.",
    "This is the lab in which you are mostly going to learn about how to use different lab equipment to measure water and atmosphere properties. Global warming lab, the one we did the presentation on, is by far the best lab and I gained the most insights from there. In other labs I learned how to do the readings and how means, trendlines are constructed. Although this is very important it could be learned in a far more interesting way, for example while doing research or doing a project.",
    "I learned how to use basic meteorological and geophysical instruments as well as how to analyze meteorological data.",
    "I got a lot more comfortable using Excel and analyzing data, and it was a good way to supplement and support what we learned in the main course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think one of the strengths of this lab is that it covers some interesting material, and ties in (sometimes) to the material taught in G&G 140\/EVST 200. This lab had several weaknesses. The 1-lab-every-2-weeks structure was great, except that some labs didn't make sense to be split up over two weeks, and others tended to be rather tedious. Additionally, this structure meant we only completed 5 labs total, one of which was jut a presentation. It would have been nice to have more, shorter labs that covered a wider variety of topics related to the accompanying course.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, and I thought it was very interesting and engaging. The field trip to the river is great, you learn a lot of useful skills and interesting things. I think the main flaw is that while the TA was helpful with this, there is no crash course with Excel involved, but Excel is basically expected in order to make charts and do complicated data analysis. Without previous Excel experience this course would take many more hours of googling and frustration. I would have liked more field work and equipment use instead of a final lab of data analysis only. The lab reports are not as long and boring as chem lab, for example.",
    "I don't think that working on very tedious reports in excel(10 hours at least per lab) is the most efficient way to understand and apply the material learned in classroom. A project would be so much more efficient.",
    "I liked the course because I felt like the things I learned (e.g. how to use meteorological instruments, analyze time series) were valuable. Often, however, the material we covered was not difficult and would not have taken the entire lab period to discuss. The lab could benefit from more challenging material that requires more engagement of the students. In addition, I felt that the lab reports were often a bit tedious, since they often involved a lot of 'grunt work' (e.g. making many graphs, writing lengthy descriptions) which were not challenging but merely required a lot of time.",
    "I liked that it was all really relevant to what we learned in G&G 140. I felt like it was a waste of time though to spend two weeks on each lab, one for the data collection and the second for going over the answers. I think the course could be sped up to a lab each week."

   "comments": [
    "If you can take the lab by itself, yes! The lab is fun and you learn a lot hands on. Do not take the class attached to this however, Prof. Smith is a horrible instructor.",
    "I would only recommend this to a student if you have to take it-- the labs are at times incredibly tedious, and the grading can be surprisingly harsh (although that probably depends heavily on which TA you have). Also, there is a written final that is ridiculously long.",
    "This is a cool lab -- some field research and some data analysis. It is very chock-full, and sometimes it seemed like the TA's weren't quite sure what we were supposed to do or what was important to know for the final.",
    "No. except you have to take it with EVST201, which is a great class. But this lab is an unnecessary use of time",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about the use of some equipment and data analysis while learning about the atmosphere, rivers and stuff like that as well.",
    "Would definitely avoid taking AtmosphereOcean&Environmnt unless necessary for the class. Prepare for some very tedious Excel work that is done over rather boring topics. Lab 2, 3, and 4 took at least 10 hours to complete while what I gained from them was inconsiderable.",
    "The lab is not bad, so take it if you have to. You do a field trip to the Quinnipiac River and get to launch balloons from the roof of KGL. The lab can get kind of boring though and lab reports take a painstakingly long time given how straight-forward most of the material is."
