   "comments": [
    "You should definitely take this course if you have the chance. The amount of reading may seem overwhelming to some people, but it's not bad once you get used to it. The novels are intriguing and the common themes make the readings worth the time you put in. The writing is not bad at all, 3 short essays and a final paper. It's a class for people who want to work on close reading and enjoy reading novels by outstanding authors.",
    "This is a decent seminar. The reading is all great and Prof. Grigoryan is wonderful. My one complaint would be that some of the other students were pretty unengaging. But definitely shop it, and see for yourself, as I'm sure other years will be different. Overall, I'm still glad I took the course.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The reading list is great, as is the professor. I appreciated how Professor Grigoryan structured writing assignments (3 short assignments plus a final, lengthy one) because it allowed me to write about a number of subjects without making the writing burden too heavy.",
    "I took the course because of the reading list and was not disappointed -- the works represented provide I nice survey of the nineteenth century. I was also interested in the theme of capitalism, which came up from time to time but was not as present as I would have thought (which was fine). The strength was clearly Professor Grigoryan, who is one of the friendliest and most helpful professors I've had at Yale. She is also good at leading discussion -- jumping in to provide direction when it is needed. I only wish that class discussion was a little more lively -- I hope that future students make the commitment to do the class reading. The workload (papers) is not bad at all.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you are interested in works by Dostoevsky, Dickens, Gogol, and Flaubert. There is a particular emphasis on The Brothers Karamazov, which I found very enjoyable.",
    "A good (somewhat typical) Literature class with a great professor, whose quality depends a lot on your classmates. ================ Professor Grigoryan is the best! She's clear, brings great insights to the class. Starting half the semester in, each session begins with some basic analysis presented by a student. Otherwise, Professor Grigoryan brings in some theme or scene for us to take a look at and just talk about. Even if our section remained quiet (which it did more often than it should have), Professor Grigoryan nevertheless still was able to bring in some new insight. ================= The class has 3 very-short papers (3 pages) and 1 longer paper. It works pretty well. We had a scene analysis, a character analysis, a thematic analysis, and finally a do-whatever-you-want final paper. We read Madame Bovary, Our Mutual Friend, the Brothers Karamazov, Ladies' Paradise (Au Bonheur des Dames), and a tiny bit of Tolstoy and Gogol. Professor Grigoryan is really open to helping out students on writing papers. ============== My only disappointment with the class was with my section, which was not very vocal or warm-feeling. I can't say that I wasn't at fault too, but the quality of the seminar does depend on the people. Professor Grigoryan was great though, but do shop the class. ================ On the whole, I would recommend that you shop this class if you're interested in reading good literature and discussing it with a great professor."
