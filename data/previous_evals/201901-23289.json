    "I saw a great firsthand example of greenwashing. It was highly enlightening. I also learned a lot about the Gulf Plain ecosystem, different approaches to longleaf pine forest management. It was a great experience to see how different social and economic values influenced the types of approaches used to manage these forests.",
    "Timber plantation management, managing forests with wildlife in mind, racial relations of the American South, the role of community science in natural resource management, longleaf pine in general, and the effects of hurricanes on forests.",
    "A deeper understanding of southern ecosystems, especially the three species of pine and the various ways in which they are managed.",
    "I was introduced to Silviculture and Southern Forestry. I have a better understanding of how foresters do their work and roles of land use planning in forestry."

    "I think that the trip was well balanced. Getting the most out of the trip requires flexibility and endurance.",
    "The course is very strong in all of its timber components. One thing that could be improved is trying to do just a little bit less during our time there; the go-go-go nature of the course made many students exhausted by the last few days.",
    "Incredibly packed itinerary that offers students a tremendous opportunity to learn about the various aspects of southern forests. Perhaps some built-in time for rest would be helpful, but I like how full the itinerary is.",
    "The site visits were great and the Mike did his best to keep it interesting for all the students given that the students had different levels of experience with forestry and field work."
