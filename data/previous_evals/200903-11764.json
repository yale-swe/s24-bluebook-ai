    "If you want to learn about the Middle East, it is a good place to start.Be warned though that there is a lot of reading.",
    "It is an excellent survey of the Middle East, and considering that most people do not have any background in Middle Eastern history from high school, it is really useful. Everyone should know this information considering our present condition.",
    "Modern Middle East Studies 102 is everything you wanted to know about the Middle East but have never looked up. It's best if you do the readings - I did not but managed to get by fairly well but obviously not a bright idea. If you're not really interested in the Middle East this isn't for you because the material could get overwhelming but it does get your feet wet to study other specific aspects or areas. I'd definitely recommend it - if anything to be a better informed citizen.",
    "It was a very easy but enjoyable class. Not having done the writing section, the only work all semester was studying for the midterm and final. Going to class was like hearing a brilliant speaker about the contemporary Middle East twice a week. I would indeed recommend it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. It filled in many of the gaps in my knowledge of the Middle East. I came out with a much better sense of the forces that have shaped this region.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!!!!! This class is incredible, and definitely worth the 9:00 time slot. I could not envision a course that would better capture the roots of, and current topics in, Middle Eastern history. Professor Foster is THE MAN!!! His deadpan humor is uproariously funny, and he is extremely knowledgeable. The only grades are a midterm and a final, which are not graded too harshly. There's a lot of reading, but the selections are good, so I found it fairly painless. The class is a great way to get a writing credit too (which only involves three five-page essays via the writing sections). If you were thinking about taking this course, TAKE IT. If you were thinking that you probably weren't to take this course, TAKE IT ANYWAY. If you have the remotest interest in such a critical region of the world, this course is for you!",
    "This class covers main turns in Middle Eastern history from Mohammed to about 2000. I was expecting the information to be focused on current issues more, but for the most part we don't go past 2000. However, everything covered is well and the lectures don't get bogged down in useless facts or dates (although you will eventually be responsible for dates!) Professor Foster has a great sense of humor if you're able to pick up on it, and it makes class a lot more enjoyable. I would definitely take a class like this taught by Professor Foster again. It's a great overview of a largely ignored portion of history.",
    "I would absolutely, wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone from any academic background. As a science person, this was my most difficult class this term, but the work was interesting and fulfilling. The readings are very long, and there is a ton of material, but success really depends on how much time you're willing to put into the class. This was a big gap in my knowledge of the world before, and I'm very thankful I took the class.",
    "HUMS 383 is a relatively dry but extremely informative survey of middle eastern history. If you're looking for a general overview of the region and its history, take this class if you can look beyond Prof. Foster's very deliberate and consisten teaching style. There is too much reading and too much information to suck everything up, but in the end, you come away having gained familiarity with the region. If you try hard, you will definitely take away more. I recommend it those who are interested in learning more about the middle east but have no background.",
    "Yes, absolutely, if they can wake up at 9:00 three days a week. I would recommend taking it credit\/D unless they want to do an absurd amount of reading (which, had I actually done it, would taken time than all of my other classes combined). Very interesting subject.",
    "Intro to the Middle East is an excellent course to take. It covers the history (politics, culture, religion, etc.) of the Middle East from Muhammad (about 500 CE) to the present day. It really fills in huge gaps in your knowledge and understanding of history of the world--you don't really (at least in the American school system) learn about World History except from a Western point of view. This course gives you the missing half of what was going on. It teaches you about Middle Eastern identities and how they formed, which I find to be essential when considering international affairs today. Though there's a lot of information in the course that you cover (there's a lot of reading, but you really don't have to do it all), it's not really overwhelming. This is one of those courses where, at the end, you realize that you've really learned and taken in a lot--it's changed your perspective, or enriched it. The work load isn't bad--lectures, there's a midterm, a final, and a 10-15pg term paper (and if you attend 10 of the optional lectures, you don't have to write the term paper. Definitely attend the optional lectures--it's super sweet not having to write the paper, and the lectures are helpful and interesting anyway).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You learn about the development of the Middle East, the beginning and spread of Islam, the importance of Arabic and more. There is a decent amount of reading, but most of it is good. Read the Cleveland and Burton book. There is one midterm, an optional paper and a final exam.",
    "This is a great introduction to the Middle East - its culture, history, and politics. Be aware that Professor Foster does emphasize history a lot - there is not as much about the current political situation (but the syllabus makes this clear).Professor Foster's lectures are an excellent way to learn about the Middle East - they are informative and entertaining. Foster is old-school in the best way - he gives great lectures without messing with powerpoints or even using notes: he just stands up there and gives you great information.The class is nota ton of work either -if you go to ten \"optional classes\" you only need to take a midterm and final, neither of which is especially difficult (definitely go to the review sessions). No section, no papers.I would definitely recommend this class - I took it Credit\/D and didn't put too much into it, which worked out fine, but I wish I had taken it for a grade and gotten as much out of the class as possible.",
    "I took it to fulfill a humanities credit, and this fit the bill well. No paper if you attend the optional section. If you have an interest in the middle east then this is a good intro class.",
    "This class's grading system is great. If you're just looking for an interesting class on the middle east, then its perfect. But if you don't want to write the term paper, don't worry, you can just go to the optional class on fridays for interesting lectures and you don't have to write the paper. The midterms and finals are based almost entirely on the lectures, so the readings are not really that important. However if you miss a lecture, most of the material is covered in the textbooks if you want to catch up. As a writing credit course this class is also great. Its only three 5 page papers during the semester, and you do not have to write the term paper. The only downside is that you have to do all the readings to prepare for the writing section. Apart from that the class is great.",
    "Yes, definitely, everyone should take this course.",
    "I loved this course! The coursework was so interesting and the readings, although heavy, are very interesting and not hard to complete. The professor's teaching style is very different from the typical teaching style that you find at Yale. There are no powerpoints, although he does have a small slideshow he usually shows at the end of class. Professor Foster literally stands up in front of the class and lectures, so it is the job of the students to take good notes during class. I actually found this method really beneficial because it forced students to actually pay attention and take notes in class rather than rely on a powerpoint later. Professor Foster was an excellent lecturer as well, so it wasn't difficult to keep up with each class. He is also makes himself available to student who seek him out with questions. He is very approachable and helpful. This course was ultimately one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is an excellent survey course to learn the basics of culture and conflict in each region of the Middle East throughout history. It takes a mixed approach through religion, culture, and politics to engross the complex issues that the Middle East is facing today. I would absolutely recommend this course to others, even non MMES majors.",
    "This is an excellent overview of the Middle East. It gives you a much better appreciation of the countries that so often make headlines, so that you can make sense of the headlines...Professor Foster is a very engaging lecturer, and, while the class is taught very early in the morning (for a Yale class), it was definitely worth it."
