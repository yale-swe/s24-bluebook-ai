   "comments": [
    "It could be improved by going over a specific example of how to enter studies into RevMan. Also, going more into detail about the statistics of combined estimates would be nice as its confusing when you write the review but there is no lecture or resources as to which method to use.",
    "Excellent course, Dr. Bracken teaches and challenges students",
    "Only take this course if you are interested in evidence supporting health practices that involve randomized control trials - good for CDE\/EHS\/EMD, not great for SBS& poliy. Helpful for systematic reviews (if you are prepared to teach yourself), but sitting through class itself is an absolute bore.",
    "Excellent concepts and caring instructor. Small class size with room to discuss ideas. Material relatively up to date.Organizationally seems to be starting to fray at the edges.",
    "A great course overall. Could be improved by adding a lecture by a librarian to on electronic search strategies for a systematic review. Having some intermediate deadlines for the systematic review would be helpful. A useful exercise might be for students to review and comment on one another\u0092s protocols and full reviews before they are due to the professor.The assigned textbook was incredibly boring and Revman was a little difficult to use.",
    "It might be helpful to have at least one individual meeting with Professor Bracken during the course of the semester to review and discuss the final project.The class format of one lecture and one discussion per week is helpful, especially with a small class size. However, it might be more feasible to have only one assignment per week for the discussion, with a few readings assigned for the lecture, rather than two separate assignments to prepare to discuss each week.",
    "It was a great course. But the the review took so much time. I would be great if we had time to prepare the review during the semester instead of preparing for Thursday discussions.",
    "",
    "A lot of work, but focused on practical and applicable skills for public health researchers",
    "Learning how to do a thorough and proper systematic review is a great skill to have under your belt. The lectures were very insightful. However, it would have been helpful to turn some of the discussion sessions on Thursdays into lab sessions where we learn how to use RevMan.",
    "This course is essential for clinicians like me, who want to teach and practice evidence based medicine.It is essential for research people who want to design solid studiesIt is essential for any medical person who reads medical literature"

    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Excellent. Very knowledgeable and approachable and interested in students' projects and understanding of the material. Some of the lectures could be updated",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Intelligent in his field, difficult to listen to as a professor",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Excellent instructor with great knowledge base. He knew a bit or more about every topic that we expressed interest in. Very impressive.One area to suggest would be to hold us more accountable for our work. Not by penalizing or treating us like children instead by truly challenging our grasp of the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0A great instructor! I enjoyed his anecdotes.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Professor Bracken is an expert in a field of evidence-based health and a valuable resource when preparing and writing a systematic review (the final project), especially if a student plans to continue work on the project for a thesis project or publication after the end of the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0perfect",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0- Articulate and engaging lecturer- Very quick to respond to inquiries outside of class",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is an excellent lecturer and it is evident that he is very knowledgeable in doing systematic reviews.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable, a wealth of information, and stylistically exceptionalI wish the class were more interactive"

   "comments": [
    "Provides and intro into how to write a systematic review and meta-analysis. However, you actually learn how to write these by doing them rather than by going to class.",
    "Take this class- Dr. Bracken is excellent, you'll produce a publishable paper, and learn tools to do systematic reviews\/meta analyses for your career. A lot of work though, both in terms of the paper and each week when he grills you during the discussion section",
    "Would only take this if you are prepared to look at randomized control trials as the sole evidence for informing medical\/public health practice.",
    "Overall interesting course on Systematic Review. Not convinced that it requires biweekly meetings. Extremely knowledgeable instructor.",
    "It's best to take this course if you already have in mind a topic for a systematic review.",
    "This class helped to solidify and put into context concepts from Epi I& 2. It requires a lot of time and effort, but is a valuable experience. Prospective students should be aware that the final project, which is the bulk of the grade for the course, is a systematic review, which can be a long and complex process. This class would be especially helpful for those who already have ideas for focused research questions in their areas of interest that they would like to explore further.",
    "",
    "A how-to course focused on the evaluation of public health\/medical publications and the implementation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses",
    "I think everybody should take this course, reviews are ubiquitous in medical work and critical appraisal of literature sould be an ubiquitous skill."
