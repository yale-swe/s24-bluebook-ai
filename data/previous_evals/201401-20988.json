   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes take it. Too bad it is being cut (worst decision in the world in my opinion). Also, don't start writing your paper the night before. NOT a good idea. Get the images labeled at least a week before class is going to be over (we don meet the final week of classes) and come to the lab during the final week of classes to sit and write everything down, even if it not super well organized. I recommend going to the library and borrowing at least three books (Cell and Tissue ultrastructure, Wheater and Ross) and writing from them. The class is more work for half a credit, but the right amount for one. Also, when I finished the paper, it was one of the proudest moments of my Yale career: I learnt SO much.",
    "Great class. You learn a lot. There may be a bit of work at the end but if you work hard, you'll do well!",
    "This class should never have been cancelled. I don't know if anyone will ever get to read this evaluation, but this was the best class I have taken at Yale. You get to use an electron microscope. All by yourself! It's exciting to see this stuff and know that you took the images. Sign up early and take this class (if you can)!",
    "I would highly recommend this course, but it is no longer offered."
