    "Step 1. TAKEStep 2. ITStep 3. TAKE IT!!!!PLEASE TAKE IT! Covers topics starting from enlightenment to slavery and the civil rights movement to feminism...just fabulous. You will not find a better lecturer than Shannon. The topics matter in real life, and I found myself referring to class material countless times in everyday conversation.Lots of reading, but the books are great. I'm not throwing any of them out after this course is over.",
    "This course is a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the Christian Tradition, its various developments through history, and how it has influenced people's thoughts throughout. Honestly, this is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I'll admit though, I do have an unnatural love of philosophy and analyzing different people's ideas, so I'm biased. However, Shannon is a splendid lecturer who explains the readings while broadening her students understanding of context and motivation. The readings do get long, but they're written by great authors who are respected in Christianity and academia more broadly despite being sometimes difficult to understand. I think that all sorts of people should take this course. It's a great way to see Christianity in a new light, especially if one has any interest in finding (or finally seeing) views of Christianity that are intellectually defensible, and seeing how that plays out in the wider historical arena.",
    "Modern Christian Thought is a wonderful course for anyone who likes to read interesting, important works and write about them. Some interest in religious studies obviously seems important, but the class's emphasis was more on the \"thought\" than the \"Christian.\" There is slightly more reading assigned than is comfortably doable, but Shannon is such a great lecturer that you'll be fine if you don't do all the reading (not that you shouldn't do it all anyway.) On the whole, it's a really great class!",
    "Take this course! Even if you are not remotely interested in religious studies, TAKE IT. You may just change your mind. It is a lot of reading, but it is all so enlightening.",
    "The reading is a little much, but as long as you pay attention in class and take detailed notes you don't have to do all of it. Your grade is almost entirely based on your writing, so definitely use the residential college writing tutors to your advantage. Go to lecture. I can't stress how important it is to your grade to take detailed notes in class, the essay assignments, midterm, and final are all answerable almost directly from class discussion",
    "It was okay, but I was not entirely satisfied by the course. The class seemed to actually be much more about modernity than Christianity. Modernity explored using Christianity, if you will, rather than the other way around. The readings were great for the most part, but some authors seemed a little random. As a RLST major, I've definitely preferred the classes on Islam that I've taken.",
    "Overall it was a good class, especially if you're interested in these issues. I took it for fun but those serious about the topic can definitely get a lot out of pushing your limits and thinking critically about the arguments made by the theologians.",
    "Yes. The readings are great!",
    "Please take this class. I didn't have it in my original schedule, and when one class didn't work out, I added it at the last minute. It turned out to be my favorite class of my entire Yale career. For me, this was always the one class that I was always excited to go to, no matter what. I find myself bringing the course material up in casual conversation, and thinking about how I can apply what I have learned in this class to my everyday life. PROFESSOR CRAIGO-SNELL IS WONDERFUL. I loved her lecture style, and she does a great job of making the material relevant for her students. Whether you are contemplating becoming a religious studies major, or have never taken a religious studies class in your life (like myself), whether you are a christian or an atheist, take this class. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",
    "This course is really great! I've taken a fair number of religious studies courses at Yale, but this is an great foundation for Christian thought with some really awesome theologians. Take this course is Professor Craigo-Snell is teaching it. Its tons of fun and she makes awesome comments about current social issues. She always is really flexible with the assignments and give you room to write what your passionate about. I've wanted to take a philosophy-esq course at Yale that was still grounded in applications to the real world. This is the perfect class.",
    "Absolutely; if you are nervous about it being too Christian\/theologically heavy - don't be - there is a ton here in the readings and lectures",
    "This course is one of the best you can take at Yale. Shannon is an INCREDIBLE lecturer, and does a fantastic job explicating the works of some really difficult authors. A lot of the texts are very challenging, but really worthwhile reads. Also, the course is appropriate for the religious and non-religious alike. The material is never presented in a way that a non-religious person couldn't understand, but Shannon also does a great job emphasizing Christianity's relevance in today's secular society. Definitely take the class if you have room in your schedule!",
    "I'd recommend this class to everyone - both people interested in majoring religious studies and people who just want to have their humanities credit done.",
    "I really loved this class. Like, really a lot. I'm willing to say that I'm interested in theology in a way that I wasn't before I took it, and I think that speaks to the energy and passion that Shannon brings to the course. She's opinionated, so if you don't like Professors preaching a little bit, you might be bothered by it. I loved the fact that she brought her own views to bear on the material.If you're not at all interested in the intricacies of religion or philosophy, you might get a little bit bored or frustrated, because some of it is pretty abstract. The readings can also be pretty opaque, but Shannon does a great job bringing them down to an understandable level, such that I skipped some of the harder stuff and still got by fine.This course makes Christian theology relevant and interesting.",
    "If you have the opportunity, take this class! All the awesome things people say are true. Shannon is the most awesome lecturer I've ever heard. I didn't think that theology would be interesting to me, but she makes it so interesting and relevant. Take the course. See for yourself.",
    "I would only recommend the class if you are interested in philosophy. It does not deal with Christianity very much, but instead philosophers take on Christianity that does not always match up with the Bible.",
    "Yes I would! This was one of the most enjoyable courses for actually expanding the way you look at the world around us. Fabulous course, a must take for anyone with any interest in the material.",
    "I am a non-Christian Physics major who took this class out of sheer interest, and loved it. Prof. Shannon really makes this class totally worthwhile.",
    "If you're looking for a general overview of modern philosophy without the burden of DS, Modern Christian Thought is a great introduction. Regardless of religious background, the course examines the theological insight and impact of philosophers, theologians, and social activists, from Hegel to Martin Luther King. The material is accessible, the reading is manageable, and the discussion sections are almost always throughly engaging. Take this class -- you won't regret it."
