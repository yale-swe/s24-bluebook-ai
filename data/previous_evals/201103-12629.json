    "YES! To those who are interested in Spanish literature",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to get a broader knowledge of Spanish literature. The course covers a lot of reading, but it isn't too difficult once you get the hang of the writing style of the different time periods. Professor Byrne is a great person to have for the course, always good for questions and extra history about the time period. There are only 4 essays, with an average of 4 pages each. Very manageable.",
    "S\u00ed.",
    "The course readings themselves are very interesting and entertaining, and are generally not too long. The class strikes the right balance between breadth and depth of literature, covering a large number of readings while still getting a bit in depth analysis during class. However, the amount of depth achieved varies, as sometimes the class is a little more of understanding the general aspects of what happened. Professor Byrne is also a wonderful professor, very entertaining and knowledgable, and extremely approachable.",
    "If you are looking to improve you're Spanish writing skills, this is the class for you. The readings can be quite difficult at times, but the professor will hold your hand through them in class to be sure that you really grasp what is going on. As well, all of her feedback on your thoughts and ideas is helpful and instructive.",
    "If you are interested in early spanish lit and want to improve your Spanish, you should definitely take this class."
