    "I took Environmental Anthropology to full a requirement for the environmental studies major. It was a pretty good class. I was afraid a lot of the theory would go over my head, due to this being my first anthropology class but the textbook for the class along with Carol, made the readings pretty understandable. It's also not too much work. One sentence reading responses, two one page essays, and then a final paper.",
    "A good class! The format is a little strange, with very limited time for discussion, but I got used to it and ended up really enjoying Prof. Carpenter's lectures. If the readings and topics seem interesting to you, take it! It will change the way you think about environmental issues. If the topics don't seem interesting, if you are looking for a real discussion-based seminar, or if you will be turned off by Prof. Carpenter's informal style (including frequent personal digressions) during class, then this is probably not the class for you.",
    "Excellent. All EVST majors should take it. The class is a discussion based seminar with weekly readings and a substantial final paper. You have to do a lot of thorough reading each week, but the articles are fascinating. Dr. Carpenter is incredibly knowledgeable and is a great lecturer. You'll learn about the field of anthropology, the nature-culture dichotomy, political ecology, environmental consciousness, etc.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It took me a few classes to be convinced, but I really didn't know anything about anthropology before and the class was a really great way to be introduced to it. Professor Carpenter was great and while I definitely enjoyed some weeks more than others (some of the readings dragged more than others), at the end of the semester I'm glad that I took the class. Not too difficult as long as you don't leave your final paper until the last minute, that's the only major assignment.",
    "Very interesting class whether or not you are an EVST or anthro major. I look at the world very differently after this class and was always talking about our material to different people throughout the day. The workload is average, not too intense but there are weekly assignments. Michael Dove also teaches this class and I have no idea how the class is with him as a teacher, but with Carol it was fun, relaxed, and extremely interesting! Take it!"
