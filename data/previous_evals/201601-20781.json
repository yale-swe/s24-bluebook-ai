    "A really intriguing course, had little familiarity with the topic but was pretty consistently mindblown with the readings and seminar each week (which functioned more as a lecture, with some class participation.) One of those classes that will really make you question what you think you know!",
    "Yes take this course if you haven't taken one with Prof. Kockelman.",
    "Love this course. If you want your mind to be blown on a weekly basis, take this course. Not all of the reading is necessary\/decipherable, but every class is gripping. Kockelman is the best. Could not recommend him enough. Seriously. I may start a fan club.",
    "A weird but awesome class. If you can take a class with Kockelman you should. He is one of the weirdest and most awesome people you will meet. I took the class Cred\/D\/Fail which was great for me, because then I didn't have to worry about grades. Not having any anthropology background was fine, but I don't know how I would do gradewise. As we got closer to talking about computers, I became a bit less interested. Maybe take another one of his seminars if you aren't precisely interested in the topic?"
