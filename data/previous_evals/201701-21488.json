   "comments": [
    "I learned a TON about pop, minimalism, abstract expressionism, and more styles during the postwar period in the US and Europe. The course is absolutely jam-packed with information.",
    "Higher appreciation for modern art; writing visual analysis papers",
    "Developed a much greater understanding of Modern Art and visual analysis.",
    "A fascinating class",
    "I learned about Art starting from the post-war period. This class gave me the frameworks and insights with which to approach artwork in general, as well.",
    "I had never taken a history of art class previously and felt that I was able to gain a valuable analysis skills in art a way I never had before. I learned how to effectively write about art and read tough sources regarding its content.",
    "How to talk and write about post war art",
    "I learned to appreciate modern and contemporary art, and understand the influence of the second world war and the holocaust, as well as pop culture and consumerism, on art. My writing also improved.",
    "What is art?",
    "I learned a lot about modern art in North America and Europe after World War II. I was also able to improve my skills in analyzing artwork, and reading difficult art history texts. I really feel like I learned a lot in this class overall, both in lectures and in section.",
    "A new framework to appreciate and critically engage with visual art. This course also allowed me to develop a writing style that can create an argument from a mere image and connect it to relevant literature. Above all this, I also learned about a huge expanse of artists, galleries, styles and critics.",
    "How to interpret and contextualize art made after 1945",
    "I learned more about how to look at and evaluate modern art in a more critical way.",
    "I think this class gave me a good introduction of history of modern art."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Scope of the course is very broad but still manages to give you a good sense of movements and individuals. Weakness: 0 female artists or artists of color. Would have been nice to at least have just one woman artist...",
    "Zeidler sometimes runs out of time - he could manage his lecture pacing a bit better.",
    "Very good course! I took the precursor (early 20th century art) with Zeidler and this course was equally great. I would appreciate inclusion of women and artist of color in the material; almost every artist was a white man, which limited my capacity for engagement.",
    "The lectures were extremely engaging because of professor Zeidlers enthusiasm for and knowledge of the subject. The course covered an interesting variety of artists in a meaningful way.",
    "The course is really interesting and professor Zeidler is very engaging. I like the breadth and depth of the material. In terms of places for improvement, it could be a bit more accessible for non-History of Art majors. I feel like expectations for how to perform well are incredibly high if this is your first art history course.",
    "The content of the class is great, and the assignments are designed to test your content of the course and the TFs are great. Can't really think of weaknesses",
    "We did not cover very much material",
    "A bit disorganized.",
    "This is a great class and Zeidler is both an engaged and engaging lecturer. But it is truly unacceptable that in a semester-long class about modern art, we didn't talk about a single female or POC artist.",
    "This question is too broad. I just want my grade.",
    "Overall I thought this course was incredible. The professor was an amazing lecturer, and my TA was also wonderful. The biggest strength of this class was probably the teaching quality, and amount of help available. My TA was incredibly accessible and always willing to set up a meeting to discuss the material or help with my essay. Two of the weaknesses of the course were that my section was too large to go to the art gallery. That was a big disappointment, as many art history classes at Yale are able to hold section in the gallery and its a really great learning experience. It was particularly disappointing because not all of the sections for this class had that problem. More TAs in order to keep all of the sections small enough would have been nice. The other weakness of the class was the lack of diversity of the artists we covered. The class covered a large amount of artwork in the 1950's and 1960's, yet there were no female artists, or artists of color. This felt like a pretty large gap in the curriculum, considering the fact that there were quite a few female artists and artists of color at that time.",
    "We only studied white male artists....somehow only those exist in Post War Art.",
    "I can find no weaknesses. Definitely a challenging course that feels too difficult for non art students as you are doing it but you come out seeig that you were actually just pushed to grow.",
    "Pace was slightly slow",
    "I feel that the class failed to make modern art (notorious for being too out there or too hard to understand) accessible to viewers. Perhaps focusing on a more holistic approach instead of very specific interpretations of select works may be more effective, and then close looking could occur in section. Further, the class did not utilize the opportunity to view pieces in the YUAG that coincided with the themes of the class.",
    "The course solely focused on male artists and neglected to include art made by females or people of color which I see as a huge flaw in the course.",
    "This is class in very interesting becomes it covers many artists in the period, but I hope it could give more supplementary readings and works so that we can have a deeper understanding of each artist."

   "comments": [
    "absolutely",
    "Absolutely. I love Yale art history courses, and postwar art is one of the only courses I've taken that gets past the 60s or so. It was an incredible class.",
    "Yes, this was a great course. Post War Art was my first ever Art HIstory course and I found it incredibly engaging and interesting. The learning curve was tremendous and I feel far more knowledgeable about Post War Art than before the course.",
    "Absolutely. If you're into modern art or are interested in learning more, take it!",
    "Take this class!! You'll love Zeidler's lectures, the readings are super manageable, and it's a really awesome way to engage with a ton of different artists in one course.",
    "Absolutely yes!",
    "Overall, the class was extremely interesting. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Modern Art.",
    "YES",
    "I would recommend taking this class. It is really interesting and starts covering art movements after World War. Take it Cr\/d\/f if you have never taken a History of Art course before!!!",
    "I absolutely loved postwar art. I had never taken an HSAR course before and found it incredibly accessible and interesting. Professor Zeidler was a gem and my TF rebecca really cared that I was learning and improving.",
    "Take this class!!!!!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if they were interested in art history or learning about postwar art, or just in a good lecture course.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend it as it is an incredibly fun and enlightening class. I enjoyed talking about many different mediums of art and how they evolved in the decades following WW2. However, if you are even remotely social-justice-oriented, you are gonna get SO frustrated SO fast by the total lack of representation of POC artists and the total exclusion of women from any sphere other than being depicted (often misogynistically) in the art itself. Worse, the professor never mentions either of these oversights or discusses the lack of prominence of POC \/ women artists in these years.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in art history. Professor Zeidler is an AMAZING lecturer, and I learned a ton in this class as a result. The material was also quite interesting. Lastly, I really liked how accessible this class was. I am a STEM major, and have taken very few art history classes, yet his lectures were extremely clear and easy to understand.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It teaches sensibility that is useful for humanity as opposed to a particular academic field.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class if you are interested in modern art! Prof. Zeidler is a great, engaging lecturer and the material covered is fascinating. Workload is not bad and you really learn a lot about postwar art and the era as a whole.",
    "Yes! Highly engaging",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes!!",
    "Absolutely. Undoubtedly one of the best art history courses I have taken.",
    "I would not recommend this course. There are better, more diverse art history lectures to take. But if you want a class without that much work then go for it.",
    "Yes. I think this is a great introduction course for art history major and non\/-major.",
    "Definitely. If you have any interest in art at all, this is a great course to make you think about and see the post war world in a new and interesting way. Also helps you think about and evaluate not only art, but other visual aspects of the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in art history. This was my first art history class at Yale and I thought the instructors made it easy to participate and really develop a better understanding of art in general.",
    "If you love modern art, absolutely take this course!"
