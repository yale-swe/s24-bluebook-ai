    "Ive gone from a very rough understanding of Hebrew to a secure foundational knowledge of the language. I have also gained, through Dinas enthusiasm, a deeper appreciation of the beauty of modern Hebrew.",
    "We learned a lot of Hebrew vocabulary and grammar in this L1 course. It covers most of the basic conversational phrases and simple grammar rules.",
    "I learned how to read, write, listen, and speak more Hebrew than I ever could imagine was possible in a single semester. I feel like I can hold somewhat of a conversation in Hebrew. I also learned a lot about Israel and the culture there, especially music.",

    "It was great!",
    "The greatest strength of this course is that students get clear feedback very quickly, so it easy to understand how to improve your performance in the class. The Hebrew department is welcoming to questions so it wasn't hard to fill in gaps in your learning between time with the teaching fellow and the language tables.",
    "Everything about this course is great. Professor Roginsky is just amazing and so sweet and really cares about the success of every single student. She creates a very comfortable and light-hearted learning environment, which makes learning a new language not intimidating at all. The workload is a little heavy, in that there is homework every day (because the class meets every day), but I never found it to be difficult and felt that it was necessary in order to learn this much Hebrew. The small class setting was intimidating at first, but you get to know everyone really well, which makes coming to class every day even more fun!",
    "Hebrew tables are very helpful!"

    "Yes! It is structured immaculately and Dina is so kind and understanding. The class is just amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with even a slight interest in Hebrew or Israeli culture. I was never bored in class and even enjoyed doing homework for the class because it was engaging and unique.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Forget whatever language you learned in high school. This was the best class I took this semester and I'm so glad this is how I began my Yale career. Learning this language is so much fun (and a major flex, by the way) and the Hebrew program at Yale is just incredible. You'll get close with the people in your class, the professor, and teaching fellows. There are so many resources and cool opportunities to do random things. I never thought I could feel so connected to a language, but because of this program, I want to take every class I possibly can and go all the way to L5!",
    "Absolutely!! Wonderful class!! I learned so much Hebrew and I felt very confident in my speaking skills."
