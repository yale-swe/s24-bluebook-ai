    "Take it if you're interested in developing painting skills. I'm not an art or art history major and I found that the practice I gained in this course and way of thinking about material was useful in life generally and also probably influenced the other work I did this semester in positive and creative ways.",
    "Take this class if you love painting and want to develop your own painting ideas, which you'll definitely get a chance to do by the end. The beginning is more structured, with set assignments, but the end is more up to the student to construct. For the final, there is a required number of pieces, but it's up to you to think of what you'd like to produce as a final product.",
    "Definitely recommend the course if you're serious about painting and have an idea of what you want to pursue for the semester"
