    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. I've taken my fair share of difficult\/hard \/ridiculous courses, but none of even come close to the bullshit\/suckiness\/foolishness of this course. YOU WILL LEARN NOTHING. The professor sucks so bad someone called him out in class outloud for it. Think that the TA will be your oasis in the desert? More like a mirage that is actually a swamp. YOU WILL STRUGGLE. Not listing linear algebra as a prereq for this class is like telling a freshman to shop John Starr's Public Schools Policy seminar (every year there are so many people shopping Starr's class that they overfill the room). Thank god I had linear algebra before this class or else I would have been royally screwed. YOU WILL QUESTION YOUR LIFE CHOICES. Because come the midterm, you will think to yourself \"I really should have listened to that review on OCS\/Bluebook\/Coursetable.\" And I will agree.",
    "Very interesting stuff, but the material is very scattered - that being said, it all comes together at the end of the semester rather nicely. Prof. Zucker is a good lecturer and very excited about the material, though he sometimes skips over some details and goes into others too much. The problem sets were not that hard, though they are much easier if you have some math\/coding background - in the end most of them were also really cool\/fulfilling once you understood what was going on. TA was not very helpful\/communicative, but he got better as the semester progressed.",
    "Many cool concepts, zero depth. Prof. Zucker spends his entire academic career researching and understanding the mathematics behind vision, then decides it's a good idea to cram all of that knowledge into one semester. Would not recommend, find another science credit, even if you're a computer science major.",
    "CS Students - don't take it unless you are really interested in the math behind vision. Although Linear Algebra is not a listed prerequisite, it should be.",
    "You make a lot of friends through this class by struggling together. Only take it if you're really interested in the material or need the credit for your major.",
    "BENG 475 is only alright. Professor Zucker brings some really good qualitative explanations to the table and introduces concepts like Fourier transforms and linear transformations in really innovative and interesting ways. HOWEVER if I hadnt learned these concepts previously, I dont think I would have understood what was going on. Class was unclear at times, and while the problem sets were fun and interesting, I often had a hard time grasping the overall takeaways from the course. The final was fair and he was very clear as to which concepts to study. TAKE NOTES IN CLASS!! He recommends that you dont, but had I from the beginning, I would have learned more. It's not too hard though. That makes it more attractive to take.",
    "Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. Do not be tempted by the dual status of this course as a CS elective and Sc credit, it is not worth it. Zucker's lectures are a complete mess, and his lecture \"notes\" are just chapters of an unfinished, unedited, and poorly written textbook and are far too dense for you to learn anything truly meaningful. The psets are okay. They're not too difficult, are a decent way to learn Matlab, and have some pretty cool results, but you will unnecessarily struggle most of the time to understand Zucker's writings and decipher exactly what it is he wants you to do. Just stay away.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the overlap between neuroscience and CS. Don't take it if you are only interested in traditional software engineering-geared courses.",
    "This is a course with fascinating material, an engaging lecturer, and almost none of the organization, materials or planning that might make it more than another disorganized CS elective. I took in Credit-D, thank god. Our final consisted of 2 pure linear algebra questions, 1 pure biology question, and the rest were kind of fair. I would worry, if I were you, about A) knowing the basic linear algebra cold and B) understanding how Zucker frames problems, rather than memorizing formulae.",
    "Honestly no Too dispersed and very stressful because of how disorganized it was",
    "This class is absolutely absurd. It seems as if the professor believes the information is too difficult for the students to understand, so he just doesn't really teach things in a way that logically make sense. He just babbles random info. that you then have to memorize (not possibly understand) for exams. There were 7 p sets, that take about 2-8 hours each, that aren't really bad. The exams aren't bad either. So overall it's not a hard class, but be prepared to understand nothing.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested who is NOT used to proof-based QR classes. This class was quite frustrating for someone like me who comes from a pure math background. The class is very math-intensive, but not in the way that I am most confortable with. Every other math class I have taken at Yale (230, 301, 310, 350, for example) is proof-based. If you expect to see (even remotely) rigorous derivations of Fourier Transform, NyquistShannon sampling theorem and many other beautiful results covered in this class, it is NOT for you. If you do not seek to really understand the results but want to just be informed of their applications in Computer Vision, and can bear (I can't) the gaping holes from the omission of the vast technical details in the lectures (and even in the supplementary lecture notes), you might find this class more enjoyable. Some people may say that the class requires a lot of math background, it really does not. Although it might be helpful to know some Linear Algebra, the course never goes beyond basic calculus when actually testing the students in exams. Sometimes I even felt that the more background you have in math, the more confused you get from the incompleteness of the derivations unless, of course, you've learned all these topics in Applied Math in a rigorous setting (I have not). One point that redeems the class for me is the homework. It really surprised me that with such elementary mathematical understanding of the material, one can still use MATLAB to do some serious image processing. The assignments were extremely fun to do but the TA graded them very slowly (I had only one homework grade back before the final exam, and we had 6 assignments over the semester). The math lectures are very fast and quite impossible to follow at times with all the handwaving and the spontaneous leture style of Professor Zucker. The biology lectures are better in this regard. Finally, in Prof. Zucker's own words, the class \"is like scuba diving with one foot tied to a speedboat: you see all these beautiful fish but you are dragged past them so fast that you can't see any of them clearly\". At least for me, it's hard to appreciate the beauty of those that appear only blurry.",
    "Vision is an intriguing and bewildering topic, and so is this class. You'll probably be baffled by the lectures\/notes, which are way more detailed than necessary. The MATLAB assignments though really help you learn and focus on what matters, and are fairly straightforward. Stick with it, and by the end you'll hopefully notice all the beautiful connections between everything Zucker covered, as I did. I recommend having some familiarity with neuroscience, linear algebra\/calculus, and programming, though.",
    "If you are taking this class just to fulfill a science credit. DO NOT do it. It's not worth it. It is only worth taking if you are really, desperately interested in the topic.",
    "CPSC 475 is a hodgepodge mix of topics but can be best summarized as the random, multidisciplinary topics that make up Professor Zucker's specific research area. Although not listed as a prereq, knowledge of linear algebra would be really helpful to the class. Problem sets are not too programming heavy and mainly involve getting to know and troubleshooting MATLAB, which is oftentimes incredibly frustrating. Overall though, the problem sets did not take too long. The midterm and final are conceptual and don't require too much regurgitation of facts, though it's not clear what topics will be on the exam. The lecture notes cover a lot of topics that he is not able to go through each year, so it's difficult to know which topics are stressed on the exam. The lecture notes are also verbose and not very clear, so do plan on going to lecture. Take this class if you are a cs major interested in computation and biology, it's a cool look into computational neuroscience.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It was an interesting class and I learned a lot, the work wasn't too bad, though there was often a lot to learn before the midterm and final. the problem sets are weirdly related to the class and often in a somewhat convoluted way.",
    "Although the topic of Computational Vision seems very interesting, and I was excited about taking this course, the class is rather disappointing. It is horribly organized, even though Zucker has been teaching it for years. He gives lecture notes, but they are very much works in progress, with whole sections missing and some ending mid-sentence, and it is very unclear what you are responsible for knowing from the hodge podge. Homeworks are listed as being every two weeks, with each PSET due two weeks after it was assigned, but we ended up having three different PSETs due the last week. Speaking of the PSETs, we didn't get a single grade back until after the midterm (well after the C\/D\/fail conversion deadline) so it was impossible to tell how you were doing. The exams aren't super difficult, but they are really random, and I was confused about why many of the questions on the final were there, because they were only very tangentially related to anything we had done.",
    "you learn some cool stuff in this class, but the lecture is nearly impossible to follow. It wanders through a bunch of disparate topics in advanced math (statistics, diff eq, linear algebra, probability etc). The material is a lot of hard math. On top of that, the lecture notes are awful. There are 20+ pages of dense math notes for each lecture, 90% of which is beyond the scope of what was taught in class. Zucker seems to think that the addition of this excess material improves the class, but all it does is totally obscure the important concepts. While the class teaches a ton of difficult math, only the easiest parts are actually tested. The homeworks are actually pretty good, and you learn more from doing the psets than trying to follow along in class. Separate from that, this class was very poorly organized, and at times it felt like a total farce. the TA accidentally posted the answer key to the first problem set online instead of the actual problem set, so that homework had to be cancelled. And then, for some strange reason, the TA chose not to grade ANY of the biweekly homeworks we had turned in until mid-November, at which point 4 homework assignments and the midterm had already been completed.",
    "The class was a bit all over the place, but I guess that was expected given that the course caters to both CS majors and bio majors, as well as everything in between (BME, applied math, etc.). Before the midterm and before the final, things did come together (probably because I sat down with the material and finally worked through it at my own pace). Zucker is a very nice guy. He's clearly passionate about the subject matter and wants us to understand it. At the same time, I think he might be trying to cover too much.",
    "The material is really interesting and beautifully interdisciplinary- I thought multiple times that this is what all classes should be like. However, because it relies so heavily on an understanding of more elementary concepts from diverse fields, it is a non-stop struggle to grasp, unless you have a really good understanding of those areas. Prof. Zucker's dense class notes and weaving lecture style that just brushes over complex math and science does not make that any easier. A really intelligent student who just \"gets\" math might be able to follow, but you should really ask yourself if you want to struggle with that. You will need to actually understand the stuff (conceptually at least) for psets and exams- every bit of math that is touched for 5 min in lecture will come back to bite you- so ask yourself if you want that. If you do, this is a cool class that could be more well organized, and will be frustrating but interesting. If you don't, don't even consider this class.",
    "The class addresses many different questions regarding human and computer vision: \"How do we see?\", \"How do we recognize things in the world around us?\", \"How does depth perception work?\", \"How can we model the biological process of vision through computation?\", etc. It's ambitious and it can be exciting if you're extremely interested in learning about how vision works. It's certainly not a true computer science class, there's not a significantly large amount of biology or engineering, and there's a surprising amount of math involved. This class is unusual, so you'll definitely want to shop several lectures before you decide. (however, many of the first lectures are about basic calculus, so those don't accurately represent the rest of the class) If you don't pay close attention to the lectures, it's very easy to get lost. They're complicated, and the lecture notes can be extremely difficult to read. It helps if you are genuinely interested in the lecture topics, or you might find the lectures rather boring. Some of the stuff can be fascinating, such as learning how those face averaging algorithms work and then actually implementing one in the homework. On the topic of the homework, there's one assignment every 2 weeks and it'll take 5-7 hours. There are about 8 total. Not bad at all. To BENG majors: this class covers a lot of basic image processing concepts that you'll probably see in more detail in other bioimaging courses. The class is almost entirely computer science majors, but you won't have to worry about being disadvantaged because of that. There's not a whole lot of pure computer science, and you'll actually have an advantage when it comes to the biology (basic neuro, action potential stuff) and the coding (all MATLAB).",
    "Great introduction to the basic principles of computer vision; liked the format and concept of the class, but lectures could be a bit scattershot. Take this class, but supplement it with other work.",
    "Don't take this class for granted or else you will not be ready for the midterm and final. They are completely different from the psets. You will find it much easier if you've taken linear algebra or differential equations, unlike myself.",
    "This is a very interesting class that covers a lot of material very quickly. If you fall behind, you will have difficulty keeping up with lectures, because they all build on each other. Occasionally it will be more useful to refer to Wikipedia pages or lecture notes than to pay attention. The homework is entirely in MATLAB. You will feel lost when you first read it, but if you keep a MATLAB programming reference open you will be able to work through it eventually. It's also not always clear if you've settled on the right answer.",
    "Terrible course. Very cool topic but poorly taught.",
    "I would recommend CPSC 475 to any person interested in how we can put biological processes into mathematical contexts. I thought it was a very rewarding class. Nevertheless, do NOT expect to understand a lot during lecture. The Matlab programs were fun, but it taught me that I highly dislike Matlab.",
    "Be prepared for lots of lectures about mathematical topics that you would probably have trouble understanding if you aren't a math major. While linear algebra and above isn't technically required, a firm understanding of higher mathematical concepts is definitely recommended. Zucker doesn't expect everyone to understand the math, so the problem sets and tests won't be focused too much on the more abstract concepts. But it helps a lot to be able to understand what he's going over in class.",
    "The class is a mix of math, computer science, and biology. The topics covered are pretty cool, and Prof. Zucker is good at drawing connections between seemingly unrelated algorithms, biological structures, and mathematical concepts. Although the only requirement is math 120 (and even that is not critical for survival here), Prof. Zucker skims through a lot of topics, especially in math, including Fourier analysis, SVD\/PCA, and some other random linear algebra, and you will definitely get more out of the class if you have at least seen these topics before. Psets are in Matlab and take a resonable amount of time, but we had 1 pset in the first month and 3 in the last two weeks, so they definitely could have been spread out better. Overall, I'd recommend the class to anyone interested in the material who doesn't mind a bit of disorganization. As far as taking it for an easy CS elective (without interest in the material), I'm not sure if the confusion is worth it.",
    "Avoid at all costs. The topic was interesting, but the professor was rude, the syllabus was not followed (and changed), exam dates were not announced, homework was not returned for months after submission, or not at all, and the content of the course follows a route such that the core topic is not truly approached until the final lecture (the professor pointed out that in previous years it had been stretched over the final three lectures, but this year we had lost time because students were unfamiliar with Linear Algebra - which should be a prereq but was not because, as the professor admitted, having it as a prereq would lower enrollment significantly)."
