   "comments": [
    "I learned far more about the history of the Jewish people than I could have imagined coming into the course. I also believe that my writing improved dramatically through the paper revision process and the incredibly helpful feedback I received on my previous work.",
    "I learned all about modern Jewish History, giving me the insight into what's led up to the current state of worldwide Jewry.",
    "I learned how to build an argument around firm evidence and place historical events and trends in context.",
    "Modern Jewish History is fascinating and extremely well-taught. This one one of the finest, all-around history classes I've taken at Yale (and I'm a senior). Professor Sorkin boils down complex historical trends in one hour but leaves you with the resources and the framework to explore on your own. You will learn how to read primary sources, how to write strong but concise papers, and how to place Jewish history in the context of other groups in world history. Sometimes, the class is more of a discussion as the professor moves from student comment to student comment, parsing out important historical themes. At other times, it is more of a lecture. It is a great mix of teaching styles. And, you get to rewrite all of your papers! I highly recommend this course.",
    "I really found a greater appreciation for my heritage as well as learning about broader Jewish history. The readings were fantastic (including visionaries like Phillip Roth) and Professor Sorkin was unbelievable.",
    "My writing definitely improved over the course of the semester. Lots of papers with rewrites for each one.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. I learned so much about Jewish history and felt that I expanded my knowledge of Jewish history. Professor Sorkin made sure that the material was things that we had not typically covered, for example, we would spend very little time on events like the Holocaust and the foundation of Israel, and more on emancipation and early Jewish history. It made the class much stronger."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course are in learning from the wonderful teaching of Professor Sorkin, the incredible depth of knowledge provided by the readings and (at least this semester) one of the better Teaching Fellows I've encountered at Yale. The only drawback was the massive amount of reading required for the class that often made it difficult to stay on top of all the material.",
    "The course was extremely well taught and structured. The only fault I can find with the class is that it consistently ran over time, and I was late pretty much every day to my next class. That being said, I enjoyed every minute of this class and didn't really mind that it ran over.",
    "Strengths: Professor Sorkin is a brilliant lecturer. He found a way to connect very disparate parts of the course together, and the course became very cohesive through his detailed analysis of Jewish history.",
    "Very engaging and well organized. Could use time in Discussion Section more effectively and perhaps have more regular feedback from the head professor.",

    "In all respects, my favorite course yet.",
    "The best thing of this course is the textbooks. It was absolutely fantastic, I loved reading it and often times read it for fun (I know, haha). I think that the course should eliminate its section, however. It was repetitive a lot of times and at an awkward time slot because we had to accommodate so many different schedules. Professor Sorkin often ran out of time because he had so much to talk about only for us to repeat the same things in section, so I think the class would be improved by making it 1:15 twice a week than 50 minutes twice a week with a section."

    "I could not recommend this course more highly to anyone who has any interest in history of any kind. While I would assume that most of the people who take this class are Jewish, I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys well-taught history classes regardless of their religion.",
    "Yes; it gives a great overview of modern Jewish history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student in learning more about modern history of the Jewish people.",
    "Modern Jewish History with Professor Sorkin is a spectacular class. Prof. Sorkin is brilliant, and he has a great way of connecting different parts of history together and creating a really clear and cohesive picture. His lectures are great, and the assigned reading supported the lectures really well. Plus he brings candy!",
    "Yes, given that the student has an interest in the subject. Interesting, engaging, and accessible.",

    "Most definitely",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Sorkin is an amazing professor, and he teaches the material so well. He is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. I learned so much about modern Jewish history in this class.",
    "Yes. Fantastic Course.",
    "Absolutely. You won't regret it. Professor Sorkin was one of the best professors I have ever had at Yale. I had a lot of medical issues this semester and almost withdrew from Yale as a whole (he definitely knows who this is now, hi professor!). Professor Sorkin was always very understanding and supportive; it meant the world to me when I was dealing with a ton of other problems. The class itself is incredibly useful. Professor Sorkin makes sure to structure the majority of the material around events in Jewish history that you are more likely to be least familiar with, for example, we focus less on the Holocaust and the foundation Israel (but read a lot of great material for those short units) but more on early Jewish history. I loved the course and highly recommend anyone to take it.",
    "This is honestly one of the best taught and most fascinating history classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Sorkin is kind and brilliant. Take it!!"
