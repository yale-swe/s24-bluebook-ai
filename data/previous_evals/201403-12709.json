   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend this course. The readings can seem a little unmanageable at times but they're totally worth the time. The novels are especially interesting, though some parts were difficult to get through (and should have come with trigger warnings). The discussions were always interesting, though, in the future, this factor would depend on the students who join the course. Again, the work is worth it and you should definitely take this course.",
    "This class mostly focuses on Chicano and Dominican literature and culture. It is a good class that I would recommend taking. It has a reasonable amount of reading and the discussions are always interesting.",
    "Great readings, interesting material if you care about Urban issues and\/or Latinidad. The course was a bit concentrated on Dominican\/Cuban\/PR and Mexican experiences and I would have liked a bit more diversity but still enjoyed the seminars\/readings and work, which was reasonable and felt balanced.",
    "Urban Latina\/o cultures covers so many aspects of culture as you learn new things and new ways of thinking. I recommend to anyone interested in learning more about latino culture.",
    "AMST 337 is a weekly seminar that focuses on close reading texts by Latino authors while paying special attention to overarching themes that have affected Latino communities in the United States. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class. There are very few courses at Yale that allow you to study Latino\/a literature, and even if it is a subject that you have not thought about much in the past there is a lot of rich material to benefit from. The workload is reasonable, but you will still come away having read and discussed some great stories and films.",
    "A great course! Professor Ramirez is a really great instructor and she really challenges you and pushes you to think critically about the material. She may seem intimidating at first, but she really does care about her students and wants to help them succeed. The course is pretty cool and the readings\/films\/music on the syllabus are gems. I probably would have never been exposed to some of this art without this class, which is such a shame because these are great works. There is so much underrepresentation of Latina\/o literature in most academic settings, but it's SO SO important to read these authors. If you're considering this class with zero-minimal knowledge of Latin@ literature or Latin@ culture, this class would benefit you the most and you should DEFINITELY take it! I had an amazing experience.",
    "A must take if you are interested in topics of race, gender, or migration. Professor Ramirez chooses interesting readings and leads class in a structured yet creative manner. There are a lot of enjoyable readings and films. The workload is definitely manageable, but Professor Ramirez expects your best on the midterm and final essays. It was truly enjoyable, just take it!"
