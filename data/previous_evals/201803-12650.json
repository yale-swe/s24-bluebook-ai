   "comments": [
    "The course is a bit taboo in that it's essentially just weekly voice lessons. That said, the course is directed and aimed at improving what you are looking to improve upon. In that vein it behaves more so as a guided independent study. Loved the formatting.",
    "they're lessons",
    "The communication about the lessons program in general could be improved - it's been very unclear throughout what exactly the policies on required theory classes, etc. are.",
    "Lessons are lessons; can't really be changed too much.",
    "I sometimes felt I did not have enough time to practice, but I think this was due to the fact that I was still learning how to manage my time in my first semester.",
    "I cannot think of any weaknesses; my lessons were always excellent!",
    "The program itself needs to be way more organized than it was this year. I didn't even start my lessons until about halfway through September, and juries were incredibly messy as well in terms of scheduling.",
    "Strengths: focuses on classical music technique Weaknesses: We went over very few songs and we never expanded the song choices. The teacher would choose the song for you so I hated half my songs as well.",
    "There are no weaknesses! Taking voice lessons for credit is academically rewarding and fun.",
    "Strength is definitely studio classmaybe wish we could have them more often?",
    "I am very grateful that Yale offers private lessons for credit! My first semester was an incredible experience!",
    "Strengths-- Ole is amazing. He gives lots of good advice \/ musical ideas. No weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it to anyone looking to improve upon their skills as a classical singer. It is absolutely not aimed at pop, musical theater, or other styles of vocal performance, so do not apply if that's what you're looking for.",
    "if you want to take lessons, you should take lessons",
    "yes!!",
    "Yes-- for students looking to further past studies in private instrumental studies.",
    "If you want to keep studying your instrument at a relatively rigorous level, taking lessons is a good option.",
    "Yes. Lessons are essential to becoming a better musician.",
    "yep!",
    "I would strongly recommend taking music lessons for credit because it is simply a great opportunity to get better at a musical instrument.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to go into performing arts, who isn't looking to spend money on first-rate voice lessons, and wants to be classically trained.",
    "Yes! Professor Parisot is great and I feel I've learned a lot in a very friendly environment.",
    "No",
    "Absolutely! If you are serious about vocal technique, I would recommend taking lessons for credit.",
    "Yes of course!",
    "If you're interested in pursuing singing seriously, I highly recommend taking lessons for credit. They are very helpful.",
    "I would recommend lessons to any student invested in their instrument as a soloist.",
    "Yes, if you are a cellist you should definitely study with Ole. I always leave my lessons in awe, and feeling much better than when I came in.",
    "I would strongly recommend voice lessons for credit. As a singer, it is so, so important to be practicing under a teacher. Bad habits form easily and leave slowly. My teacher is excellent -- we get along well, and my singing is getting better and better."
