    "Probably not. I don't think I learned enough during the semester to make it worthwhile.",
    "Take Documentary Photojournalism in New Haven if you're interested in exploring the city, and if you're comfortable enough with maintaining your own photography project. For example, if you wanted to photography homelessness in New Haven, you'd have to be able to schedule meetings with shelters, etc. on your own time. Completing a project requires long-term vision and the dedication to see it through.Also, having a genuine interest in photography and photography technique helps too!",
    "Take it essentially if you want to get credit for working toward your own project (not that you need a project in mind before getting in). The course is not one to teach you how to take photos - you can take the class as a novice, but much of the learning to take good photos, you'll have to do yourself. I know Lori was thinking of including a learning period at the start of the term for beginners to learn to use your camera, but even if she does, that'll be short. You'll also need an (D)SLR camera and some way to develop all your own photos digitally or analog as the class has no access to a dark room or the DMCA.The course, I found was very good if you were motivated to go out and find something or someone in the community to work on a documentary. The biggest workload from this course will be finding someone who is willing to let you photograph them and going wherever they are in New Haven (or further) to do so."
