   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Take this class. Professor Karas truly improves your writing.",
    "It's a bread-and-butter intro English course. You read books and articles, discuss them in class, and write analytical papers on them. The class provides a good review of researching and writing critically in general.",
    "It is a writing class about happiness.I would recommend it as a great way to get a writing credit and as a good introduction to a higher level of writing than high school.",
    "Andrew Karas is a kind and compassionate professor. My style of writing was quite different to that expected of us at Yale. Andrew's teaching and comments on my papers inspired me to challenge myself and break free from the conventions I was used to. As a result, I feel more confident with my writing and no longer feel the slight urge to shy away from essay classes.",
    "Great way to start writing at Yale. Learn all the core elements of essay writing with other freshman who know just as much. Reasonably work intensive but not hard to keep up if organized.",
    "English 114 is exactly what you expect- a topic-oriented writing class. Choose a topic you're passionate about and make sure your papers are reviewed by at least 3 people. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend english 114 to any of my peers. The class helped to improve my writing and dealt with an interesting subject!",
    "Much better than a lecture class. I felt like I got to know everyone in the class and have fun yet meaningful discussions.",
    "This is an introductory writing course at Yale. You will learn how to write an academic essay in the style that Yale suggests. There are several essay assignments over the course of the semester ranging from 4 pages to 10 pages. If you want to become a better academic writer, take this class. You'll be writing a good deal, editing papers, and having interesting, in depth discussion about happiness and the many definitions and factors we think contribute to it. This is not positive psychology, so don't think thatyou are going to walk away (X) times happier. You will walk away with a realistic view of how different aspects of your life contribute to your life, and a health skepticism for statements like money buys happiness, and all you need are friends to make you happy.",
    "English 114 12 is a course that approaches a very common topic in different unique ways. If you think that in this class you will just discuss the philosophy portion of the pursuit of happiness think again. In this seminar we explore our views of the pursuit of happiness against other views. We argue for or against other views and provide viable research as to why we, or they are correct in their pursuits. The techniques applied in the papers are incredibly helpful and will continue to aid you as you continue your career at Yale.The readings and the research very interesting and eye-opening. I would recommend this course to any of my fellow students.",
    "Absolutely. The Pursuit of Happiness is a class that every Yalie should take. It grazes over so many different fields, and is so applicable to one's daily life. For me at least, it changed the way I think of happiness -- for the better.",
    "This is a basic introductory writing course. It really helps improve your writing. Professor Karas is excellent and really makes this course worth while."
