   "comments": [
    "It is a class that requires time and effort but you do learn a lot. You get a lot more comfortable speaking and using different types of grammar. It moves pretty quickly and covers a lot of material and everyone in the class has had experience taking Spanish for awhile. Definitely take this class with Sonia Valle. She is actually amazing and makes the class a thousand times better. She is extremely nice and helpful and makes everyone feel comfortable speaking in class. This course can be a lot of work and it meets everyday, so it does require a good amount of your time. The work usually is not particularly difficult but it does take some time.",
    "This class is very time consuming but the instructor, Sonia Valle, is absolutely amazing. She genuinely wants you to understand the material and will work with you personally just to ensure you're up to speed. Take this class! It made me love Spanish. Also, choose your class time wisely. This class meet every day.",
    "I would recommend that you take this class you have the opportunity. This is a great opportunity to practice your grammar and improve your Spanish. The work is easy to handle even though it is every day. Be prepared to practice every day.",
    "This class is very fast paced and requires that you stay on top of your work consistently. However, your understanding of the Spanish language will improve exponentially.",
    "Spanish 130 is a perfect course to pick up on if you took high school Spanish but aren't perfectly skilled in Spanish yet. It covers every single grammar topic and teaches a lot of reading comprehension and speaking as well.",
    "Spanish 130 is an excellent review of the important areas of Spanish and will improve your speaking, writing, and listening. The course is pretty well designed, and I would encourage other students to take the course, especially with Profesora Valle.",
    "Take it if you want to learn Spanish! It's estimated by 2025, 1\/4 of the U.S. with understand Spanish, let alone all the other countries outside of the U.S. that already speak it... so an incredibly practical language to learn. Stay on top of course work, it can pile up."
