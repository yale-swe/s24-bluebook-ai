   "comments": [
    "I switched sections but still, No TA knows anything about the materials.We don't learn things in the end. We just do formal analysis and guess what they mean in sections.Lectures are good, just too much emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism. Good if you are into that.",
    "It's a good introductory art history class!",
    "Super interesting class, definitely take it. Midterm and final both very manageable, class was always really fascinating. Took it for the humanities credit and it totally met all my expectations in terms of workload to enjoyment ratio.",
    "This class is all about Buddhist Art and Architecture. It examines art from all types of eras and all countries. Two exams and a final paper. Plus section. It's very manageable and a lot of fun.",
    "First art history class I've taken but it was a good one. Got me interested in Buddhism. I enjoyed the material very much. You will too.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend Buddhist art as an introductory art history class. It isn't too dense of material and is all interesting.",
    "Good intro into Buddhist art, which I never would have thought I would study at Yale. It's a pretty easy course with light workload, the only thing that is mildly difficult is memorizing names like Wat Mahathat or Jnanadakini Mandala as well as their years\/country of origin\/materials (just print out the master list and quiz yourself over and over again). Reading is very minimal - there are a few articles that you probably should read but otherwise the lectures cover most of the stuff. Requirements for the 10-15 page final paper were really vague (is it a reflection paper or an analysis?) and could have been more specific. Mimi Yiengpruksawan is really sweet and kind. Looking back I have 100% more knowledge about Buddhism and Buddhist art now than I had when I started. This is kind of cool because I can apply this knowledge to Asian cultures in general, since Buddhism is clearly a pervasive force in daily life there even today.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is sort of a survey course covering buddhist art. The lectures and the professor were enjoyable. The class is structured it such a way as to really make it possible for you to attempt to engage with the art as much as possible without too much fear regarding grades. They just want you to learn history of art techniques and to enjoy working with the pieces. The material is interesting, the workload is very manageable, and the structure of the class makes it pretty fun.",
    "A great art history class whether you are an art history major or not. You don't even have to care about Buddhism (although you will at the end) it is just truly a great class.",
    "A great class! I'm an econ major who needed a Humanities credit, but taking this class made the requirement extremely enjoyable. It's a must if you are interested (even if just mildly) in Buddhism and\/or East Asian culture. The lectures are easy to follow but vital to go to - don't take this class if you plan on skimping on attendance. There workload is light: just 2 exams and a final paper. The reading is helpful and short but not vital to learning the material.",
    "The class is extremely interesting and it is not that difficult. The work load is pretty minimal (two exams and a paper), but going to class is always a pleasure because you learn a lot. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "The chillest class I have ever taken. Mimi is awesome and very flexible with deadlines. The class isn't a gut, but it's very straightforward and the amount of material is small. Good class for anyone interested in the topic or looking for a humanities class without too much work.",
    "wonderful class with important materials...lectures are great, required workload not a lot (but you can definitely spend a lot of time reading different materials if you want to!)... take it! really important perspective to be introduced if you are interested in art history",
    "yes, this class is decently interesting and easy, solid art history class.",
    "Great class. The material is interesting, and the workload is very, very reasonable. I had never taken an Art History class so don't let that discourage you from taking the class; in fact, it's a great introduction to formal visual analysis as well as Buddhist culture. The class is 2 mid-terms and a paper, and Mimi gives you all the material you need to succeed. This class has gotten me to think about taking more classes in the Art History department. It's a great 5th (or 6th) class to add to your schedule.",
    "This course is the second part of a two part series on introductory Buddhist Art and Architecture. The workload is not only extremely doable this class is a gateway to understand one of the greatest religious systems in the world and understand art from the Asian continent as a whole. The lecture is extremely well done and the material is fascinating and interesting. I absolutely reccomend this course for anyone thinking of dabbling in Art History since Professor Yiengpruksawan is amazing and really cares about her students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The work load was not bad at all, the material very interesting, the professor really laid back and passionate and the testing infrequent."
