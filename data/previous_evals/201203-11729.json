    "It's a decent course, but be aware that music theory is a technical subject, and MUSI 110 is very much about the structure about pieces and chords, not necessarily about the beauty of music or listening to great pieces (there are other classes for that). It covers all the basics\u00e2\u0080\u0094scales, different kinds of chords, roman numeral analysis. Plus, if you're in Richard Lalli's class, while the class can get a little tedious, you get to compose some of your own pieces and hear a School of Music student sing them, which is a fabulous experience!",
    "This is a solid introduction to music theory taught by someone who clearly enjoys what he is doing. The homework takes effort. The instructor explained at the beginning of the class that you have to do some music practice daily. Some of the homework is tedious because you can absorb this stuff only through constant repetition. You learn an astonishing amount in one semester. I even got to write two songs and to hear them performed in class. All of my classmates seemed to find the course thoroughly enjoyable, as did I. You should too, if you are willing to do the work.",
    "Great class. Gotta spend some time on homework, though. You must take it with Richard Lalli!",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I was a true beginner (could figure out treble clef pitches, but had never learned bass clef or played any instrument) and by the end of the semester, I was able to play piano chords and do simple harmonic analysis of musical pieces. We did two compositions during the semester and several keyboard quizzes and singing exercises. I put a lot of effort into this class but Professor Lalli had realistic expectations of me the whole semester so I was never too stressed. Professor Lalli is the BEST, so patient and a very nice person. I will miss this class a lot.",
    "Yes. Especially if you have even a tangential interest in music."
