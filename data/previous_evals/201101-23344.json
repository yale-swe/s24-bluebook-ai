    "There was a bit of confusion and a little disorganization in some of the activities and field trips. This was my only and very minor suggestion for improvement.I grew to like and respect Mike's teaching and mentorship more and more throughout the semester. He provided sophisticated analyses of forestry from operational and logistical and economic perspectives but also social and political considerations. He was knowledgeable about forestry laws in many states and had insightful critiques of federal policy and politics. I treasured his seasoned and reasonable criticism of forestry practices. I know I'll be thinking about his observations and judgments for years to come. And I look forward to staying in touch with Mike for years to come.",
    "Question 9: The field trips were excellent. The last trip would have run even better had we had the paperwork figured out ahead of time.",
    "One of the best courses I've ever taken. A great teacher, great material, great field work.",
    "This class is so important. We have so few opportunities to learn about practical aspects and challenges of applied forestry, this course is a standout. It's also taught by a highly knowledgeable and well-rounded professional who embodies what he teaches. He draws from a range of professional experiences which helps us a lot in gaining a good perspective on the management challenges of forest operations. There is so much to learn in assessing the fine line between acceptable and damaging forest management, and it's impossible to do so without multiple extended field exercises, which this class provides. We came a little closer to understanding what was OK and what was not in harvest assessment, which is impossible to teach via textbook."

   "comments": [
    "Mike's broad intelligence and his good naturedness.",
    "1. Going into the field and discussing operations with practitioners2. Picking Mike's brain about FSC\/SFI and other auditing of forests and forest management3. The last field exercise where we inventoried a parcel and then designed a harvest plan- this was a relatively simple exercise and FES needs more hands on practice like it4. Being held to a high standard on written reports- we had many reports to turn in and Mike set very high expectations for how those were put together and written. This emphasis on professionalism is very important.",
    "Field work.",
    "field time. felt more confident every time we went into the field.",
    "Students can learn practical and real technique on forest operations.",
    "The instructor - he's so excited about teaching this class, he really gets our needs and what we're learning (and what we're not) at FES and how to bring across the essential aspects of forest operations. He's an excellent teacher and visibly enjoys spending time with us, which is a great motivation."

    "A warmer winter so we could have gotten out more.",
    "1. Communication and organization. Everything came together well, but it would have been nice to have had more clarity on when things were due, and what we needed to prepare for each class.",
    "possibly a mock final. to go in to the field and give a post harvest evaluation then share. the final was an informative process, but more practice before hand would be great. or spend some time going over trip reports comparing and contrasting.",
    "I think the class could benefit from being taught more intensively - I know Mike's schedule is demanding, but it would be great to visit some operating pulp\/paper\/sawmill, to talk more about forest industry (where is all that wood going and what does it mean for management and harvest?) or an extended schedule - taught on occasional Fridays from September through March. Also, I felt like I was tat the verge of getting it - one or two more field trips, and I think I could have been much more comfortable with assessing the fine line between \"good\" and \"bad\" operations."

    "The TA was very helpful.",
    "1. Mike is a little hard to get in touch with while he is traveling for work.I would appreciate him responding briefly but in a timely manner to emails. However, this is a price I am more than wiling to pay given FES's need to have more professionals teaching hands-on classes where we get out in the field.2. Shelby was always very available although her communication with Mike about assignments and class topics could have been better. I think that the TA-instructor relationship in this course is absolutely an essential one and in the future, we should be sure to have them communicate better so as to be on the same pageat all times.",
    "Great.",
    "good. TA was good at relaying logistics and planning trips.",
    "The instructor is outside the school, but he is very accessible on email.",
    "Excellent - quick to respond and very willing to help."

    "1. This is one of the most helpful and informative courses that I have taken while at FES. As we MFs learn about soils, silviculture, ecology and so forth, it is essential that we also learn how machinery and people operate in a forest during a harvest.This class provides us opportunities to discuss silviculture, forestry, forest industry and landowner objectives. It is a wonderful and absolutely essential part of the curriculum here at FES.",

Nobody wants to show off a poorly done harvest, but I would like us to have one to go look at and assess.",

Demand clarity as far as when assignments are due.3. Go on the southern forestry field trip.4. Proofread each assignment repeatedly- Mike is a real stickler for any unprofessional grammatical errors.",
    "Take with the Southern Field Trip - a knockout combo.",
    "Ask questions as many as possible because the instructor has much practical knowledge that other instructors do not have.",
    "Hmmm - ask Mike for more field trips."
