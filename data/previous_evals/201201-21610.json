   "comments": [
    "The great thing about this lab is that there are no lab write-ups and there is virtually no work outside of lab. There were three very easy problem sets on error propagation, and then there is an online lab quiz you have to complete before coming to each class. Some of the experiments are hard to finish within the time limit especially if you're not familiar with the equipment, but overall it's not a bad lab to take. The grading on the labs seems to be somewhat arbitrary though.",
    "Good gut class with very little work.",
    "It is a good introduction to lab work and statistical\/error analysis in a lab setting. I would recommend it because it was not terribly difficult but I still got a lot out of it.",
    "You gotta take it... just get it over with. It's not that bad and the TAs are really cool.",
    "Thorough lab course. Covers a wide range of topics.",
    "This is a relatively easy lab that provides an introduction to the basic principles of physics. It will obviously be easier if you've already had an introductory physics course.",
    "This lab is a lot less work than the chem labs; no weekly lab reports and little homework. The lab is only three hours once a week, though I and most people almost always went over (averaging ~3.5 hours maybe). The practical at the end was pretty tough. Not terrible, but hit heavily on error analysis stuff that was covered in the textbook and homework and far less in lab itself.",
    "A requirement for physics majors that isn't very interesting as a course. It's a lot of time to put in so I wouldn't recommend unless you're trying to major in physics.",
    "The lab itself is probably not the most enjoyable, but the good news is that's all there is to this class. Out of class work is an hour a week max, and while the labs are occasionally confusing, rest assured you will get a \"check\" for your troubles in the end.It's worth reviewing for the practical, but as it's open book and you have plenty of time, review should be spent making sure you know how to use the equipment (and it wouldn't hurt to know a few formulas so you don't have to look them up).",
    "The labs were interesting but long - took more than 3 hours. If you get a good TA it will be pretty good.",
    "It's an intense three (or four) hours once a week, but outside of that, almost no effort required. The written portion of the practical felt like an easy test for a class I had never attended.",
    "This is one of those classes that you just need to take for prerequisites. It is not the most exciting class, and sometimes you can be clueless in what you are suppose to do. This is just one thing that you need to take and get it over with. The good thing is, there is barely any homework, andall the lab write-ups are done during the section, leaving nothing outside of class.",
    "It's a good lab--not much work, interesting material.",
    "Physics 205 is a trial. I wouldn't recommend it unless it was requird for a major.",
    "An easy lab, but grading is really weird.",
    "Quite easy compared to other lab courses. Your grade will likely be determined mostly by the practical at the end of the year, for better or for worse.",
    "I did not enjoy this class. It's not bad if you need to take it.",
    "I would summarize PHYS205L as an introduction to the usage of lab equipment. I'm glad that I took it so that I can take PHYS206L next year, and since I want to major in physics. For a student who does not want to major in physics, I would not recommend this course, as it was not overly informative or interesting.",
    "Some labs were cool, others were less engaging. Not bad for a lab class, and less work than most. Grades are kind of ambiguous though.",
    "No - take it only if you have to.",
    "Physics 205L was a boring course and a pain. That might be partly because I was always severely sleep-deprived during my class as a result, but I don\u0092t think so. If you want to major in physics you need to take a lab, and this one is no worse than the other ones, but is mostly frustrating. That said, it\u0092s better than most labs since you don\u0092t need to do write-ups out of class. Still, don\u0092t take it if you\u0092re not interested in majoring in physics, unless you live for simplistic experimental physics opportunities.",
    "I'm really unsure about this. The lab benches were really uncomfortable. The labs were pretty good but the way in which the lab instructions were written was horrible. The instructions should be instructions, less verbose, more straightforward and if there's something there that's conceptual and meant to be read and digested before heading to lab, it should be put in the beginning with the intro. If there are questions meant to be answered in the lab notes, they should consistently be bolded\/underlined. The labs are really involved and a single unclear instruction can hold up an otherwise easy section --and there are definitely many unpurged mistakes and unclear sections in the lab manual. Most of us ran over time not because the overall lab was hard but because one section that had a word that was not supposed to be there.Otherwise, everything else about the lab is dandy. The lab syllabus should really spell out the way the grades are assigned. That's very helpful, and it gives you a sense of how much time you should be spending on the course (apparently checks are considered 1\/2 but a 50 in any other class is a failing grade?). If you're thinking about taking this, just go ahead and take it, you probably need to anyway. But be neat and organized and, before heading to lab, read and highlight the questions in the lab instructions beforehand too (if that doesn't get fixed next year).",
    "Only take it if you have to for your major\/premed.",
    "I would recommend this class to those interested in physics. It's a bit of a struggle since the equipment doesn't always work as intended, but it is a nice broad overview of general physics lab techniques. Be sure to read the lab handouts in advance of each week's session, or the lab may end up lasting much longer than you'd like.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "It's a good class. I liked that we didn't have to do any work outside of class. The labs aren't too difficult if you look at them ahead of time, and it's nice to be able to work with a partner.",
    "Its a lab... take it if you have too... otherwise idk what you're doing in life lol.",
    "A thorough lab with an appropriate workload. Overall a very positive experience.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "Intro lab class. Learn about error, basic lab procedures, basic physics concepts. If you have taken any electronics some labs will be particularly easy.",
    "Since it's a pre-requisite, take it and make the best of it. The class has both the potential of being really boring (and it will be sometimes) and a lot of fun.",
    "Labs in general are exhausting, but it was nice that this course didn't have much homework.",
    "Some labs are really fun and engaging, others are a little less exciting. I'm a Physics major so I have to take this class as one of my pre-reqs. Just make sure you know a lot of error analysis. Error analysis is covered but not \"stressed\" as important during classwork and homework. It seemed like practical skills and analysis on computers were the important things to learn so I made sure I knew how to do this for finals, but it turned out my final paper had a lot more error analysis than I was anticipating.",
    "If you're considering this course, it's probably because you have to take it. The labs generally run long, and the topics covered are more introductory than interesting. There are no formal lab reports, just graded notebooks. The final, a lab practical and written exam, is somewhat difficult.",
    "An introductory physical science lab. You work with waves, gravity, other topics, and especially focus on electromagnetism in the end of the course. The course was okay overall; most of the experiments were at a decently difficult level but were uninspiring. My favorite experiments were the one on rotational torque and precession as well as a few of the ones on electricity and magnetism.Overall, though this course is rather dry, I would recommend it if you're a Physics major (you have to do it) or if you're just eager to get some hands-on knowledge of physics concepts and you're willing to put up with a weekly 3-4 hour lab session and some boring material (granted, that's not a lot of people)."
