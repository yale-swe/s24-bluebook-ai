    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Very well organized and clear. Could have been more slow\/patient in explanations.",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0I really liked that instead of repeating the same thing as the professor he found new ways and new examples to explain what we didn't understand. I think he was very successful in trying to make things more simpler and easier to understand.",

    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Hao is a wonderful teacher; tried explaining things in several creative ways when he intuited that the first way wasn't connecting. Incredibly patient and generous with his time. He is really great at putting himself in the shoes of the students to whom this information is new.",

    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Jesse was an amazing teaching fellow and helped me to understand many concepts that I did not have in class. My strategy was to go to his sessions after attempting problem sets and then have him explain any concepts that I did not understand. He was always very helpful and patient and I certainly don't think I would have been able to do many of the homework assignments without his explanations. I think that he needs to be more assertive in addressing questions that may seem a bit redundant to what we already did.",

He is clearly very experienced in teaching this material, and was able to teach it a different way than Kotchen had in class if we had not understood it during the lecture. He went through problems slowly, and allowed us to figure them out for ourselves, rather than showing us how they were done.",

    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Jesse was an awesome TA. Often the Problem Sets required going to a TA because we didn't learn a lot of what we needed to in class. Jesse taught without just giving us the answers, which deepened my understanding of econ.",

    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0The Teaching Assistant had a very good understanding of all the concepts and ensured that every student's doubts and questions were addressed, using examples that everyone could relate to. He was also very approachable and responsive. In the beginning, some of his explanations were complex and roundabout - it was clear that he had a thorough and advanced understanding of the concept, which sometimes led to explanations that were more complicated and beyond our understanding. He soon realized this and his explanations became much more straightforward and easy to follow. There were a couple of mix ups with rescheduling of TA sessions and lack of information, however, these were later made up."

   "comments": [
    "Question 15: some thought we wasted too much time in the beginning( which was less important) and rushed through the latter part( which was the more important part of the course). However, I think the idea was to help people who have never done economics to catch up and get the basics.",
    "I really enjoyed this class up through the midterm. After the midterm exam, the material got away from me and became less accessible and useful to me. The reading in the text book had been very useful and accessible but it got less so in the second half of the semester when we moved away from the book.",
    "I liked this course. There is a wide variety of backgrounds in the classroom, so I understand that the challenge of the professor was not easy. He had to make a course that provided enough value for people with background in economics, but still make the material comprehensible for people with other backgrounds. I enjoyed the course as an introduction to how to analyze the environment from an economic point of view.",
    "He should teach more and more about environmental issue NOT spending half of the semester on basics of energy and supply.",
    "Professor required us to make a lot of assumptions, so there wasn't a lot of room for questioning or discussing the flaws of the economics concepts we were learning. It ended up being a presentation of concepts that we know are flawed in the real world, but that we were forced to learn as if they are the magic bullet.",
    "I didn't have any previous knowledge of economics before coming to the course. I believe that what I learned is very useful, but I wish we talked more about current environmental issues instead of just staying in the \"conceptual\" part of economics (graphs, assumptions)",
    "Excellent class with excellent professor and teaching assistants.",
    "The course covered very good concepts and was very valuable in general. However, I struggled with the professor's explanations of these topics as he would be extremely abstract and gloss over difficult concepts.",
    "Professor Kotchen is very smart and extremely difficult to approach in person.",
    "I felt it was necessary to take the economics course to have a better understanding of environmental economics. However, post-midterm this class was very disorganized and there was no assigned textbook to follow along with the lectures. It moved at an inconsistent rate - very slow post-midterm and then two weeks before finals it really sped up.",
    "i wish this class were more \"real world\" than theoretical",
    "Prof. Kotchen's teaching style is really engaging. He is genuinely enthusiastic about the material and its everyday applications, and it's contagious.",
    "12) Professor Kotchen is extremely responsive to student questions. He encourages many questions during class, and takes the time to answer each of them. This is really nice of him to take the time to do, and is great for running through some over-arching and general questions that many students have. But it ends up derailing the class sometimes because there are SO many questions and many of them devolve into hypothetical scenarios that get quite off topic.",
    "The course was too basic for me when I haven't really ever taken a core Econ course.",
    "question 11: Though the professors was really clear on giving explanation, sometimes our concentration divided between listening and recognizing his writing on the blackboard",
    "The course was structured in a way that the first half was primarily a review of microeconomics and the second touched more on environmental aspects of economics. While helpful, the instructor should place more emphasis on novel environmental concepts so that people with prior exposure to economics can benefit just as much as others.",
    "Professor Kotchen tries to be very clear in his teaching and receptive to students' questions. But he can be assuming too much authority in his approach sometimes which distances students from effective learning. His handwriting can get too small and sometimes illegible. His answers to students' questions and explanations of concepts may get convoluted and long winding sometimes. But overall, he has potential to be a very effective educators in the future.",
    "In the absence of a textbook for environmental econ topics, it would be helpful to have slides posted online at least 24 hours before the course.",
    "I think every environmental student should have a chance to take this course especially in a widely growing capitalistic world. The course gives you a different view on different environmental issues and resources and their management",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially for first year MEM students. Great review of Micro concepts, and clear instruction.",
    "It would be helpful to have a textbook for the second part of the course (after the midterm)",
    "A lot of time was spent on the introductory concepts of Demand and Supply. While having a clear understanding of these concepts is critical to the rest of the concepts, I felt we spent relatively less time on the more complicated concepts in the latter half of the course."

I appreciated the extent to which he was open to discussion with students during lecture, and the fact that he left ample time to answer questions and clarify. Problem sets were difficult and sometimes too long, but they generally helped me to understand the material more thoroughly. Exams were fair.",

Smaller class, or some small group work or something might help get people talking.",
    "The exams are too difficult\/unhelpful to prepare adequately for. I think this class does a good job of talking about the shortcomings of economic theory and incorporating externalities. Despite this, the course needs to acknowledge the historical shortcoming of economic models and better train students to know the theory behind it, and some real life comparisons. I felt the exams forced me to go memorize theory when there was potential to put energy to being a good economist in other ways.",
    "- The material, especially the second half of the semester.",
    "Often the balance between developing an economic intuition and solving economic problem sets was unclear. The goal of class often seems to be 'lets get you understanding and using this theoretically' which to me was mismatched by then being asked to apply a mathematical representation of that theory to a problem. I would have liked more discussion-based problem sets that ask us to explain and integrate concepts. Also, the second half of the class needs a textbook, or needs daily slides, or needs to be complimented with more real world applicability, and perhaps with a discussion of behavioral\/institutional economics. Much of it seemed \"far fetched\". Finally, Matt needs to do a better job screening his TAs, as Hao was overwhelmingly favored.",
    "Myself, along with many students, really got lost after the midterm. I think it was hard for us to grasp its relevance and the reading got more difficult.",
    "It would be nice if there were small group discussion sections where 10 or so people would come together to ask questions and work on the homework together. This naturally happens but I felt like I would have learned more if I had collaborated with my peers on the homework more.",
    "I dont think that this course need improvement. The content is very good. It can be a bit to basic at the beginning, but I understand it given the background of some of my classmates.",
    "Teaching more and showing more case studies about environmental economics",
    "The first portion of the class is too slow\/basic\/not environmentally focused. The second half of the class feels rushed, and skips important discussion of the pros and cons of the ideas and methods we learned. The professor, while friendly, sort of shoots down people's concerns with economic solutions, and doesn't leave enough room for critically analyzing what we're learning. The second portion should definitely be supplemented with some sort of textbook. Furthermore, it would be helpful if not all of the \"environmental\" examples were so natural resource focused- examples of energy, waste, etc. would be interesting to a wider audience. The homework assignments also come too quickly one after the other, and you don't really know how to do the assignment fully until Thursday's class, which leaves it too much for the last minute. The professor should tailor the classes environmental focus to what people are interested in- for our class, that seemed to be business and energy, not fisheries and carbon taxing.",
    "The quality and responsiveness of the teaching assistants varied greatly.",
    "Having examples in class that provide students with the tools to answer the problem sets. I really struggled on weeks were I was unable to attend the discussion sessions. I very much felt as though without the discussion sessions, there were several questions on the problem sets that would have been impossible to answer without significant research. It would be helpful if at the beginning of the course Dr. Kotchen provided the students with a list of helpful resources that could be referenced to better understand each subject since we quickly outgrew the textbook.",
    "I wish we could have some field trips or group project that allows us some experience hands on research on how to apply framework that we learned into the real world.",
    "To talk more about current issues, more of a dialogue. There were too many graphs, and the problem sets were based on a lot of assumptions.",
    "A little too much time spent on answering some student questions that are clearly not thought-out, or would be answered had readings been done prior to class, or considering the assumptions used in the concepts.",
    "The professor needs to spend more time explaining and describing the intuition behind difficult concepts and ensuring that students understand what he is teaching, rather than spending 45 mins answering questions that are not beneficial.",
    "Assign a textbook for second half of semester. Follow the syllabus. It is extremely frustrating when the professor sends out an email the day before with the reading for the class. I don't know anyone who actually read it because of this.",
    "The second half of the class needs a book to supplement in-class learning because there is nothing to learn the information from if you do not understand how it is being explained in class.",
    "class time, instructor's teaching ability, etc. matt got really excited and went very quickly on the tough concepts (graphs) and took his time chatting with himself while teaching the easier concepts",
    "It would be helpful to have some sort of textbook for the second half of class. Readings were not nearly as useful as the textbook was - during problem sets, the textbook was valuable for going back and figuring things out on my own. Couldn't do that with the readings.",
    "I think the second half of the semester needs more structure. I found the first half, which followed the textbook, to be very clear and easy to follow. The second half was less so - more clear section headings would have been useful. In the second half, I could also have benefitted from readings that were less technical and more explanatory (or perhaps a bit of both).",
    "The second half of the course, when we switched from a textbook to articles\/papers was pretty challenging because there wasn't a ton of material to refer back to if you got confused on homework. It would be helpful to have some more basic level texts for this portion of the course, but I understand it's tricky since we cover lots of topical, current events.",
    "The instructor allowed for students to ask too many questions and go off on tangents during class.",
    "The instructor very frequently fielded tangential student questions that were often unrelated from specific course content and significantly limited the amount of time spent explaining important concepts during lecture.",
    "It seemed that some of the lectures in the second half of the course lost focus. We spent a strangely large amount of time on the lectures about methods of valuation, which did not seem hugely important or relevant to the course as a whole.",
    "I think this course should be geared specifically towards students with a particular level of economics background. This course was strongly suggested for people of all levels of backgrounds in economics. Discussions with other students led me to believe it was very simple for those with an economics background, and difficult for those without such a background. If it were directed at one group or the other (people with or without econ background) the students may get more out of it. Another thing is taking fewer questions that get the class off topic.",
    "I think that the format of the course could be improved by breaking it down into two parts, each 1.5 credits. That way, if you are like me and don't have any background in econ you could take both parts, and if you have had intro micro you could pick up for the second part of the course. The way it stands now, the first part is too rushed for people without the intro mico background and too slow for those who have had it.",
    "It would have been helpful to have more resources available for understanding the material covered in the second half of the semester.",
    "Poor on application for the real world.",
    "Not all class material was supplied through class' server. Some class were only based on Professor note and he write it on the blackborad. it would be better if it also provided in the server. Another thing is the class material. first half of the semester was focused of Microeconomic. I would suggest to give more sessions for environmental economic side would make this class better.",
    "Professor Kotchen often explained concepts too fast and didn't allow time for questions. During the second half of the semester, he didn't use powerpoints and just explained everything verbally, which made it harder to follow along. He should consider modifying his presentation style and talking speed.",
    "Slides for the second half of the lecture would be helpful",
    "There should be conceptual readings for the second half of the semester so students have notes to refer to if the professor's explanations don't resonate with them. There were classes when we spent too much time on abstractions without a strong practical grounding. It would be useful to go through practical problems in class so that we can develop the right kind of reasoning to apply our learning.",
    "Problem Sets were frustrating. There were weeks where you had to go to a TA or you'd never be able to figure the answers out. Also, a lack of a textbook was frustrating.",
    "Sometimes it was hard to know what the readings were because they were sent to us in emails. It would be helpful to have the readings on the syllabus.",
    "The second half of the course lacked the organization of the first half. A major part of this departure was the absence of a textbook. Although the readings were valuable and well selected, they failed to adequately address fundamental topics in environmental economics. Professor Kotchen's teaching suffered during the second half of the semester, and problem sets proved frustrating because correct procedures were not covered in class.",
    "Better study\/reading material for the second half of semester.",
    "There is need to provide better reading and graphical illustrations to the Environmental economics sections namely: Non- Renewable resource management, open access resources. Most the graphical illustrations made in class were hard to find further and similar reading for. This made it hectic to prepare for finals and overdependence of hurriedly taken class notes",
    "I didn't find out until the end that the students who went to the review sessions basically worked on the problem set together and went through each problem. I felt like that was unfair. It would be great if that was spelled out from the beginning for students who are less likely to attend the TA sessions.",
    "None",
    "The professor could be more responsive to students and more approachable both in and outside the classroom.",
    "The class is too big, it would help if it were divided into two or three subgroups for mandatory weekly discussions. Also, for the second part of the course, there is no book at all. This should be changed.",
    "The last sections of the course seemed to lose their flow. I would have appreciated more discussion of how the topics related to what economists do in the field, rather than the more theoretical framework these topics seemed to be presented in.",
    "Time allocated to teaching each concept could be restructured to give more time to the latter half of the concepts."
