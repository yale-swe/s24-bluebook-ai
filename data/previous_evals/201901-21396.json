I developed skills in choosing a topic and researching that topic, through finding readings that are pertinent to that topic. I cultivated skills in consolidating diverse readings on one topic and interpreting them in a unified, coherent way my essay. I also developed skills in writing a longer essay (about 25-35 pages) and in revising my writing."
