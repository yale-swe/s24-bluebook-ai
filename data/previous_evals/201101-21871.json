    "A good, laid-back class to take senior year.",
    "A take-home midterm, final, and maybe four easy problem sets courtesy of Sigworth. There's no incentive to REALLY keep up with the material in a thorough matter as the exams are take-home. However, it would be pretty impossible to thoroughly understand all the material. I did learn a lot. This was a pretty non-rigorous way to fulfill the upper level MCDB major requirement. I definitely recommend it if you enjoyed Physiological Systems. It might be boring if you dislike physio.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material. You get out of it what you put into it. It is not too demanding, but it's hard to tell where you stand.",
    "I liked this class, so I would recommend it. It's a lot of work at two points in the semester--the take-home midterm and the take-home final. Otherwise, it's pretty interesting if you like the syllabus and you get to know a lot of professors from the med school.",
    "I LOVED THIS COURSE! It was the perfect amount of work, the professors were great, and I learned a lot. I also felt the students got together a lot to learn from each other, which was really helpful."
