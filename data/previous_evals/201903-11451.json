    "Learned a lot of interesting Egyptian history",
    "In addition to an excellent introduction to all of ancient Egyptian history, society, and religion, the class gives you an insane knowledge of the weirdest 30 years of Egyptian history. More broadly, it teaches us how any ancient history (or history where there's a paucity of evidence) is constructed. Prof Darnell had the expertise to question our secondary readings, explaining the specific pieces of evidence used to draw the conclusions. He taught us how to evaluate that same evidence, and analyze the experts' (often fanciful) interpretations. It's a good introduction to how history is written and how much of what we're taught in K-12 may be fictitious.",
    "My knowledge about ancient Egypt greatly improved with this class.",
    "I learned a lot about ancient Egypt",
    "We learned about a specific Pharaoh named Akhenaton. If you know King Tut, that's this guy's son. It was really interesting to engage with the material.",
    "My writing and reading skiils have been improved.",
    "I learned to understand Egyptian art and depictions of certain symbols.",
    "ALL HAIL THE ATON. AKHENATON, THE KING OF KINGS, BELOVED OF THE ATON, AND HIS ROYAL WIFE, NEFERTITI. This class gives not only an incredible overview of Ancient Egyptian history, culture and religion, but has an incredible focus on the misunderstood and undervalued Akhenaton, king of the Amarna period and a revolutionary figure who may have been the first to spread monotheism. In addition, in this class, we learned skills for writing about history and focused on the presentation of historical artifacts in a museum setting, and how important it is to not assume things about the historical narrative in the historical research that we perform.",
    "Basic history of ancient Egypt. Knowledge of the pharaohs, especially of the 18th dynasty. Diplomacy of ancient Egypt.",
    "You learn all about the Amarna period and Akhenaten. You also discuss the 18th Dynasty kings leading up to Akhenaten, in order to provide context for understanding the changes that Akhenaten implemented during his reign. You discuss Egyptian religion, ritual, art, and foreign affairs."

    "Interesting papers and fair exams",
    "Strengths - Professor Darnell. He's insanely passionate about the material and it shows. He's also an endless pit of ancient near eastern knowledge. Lectures were highly engaging, and supplemented with visits to both YUAG and peabody. He literally once stood on the table while we looked at a massive set of archeological maps. If you like ancient history, the content is IMO super interesting. The work and exams were all extremely fair. Weakness - He's so excited about all parts of Egyptian history he couldn't stick to the syllabus too much to say on each thing. We were like 2 weeks behind by the end. He didn't explicitly shift the readings, meaning that the (often long and overly detailed) readings were often not on what we were discussing in class.",
    "Strengths: Strong course material, fair tests and grading on papers Weaknesses: Slightly disorganized",
    "N\/A",
    "Strengths: deep engagement with a specific period with some background in past and future periods, working closely with primary sources, lots of reading and individual analysis Weaknesses: sometimes repetitive",
    "The professor was a huge plus! The material was not hard and you could find everything on the slides.",
    "It was a fine class. The professor was a little wishy washy on what he wanted from his students. But he was extremely fair and a wonderful professor.",
    "This course was very well organized in terms of material, and every single lecture was intriguing. It was easy to stay engaged with the content, which was a major strength, and the readings given were similarly interesting, which made it the kind of class you're excited to go to. Professor Darnell is easy to communicate with, and offers incredible expertise on the topic (he's the author of one of the course's books!) and presents his opinions in a non-biased manner that allows students to make their own guesses about the truth of certain Ancient Egyptian mysteries while analyzing all of the evidence archaeology has laid out in front of humankind as of today. The only thing that might be improved is the communication of an all-around schedule for the course beforehand, rather than the update as things come along method that Professor Darnell employed. However, I understand why this method may be beneficial in some cases, so I think it's all up to what he feels is best. Overall, it was an incredible course!",
    "Great course, amazing lecturer. Decently organized generally, but some facts and random tidbits felt a little bit tossed in sometimes during lectures that belonged more to previous or later lectures, so there felt sometimes like there was a bit of skipping around between topics."

   "comments": [
    "Yes was really fun and interesting and learned a lot",
    "yes!",
    "If they have even a passing interest in Ancient history, absolutely. By the end of the class, you feel like a true expert on the most fascinating part of Egyptian history. You also learn how to question popular narratives of history. Professor Darnell is a gem, it's not too much work, take it!!!!",
    "Absolutely, the course was interesting and challenging",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. Professor Darnell is terrific and the readings are interesting. Don't worry the class size is pretty small and you don't really have to talk during class. The assignments are doable. Overall, as a STEM major, this is one of the best humanities classes I have taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the material! Because most of the course focuses on one specific thing, it would be neither interesting nor useful if you were not interested in it.",
    "YES! Its very interesting and engaging. Its a gut so long as you follow through and study what he tells you to beforehand. He also gives a list of questions on the exam and lets you pick which ones to answer based on your own preference which allows for more fair testing. He's also a very lenient grader which is a plus! Make sure you show up to class (but he makes it very interesting so this shouldn't be a problem).",
    "Yes, the class was unorganized a little bit but the professor was wonderful. He is extremely fair with grading and with due dates.",
    "AKHENATON, THE SON OF THE ATON, RE-HORAKHTY, THE SUN DISK. ALL HAIL THE ATON, AND FEAR HIS RAYS. If you do not take this class at some point during your Yale career, you are truly missing out! The material and teaching style makes it an all around fabulous experience, one that has encouraged me to take more Egyptology classes in the future. If you're even considering taking this course, do it - it's worth it!",
    "I fall at the feet of my lord, God, sun, breath of my life, 7 times and 7 times. All hail the Aten! I would 100% recommend to those interested in ancient Egypt, especially the pharaohs. The knowledge taught is extensive, only outmatched by the knowledge of the professor himself. Take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Egypt under the reigns of Amenhotep III, Akenaton, and Tut and experience the perfect model of a kingdom for yourself!",
    "100% Yes!!! This class is amazing and so much fun. If you want to learn from literal Indiana Jones, this is your opportunity. Professor Darnell is one of the most engaging lecturers I've encountered. He's also so kind and generous. This class was by far the most random class I've taken and has nothing to do with my major or distribution requirements, and it was an amazing addition that everyone should at least shop. You get a great sense of Ancient Egyptian culture and religion by learning about the kings of the 18th Dynasty, and fascinating insight into Akhenaten's reign and how he used Egyptian symbolism and practices to make the drastic changes he's famous for. If the material sounds like it could potentially be of even slight interest to you, shop this class. I almost didn't even shop, but it only took 10 minutes of hearing Prof. Darnell talk about it to decide that this class was the one. I enjoyed the class so much that I even had fun doing the writing assignments."
