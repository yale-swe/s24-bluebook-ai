   "comments": [
    "This course will solidify your written command of Spanish and you will leave knowing every tense. Tons of daily homework. Great class to CR\/D because it's quite difficult to get solid A's on the exams unless you are really ontop of it.",
    "Complicated grammar rules often confuse the teachers as well. Take conversational if you can, it's more useful in the future.",
    "Definitely. Out you want to exponentially improve your Spanish.",
    "The class is really great if you are looking for a crash course in Spanish grammar. There is definitely a solid amount of work each night, but I wouldn't say it is necessarily challenging, it's just a lot. This class won't help you with your speaking skills, but it will definitely refresh your memory about all the grammar you learned in high school. The stories we read and the movies we watched were entertaining, and the class is cool because there is a range of grades from freshman to senior.",
    "The class consists of doing homework before every class and then discussing it in the next class. I would definitely recommend it to any student looking to improve their grammar in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants a foundation to continue with Spanish. I'm planning to use what I learned in the course on study abroad and to take more advanced Spanish classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it. Certainly tightens up your grasp of grammar.",
    "Class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Homework assignments, including short readings (1-5 pages) and a few assignments (2-3 worksheets worth). Two or three in class exams and a final. I'd recommend this class if you're interested in really pushing your grammar. We did practice speaking in class, but it wasn't anything extensive. Sometimes the homework felt overwhelming because there would be several reading assignments& writing assignments, along with preparation for an in class composition the next day. But it was doable.",
    "no, I feel there would be easier options for a Spanish credit, than this course.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's dry but useful."
