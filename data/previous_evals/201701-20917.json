    "So many! Learned a ton about the human body and its responses to disease; learned how to write a STEM research paper; learned how to study for STEM-style exams. Many valuable skills!",
    "I gained so much knowledge about the mechanisms and history of cancer and cancer biology.",
    "I learned how to read and understand scientific papers as well as how cancer biology and treatments function.",
    "I learned a lot about the workings of cancer.",
    "I learned so much about cancer! I went in with almost zero knowledge and background about it, and I am walking away feeling like I have a solid foundation.",
    "This is a good introduction course to cancer and I learned a lot about the science of the disease.",
    "The seminar format works really well! I enjoyed it a lot and I was engaged. One recommendation for this class is to have a final exam instead of a final paper. I feel that although the quizzes were worth so few points, they took up so much time to study for and I wish that the effort to grade ratio were more correlated."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths were in the courses breadth of content. We learned so much in the semester, really covered a ton of subject areas. Also, the professor gives a tone of time to individual students and makes it really easy to get help when needed. The weaknesses are in the pace--at times, it can be very fast-moving, so the extra help is more than necessary.",
    "This was incredibly wonderful for non-STEM students--by no means a gut, but if you put in the effort, Belperron makes it more than easy to learn.",
    "This course was challenging but very doable. I appreciate having the opportunity to take a science credit that pushed me but was not impossible coming from a non-stem background.",
    "The strengths of the course are Professor Belperron herself and the various vehicles she uses to test students' knowledge of the material.",
    "The course is very informative in different aspects of cancer, but not deep enough because we did not have enough time to cover so many complicated aspects.",
    "The seminar format works really well! I enjoyed it a lot and I was engaged. One recommendation for this class is to have a final exam instead of a final paper. I feel that although the quizzes were worth so few points, they took up so much time to study for and I wish that the effort to grade ratio were more correlated.",
    "Much more of a lecture style than a seminar even though it's structured like one"

   "comments": [
    "An amazing SC credit -- and no numbers",
    "Definitely!",
    "Very much so! Perfect for non-STEM students with a genuine curiosity about the topic. By no means a gut, but an engaging and interesting class. Belperron is beyond helpful, wonderful, and engaging, both as a teacher and a person.",
    "Yes! If you want a science credit that will push you but still be accessible for a non-stem major then take this class. Professor Belperron explains the material at whatever pace the class needs and questions are encouraged. I learned a lot and really enjoyed this class--something I didn't expect from a science credit.",
    "Absolutely. To anyone who has the slightest interest in cancer take it. No need to be a stem major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Be prepared to work very hard thouh.",
    "I will recommend if you are a non-science major who's not looking for a gut.",
    "I learned how to evaluate scientific arguments, read scientific articles, and a lot about the biology of cancer.I would recommend this but it's definitely a lot of work. I thought it was well worth it though and I learned a lot more about the mechanisms of cancer than I thought possible.",
    "If you're looking for a fairly straightforward science credit, this certainly checks those boxes"
