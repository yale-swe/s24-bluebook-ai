    "L2 Hebrew was a good continuation of L1. Dina and our TA, Igal, were outstanding. We learned new grammar concepts every couple days, switched up class with stories and songs, wrote nearly every day for homework, and had a steady stream of vocab each week. An hour of homework each night is to be expected, but it really helps to reinforce concepts learned in class. I highly recommend this class to those who want to learn more Hebrew.",
    "Terrific, challenging, and fun course.",
    "Hebrew is great! If you've taken L1, you have to take L2 to get the credit... So do it! Try to take the smaller class, if there is a choice, because it will be easier to pick up the language with more individualized attention.",
    "Awesome! Take it! So relaxing and you learn so much!",
    "You work hard and learn a lot, and by the end, can actually communicate in Hebrew! I looked forward to coming to class each day. Dina is a wonderful, friendly teacher who makes the material very interesting. She is really committed to addressing the individual needs of each student.",
    "For a course that you pretty much have to take, this class is not bad, though it is a good amount of work and can get pretty boring at times. Dina is very organized and gives out handouts with everything you need to know, which is great for studying for weekly quizzes and tests.",
    "L2 Hebrew teaches past tense, general vocab, and several finer grammatical points. Dina is a little stricter than Ayala but assigns less busywork."
