   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the course. Prof. Shankar goes slow enough that everyone understands everything. For this reason, the course doesn't go into much depth. However, what I did learn I felt like I actually understood at a deeper level than most other physics courses at Yale. The psets and exams are not too hard, but they are graded rather harshly.",
    "Shankar is an amazing lecturer. Although the course can seem to hop a little from one topic to the next, Professor Shankar makes every topic intuitive. I definitely recommend this to any Physics and\/or Math major.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is well taught and relatively fun. There is virtually no reading, the class is only problem sets.",
    "This class covers oscillations, a bit of multivariable, energy and momentum (rotational too), lagrangians and hamiltonians, four vectors, and thermodynamics. It is a great class whether or not you're a physics major. It's taught by Shankar, take it.",
    "Continuation of classical physics, more mathematically based than 180 (although apparently very comparable to 260). Shankar is an engaging lecturer, and his treatment of relativity and thermodynamics in particular were very interesting. Moreover, he is very receptive to student questions during class time, although he is not very accessible outside of class time. The PSets aren't especially difficult, but they touch on the fundamental material, and greatly help in understanding the material (and if you have any questions, be sure to collaborate with fellow students, such as during the TA sessions).",
    "Take this course for sure. Shankar is the best!",
    "This was a great course. The material was what you would expect--Newtonian mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics. It was presented in a way that was both a great review of prior knowledge from 260\/261 and a thorough introduction to new and interesting concepts.",
    "Solidifies previous topics in mechanics, thermodynamics and special relativity. Some new topics (compared to PHYS 200\/201 such as Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, some statistical mechanics, energies of orbits). Everything is presented as a logical result of a previous theory or observation, so it is neat to track how the observations of Kepler, for example, were proven by Newton. Prof. Shankar often crafts a beautiful introduction to each new topic, placing it in its historical context, and then often somehow connecting it to quantum mechanics. Hopefully you know that he is one Yale's most eminent lecturers and teachers, and knows his physics soberingly well. If you are considering 410- know that the math knowledge required (at least for this first semester of the year-long course) pretty much is limited to multi-variable calculus, with a brief foray into the differential equations of the harmonic oscillator- which is taught in class, although quickly. In other words, if you are hoping to use what you learned in a linear algebra or differential equations class, there wasn't much opportunity here, unless you went above and beyond and read extra sections in the book.",
    "SO SO SO GOOD. TAKE IT",
    "Definitely would recommend, especially if you feel like the intro physics classes didn't teach you well. This is more like a review class of intro physics concepts that goes further in depth, so if you're already comfortable with the material, you will probably want to take another class."
