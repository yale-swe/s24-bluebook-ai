   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if you want to be a Theater Studies major and you need it as a pre-req! The professors mean well but are very difficult to follow, so the class can be a major struggle.",
    "Theatre Studies is a GREAT class if you are a humanities person. I went into the class knowing a lot about Roman and Greek drama, but once we got to Sanskrit drama and Medieval drama, and Japanese theatre,that's when my interest really peaked. The class may start out slow at first (the first two or four classes I'd say) but get through it. I'm only taking it so I can take an acting class here, and it's a pre-req to do so. But you should love the class. It's very informative with material that isn't too hard to gain a grasp on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in History or Enligsh.",
    "By all rights, this class should work. A community of scholars, practitioners, and theater-lovers at Yale getting together twice a week to learn and talk about plays? It should all be much more interesting and elucidating than THST 110 actually is. The work isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terrible; the final paper is entirely open to a topic of your choice, the performance portion can be fun, and we received a study sheet before the midterm and final with a list of the terms that would appear. But even with the natural breadth-over-depth approach of a survey course, the variety of texts and performance traditions is unfeasible. It would be impossible to cover even with more efficient pedagogical practices: but lecture is often unfocused or off-topic, readings aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really relevant, and everyone is pressed for time. The problem is exacerbated by the guest lecturers, who are often fascinating scholars and leaders in their discipline--but who rarely managed to actually cover material presented in the readings. Similarly, Professors Laster and Fleming are nice people and clearly passionate about their subject matter, but sometimes seemed to struggle to create concise and coherent 50-minute lectures. The result is a lot of rote memorization of theatrical terms at exam time, and a class with great potential that is somehow less than the sum of its parts.",
    "Unless you're really serious about becoming a theatre major and must endure this class, it is not worth your time.If you're looking to learn about theatre because you enjoy the hands-on experience of working either on stage or off, then this is a wrong place to look.If you enjoy reading plays from medieval drama and Edo Japan, then you might find something interesting here.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to be a theater studies major or read a few really great plays.",
    "It's a summary of Theater from antiquity to the mid 19th century. I would recommend it if you, like me, intend on being a theater studiesmajor.",
    "It is not easy, and if you don't do the readings, you will have a hard time during the final, and it is easy and tempting to not do the work for the course. I would only recommend it if you are seriously considering being a Theatre Studies major. If not, don't bother.",
    "An overall survey of drama from ritual to later drama. Lots of reading, but the examinations were very manageable.",
    "This class is really boring to a student hoping to get some performance based learning. It was very informative and history based on theatre. That being said, it was an interesting class but mostly very tedious and boring .",
    "I think there is a contrast between \"agh I'm just doing this to get the basic theatre class out of the way\" and \"whoa this is really cool\". I think this case has the potential to be really awesome, especially for those who enjoy literature, and I think there is sucha variety of material that everyone can find something they enjoy. I would probably recommend this class to anyone who enjoys anything theatrical.",
    "Great overview course paired with an EXCELLENT sectional. There is a good (enjoyable) amount of reading. Expect about 30-45 mins of reading per class.The sections are SUPER fun.The best part is we get many guest lecturers who all specialize in the various forms of theater that they are studying. You get some pretty interesting characters.It's a requirement for theater majors, but it is just a great class in general and you should take it if you have any interest in theater. Almost all the class is comprised of actors or directors, all practicing theater people. It's an interesting bunch!",
    "THST 110 is a very quick and brief introduction to all theater from the beginning of time until 1700. It is a lot more work than one would expect, with a lot of weekly reading (usually a play and one or two drama theory articles for each class - excluding section reading!) and too many final assignments (a performance, a 10 page paper, and a final). Unless you're thinking of being a theater studies major, and you have to fulfill this prerequisite, I would not advise taking this class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, or unless the structure\/lecturers change.",
    "It's a decent class, but don't waste one of your Yale courses if you're not planing on majoring. You'll learn about a lot of different theatre traditions despite the limitations of the course. Be prepared to do most of the coursework towards the end of the semester. Going to lecture makes the final pretty easy, even if you don't do all of the readings. Section meetings and the studio performance were great - definitely the course's saving grace.",
    "It is such a broad course. Over two thousand years are covered in one semester, so one has to be prepared for the constant moving on to the next topic. I would recommend it for students with an interest in all sorts of theater because the course is designed for scope. Those with unique and singular interests not wanting to branch out would not get much from this course.",
    "This feels more like a history class than a theater class. Do it only if you like to read a lot. In general, I would not recommend this class.",
    "If you're looking for a deep understanding of how theater has evolved over time, this is definitely the course to take. I would recommend this course to any student that wants to gain a breadth of knowledge in theater history, or anyone that is simply curious about the theater.",
    "Almost everyone who took this class did so because it is a prerequisite for the Theater Studies major as well as the upper level theater classes. If you do not care about either, I would not recommend taking this class. It is a dry, methodical, shallow look at great theatrical works that was mostly confusing and underwhelming. The same material is covered in English classes that would offer you much more creative input. If you are planning on majoring in Theater Studies, or want to take upper level theater classes don't worry: 110 might be dry and boring, but surviving it forms a bond between all the past and present members of the class. Surviving 110 is a badge we wear with honor.",
    "This is a class you take because it's a prerequisite, not because the lectures are interesting. Of course, that could change if the professors do. The material is important and I'm glad I've read it now and have no regrets about taking the class"
