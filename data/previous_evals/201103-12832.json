    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 130. The class is organized, the instructors are professional and energetic, and I can say unequivocally that my Chinese (particularly my speaking skills) have grown tremendously. My only criticism is that the structure of the course can get a little repetitive at times. Even then, I feel like there is enough division of speaking, reading and writing that things stay interesting.Despite nightly homework, each assignment is short and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Awesome class. I took this after 4 years of Chinese in high school and found it to be completely manageable. You do a lot of drills in class-be prepared to improve your listening and speaking a lot! Mu laoshi is HILARIOUS and an awesome professor, and Liang laoshi is so kind. The weekly tutorials with the TAs are annoying (at best), but it's definitely good that it forces an extra half-hour of speaking chinese into your life every week.",
    "This class is great for those who actually want to learn Chinese, and aren't just taking it for a language credit. If you are planning on taking it only to fulfill a requirement (and even if you aren't) be warned- the workload can be heavy at times, and not always in an interesting way. It is hard to learn a language in an academic setting by some method other than repetition and memorization, and Chinese 130 exemplifies this rule.",
    "Yes for Sure :)",
    "Chinese 130 is an exceptionally time intensive course. It requires dedication and commitment throughout the entire semester. You cannot get away with slacking off at any point. This aside, the course is extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend it to another student. I took this course to fulfill my language requirement and have taken away so much more from it than I expected. The professors are both incredibly helpful and dedicated. Definitely take this course if you want to study Chinese at Yale. The Chinese department is incredible!",
    "It was significantly harder than Chinese 110 and Chinese 120. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on Chinese."
