    "Overall it is a good course, very simple & straightforward (read the book, do the exercises, take the quizzes). It is basically an external structure that forces busy graduate (and some undergraduate) students to devote small portions of time on a regular basis to translating German into English, without which they may never get around to learning the skill. I would recommend it.",
    "Very much so. It serves its purpose well.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student that had already taken several semesters of German and needed a cursory review of the grammar and\/or some translation practice."
