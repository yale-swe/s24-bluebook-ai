    "If you're looking to learn italian, or just to fulfill a requirement, take this class. It's not overly demanding, but it is challenging nonetheless.",
    "Italian 110 is a really great class; it requires a lot of memorization, but the course is very fun and relaxed. While a background in a romance language could be helpful, it's not necessary at all; in fact sometimes it just made it confusing. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, Italian 110 is SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! TAKE IT!",
    "If you are good at grammar, than Ital 110 is not a difficult course. The faculty is great and overall the department seems way more relaxed than other languages. We have way more fun. Take Ital! However, we go WAY faster than other classes as far as grammar goes. The class isn't easy, but if you want to learn Ital, you should take it anyway. I loved it.",
    "I would because it is very well taught."
