   "comments": [
    "Teamwork, research skills, communication skills, data analysis, writing skills, presentation skills, client management, etc. I really learned a lot about a region of the world I never thought I would study about, which was a bit daunting but overall a great learning experience.",
    "A lot of familiarity with R, putting concepts learned in stats to use on actual data to answer a question.",
    "My team was asked to help the US Third Special Forces Group better predict instability in the Sahel. I learned SO MUCH from this course, including understanding how the US carries out its foreign policy abroad. I also better understood the structure of the military and gained a huge respect for our armed service. I never had really taken the time to think about the impact they have on my life. I think that all the students gained FAR more than any of our research partners. This course taught me more than any of my other courses this semester and broadened my world view. The Global Affairs capstone is a gift, and future students should embrace it and try to learn as much as possible!",
    "I learned a lot about data analysis in the context of international affairs\/military policy - particularly with its applications in R. I also learned a fair deal about working as a part of a group on a large, long-term project for an outside client. The entire process was foreign to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "The biggest skills that you gain are essentially \"how to be a consultant,\" including managing client, working in a team to create a final product, presenting solutions in a way that appears to solve the client's needs. Given the highly specific nature of the work, you also gain a lot of knowledge about the client's area of concern, which were regional issues in the Sahel."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "How much you enjoy the capstone, I think, really depends on (1) the Yale team's relationship with their partner organization, and (2) the team dynamic. Thankfully, in my case, both were very good. The general issue with capstones is that you don't have much control over the topics provided for the given year, and in some cases you can be given a very challenging, broad topic that you basically never learned anything about (which was my case). While I learned a LOT by the end and I do not regret it, it was a steep learning curve to both teach myself a whole new topic and making recommendations at the same time.",
    "I really enjoyed the capstone in all ways.",
    "The strength of the Global Affairs Capstone is that students are entrusted with the liberty to make a real recommendation to an institution, in our case, the Third Special Forces Group. This is FAR more beneficial for the students than for the organization. As a student, I was able to understand how the military operates in Africa, what factors potential collaborators\/competitors exist in the region, and how the United States considers its Grand Strategy, more broadly. Weakness: Even with the small nature of our group, tasks fell unevenly. I think some people really fell through the cracks and did less work while a lot of the burden fell on others. I don't think this is fair, and would have appreciated a better accountability system.",
    "It is difficult to comment on the course in general as each individual capstone is so unique, but I think one area of improvement could be more direction earlier on with regards to the final deliverable and what was expected out of us. However, this was due to a unique situation with our project that was far from the norm.",
    "I loved working with my team and my project, however, it seems that there is a lack of consistency across all groups. The major could do a better job of making sure that the scope of each project was more equal as well as the amount of work or type of work. One thing that my group really appreciated was the flexibility that the instructor afforded us in developing the final product, discussing the preparatory work that we wanted to do, as well as the assignment of each task. The project was very much self-driven and self-motivated which proved to be more enjoyable for the team."

    "You need to take it to graduate! But all in all, I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot for sure.",
    "Yes, its a very different experience than most classes and you have to learn to transform a set of vague asks into a concrete answerable question then find a way to do so.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! I learned A LOT in this capstone. Most of all, I gained a profound respect for our military.",
    "Obviously, this class is required for all global majors, but nonetheless it has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. The camaraderie developed between team members in the small-class environment was particularly welcome."
