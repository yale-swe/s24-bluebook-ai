    "This course was very interesting to me because I gained a deeper academic understanding of topics that I'd always been interested in but only ever talked about in conversation or read about in articles (ex: state vs. nation, identity politics, etc.).",
    "it was a good class.",
    "I learned much about the world today, especially in regards to how people identify themselves and are identified.",
    "I learned many new socio-political theories relating to ethnic and national identity. I also learned about specific area case studies from the professor as well as fellow students.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of identity as a key factor in analyzing political behavior; the salient effect of identity as a mobilizing factor for individuals across various spectrums of society; the ability to integrate theoretical, classical interpretations of political science with the poignancy of today.",
    "I learned about theories of group formation and how societies interact. I learned how ethnic identities can be determined and used by politicians and governments to their own benefit. The course taught me how to analyze different social formation theories and to apply them to different situations.",
    "This course gave a broad introduction to theories of ethnic and national identity formation and their affects on the structure of the world. It drew on work from multiple disciplines, including sociology, psychology, political science, and others making for an interesting learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "The course was different from what I expected it might be like I wish we had a little less of a focus on all these different thinkers' theories, but maybe that's just what political science tends to be about in general (I'm unfamiliar with the topic matter in political science). I definitely enjoyed the subject matter though and loved all the different real-life scenarios we could bring in and the fact that we could draw from different historical examples and countries.",
    "it was good for what it was.",
    "Very clear instruction about what is happening and how it impacts the world around us.",
    "The material is interesting. The best part of the class is hearing from other students. Professor Hierro did a good job navigating differences in opinion and background. I do think the class might have done better in a round table style. I would have preferred a little more guidance on some of the assignments or more assignments so the grades are not as dependent on one thing.",
    "While the course often requires that class material is supplanted with contemporary\/local anecdotes, it is easy to distract from the day's lesson in considering them. That being said, the course is thoughtful and flexible and engages students in small, seminar-esque discussion.",
    "I consider this course one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It is well-organized; the readings are arranged into clear categories for furthering understanding in the field; the class discussions are vibrant and informative.",
    "The course is very well taught. I think it should become a seminar because almost everything taught provokes discussion, and we didn't have time to discuss everything as in depth as we would have liked. The readings were very interesting, however it would be better if more diverse authors and sources were used. When we study other ethnic groups through works by authors who are not of that group or who are part of a historically oppressive group, it tends to affect our viewpoints.",
    "This course is well instructed and the readings assigned are well chosen. It could perhaps be better taught in a more overt seminar format."

    "I think only if they are specifically interested in political science courses",
    "not really because i feel like there are better classes out there.",
    "Yes it is a very interesting class that has many lessons to today's world.",
    "It was definitely a very interesting and informative class for the amount of work we had to do. If you want to discuss race and ethnicity and its relation to politics but don't want to have to write too much, I would recommend shopping this class.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Hierro is fantastic and the class is a wonderful introduction to identity studies.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in forming her own understanding of society, history, ethnic and national influences, and identity, and how these factors have contributed to the world we observe today.",
    "Yes. It is a great class and very engaging, and the workload is manageable and very interesting. You will never be bored.",
    "You should take this course if you have any interest in the field or are interested in political science at the intersection of many fields."
