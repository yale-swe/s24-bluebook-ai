    "This seminar was held way too late in the semester for it to be very useful for first year students. Ideally, I would have liked to attend these talks during the first week of school before classes started so that I could make a more informed decision about my first rotation. The professors who spoke were good, not too much overlap with the MB&B retreat.",
    "I wish the timing was better, as I feel like there should have been more earlier in the semester. Other than that, it was good.",
    "Although the time is not regular but it never conflicts with my schedule, which is good.",
    "Would have preferred to see more of the talks earlier in the semester, before 2nd rotation choice",
    "The variety of professors in the seminars was wonderful, but they were planned so late and we were told about them on such short notice that is was a little awkward.",
    "I think this was when we had the five minute talks of what different MBB professors are working on. It was poorly organized. It was supposed to help us pick rotations, but didn't happen until the day or two before our second rotation choices were due. So we all had it figured out before hand, and then had to sit through the talks anyways. Lots of professors had presented at the retreat, so we kind of knew what they were working on anyways. However, it was nice to hear from the people who weren't at the retreat, and to get to know a little more about what's going on in the department. Next year it would be great if these were planned earlier, and if we were given more than a day's notice of when they would happen. And if they weren't scheduled for during Fall break."
