    "Overview of interesting history of American regulatory state and American political parties. You will learn a good deal. DeCanio is great - fun to have class with and very smart. Only work is a 15 page paper at the end of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is a fascinating overview of the political history of the U.S., and every student at Yale should take this course.",
    "This is a very interesting course that is not exactly how it sounds in the title. Its more like an exploration of the period after reconstruction (1877ish, but starting early, perhaps 1873) until WWI, through the lens of public opinion vs elites. The course is valuable because the time period is not taught in many courses and is very important for the creation of the modern American bureaucratic state. Additionally Prof. Decanio takes you through the period through the lens of elite manipulation of public opinion, which is obviously a relevant theme throughout US politics."
