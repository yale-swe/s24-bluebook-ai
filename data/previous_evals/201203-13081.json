    "I would highly recommend this class for a fellow student, especially one with little to no experience with photographing",
    "Take it if you have an interest in photography and have time to devote to it. The more you put in the more you'll get out of it.",
    "I enjoyed the class overall and I think many of the strengths lie in the great faculty and resources provided by the DMCA. The workload of the course is also very manageable and with the guidance of Dru Donovan, very inspiring. I wish, though, that written instructions be provided more often, in addition to more concentrated and guided studies on specific photographers. Students should have the initiative to do the latter, and I'm sure they will naturally feel encouraged to, but I think more time dedicated to parsing photographs would have been very helpful. I would recommend!",
    "An enjoyable class for all of us. Yes, I will recommend it.",
    "Fantastic. The course provides guidance i helping to develop your photographic skills, but still allows for great freedom in focusing on whatever you feel appropriate. Never an unenjoyable moment. Dru is awesome, you won't find a cooler, more chill, low-stress instructor.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course! One of the best courses I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever taken, and a really nice change of pace from writing essays, taking tests, etc. I learned so much, took photos I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of, and was fortunate enough to take the class with Dru. It was a significant but manageable amount of work, and the work was both fun and rewarding. Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have asked for more in a photo class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a fun course that also asks a lot of you as a student and an artist. You learn so much about photography in such a short amount of time; it's definitely worth taking!",
    "I liked this class. It was very flexible, but still required a large volume of good work to do well. It's a great class with which to break up a semester full of papers, psets, and exams.",
    "Yes! Dru is amazing, and the class does a superb job of balancing learning about the technical aspects of digital photography and exposes you to a series of Yale photographers and the personal work of various artists. You visit the art gallery and also understand how to work photoshop. If you pace yourself the workload is manageable and really a delight. Definitely take it if you get a spot and like photography!",
    "This class is incredible. I learned so much about how to manipulate my camera (I'll never use the automatic setting again), and trained my eye to take much better pictures. Dru is AWESOME and so willing to provide extra help. When we learned about photoshop in class she often went really quickly, so I would really advise taking notes because I found myself not able to remember many of the steps we went through. This is also NOT a simple class -- the work itself isn't hard but each assignment requires hours and hours of shooting time and editing time, you can't get away with not doing it. But going out and taking pictures is incredibly fun and rewarding, so every second is worth it if you're willing to put in the time."
