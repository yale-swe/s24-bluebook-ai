    "This class is very interesting, but very hard. I would only recommend this class to someone who has to take it for his or her major because of its difficulty as a subject.",
    "So Gomez's old reviews are basically terrible, and I was super nervous heading into a class that I heard was really hard with a professor people didn't like. BUT HE WAS SUPER CHILL. He made jokes and kept us awake and engaged. His lecturing style was the best STEM lecturing I've ever had. Sometimes it felt like classes didn't help with the psets at all, but having to think about systems both from the math and from the logic of it made me understand Thermo better. Psets were not easy, but working with other people makes them more manageable.",
    "Very well taught. Logical procession of material. Lectures presented the same material as did the textbook, but in different ways. Weekly quizzes and homeworks like clockwork kept the class focused and clear on the concepts. Tour of Sterling Power Plant at the end brought it to the real world. My only criticism is that it the first midterm was impossible to finish in time. The later midterm and final helped this by making the last question a \"bonus\" that noone got on the midterm either.",
    "It's a hard class but a must-take for anyone who wants to be an engineer. Its the basics and the foundation for the rest of the curriculum.",
    "You basically have to take this course if you're ABET MechE but even if you're not ABET I would actually suggest taking it. It's really pretty interesting if you care at all about energy studies and Gomez really isn't as bad as everyone says he is. He's really blunt (which was actually refreshing compared to most Yale teachers) and he really cares about the material. The homework was a decent time commitment (5-8 hrs depending on the week). The exams are ridiculously hard, but Gomez curves and the entire class does poorly anyway.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "I thought the material in Thermodynamics was interesting and I thought Professor Gomez did a good job of explaining the material. The problem sets were pretty challenging, but I felt like I learned a lot. The weekly quizzes that Gomez had helped me keep track with what was being taught through the semester. The exams were incredibly difficult, so be sure to study well for those. Nonetheless, the exams were curved.",
    "Thermodynamics is among the more conceptually difficult classes in MENG. The work load is quite average, but you need to take your time to understand the material thoroughly.",
    "tough course, but you need to take it. Just go to the TA sessions each week.",
    "This was my most challenging class so far in mechanical engineering (I'm a sophomore). The course material was very difficult but the class was well taught. Proffessor Gomez did a great job teaching this class. He really cares about the students and will pause teaching if he sees a perplexed look on students' faces. This is a great trait for a professor teaching such a difficult class.",
    "If you have to take this course with Gomez, DO NOT TAKE IT. Thermodynamics has been and probably will be the hardest class I have ever taken in my life. Gomez is a really good guy but he is a very intense professor and moves very fast. Thermodynamics is conceptually and mathematically hard, you HAVE to put in the time to read the book and keep up with Gomez in class. The problem sets are long and hard and will take you four hours easily even if you do them in section. This year he gave us a quiz every week to make sure we kept up with the material, and they can often catch you off guard. The midterms are open book open note but still ridiculously hard and scores often range in the lower 20s and 30s. I got a 5 on my first midterm and a 33 on my second, he has no remorse. The only reason you should be looking at this class is if you're a mechanical engineer, so if you have to take it, take it. As a mechanical engineer this will be the hardest of your required classes. Otherwise save yourself, because this class will single handedly ruin your semester.",
    "Thermodynamics for engineers. It's very cumulative.",
    "I thought this was a very good course. The weekly quizzes are a good way to help solidify information and clarify more important concepts. Gomez is a dynamic professor so it is easy to pay attention in class, and his lectures are a good supplement to the textbook. Exams were quite difficult and very selective. Hard to know how you are going to do until you take them because they are often only one or two long questions -- so you better hope you have a solid grasp of basically everything (tough). Overall a good course though, if a lot of work and time. I recommend going to the TA sessions and reading through textbook examples consistently.",
    "Intimidating, but doable if work is put in.",
    "Very interesting course that has very practical applications but it can be quite difficult. The midterms are hard with the first being the most difficult but they seemed to become progressively more doable. The psets are far from easy but not impossible. Do the reading and you will be fine. You will learn a lot about engines and cycles and their efficiencies. Worthwhile class!",
    "The course emphasizes the first and second law of thermodynamics and there relation to thermodynamic cycles in various types of power plants (~10.5 weeks)and in chemical reactions (~2.5 weeks). By the end of the course, students will have a strong grasp of thermo dynamics and how it applies to cooky cutter engineering problems. Unless students come in with a strong chemistry background, they will know little about thermodynamics and chemistry. This is the nature of the course. With only 2.5 weeks to introduce as much material as taught in 10.5 weeks, it's not a surprise that students have no understanding of chemistry and thermodynamics."
