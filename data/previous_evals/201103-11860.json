   "comments": [
    "Would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if the field placement sounds interesting\/tolerable. Also, the two semester commitment is something that needs to be weighed. I think it is worth it though.",
    "This course has a weekly practicum at an actual mental health center. It is not difficult intellectually, but practical (and can be difficult in a different way). You also have to be committed to a full year. It is a great opportunity for you to practice clinical skills, which is sometimes hard to get in an undergraduate psychology course.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in learning more about clinical psychology and if you enjoy analyzing other people's situations\/problems.",
    "The class really helps you understand what it means to be a therapist and give therapy to a client. It focuses on forging relationships, understanding clients, knowing what questions to ask, and understanding boundaries. The readings were not hard to keep up with and the work-load was very manageable. At times, I wanted the work load to be a little more extensive actually. I wish we had focused on specific mental illnesses in greater detail instead of having this very general approach. Working at the field placement was very eye-opening for me (I worked at Riverview). Professor Lockhart is clearly cares a lot about the subject and provides many interesting personal anecdotes. She is also crazy (in agood way!) and quite funny.",
    "Yes, this course is great! Take it if you want to or can handle this early of a course. Because being too tired for the class really detracts from your experience.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in clinical psychology. You'll get a firsthand look into working with people with mental disorders, but don't expect to see really shocking things. Still it's a great experience. The workload is manageable (weekly thought responses or journal entries and a final paper) as long as you have time to go to the placement everyweek and can commit to taking it for both semesters.",
    "Yes. Great if you're interested in clinical psychology. Just keep in mind, the class is all year long.",
    "Yes, if you are truly interested in clinical psych. if not, probably not for you.",
    "The combination of interactive class discussions, simulations, and field placements in nearby psych facilities makes this course unique in the psych department. You will get a better understanding of mental illness and the experience of being a clinical psychologist than in any other psych course. It's fun even if you're not interested in ultimately becoming a clinical psychologist though!"
