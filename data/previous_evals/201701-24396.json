    "I learned more about historical analysis of indentitarian conceptualizations. I gained insight into how projecting modern conceptualizations of identity onto people in the past is anachronistic and ill-suited to gaining understanding of the past. I gained a lot of historical contextualization for gender and sexuality in Japan which I found deeply interesting."

    "I think this course was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the material. I think that the instructor should either choose to teach only on edo period japan or make the course into a survey course which gives a broader perspective on how japanese conceptions of gender and sexuality have developed over time."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was deeply engaging and valuable to learn about gender and sexuality in another country. It was also interesting to see how ideas are exchanged and how European and US imperialist interactions with Japan played a part in the rise of homophobia in Japan. This class taught me to seek historical contextualization when learning and discussing identities with which I am unfamiliar. Overall, the class was very informative and interesting."
