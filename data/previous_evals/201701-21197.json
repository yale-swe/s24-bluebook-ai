   "comments": [
    "Great mix of hands-on experiments and theoretical underpinnings\/ideas - learned so much about the environment around me, from the physics of how structures function successfully to the way the architecture profession and industry works.",
    "You really do get to understand how structural engineers have to think about constructing a building or any kind of structure really. I learned to think about the physics and math behind architecture which I've never really thought about before. It was interesting although the concepts were slightly difficult.",
    "tension is better than compression is better than bending",
    "How physics is applied in building structures and how closely structure affects architecture. Structures was something that I previously never really thought about, but is so universally applicable and this course really gave me a good overview of structures in architectural design.",
    "Learned the structural logic behind building choices. Very important for anyone interested in architecture, especially majors.",
    "Basic math, basic physics, so much knowledge about structures! Learning how both an engineer and an architect think, architectural history and knowledge of important buildings",
    "I know understand more fully how structures are constructed and stabilized. I also feel therefore that my intuition about the topic has become much greater."

   "comments": [
    "Everything about it is excellent. One of the most well-structured and organised courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Moves too fast.",
    "The lectures, especially the in-class lab or demonstrations were really good, and the real world examples in lectures\/in homework problems were very interesting. I especially liked the structure competitions, since you got to apply what you learned to actually make something. Maybe the pace of the class was getting a lot faster towards the end of semester, and it'd be ideal if it were spread out evenly throughout the semester.",
    "The end was somewhat rushed.",
    "Great class, a lot of problem sets sometimes lumped together, but otherwise pretty manageable.",
    "Jump into quantitative parry very quickly and cover a lot of material but it all builds on each other and is taught very well, review session super helpful, psets fair and covered taught material in a helpful manner, structure competitions were hard to get done on top of psets but were interesting and fun way to mix up class",
    "The instructor was very engaging, however it was difficult to cover so many topics in one semester and achieve any sort of depth.",
    "Some kind of additional study guides would have been useful - ie a textbook or online videos, worksheets. It was extremely difficult to understand something if you didn't get it the first time around - the TFs were helpful but only to a certain degree.",
    "Professor Moon is a great professor and he taught very clearly in class. I only wish that there had been more resources outside of lecture. The TAs were almost always available to help, but some resources online or any sort of lecture slides would have been nice and very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely - easily one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Moon is smart and caring and an incredible professor and really cares that each of his students understands the concepts and does well. The pace was great - learned a lot but never felt lost or left behind.",
    "Be warned: not a gut.",
    "Really great class--not easy, but the things you learn are actually useful. Take advantage of Professor Moon's office hours! He cares so much about the success of his students and will do whatever it takes to help you understand the material.",
    "Really interesting material, unlike any other class, great mix of engineering knowledge and architectural, Moon is the greatest professor and really loves teaching and helping everyone be the best student they can be, great environment and huge learning experience",
    "It was both fun and informative.",
    "As an architecture student - yes, because the material is essential and not something you'll get through studio. Otherwise, this class is definitely not a gut, and it's easy to think you understand something and then totally bomb a pset. Moon went through the material very quickly towards the end of the course, and you need to pay attention very diligently in class because there's no textbook or other kinds of study guides. You might feel very lost a lot of the time, but he does make an effort to make sure you understand the actual concepts. The exams weren't too difficult if you were good on the homework, but beware the competitions - you'll need a lot of time to build the structures and let the glue dry.",
    "Conceptually, the class isn't too difficult. You have to be pretty comfortable with trigonometry and physics but if you put the effort into taking stellar notes in class you'll probably be okay."
