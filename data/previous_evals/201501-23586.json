He was very responsive and helpful, and was passionate about the subject and cared deeply for student learning. However, I don't think many people asked for his help before our trip. On the trip he was an amazing TA, and afterwards he took it upon himself to help us with our write ups. I don't know if there is a way to have him integrated into the course more at the beginning.",

    "Instructor: Juan Carlos Penagos Zuluaga \u00a0Knowledgeable, always accessible, open and friendly.",
    "Instructor: Juan Carlos Penagos Zuluaga \u00a0Juan was extremely approachable. He had a great style of pushing us to think harder but never can across negative. It was a great balance. The one way he may improve was to expand his academic conversations to topics outside of botany\/taxonomy. I recognize this is his expertise but I am sure he has much more to share.",
    "Instructor: Juan Carlos Penagos Zuluaga \u00a0Juan was a fantastic TA. He was so friendly and accessible, in New Haven and in Panama. There was no question, large or small, that I felt uncomfortable asking him. Beyond this, he knew the material like the back of his hand. A mentor and a friend, Juan is someone whom I hope to keep in touch with and to continue learning from.",
    "Instructor: Juan Carlos Penagos Zuluaga \u00a0Really excellent teaching fellow, very available and interested in the topic, and very knowledgable. We got to interact with him a lot in Panama, and he was crucial to the amazing experience we had. I really have no weaknesses to report in Juan, he is the best TF that I have had here at Yale.",

    "The major strength of the course was the time spent in the field, and the writing up of the research afterwards. It was incredible to be immersed in the field and meet all these scientists and learn of their research. Conducting a study and following proper protocol for scientific submission was very helpful to learn the rigorous process behind scientific experiments and knowledge. The first half of the course did not seem all that relevant to the field trip. It has been explained that the course in the fall is meant to provide a detailed background to understand tropical ecology, yet without that course this year, many of us had trouble connecting what we were reading with the relevance to the class.",
    "I thought the pace was too slow initially, and only really picked up for the field trip. I think it would have been useful to prepare a bit more before we got into the field, especially around plant ID and ecological theories. Although the latter made a lot more sense while we were actually in the field.",
    "I think this course was really heavy on the botany. I would like to see more conversation around topics such as fauna and sociology.",
    "This course was excellent. I really feel that I got a lot out of it.",
    "The field trip was extremely helpful to my learning about tropical field ecology-- I learned an incredible amount by being there and seeing the research station. It was an incredible experience that really inspired excitement for learning more about tropical ecology. However, overall I did not find that the professors were excited about the material, or interested in advancing our learning. We did not get a good foundation in ecological theory or concepts before we went to Panama-- because we only met once a week, we didn't have a lot of time to learn about the concepts before our trip. Our discussions were not very helpful, and I didn't feel that the professors did very much to provoke conversation."

   "comments": [
    "The field trip to Panama, we learned so much. I sincerely appreciate how flexible and adaptive the professors and the TA were to tailor it to student interests, and how much they cared about our learning.",
    "The best aspects were the chance to get into the field and see how these ecological forces and theories were interacting in practice. It was useful to get a sense of how data is collected and the limitations for studying these issues. However, I would have liked more focus on tropical ecology basics and theories in a more formalized setting. I feel like I have a sense of the interactions more now, but not as strongly as i have when I left other similar classes that weren't specifically tropically focused. Professors were also great at responding to class interest and flexible in class and on the field trip. The places we went were a pretty amazing selection of sites, and it was a pretty incredible 10 day trip!",
    "The field trip was a great opportunity to see things on-the-ground, see research sites and get an \"on-the-ground\" attempt at practicing tropical ecology.",
    "Excellent field trip.",
    "the field trip was very well organized and ran extremely smoothly. I understand that this is no easy feat. Great job!",
    "Learning the literature and being out in the field",
    "The trip to panama was, of course, the highlight of the semester. In the ecosystem that we'd been reading about, we were learning so much each day. The teachers were open to endless questions and were very attentive and excited. It was awesome to see them in their element.",
    "The field trip was extremely well organized and packed full of useful information. A very intensive and complete overview of tropical field ecology and management issues faced in the tropics. Good combination of biology exposure with management application (such as the Aqua Salud visit).",
    "The trip was great. I especially enjoyed interacting with researchers on BCI. I think that getting the course to such an active field station was critical to it's success. Hanging out at the school house was nice but it also meant that there was less informal learning going on. The canopy crane was amazing."

   "comments": [
    "the beginning half, see question 16.",
    "I think having the fall tropical ecology lecture class will help this course a lot, as it won't all have to be a part of this one course. Because I would have liked some more back ground on tropical ecology as it is understood now. All the other ecology courses at FES I've seen are naturally more temperate focused, so I was really looking forward to digging into tropical questions specifically. We got into a lot more of this knowledge when we got into the field, but I would have liked more before we left.",
    "More preparation prior to the trip could have allowed for more time for creating and conducting our \"studies\" or more visits to sites and places. (Preparation being lectures on plant, and animal id, a preview into the process of designing a study, developing a hypothesis etc.) More lectures in addition to student discussion would have helped.",
    "As mentioned previously, a more holistic perspective of tropical field ecology (incorporating more fauna and how humans affect ecology and how ecology affects humans).",
    "More structured discussion in class. May help if professor explains more concepts and guides conversation more",
    "This course was a bit awkard in that we didn't have a thorough introduction to the topics that we'd be studying. We were not lectured to about the ecosystem and its flora and fauana generally until we were in Panama. I understand that this is because it is meant to be accompanied by a fall course that didn't run this year. Taking both courses may completely eliminate this small complaint. But because some students may only be able to take the spring field course, I would recommend some introductory lectures on the ecosystem (flora, fauna, history of the landscape, biotic +abiotic processes) in the first few days of classes.",
    "I think that the readings and student lead discussions could be improved a bit - perhaps with a bit more guidance early on in terms of what is expected for a student led discussion. I think that some of the students were not sure how to lead a thought provoking discussion or how seriously to take things, though really it's the student's responsibility to strive.",
    "The pre-panama section of the class was very boring. It is hard to get a class of such diverse backgrounds onto the same page to have meaningful discussions. Lectures by the professor that framed the paper we were reading and pointed out why we should be interested would be improve this section. Also the discussion sometimes got well outside of the professors wheel house in terms of content. This leaded to some pretty low level uninformed discussion of things like ecosystem services. During the trip there were multiple times when we had the group gathered but the instructors where still working out the plan of action. This should\/could be shorted out before hand and would improve the flow of the course. The period after spring break seemed two short to prepare to papers meaningfully. Doing two papers also felt like busy work. It would be better to have a presentation on the first project and a paper about the second."

I would not have been able to preform the statistics in particular or have the background to create a detailed research question outside of my existing knowledge base. The disadvantage was that I felt, in one group in particular, I didn't have much of a say in the content of the final version of the paper.
