   "comments": [
    "It is a prerequisite for the major, but anyone would benefit from it. Any musician should definitely take this class... Sarita is a amazing, and it is challenging but low-stress. The aural and keyboard skills you develop in 219 are vital and practical for anyone who wishes to devote any aspect of their life to music. The music listened to\/ dictated\/ sung in 219 is also phenomenal. Absolutely take it.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class. It's hard to practice on your own outside of class (I mean that it's a difficult thing to do, not that it's hard to find time or whatever), but if you are the kind of person who loves music and can work through occasional frustration, you should definitely go for this class.",
    "This was a great continuation to the 218 ear training course. The keyboard lab helped my piano skills quite a bit, and my ear got A LOT better over the year. Highly recommended!",
    "Definitely take this class if you consider music a big part of your life. Sarita is wonderful and genuinely wants to see every student improve. The class is challenging but always relaxed and shockingly fun, even at 9:30am.",
    "If you feel relatively comfortable with the ear-training (intervals, pitch relativity, sight-singing with scale degrees, chord identification, etc..) or feel\/know that you have a good ear, then this class is very easy and just a good way to keep your ear 'in shape.' However, if you are new to these skills, I think the class can be challenging and perhaps not so fulfilling. If you aren't so used to ear-training, this class doesn't allow for quite enough time to fully skills in musicianship. Building a foundation in the subject is really an enterprise that needs to be taken gradually and drilled often.",
    "This is an opportunity to develop your \"seeing ear\" and your \"hearing eye:\" that is, being able to mentally translate written music into aural music and vice versa. I strongly recommend this course to those who are skilled in this regard; however, I feel like if this was not something for which I had something of a natural propensity, I would have found it frustrating at times. Personally, though, I strongly recommend this course.",
    "In this class, you spend a lot of time practicing dictations, and a couple of weeks doing sight-singing. The dictations are sometimes longer and have more parts than in the first level of musicianship, but are not really harder. Sarita is a knowledgeable and engaging instructor, and the class is a great way to hone your ear training skills and listen to some great music for credit!"
