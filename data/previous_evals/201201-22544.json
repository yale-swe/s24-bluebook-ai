    "This was my first course in film theory, and though I approached it with some apprehension, I very much appreciated the opportunity to consider the early days of film as an artistic and commercial medium. Do not pass up the opportunity to get to know Professor Casetti, who is passionate and obsessed with the material, but is also interested in hearing new ideas.",
    "If you're interested in watching a lot of film and analying it, this is not the class you want. However, the theory and insight it gives into film's history and early years is fascinating.",
    "This course would be interesting for anyone interested in modernity and the twentieth century, with or without the film component. Casetti's lectures are riveting, and anyway his accent is really charming.",
    "If you are a theory person this is a cool course to take. Professor Casetti has a lot of interesting things to say and his lectures are enjoyable. The workload is not too bad (20ish pages of reading per week, 2 essays and a take-home final), the material will make you think about film in ways you probably have in the past, and tailoring theory to fit your arguments can always be fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to any student interested in film or in the complicated responses to the conditions of modernity."
