    "For somone that really has a passion for modern philosophy, second semester DS Philosophy is just as rewarding as first semester. For me, I just couldn't find the stamina to care about it nearly as much as second semester H&P or Literature. If you loved DS first semester, I'm sure you'd enjoy it just as much or more than first semester. Depends on personal preference.",
    "The second semester of DS philosophy is fulfilling because it gives exposure to a wide range of modern philosophers and their varied views on \"the big questions\" in philosophy, in comparison to the first semester, which presented Plato, Aristotle, and \"others.\" We read a new philosopher almost weekly, so students had the chance to find thinkers they really identify with and support. The frequently polarized opinions of the class lead to engaging discussions. This is a great way to be introduced to different schools of thought to help you decide which you'd like to pursue in further courses on the subject or philosopher.",
    "Great course, great faculty, great community. DS is painful, and you'll learn only as much as you commit; but you won't find anything like it elsewhere in Yale--not taking DS will be the biggest regret of your Yale career.",
    "Taking notes in section is overrated; taking notes at LECTURE is profoundly underrated. Do not make the mistake (that so many DS students seem to make) of skipping the Friday lecture; when finals come around you will hate yourself. Also: get the reading later in the semester done as early as you possibly can. Doing a rushed reading of Hegel over breakfast the day of your section is certainly an exhilarating experience, but exhilarating in the way that trying to defuse a nuclear bomb is exhilarating. Don't do it to yourself. Please."
