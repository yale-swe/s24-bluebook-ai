   "comments": [
    "You get as much as you put in. If you don't have much previous knowledge on western classical music, you'll get a pretty complementary idea. If you already are interested, or already knows a lot about it, this course still offers a great structure in which you can broaden your horizon.I came to this class as sort of an audiophile, owning many classical CD's, and had much previous exposure. But I got to know periods, genres, composers that I wasn't too aware of, and I got some great knowledge in music theory.",
    "This class makes me feel more cultured. I knew a lot about music coming in, but not about music history, genre, style or form. It was harder than I thought, and more work, but also pretty easy to get an A if you do all the work. I recommend.",
    "Excellent fifth class! DO IT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in music, but not a music major.",
    "Great class - lot of fun.",
    "It's supposed to be introductory, but the vast majority of students have had recent music experience, so that sort of sets the standard for the class. Definitely not as \"gutty\" as I thought it'd be.",
    "Take it! One of my favorite courses at Yale!",
    "I would recommend Music 112 to someone who hasn't had much experience with music. The class gives the basics to elements of music and music history - don't take the class if you already know this stuff! Great for someone who wants to understand how music works and how it has evolved over history.",
    "This course is a great class. One of the best I've taken at Yale. It is really interesting and the professor is awesome. If you are at all interested in classical music you should take it. Doing the assignments and taking the tests are much more fun and relaxing than any other course because you are primarily listening to nice sounding music. Still mentally stimulating at the same time.",
    "It is a good choice as a class to take outside your major but sometimes it can become difficult to keep up with the pace.",
    "I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Listening to Music to another student who's had some musical exposure; however, to the student who has not had any, I would somewhat be wary of taking the course, only for the large amount of concepts that one is required to grasp in a very short amount of time.",
    "This is a good class. It's not as easy as it sounds, and I mean that, but the class is pretty straightforward if you put in the effort. It is hard at first for people who have no musical background, but if you follow the test prep sheets you will be fine.",
    "Take this class if you want to be a more conscious music listener. Professor Wright is a wonderful instructor that sincerely cares about the subject matter he teaches and about getting students interested in music. He understands and respects that not everyone is a music major and does not expect anyone to become one. What he cares about is sharing his love for music and hopes it will trickle down on to the students.",
    "YES! Take it, no prior music experience required!",
    "It is an extremely interesting class for anyone who is interested in learning about listening to music. In no way is the course a gut, so you do have to put in the necessary time commitment. That being said, if you put in the time and effort, it is not an extremel hard class. I definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject matter",
    "The most pleasant course at Yale. I came in expecting to enjoy myself, and I did. The music history portion drags a little, but it all comes together in the end. The workload is not extreme, and section is almost as fun as lecture. Take it if you've ever been unable to sit through a classical concert or opera. Learning to understand and appreciate that stuff will make you feel a bajillion times more cultured, I promise.",
    "awesome survey to music. everyone should take this course before graduation. beware if you're looking to get good grades its not exactly a gut.",
    "It's a very interesting class. Take it if you want to learn some really basic theory and music history, and listen to lots of cool music.",
    "Great course to learn about basic music history and how to appreciate classical music. Would recommend for anyone interested in those topics.",
    "Absolutely take it. Most fun you'll have in a class at Yale. Homework is essentially listening exericises, and you spend a great deal of class listening to music. Great course. Take it!",
    "Take it.",
    "The course is great for people who have very limited background in music, but even for those who are trained musicians, it covers a lot of really interesting history about musical periods.",
    "Definitely. This is a truly life enriching course, because it will change the way you listen to and comprehend music, giving you a whole new appreciation for this art form. One concern I had going in is that I would be disadvantaged by not having a musical background. I did not find this to be the case.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is looking for a fun and useful gut class :) If you are not musically inclined, the listening part of the tests (e.g. identify instruments or identify genre of this piece) will be difficult. Overall, however, this class is fairly little work.On the other hand, if you are a music major or are heavily involved with music related things, I would not recommend this class, because you will be quite bored. On the first day of class, Professor Wright hands out a quiz with some music terms. If you score well on it, he suggests that this is class is not for you as you know too much. So keep that in mind :)",
    "Definitely. It is a beautiful class, just like all of those beautiful pieces of music we learn to appreciate as a major part of the class requirement. I love Prof. Wright, who is extremely experienced and accomplished in music teaching. He chose some of the most beautiful pieces in whole of human civilization and I feel a lot more cultured having taken the class.The lectures are also so relaxing it almost feels like a study break. But at the same time you get a lot out of it too.However, one downside is that I find the Listening Exercise part of this class not as effective as it should be. Some of the questions I feel are not very well designed, and there are ways which you can cheat around the system.",
    "This is not clapping for credit as some may here. You really have to put in the work and do the readings ahead of time to get the most out of lectures and sections. Also listening to the music constantly(a week or two before exams) is the only way to truly get a feeling for the musical elements at play.",
    "This is a really fun course! A must-take for a fun humanities credit. Do be warned-there is actually work involved- especially if your musical skills are limited (but that doesn't mean that you won't do fine in the course!) Craig Wright is great- he is super passionate and a really nice guy. Overall a great course that opened me up to a lot of music I never would listened to or appreciated otherwise.",
    "It's a pretty interesting introduction to music (mostly classical music) if you don't have any background in music. It's not that much work. If you are a musical person it will probably be very easy. If not (as I was not), you may have to spend a fair bit of time listening to examples to be able to hear the things that Professor Wright speaks about in lecture. I think in the end I got a lot out of the course."
