   "comments": [
    "If you love writing take this course. You do have a lot of essay assignments but they are all pretty fun to do.",
    "English 120 is a great way to strengthen your nonfiction writing skills. It's unlike any high school English class in that you aren't so much writing analytically as you are writing creatively. That said, it still strengthens your analytical skills since you have to look critically at the readings and the techniques used by the authors. I would absolutely recommend English 120 to another student--it's one of the \"must-take\" courses at Yale.",
    "Take everyone's advice and just take this class, you'll be so glad you did. I don't know why it took me all the way until junior year to take this class. I kept making excuses for myself how I wouldn't have enough time, etc. But honestly, with Professor Shirkhani, you'll enjoy the class so much that you'll make time. And you'll arrive on time... even at 9am. To quote another 120 teacher, Professor Ehrgood, the workload of the course \"is not what it used to be.\" Only 5 papers, and the due dates were very reasonably spaced with assistance from the October and Thanksgiving breaks.All of the readings are great, and Professor Shirkhani does an amazing job leading discussion section. I definitely improved as a writer during this course and had a heckuva good time. DFW FTW",
    "It's a bit unorthodox but very fun. There is no given topic, so you learn a little about a lot of things. I thought that was a plus, but some people might not. There isn't an overwhelming amount of writing, but what you do write has to be good quality and so it does take a good chunk of time to complete. The prompts are very open and you can choose to write about something that interests you.",
    "English 120 is a great class and an easy, stress-free writing credit. Actually do the assigned readings since they are key to participation and contain skillful writing techniques you could emulate in your essays.",
    "English 120 is basically a crash course in essay writing. Not your typical research papers or literary essays, but the types of essays that you see in the New Yorker. Definitely take this course if you're interested in writing,but don't take it if you're worried about your grade. This is not an easy A or even an easy A-, and if you're not willing to take a few hits to your grade in order to learn how to improve your writing, you're only going to be stressed out by this class.",
    "The class is a really good study in creative non fiction. It's a fun intro to writing in college, but not academic writing. It's really enjoyable to read\/discuss the essays and to just sit down and WRITE. I loved this class. Shirkhani is also great. She leads discussion well, offers really constructive comments, and is open for office hours.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to another student, and especially this section with Professor Shirkhani. The amount of attention she gives to your essays, especially if you go to her with questions, is incredible. She focuses a lot on more modern writing and the larger ideas of your essays rather than on more classic work or specific sentence structure like I think professors of other sections do. Personally, I enjoyed the selections we read and found her comments really helpful. In English 120 you also have to workshop everyone's writing in the class. I found this to be one of the most rewarding parts of the class even if my writing wasn't being workshopped.",
    "This class was wonderful! I'm not sure the extent to which it improved my writing (not that I'm particularly that great a writer to begin with) but it surely instilled in me a far greater love of creative writing and the New Yorker!",
    "Take this class! Especially with Professor Shirkhani if you can, she was the best!",
    "Definitely take English 120. The essays we read are amazing and the ones we write are a lot of fun. Professor Shirkani is great; she cares about each students' writing style and works with you individually to improve. I know I'm a better writer after this class, and I enjoyed the process.",
    "Great class!",
    "English 120 is excellent for students who are comfortable with their writing and want to improve their technique. Difficult for those still finding their voice and concerned with content more than style.",
    "If you only want to learn how to write better essays for class, English 114 might be a better choice. Do English 120if you enjoy writing, or think you could learn to enjoy writing. There is a lot of room for creativity in the assignments, and you WILL be a better writer by the end. Be prepared to put in the effort though, it can take quite a bit of work."
