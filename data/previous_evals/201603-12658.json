    "I was new to Ottoman history before this course. I learned 1) the formative works in Ottoman history 2) major debates in the field.",
    "Thanks to Professor Mikhail's engaging teaching and rigorous schedule of course readings, I developed a deep understanding of some of the major historiographical issues within the field of Ottoman history over the past century. Though some students in our course might argue that the quantity of our readings was too high, I gained twice as much from this course compared to other graduate seminars in history simply because we were asked to read twice as much. Over the course of my undergraduate and graduate studies I have found that it's courses like this one, that push you to work outside of your comfort zone, which encourage the most growth. Along these lines, beyond satisfying its basic goals of familiarizing us with the historiography of the Ottoman, the course was extremely relevant for me given my research interest in the early modern Sephardic diaspora. Thanks to my involvement in Professor Mikhail's seminar I now have a much stronger sense of the economic, social, and intellectual history of the Ottoman empire at the time of the emergence of Sephardic diaspora communities in the 16th and 17th centuries."

    "Excellent course. Volume of reading can be challenging, but the selection and structure are great.",
    "What makes this course so valuable is the level of engagement in Professor Mikhail's teaching. He does not simply arbitrate our discussions, as is the case with many professors, he actively encourages us to go beyond making basic contributions. In other words when some one chimes in with their point of view, Professor Mikhail regularly urges us to to better qualify and explain more deeply our interpretations of course readings. At first I found it a bit nerve-racking to be put on the spot in this manner. Normally professors in my seminars lead discussions in a passive manner, never seeking to challenge our points of view. Yet the level of Mikhail's engagement in leading discussions, often as devil's advocate, lead me to begin thinking more deeply about my contributions to our discussions and their broader context\/historiographical relevance."

    "Although intensive, this course is a superb introduction to Ottoman history.",
