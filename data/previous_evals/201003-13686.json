    "The quality of the experience depends to such a great degree on interaction with the client that it is hard to generalize about this course. With regards to my experience, though, I'd say that I learned a ton this semester, both substantively through the project research and procedurally about how to manage working with a team and a client.",
    "A student's experience of this class is entirely dependent on his or her project. Fortunately, Maureen does a great job of assembling quality projects so that there are a lot of good options. She is also very upfront about each client's advantages and disadvantages, so students know what they are getting into. I was 100% happy with my project and my client, and I am very grateful to Maureen for making it all happen."

    "- The ability to work on a real-life problem for a client organization.- Client was engaged and responsive throughout the semester.- Prompt feedback from the instructor on all deliverables.- Great team dynamic on project.- Interesting guest speakers.",
    "Access to an actual client. I felt that my work was actually a useful contributed to the world.",
    "The opportunity to work on a real project and seek to influence the decision-making process of an important client.",
    "Direct communication with the client.",
    "Getting a chance to do a real-world project for a real-world client. Hopefully our product will help inform the company's decisions moving forward. It is great to be able to balance out the more academic FES coursework with this type of practical experience.",
    "Potentially, the clients, if you get a decent client.",
    "real-world problems.",
    "Learning through real-world application of skills, including consistent support from Maureen along the way (regular meetings, feedback on written products). I also liked the guest talks, and being able to have a good Q&A with them as part of their presentations.",

   "comments": [
    "- Stronger in-class curriculum outside of guest speakers.- The work content was much lighter than I would have imagined or liked. I wonder how much value we really added to the client organization with the high-level nature of the analysis. Other clinics are more rigorous and demand a far higher quality and quantity of output.",
    "I thought the class sessions were not always that helpful. The session on presentation skills, for example, could have been dropped altogether, and there were others that didn't add a ton of value for me. The opportunities to hear from guest speakers and engage with them about their internal initiatives were much better.",
    "Some of the powerpoint presentations in the beginning of the semester -- how to be a consultant, etc -- were rather weak and that time could probably be used in a more useful manner.",
    "Everything. One of the worst courses I have ever taken. Both the course and professor are poorly organized.1. This is a course organized around group work, and the groups themselves were not well considered.2. The classes had little if anything to do with the work for the course. It was a clinic course and yet we had random lectures about renewable energy; the connection was tenuous at best.3. When giving a lecture using powerpoint about powerpoint presentations, it is useful to have a decent powerpoint presentation. Most students were in awe that anyone would pay the professor for said consulting services.4. The professor was not responsive to students comments\/question and was in fact often defensive-- both in class and during our weekly group meetings with the professor.5. When it was all said and done, I got so very little out of this class. I had such high expectations, but as I said before this is easily the worst course I have ever take at FES.",
    "not sure what you should change",
    "This seems a bit nit-picky, but the slides are a bit old school and it can take a long time to find things when going back to them.",
    "The client could have been engaged more. Possibly requiring the client to donate to a fund to be a part of the clinic might help.",
    "A bit more depth on consulting skills and methodology"

    "Group work was invaluable in dividing and conquering project deliverables.Great team dynamic and good mix of skills and working styles made for a fairly easygoing but high-quality work environment.Different working styles sometimes caused progress to be slower than ideal, but issues always got worked out without compromising on quality or timeliness of output.",
    "Small group size made it difficult, but quality of group members was good.",
    "I learned a ton from my group and found it a useful challenge to deal with different work styles. There were numerous disagreements that slowed us down, which was difficult at times, but there was also good learning in that, as we figured out how to handle those differences.",
    "Advantage: I have learned how to coordinate with team members.",
    "I loved the group work. Working with a team is part of the working world, so in that way, the group aspect of this course is a valuable learning experience in addition to the actual projects we completed. It helps when you're very happy with the other members of your team, which I was.",
    "The advantages were that some students were able to do little if any work and still get credit for the course since all work was group work. The disadvantage was that the remaining members had to carry the day.",
    "advantage - different backgrounds, strengths and perspectivesdisadvantage - keeping people on task, coordinating schedules",
    "We had a great team with complementary skills, styles, and approaches. It actually went so smoothly that the load didn't ever fall too heavily on any single person. Disadvantage was just the perennial issue that you don't always have fast enough or clear enough communication to know what everyone else is working on at any given time.",
    "Scheduling meeting times was difficult.Learning from others experiences was interesting."

    "Make sure to pay attention to how available the client will be, when applying to projects.",
    "You get what you put into it. If the client is not responsive, you can still have a worthwhile experience if you explore avenues of interest to you."
