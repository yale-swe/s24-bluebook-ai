    "Math 112 is difficult if you haven't taken calc before, but is survivable if you have a friend in it with you. Try to get Prof Lachowska because she's awesome.",
    "Yes it's an easy QR credit and you should learn calculus at some point.",
    "A class for pinning down your understanding of calculus; I took the class after taking and forgetting most of Calc AB in junior year of high school; the class was not difficult at all if you attend lectures and do the homework; tests are fair. Overall was satisfied with what I got out of this class.",
    "Basic calculus class. Nothing special, but very doable.",
    "basic calculus",
    "A good intro calculus class to take. Anna Lachowska is a good professor. The exams were a lot harder than I was prepared for.",
    "I took it as a prerequisite, it is no fun but also made interesting by some real-life applications, and my particular instructor was very kind.",
    "Dude, if you want a relatively chill math course. Do it.",
    "I would recommend it if it is a necessary requirement for a major of interest. The midterms\/tests are hit or miss on difficulty level. Not everything can be explained in class, so seek help out of the classroom when uncertain about things."
