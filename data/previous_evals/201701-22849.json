    "I gained a medium amount of insight into Israeli politics, history, and demography. At the same time, I was able to practice my Hebrew, so it was a good combination.",
    "Advanced hebrew communication and writing skills.",
    "I increased my vocabulary and general knowledge base with regard to politics in Israel. It was a fantastic course to learn about different societal dynamics in Israel as applied to different sectors of society.",
    "I developed my hebrew substantially and my proficiency in the language. I think specifically in reading and writing, I improved a lot.",
    "My knowledge of both spoken and written hebrew was greatly enhanced by this course. The topics provided me with insights on Israeli society and culture, and teh discussions were always interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course felt a little light on backgroundarticles and discussions did not break down a lot of the basis for what we learned about Israeli history, culture, etc. The course also was not the most helpful for greatly improving one's Hebrew. Strengths-wise, it was a great way to practice Hebrew and make small improvements while learning more about Israel through many topics.",
    "This course was a great overview of Isreali politics and culture and was useful for learning vocabulary related to those topics. It also exposed me to Israeli news and sociological studies which were very useful.",
    "I liked how we read articles each week and discussed them as part of the class. I also liked how we enhanced the class with short and long videos on various topics. I think the course could be further improved by more short videos with Hebrew subtitles, which allow students the opportunity to work on their Hebrew listening and reading skills while still having a short enough clip that they take the time to look up words they don't know.",
    "I think the course is very strong and really allows you to engage with multiple topics in different ways, i.e. through films, articles, presentations, etc. I never felt bored or like the work was repetitive.",
    "The strengths of this course are in Dina's flexibility, her willingness to modify the course based on student requests\/interests, and the overall structure of the course. The weekly assignment to enter words on a google doc, and then to formulate sentences using those words in class, was very helpful. The only change I would make is that I did not find Hebrew tables to add anything, and I did not find that they helped increase my knowledge of the language."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course if you want a way to practice Hebrew without too much work or stress, which is a lot of what I wanted. However, especially because the class is pretty laid back, if you're really interested in learning a lot about each topic or making strong improvements in your Hebrew, you'll have to do that more on your own.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "I would recommend this class - it is very fun and relaxed, and you learn a lot about many different aspects of Israeli culture, immigration, and politics that is not really highlighted in other courses but actually is key in truly understanding some of the internal issues and politics that Israelis encounter. It's a great way to learn new and interesting material.",
    "Absolutely. Dina is a gem of a professor The class content is really fascinating, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Hebrew and Israeli society.",
    "I think it was interesting course in subject matter and taught in a really productive way for my learning.",
    "I would STRONGLY recommend this course to another student!! Dina is great, always willing to help, and the content is fascinating. If you are interested in taking hebrew, this class is definitely worth it!"
