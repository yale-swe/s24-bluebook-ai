    "Ray made this class incredibly engaging and fun. Each week, he selected fascinating manuscripts for us to look at which was a great opportunity. The classroom environment was positive and very friendly. Both Ray and Diane were accessible to students and happy to help in any way that they could, both in-class and out of class. The class, at times, felt quite disorganized and the term project was assigned incredibly late in the semester for its difficulty. Further, the research project seemed very disjointed from the rest of the class and had nothing to do with paleography which was unfortunate.",
    "I really enjoyed classes. I liked how many significant documents from the Yale collection were brought into class for us to look at. One weakness was that it was not always clear what reading or document we should work on for each class.",
    "Excellent class discussions and group work. Lots of independent reading but manageable workload. Very few weaknesses of the course, excellent guest lecturers and brilliant teachers."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in classics or medieval studies. Ray and Diane were welcoming and warm from day one and I always felt free to go to them ask questions. Looking back, it would have been nice to have smaller assignments to turn in so that we could better showcase the work that we were doing from week to week. But going around and reading out our transcriptions gave each student accountability. I was pleasantly surprised by the supportive atmosphere by both my professors and fellow students. The final project was a little ambiguous depending on what your assignment was, but again the professors were understanding. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "If you're passionate about Latin or medieval history, this is a great course to take.",
    "This is the class to take if you have any interest in Latin, Paleography or even just in being in the Beinecke and looking at old manuscripts. The teachers are so involved and knowledgeable, classes are enjoyable, every week there were new manuscripts and hands to study and the guest lecturers complemented the class very well. Would thoroughly recommend!"
