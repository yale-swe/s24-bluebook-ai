    "I LOVED this course! Definitely a \"must-take\" at YSPH if you have any interest in global health or NCDs. Dr. Hawley is in incredible and the workload of the course is manageable. I really looked forward to coming to class. Being able to work with partners in Samoa and create actual deliverables was a highlight. My one suggestion - rather than having the final paper crammed into the end of the semester, could it be spread out more? For example, background due month 1, current intervention strategies month 2, proposed intervention strategy month 3, final draft due at the end of the semester?",
    "This was a great course! The material is interesting and Nicky taught it all so well. I actually liked the reading responses because they made me do the reading and really engage with it. However, I didn't think it was necessary to list both three questions and three things I didn't understand. I sometimes found myself reaching to come up with questions or concepts I didn't understand, especially because Nicky did such a good job of choosing straightforward, understandable readings. I think the same goal could be accomplished by having us write a total of three questions and\/or things we didn't understand, as opposed to six total. Group projects can be frustrating in any class, but I do think this class would not be as good without the group project. It would be interesting to be able to focus on any LMIC instead of every group focusing on Samoa.",
    "I would be helpful if assignments were placed on Canvas and graded on Canvas so that we know how we are doing in the class.",
    "This course is amazing. This course is definitely one of my top 3 classes at Yale. This class gave me perspective, solutions and a lot of questions about how we approach non-communicable diseases in high, middle and low-income countries. The greatest strength of the class is the in-depth discussion on real world occurrences on non-communicable diseases. This was further improved by the fact that Professor Hawley gave us feedback on her work in Samoa, and this made us realize how important the course material we were learning was. We were learning about obesity and referencing this knowledge with her work in Samoa for example.",
    "Amazing course that covers an important and overlooked topic.",
    "Great overview of NCDs that provided a holistic global viewpoint. Strengths: learned to assess varying dimensions of NCD issues, including individual-level and socioeconomic factors; learned how to analyze global issues with a broad framework. Weaknesses: reading responses were not that helpful--I think structuring the class as a more round-table seminar would have been more useful",
    "Great course! Very interactive and engaging! I love the humanity of public health that this course reinforces.",
    "Professor Hawley does an amazing job tailoring the course to match student interests and expectations. The guest speakers she brought in supplemented her lectures very well. The weekly readings were very interesting and the lectures were very engaging.",
    "The biggest take-away I got from this class is to see a set of health problems, and instantly consider multiple perspectives on how the issue will affect different people within a population and who the stakeholders are. The course has also allowed me to critically think of different interventions at the prevention, treatment, and palliative care level, while understanding the trade-offs of implementing one over the other. Further, being able to produce a deliverable that could be used in Samoa for our group project, was one of the most gratifying assignments I have participated in at YSPH. In the future, it would be very interesting to compare different interventions for chronic conditions from an economic and policy perspective.",
    "Summaries were a kind of lot every week.",
    "Great course for discussion and global health!"

    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0The best professor I have had at YSPH! Brilliant, kind, understanding, and really cares about her work and her students. I could not endorse her more highly.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Nicky is one of the best professors I have ever had. Her passion for her work comes through in every lecture. She is funny and relatable and took a lot of time to provide feedback on all of our big assignments. She's wonderful!",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Looking for her weakness is close to impossible. In my opinion, her work and teaching style are almost flawless. She is very engaging, on both academic and personal level. She's willing to put in extra hours to make sure everyone understands the course content and is on the same page. She draws her learning material from other faculty and professionals through the guest lectures we had. We had a couple of international guest speakers, which for an international student proved pivotal. She has so much energy and passion for the works she's teaching and doing.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Dr. Hawley could not be a more supportive and engaging instructor. She has a unique talent for getting students excited about group projects and term papers, by allowing for flexibility and creativity.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Dr. Hawley was absolutely wonderful, has the best sense of fashion and style, and always made light of the 'technology' difficulties. I appreciated her connections to incredible speakers and her ability to capture such a broad area of study into a semester.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Absolutely amazing! She knows the material very well and is also a great instructor! Shes always willing and able to make time to meet and provide feedback. She seems to be very invested in her students and her research.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Very engaging lecturer, very personable, and very passionate about the topic and the success of her students.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Dr. Hawley is the greatest and was always very engaging. Students can tell that she was invested in her students' overall success, inside and outside of the classroom. She was always very helpful when we had class questions and even takes the time to support us in our independent research.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Shes amazing. Just a tad bit too focused on Samoa, understandably, but you learn so much"

   "comments": [
    "Take it! There's one two-hour session each week, where Dr. Hawley will lecture or a guest speaker will visit, mixed with discussion and activities. Each week there are 3-5 readings and a short reading summary that you submit via email. There's one manageable (and super cool) group project, and a 15-page paper due at the end of the semester.",
    "Global NCDs is a great class! Nicky is easily one of the best professors at YSPH. Assignments include weekly readings and responses, a group project, and a final paper. A little bit work heavy but 100% worth it and a great class for GHC and non GHC students alike.",
    "Overall, an amazing course. I would recommend this course to anyone, it will enhance your perception of non-communicable diseases around the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students, and I think it should be a required component for the Global Health Concentration rather than just an elective.",
    "Great overview of NCDs taught by an absolutely wonderful professor. The course does not go too much into details\/epidemiology of NCDs, but focuses on the larger themes. Wonderful mixture of disciplines in the class that really added to the discussion",
    "This course is a comprehensive overview of several NCDs through a global lense. The readings and the lectures are very engaging. Dr. Hawley is highly invested in her students and wants you to succeed. I highly recommend this course!",
    "Essential for anyone interested in Global Health, specifically if you are interested in NCDs or Maternal and Child Health.",
    "I would (and have already) DEFINITELY recommend this course to other students. Especially as it becomes more clear that chronic diseases are significant burdens in low and middle income countries, I think it is important for global health, policy, and EMD students to engage with this material.",
    "Would recommend!"
