    "Analytic philosophy. Presentation skills. Long essay writing.",
    "Learned a good deal about the history of mathematical philosophy, the logical systems at the foundations of mathematics, and the modern approaches to the discipline.",
    "We learned to analyze the foundation of mathematics from a philosophical standpoint. A historical survey of philosophers' \/ mathematicians' attempts to explain mathematical certainty (necessity, universality, and \"a prioriness.\"",
    "I read many papers in analytic philosophy related to the metaphysics and epistemology of mathematics.",
    "Overview of all the major schools of thought relating to philosophy of math--Platonism, intuitionism, formalism, fictionalism, and so on. You might lose all hope in abstract truths though.",
    "In this class I gained a sense of the discussions going on in the philosophy of mathematics.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of the history of the nature of mathematical thought. I also improved my ability to read and write about complex philosophical topics.",
    "I discovered a whole new field of knowledge that covers mathematics and philosophy. I learnt about some of the most interesting discoveries that have been made in the history of mathematics. I developed my skills in analyzing philosophical texts and critically thinking about them. I learnt how to better write philosophy papers. I learnt how to compare different philosophical views on a same topic."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful discussions, short weekly readings so you can really go in-depth with all of them and understand them rather than skim through everything, weekly reading response facilitates more people doing readings and better discussion. Student presentations sometimes take up a lot of time and it would be nice to spend more time discussing material",
    "Surprisingly I wish there were more writing assignments because I feel I have a lot to learn from Professor Shin! She is an unmissable instructor and the reading list was well crafted and accessible! A great survey of mathematical philosophy.",
    "The readings were always well chosen, if a bit dense, but the subject matter was made as engaging as it could be. The majority of class sessions had students presenting on the week's material, which was fine but often led to confusion on some of the more involved topics.",
    "This seminar is very organized. All the readings are very interesting and not too much (average of 40 pages a week).",
    "Discussion questions before each class.",
    "Interesting material! It really grows on you.",
    "No improvement needed.",
    "A major strength of the class is the high level of interaction between the students as the structure of the course facilitates discussion.",
    "strengths: very interesting discussion in seminars, professor moderated the discussion well, not too much reading, weekly reading responses very helpful in order to ensure that all student do the reading, paper presentations very helpful to ensure that students start thinking about their final paper topics in advance and not write them last minute."

    "This seminar was the most I have learned in a seminar (but not the most time I've spent working on class-related work). The Professor is very deliberate about structuring class to maximize learning in the time you have, and that makes me really motivated to complete all of the readings and assignments to the best of my ability. You also get frequent feedback on your reading responses. I would recommend wholeheartedly, and Professor Shin is one of the most enlightening professors I've had the privilege of learning from. Weaknesses, if any, are that a lot of time is spent on student presentations, which can be less interesting than discussions -- but at least with this style, people actually know what they're talking about when discussions happen, and discussions aren't spent arguing points nobody understands.",
    "Completely! You cannot miss working with Professor Shin who is brilliant and engaging!",
    "Highly. It was not a huge amount of work but the work done was quite rewarding. I would recommend keeping the paper topic in mind early on.",
    "YES. This course is super interesting and accessible to people with all levels of philosophical \/ mathematical background.",
    "If you are interested in Mathematics or Philosophy this course will definitely expand your understanding and perspective with regards to these fields.",
    "Yes, though you'll probably know if you're into this sort of class or not.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any philosophy student who is a little sick of the (inherent) inconclusiveness of topics such as ethics.",
    "For anyone interested in philosophy or math, this is a very cool, engaging and worthwhile course to take.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the philosophy of mathematics; the class is eye-opening. Some topics might be hard to understand for students who have no background in set theory."
