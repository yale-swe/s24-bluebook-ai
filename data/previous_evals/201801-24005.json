    "I really wish that not every single one of the speakers was research-based.",
    "Should not make it mandatory. Some of the topics and presenters were just plain boring and uninteresting. And plus, there was not always enough food. Also, not any vegan\/vegetarian options. And they used the tiny plastic water bottles that you finish in a sip and are so bad for the environment. YSPH should really practice what they preach in terms of sustainable and environmental-friendly food options.",
    "Some great seminars - I really liked meeting the faculty candidates and having the chance to go out to lunch with them afterwards.",
    "Try to have weekly speakers throughout the semester.",
    "One of the best courses at YSPH",
    "It was alright. Bring in practicioners though. too research heavy. got boring.",
    "Strengths: - Many lecturers with diverse research topics came to discuss their work, which was exciting and helped me to learn about many new topics that I wouldn't otherwise have encountered. Weaknesses: - I think the course could benefit from having other types of lecturers that are in other fields of work come to present (i.e., not just research)",
    "I wish we had more space for conversation! And I also wish there were more opportunities to get to know the SBS students.",
    "The talks were very engaging this year! A few nore non-sandwich lunches would be nice",
    "The seminar was mostly used as a time for presentations, which is helpful and fun, but doesn't encourage SBS bonding, or conversations with faculty. I hope next year it can be re-vamped to include more activities for the department.",
    "I really enjoyed how this seminar had a social justice and health equity theme.",
    "The speakers were interesting, but it would be more interesting to bring speakers from a wider range of topics. Maybe ask students (via survey or poll) what types of talks they are interested in hearing, and try to tailor the talks to more student interests. Also, it would be useful to provide enough lunch and quality lunch options for all students after the seminar, and potentially hold the seminars in another room that would allow students to eat during the seminar (many times there are other courses and events that started immediately after the seminar and it was difficult to get lunch after the talk).",
    "There wasn't enough food sometimes. I would go to the lectures, stay the whole time, and the sandwiches or lunch offerings would be gone. It was sad when you expect food but would leave hungry (perhaps because students from other departments sometimes sneak in before, or enough isn't ordered).",
    "Great seminar, would have also enjoyed a more variety of speakers, perhaps some public health practice professionals and not just those working in academia.",
    "I enjoyed the content discussed and professionals that discussed their career work this semester! The timing was convenient for me based on my course and work schedule and the fact that lunch was included was definitely a plus!",
    "A strength of the SBS seminar is that it allowed students to meet and hear from professionals in the real world who are practicing public health research on SBS topics. A weakness of this seminar is not being somewhat sensitive to individuals who have differing viewpoints than the lecturers. One seminar in particular that discussed gay bath houses in California seemed inappropriate to discuss in such a casual manner, and the lecturer almost normalized these bath houses. I understand that as public health professionals we are trying to be open and focus on health issues without any judgment. I just wonder, though, if morals are ever allowed to be discussed. It sometimes is disappointing that they are not.",
    "Great way to learn about research and\/or work opportunities in SBS."

    "N\/A -- required for the department.",
    "I would recommend this course as it did a good job of exposing us to different health inequalities that exists, and what is being done to address these issues.",
    "This class is required, and most of the speakers were interesting!",
    "Great opportunity to learn about the vast amount of research being conducted across the country\/ world in our field or related fields.",
    "The variety of topics gave me great perspective on the vast reach of public health and it's practice!"
