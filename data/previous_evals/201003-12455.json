    "TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH.",
    "Definitely recommend it.Christine Hayes is a wonderful teacher who will give you a fantastic introduction that will equip with the concepts and critical approaches to the Bible to give you a very good foundation in biblical scholarship to build off of for future studies.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, it's one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Hayes is phenomenal. There's a fair amount of work because you have to watch the lectures on oyc before class in addition to doing all the reading, but this allows you to have great class discussion with Professor Hayes rather than having section with a TA. The tests are extremely fair and not very difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class unequivocally.",
    "one of the best classes i've taken at yale by far. christine hayes is the perfect yale professor- brilliant, accessible, gives a wonderful lecture and leads great discussions. she really gets to know every student, and is one of the foremost scholars in this field. she truly makes this a very special course that i would highly recommend to anyone. it does take a ton of time- watching the lectures in addition to going to class means it's like a 5 hour a week commitment of just \"class\" time. but there's not a lot of reading and it's definitely worth it.",
    "Good course. Not too much work.",
    "Take this class!!! Seriously. Take it. Professor Hayes is amazing, the material is amazing, this class will make you go \"wow\" every time you leave it, do a reading, or watch a lecture.",
    "It is a super intro to the Old Testament that incorporates a little history, many different methods of critically analyzing the bible and a lot of fun. You'll love Christine Hayes. She's super smart, fashionable, cool, and she brings candy and sweets for Halloween and \"Holiday\" (Christmas? Hannukah?). It can be hard to keep up with the readings, which get really long in the middle of the semester - especially since you want to read it all slowly and analyze it all, not to mention reading the notes in the margins of the JPS bible. Some parts of the bible you'll read with a view to the historicity, which is fascinating given the Ancient Near East parallels to the flood story, the creation, etc. Other parts you'll read literarily, which is really fascinating: David and Bathsheba, the golden calf, the expulsion of Ishmael, etc. I loved the lit parts.This is an intro class, but Prof. Hayes does a good job of covering a lot of ground while also going in-depth about some stuff so you don't feel like you learned not enough about everything.",
    "Intro to the Old Testament\/Hebrew Bible is a great course - I'd definitely recommend it to any student wanting to know more about the Bible. The course is very comprehensive, covering everything from modes and methods of scholarship on the Hebrew Bible to the actual content of the Bible itself. Professor Hayes is a GREAT professor - - so knowledgeable, very understanding, and extremely articulate. She's very attentive to student questions and work and gives great feedback. And the workload isn't too bad - - though you do have to watch 2 online 45 minute lectures outside of class every week, it comes out to your benefit - - you're tested basically exclusively on that material and the lectures\/lecture transcripts are very useful in giving you a better understanding of what you're reading and discussing in class.",
    "Overall an incredible class, one of my favorites at Yale. Amazing professor - Hayes is accessible, friendly, knows everything but isn't intimidating. It was a lot of work because you have to watch the lectures outside of class, but it was totally worth it to learn as much as you did!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone. There is a lot of reading, since the Old Testament is long. However, you probably can skim a lot of it. But the reading is all interesting, and I loved the class sessions. I look at everything from a new angle now--you'd be amazed at how many people misquote the Bible!",
    "This class left me wanting to take many more RLST classes. It's fantastic, and I highly recommend it. Professor Hayes will blow your mind with the sheer quantity of knowledge that resides in her head, and she is always available to answer questions that come up from the reading\/lectures. I would advise that this class is significantly more work-heavy than many other seminars, because in addition to the reading, there is an online lecture that accompanies each class - and when the lecture is online, you feel more compelled to hear every word, so it takes much longer than fifty minutes to watch\/annotate. That said, you learn a lot as a result - but I did sometimes have to let my reading dropped by the wayside, which was a pity.",
    "This class is worth every minute you will spend on it... and that's a lot of minutes. If you're serious about taking this class, find a JPS translation of the Bible online, and read, say, Genesis 22. If you're ready and interested enough to read sixty such chapters a week, plus online lectures and secondary source readings, then take this class. The class is wonderful, but make sure you're interested enough before committing to the class.",
    "Professor Hayes is wonderful. I came into the course with little background in the Bible and learned a ton."
