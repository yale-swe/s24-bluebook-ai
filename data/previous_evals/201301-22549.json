    "Yes. The material is very interesting and it is enjoyable speaking with Professor Marinov.",
    "Great higher level class, not too work intensive, but definitely a lot of reading. Half the class this year were graduate students, and their perspective was interesting to listen to. Overall, take this class if you are interested in global affairs or international institutions.",
    "Yes, I would. Prof Marinov is a great Professor and the class was a good way to get the theoretical background related to international institutions."
