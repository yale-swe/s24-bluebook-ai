    "PS 633 is an extremely valuable class in which you will learn to think better about the debates around liberty that are central to contemporary politics. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This class would be a perfect small graduate seminar, but even as a joint grad\/undergrad class, it's well worth taking. The course seems to be motivated by Professor Garsten's intuition that economic intersections with canonical conceptions of liberty are under appreciated and after taking the course, I think his intuition is spot on. Recommended without reservations!"

   "comments": [
    "This course contributed directly to my research and should be very helpful to my dissertation.",
    "For me, excellent seminars are marked by their ability to induce students to spend the entire two hours thinking critically. This course did that. It was an incredibly rich block of \"thinking time\" each week and for that reason it contributed greatly to my thinking about my own work (related and unrelated to the course's themes)."
