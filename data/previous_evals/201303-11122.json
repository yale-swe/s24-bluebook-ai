    "One of my favorite courses at Yale. Korie is terrific, but like the other creative writing courses I've taken, the classmates made the experience. I certainly improved and gained skills that will be applied elsewhere (working on teams, for example). The final show was wonderful conclusion.",
    "YES! If you like any form of writing then lyric writing will appeal to you. You will learn a lot. Depending on your writing style, this class could be simple or stressful. Michael will rip your songs to shreds though so be prepared. \"This sucks\" is not a phrase that he is afraid of.",
    "This is a phenomenal class on how to write lyrics for musical theater. Having never taken a creative writing or other creative course at Yale, this was a challenge for me. But a challenge I came to love. You write a song almost every week, and by the end of the semester are focusing on collaborating with a composer to write a song together, revising it each week. It's an exciting and fun process, and Michael Korie is a phenomenal instructor for such a task. From comedy songs to \"I want\" songs to rock songs, Korie leads you along very well. It's fun!I recommend this class to anyone interested in musical theater. It's helpful to be familiar with the form and with the canon, as Korie will often reference songs from Broadway shows. That doesn't mean a casual fan couldn't do well in this course, but if you don't know musical theater at all you might find it difficult to know what he means sometimes.",
    "I think it was an interesting experience. I had no experience in this realm at all. While it was incredibly hard at first and took up a lot of my time, eventually I became much better at it, and the course took up significantly less of my time.",
    "I really great introduction to the craft of lyric writing, with one of the best musical theatre lyricists in the business. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in learning how to write lyrics, especially if you have absolutely no background in it. The more experienced writer will find ways to keep themselves challenged, but this is definitely geared towards the less-experienced."
