   "comments": [
    "Overall, a good class. You'll cover early music history from Greek antiquity to the late Renaissance. Wright picks some interesting additional readings and assignments (transcribing medieval neume notation into modern notation) and the final project is tailored towards your specific interest and instrument (standard paper, composition, or performance). Wright's idiosyncrasies are well-known but as a teacher he's organized and conveys the material in a straight-forward uncomplicated way. I enjoyed this class and am looking forward to the other classes in the history sequence.",
    "A great introduction to Medieval and Renaissance music! I now feel much more equipped to talk about and listen to music from the period, which I have gained an appreciation for during the semester. This class has many treats in store, such as seeing original chansonniers and Gregorian chant books in the Beinecke and hearing early music performed, sometimes on early musical instruments!",
    "Early Music is fascinating-- it is like entering an entirely different world. If you allow yourself to fall in love with it, you'll love the class. Professor Wright is very methodical; the path to doing well is very straightforward.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to take for fun\/interest. It's arequirement for the music major, and I think it's important that music majors learn about early music. I just wish this course were better taught and more serious. The weekly assignments are easy and the tests are mostly rote memorization, so as long as a decent amount of time is put in before the midterm and final it's a pretty easy class. Craig Wright presents the material as though he were speaking to uninterested 7th graders, and as a result anybody who was initially interested loses interest very quickly.",
    "The main problem with Music 350, I think, is that it's embroiled in a kind of self-destructive cycle: people only take the class because it's a requirement for the music major, so they're not invested in the class, so it gets poor reviews, so people only take the class because it's a requirement for the major. It's a lot of really fascinating material, but somehow it seems to be set into a \"not-very-good-class\" mindset. Take the class if you have to, but consider taking it even if you just want to learn more about Renaissance music. It's not bad; you just have to know what to expect.",
    "You have to take this if youre a music major, so take it.",
    "They can make you take it, but they can't make you like it. Don't come quietly--keep yourself engaged by resisting as they brutally drag you through the endless trivia of 1000 years of musical history.",
    "I loved this class, the professor, and the material. If you are interested in this period, take the class!",
    "Take if you have to... Not the most interesting class ever, but manageable workload.",
    "Music 350 is the study of the history of the Western music of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. If you are a music major, you have to take it!",
    "The required early music history course. Won't ever be as good as Music 352, but that would be asking a lot.",
    "Not as bad as the previous evaluations said it was. There were massive study guides for the midterm and the final exams. Pay attention and learn as you go along. Otherwise you will be totally overwhelmed. Don't be fooled.",
    "So bad in so many ways. This is the reason I almost wasn't a music major, and my cynicism was justified in every way. Fuck this class.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. That said, you can't approach this class with a negative attitude because of all the other reviews. You will be much more miserable if you try to find things to hate. My advice would be to just treat it as a light course with an easy workload that you can split with a friend. The lectures are useless and a complete waste of time but you have to attend them because there's an attendance grade. You have to study your butt off for the midterms and final. DON'T SPLIT THE STUDY GUIDES, DO IT YOURSELF and you'll be fine.",
    "Overall, this is not the horrible course that everyone says it is. I won't say it is the most exciting, but it is actually pretty interesting if you put in the effort to learn something about the material. You end up learning about the time period as a whole and about the historical fundaments of Western music. Another music history course (treating a later period) might be even more fascinating, however.Most likely, you are a music major and need to knock this requirement out of the way."
