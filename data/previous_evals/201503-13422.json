   "comments": [
    "This class covers a bunch of really interesting topics in the history and culture of Classical Athens. We ask a lot of good questions about our sources and their biases, and how we can restore the voices of the non-free, male, citizen elite who wrote our sources. Emily Greenwood is brilliant and you will learn a lot and come out with a much better competence with the Classical Greek world.",
    "Most people who take this class (like myself) do it because it is required for the CLSS or CLCV major. Regardless, I found it helpful as a comprehensive overview of Athenian culture and the classical period. I'd characterize it as a soft history course that does not emphasize timelines or details, which makes it nice when learning the overall themes and tropes. Professor Greenwood is a great lecturer and is wonderful to talk to. I think 256 and 257 do an exceptional job and giving students an overview of classical history.",
    "Absolutely would recommend, even to non-Classics majors. It's a fantastic course, that really leads you through looking at Athens through a great variety of perspectives, traditional and non-traditional. Weekly readings, 2 papers, and 1 final. Great course.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you want to know more about and really INVESTIGATE Athenian civilization. Emily Greenwood is an incredibly engaging professor who puts a lot of effort into reading your papers and giving you feedback. Save all of the handouts and read through them in your own time, they're fascinating! There will be no better class to show you why classics matters here in the here and now, and to dispel the myth that classics is only a dead white man's discipline.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student for the workload is not to hard, yet you cover an enormous amount of Athenian history, culture, and literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about Athens from a variety of different viewpoints and writers.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a very interesting class that has a lot to offer. It allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of a culture that has proven to be a symbol for other societies.",
    "I highly recommend it to everyone, whether as part of a Classics major or for a Humanities credit, or even just as a class to enjoy some interesting history and literature.",
    "Great class that acquaints one with Athenian culture at a surveying glance. Professor Greenwood tends to talk like how one would expect a leading Classics scholar to talk, so he may go over your head at times. But the TF and classmates help a lot in bringing things down to an understandable level and Professor Greenwood is always happy to clarify in lecture if you ask.",
    "This is an excellent history survey with a cutting-edge approach to the study of the ancient world. So many of the voices that are often shouted down amidst the stories of democracy and Western culture - including those of women, foreigners, and slaves - are here elevated alongside a narrative of Athens as a society grappling with its identity in other areas such as art, war, and oratory. The class examines the perspectives and identities influencing ancient sources themselves, as well as those of subsequent interpreters. Overall, a very thorough course with a good balance between essentials (for those who are newcomers) and depth (for anyone with familiarity). Professor Greenwood is a great instructor and clearly cares about her students.",
    "This class is a really different take on ancient history than anything you might expect; it is creative and engaging and exciting and really leaves you feeling like you have learned something: both about the ancient world and about how to think philosophically about history (and this wasn't just abstract--you really begin to get a sense of how integrating perspectives from literature and sociology and theory can change the way you are reading and writing). Also, Professor Greenwood is unbelievable. She is a wonderful teacher; she is a wonderful reader of students' work, and everything that is distinctive about her way of teaching the classics (especially her insistence on making people do the work of building a personal and thoughtful relationship to material that can otherwise feel arcane and alienating) shines through so so so so so powerfully in this class. Take! If a major, you have to. If note a major, still take!",
    "A course centered on ancient athens, using athens as a pivot point to reflect on a whole repertoire of concepts and conceptual problems, providing an excellent primer for any kind of social and cultural criticism.",
    "Yes! Excellent material well presented by an available Professor. If my mind ever wandered in lecture I always immediately felt I'd missed something of value. Loved lectures.",
    "This course was frustrating at times but was mostly satisfying. I often left class feeling like I wasn't sure I had learned anything; it was a firehose of information which wasn't given quite enough context to be captured by someone without a substantial grounding in Athenian history. A lot of time was devoted to problematizing different interpretations, which was good training in being skeptical while reading modern scholarship, but it contributed to the feeling that I didn't walk out with any concrete information gained."
