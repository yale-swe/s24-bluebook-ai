   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you want to know about Cocteau or are feeling like a barbarian for not having watched any Welles before, take this. Professor knows a lot, and you can learn a lot too, if you make an effort.",
    "I think this class was most valuable because it helped me cultivate my sensibility. It teaches you how to be attentive, how to notice things, and how to express your reactions to a work of art. This is why I would recommend the class to other students.",
    "Yes!",
    "Good class, take it if older films interest you",
    "A great introduction to studying film. A nice balance between film theory and closer analysis of film...if you are interested in deeper philosophical questions about film and other art forms (primarily literature, painting, and theater) then you will love the class discussions. The first half of the semester is spent on Orson Welles, but more variety comes up later in the syllabus. Our section was great, and Professor Andrew is very friendly and approachable. He is the type of person who will casually mention that he brought something in to show the class and then it will end up being a handwritten letter written to him by Orson Welles himself! A solid class.",
    "Very fun course because you get to talk about whatever interests you as long as it's related to the very general term.. art. Which is awesome, because everyday we talked about cool ideas in art, and read some really, really excellent essays and watched some really, really excellent movies. Bazin is an incredible writer and as far as the essays go, I never wanted to miss a single one. You get assigned to biographies, it's a lot of reading and I didn't really see the point, seeing as I couldn't remember any of the facts anyways.In this class you get to talk about crazy hypothetical ideas about the very ontology of photography and how different art mediums can and should be adapted and I've learned to be much more attentive when watching films.Biggest Weakness is it's structure. The class is very unstructured.We would basically go in, and the professor would kind of say... so what do you wanna talk about? I thought this was cool, but can see how that would be frustrating to a lot of people. The writing prompts are very very general and rambly, which basically means you get to write about whatever you want. It's a writing credit with little writing."
