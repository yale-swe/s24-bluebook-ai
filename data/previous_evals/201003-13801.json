    "The fact that Brennan can be down to earth and try to understand architecture within the context of the world-- what are it's contributions, it's limits, it's doing today-- is a plus. Especially because the things we pursue in studio seems pointless and does not relate to anything in the real world. It gives us confidence that our instructor deals with the real world everyday.The students are already stressed out. I think some instructors stress them out more by telling them to take things seriously. I'm glad that Brennan is wise enough to understand that this studio is only a beginning of a long process, and that it's pointless to be burnt out or be too intense. People will take things seriously once they find what they are passionate about. No point is grilling that in- eg. M.Young.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Ben is a sharp critic that did an excellent job of motivaitng us to work hard without explicitely requesting that we work hard. Our studio was definitely one of the hardest working ones, but it was a subconscious drive, and really a sign of our respect for Ben.It would have been helpful and interesting to shake up the pace a bit with some more pin-ups or some group desk crits so that we could receive and give criticisms to our peers (helping our ability to do both) and also to learn about our peers' projects. it also might have helped us to hone in on our presentation skiills.Ben's accessibility was exceptional. He encourated email correspondence and offered many valuable thoughts by email between class sessions. Even if Ben had other things going on--which, presumably he did--there was never any inidcation that any priority was more critical than his work at the studio. His committment to Yale is admirable.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I think that what I thought my professor was trying to get me to accomplish forced me to be a better student and designer. Unfortunately, I wish that he had pushed me harder when I may not have been understanding what he wanted--when he was obviously thinking something about my project that he wasn't saying. Our time is precious first semester. If I am missing the point, just say, \"Youare missing the point.\" If you value work on the computer more, just say that you want everyone to have a computer model.I think that unlike the other professors, who could care less about the prompt, Ben was glued to it because he was the coordinator. Our goals were more generic than other studios where the professor picked the parts of the prompt that spoke to them and created a new framework for the quick projects. I was always trying to digest everything, Ben should not be afraid to really define aspects of the project for his students.Overall, Ben was a really good critic for my first semester.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I thought Ben Pell was a fantastic critic. He and I often saw eye to eye on where my projects needed to go. When I experienced difficulties he was great about helping me work through them. It was also very helpful having him for studio since he\u0092s the coordinator and could clearly convey his expectations. I appreciated that he was flexible with his schedule and made sure to give everyone a good deal of personal attention.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Great studio atmosphere. Ben offered a goof balance between criticism and letting the student take risks.",
    "Instructor: Brennan Buck \u00a0Brennan was a responsive and helpful critic who would often listen to our suggestions and give extra lectures or advice as needed.",
    "Instructor: Brennan Buck \u00a0Brennan was the chillest of the critics. By this I mean he let you do what you were going to do. He didn't force ideas onto you, but encouraged the path you chose for yourself and helped you mold that idea into a stronger argument. He also didn't burden us with work that we couldn't possibly execute and do well simultaneously. For example, we would do 3 study models while an adjacent studio would do 6. It is because of this that I wasn't overly stressed like people in those studios, and I think it would be safe to say that everyone in my section agrees on this point.Sometimes, though, it would have been nice if Brennan was more animated. He has a somewhat stoic demeanor, and occasionally it would be difficult to gage his opinion on a matter. Brennan has a good eye for design, so it would be more useful to get his candid perspective as opposed to having to extract it more slowly.Overall I was very pleased with Brennan and I think he will only grow as an instructor. I look forward to taking his Viz 4 class in the summer.",
    "Instructor: Brennan Buck \u00a0I often wished that Brennan was more specific with his criticism. Questions were often met with more questions rather than answers on his behalf. While I understand that this was done in order to encourage exploration, a simple answer as to what was working and what wasn't often would have been appreciated. I did enjoy all of the precedents he referred us to, and his breadth of knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0Incredibly helpful, available and supportive.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0Eeva is great at creating morale, motivation, and pushing people to develop their ideas without a strong agenda from herself.She could be more demanding and specific about her requirements.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0Eeva is an exceptional teacher who encourages the student to explore their own ideas and design process. I feel fortunate to have had her as a critic.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0Eeva is empathic and insightful, a fantastic critic. One criticism is that although it is great that she trusts each student to a degree to determine their own process, for some students in the first semester a bit more structure in terms of process might be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0Eeva-Liisa is the best teacher that I have had in architecture. She internalizes your project and directs you at your own pace to complete it. She puts a lot of effort in getting to know each student. She is aware of each student's strengths and weaknesses. She instills in her students a sensitivity to scale and the usability of our designs. I believe that I will keep Evva's teachings with me as I continue architecture.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer was overall an effective critic in which she did not impose a certain style of process of thinking. She was very good in encouraging exploration and discovery on our own. However, this came at the expense of a clear direction. While this may seem contradictory, it is merely meant to express the fact that her criticisms and suggestions often come off cryptic and nebulous. Often times, myself and others are left guessing what she meant and what to do next.I musthowever commend her for pushing me in directions I myself would not have ventured myself, often ending up in a better direction and a better project.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer was generally helpful and always available but was not good at listening to our ideas as students. Often she would grow impatient and not let us express ourselves verbally - it felt as if her ideas were being projected onto our work, instead of her helping us express our own ideas through our designs. Her advice and feedback was often abstract and vague, making design progresshard.That said, towards the end of the semester as she got to know each of us better, she got better at working with us as individuals.It would be helpful if, from the beginning of the semester, she gave her students very concrete examples of what buildings, architects, materials, books, etc to be looking at for precedents. I think the study of precedents is a very helpful way to feel grounded as a first year architecture student, and a larger emphasis on that, both in the studio as a whole and from each individual critic, would be very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer led a good section. She struck an appropriate balance between stressing the conceptual development ofa project during its initial stages, then transitioning to push the articulation of a design as the review approached.Conversations in desk crits were enlightening; Jennifer's advice was helpful and often insightful. Pinups were useful exercises which demanded a modicum of resolution or productive development, but often ran long, sometimes beyond what was necessary or useful. If these conversations could have been shorter and the comments sharper and more incisive, then pinups would have been as useful as desk crits.In some circumstances, I feel that Jennifer could have been more forthright with her opinions. Sometimes dead-end ideas, ill-concieved partis, or overwrought designs were not sufficiently challenged. If Jennifer could have been more direct and plainspoken in her criticism, unproductive trajectories might have been altered.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Section critic was great at offering different methods of exploration from initial concept. Difficult to understand at times but on the whole, great for first year.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer has an exceptional knowledge of the subject matter and frequently pointed the group to relevant precedent.In our one-on-one interactions, Jennifer seemed to have a difficult time providing direct criticism. I often came away from those meetings confused about her opinion of the work. In written communication, Jennifer was more incisive and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0This course was largely successful. Jennifer was always very supportive of each students own personal interests, and allowed them to explore and develop unique arguments, theories, and styles, with eagerness and positive questioning. The result was a highly dynamic studio in which no two projects seemed alike, except in the rigor of their process. Jennifer is exceptionally versed inarchitectural theory, as well as contemporary and historical precedents, as a result, always lead compelling and fruitful desk critiques, and discussions. The topics and issues that were brought up were relevant and thought provoking. On top of this, she exhibited a very high level of dedication to our studio, often staying many extra hours to ensure everyone had a chance to speak with her. The studio as a whole fed off of the enthusiasm and openness that Jennifer brought to the table.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0I enjoyed having Jennifer as my first semester studio critic. Out of all the critics, she seemed to be among the most open to different directions, which I appreciated. The ability to adapt to whatever approach a student might take, then work with the student to enhance that process is, to me, the most important quality for a critic to have. She allowed a great deal of freedom during the design process, but also required sound reasoning and a solid basis for decisions made, which made sure that nothing was ever done without thoroughly questioning the value of that approach versus any other. Her method of questioning the things which we had taken for granted often revealed interesting possibilities which added to our discussions and strengthened my thought process. Jennifer seemed especially focused on identifying bad habits, and if we had them, finding ways to force us to deal with or confront those weaknesses, rather than working around them. I think this last thing was the most valuable.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce was an excellent studio critic, constantly pushing me to explore new ideas and new techniques. She made herself available for any queries or concerns and was eager to help, being supportive and approachable throughout the course of the semester. Although i understand her reluctance to offer specific design guidance, at certain points in the semester -for example, immediately prior to a final review - a more focused and direct guidance would have been beneficial.Of particular concern was the studio workload. Although the constant pressure to complete large amounts of work in a short period of time encouraged rapid production and efficient patterns of working, it left little worryingly little time for experimentation. The pressure to have enormous amounts of work ready for pin-ups, desk crits etc. does not foster a culture of experimentation, and does not allow for trial and error. While we all have pre-established patterns of working and are capable of producing work of a high standard -that is presumably why we were accepted - I chose to come to Yale in order to take full advantage of the resources available to me in order to push myself beyond the standard i am currently capable of, and to experiment with new ideas and new techniques. In my opinion, the current studio culture does not do enough to promote this.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The critic would have been more helpful had she given more concrete advice. Many sessions left me more confused rather than clearing up design issues. I appreciated that she encouraged the exploration of certain concepts, but more direct instruction would have been beneficial.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce was a great studio professor, I found her interesting, and inspiring and I appreciated the work that she put into the studio. It was clear throughout the course of the semester that Joyce was committed to our group and she would often stay far later than 7 or 8pm on studio days to make sure that every student was satisfied with her feedback. Often, Joyce would come inon off days and even weekends when we asked and was always available remotely via email. Her deep pool of knowledge and intense interest in architecture was a great source of motivation- she was always engaged.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce was very encouraging but also critical. She promoted our own explorations while not dictating direction, and encouraged us to look at different representation styles. She was a really great studio critic to have as a first semester graduate student.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0She was very receptive and approachable. She gave us a lot of flexibility and encouraged us to explore our own interests. Her critique was always thoughtful and relevant to our interests. She encouraged everyone to have clear and strong ideas and to explore those ideas fully.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce was a pleasure to work with. She was particularly skilled in motivating students and keeping them productive throughout the semester. The diversity of student work in her section was also very refreshing. Joyce was willing to engage a topic from a variety of perspectives without prejudices or preconceptions. In the future, it would be helpful if she could provide more clear and direct criticism to students.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce was an extraordinarily committed instructor, who took sincere interest in each student's work, and often spent time after class and outside of class to speak with us. My criticism is that it was often difficult to understand or interpret her desk crits.",
    "Instructor: Michael Young \u00a0Michael was a fabulous critic. Could not ask for more. He is great.",
    "Instructor: Michael Young \u00a0As a first semester studio critic, Michael Young's performance was excellent. He continuously pushed the studio to explore beyond the normal boundaries of design with all three projects. He particularly pushed me to not settle for the conventional architectural solution, but instead to question what might be conceived as the \u0093norm\u0094. His breadth of knowledge was insightful and encouraging throughout the entire semester; I found his knowledge of contemporary practices and technologies particularly helpful. I likewise appreciated the effort that he made to develop camaraderie amongst the members of our studio section; this helped to establish a productive and collaborative studio environment. His advice and criticism was helpful, but not always clear. I appreciated his visible excitement for all of our projects, but sometimes I felt as though this enthusiasm distracted him from the main point he intended to make. Regardless, I hope that he teaches at Yale again in the future, as he would make a valuable addition to the faculty and development of the curriculum at the school.",
    "Instructor: Michael Young \u00a0Michael Yong is an excellent educator. He was aware of my strengths and weaknesses and encouraged me to develop and challenge those strengths and weaknesses through the studio projects.He pushed me to explore my design process without imposing himself. Though this is admirable, at times I wished he displayed a bit more of his own process or was more prescriptive about his approach to a give design problem. This would have been beneficial to me at moments throughout the semester.In general it was more helpful to meet individually or in small groups with Michael than as whole studio pinups.I feel lucky to have had Michael as my first semester studio critic and strongly recommend that he be invited back to Yale and made a permanent fixture.",
    "Instructor: Michael Young \u00a0I think Micheal is a wonderful critic and I have shown that in my ratings so I am not going to go on and on about how awesome he is in this section. He is a very articulate person when talking about architecture as a subject in general, yet sometimes when it comes to giving critique to specific design iterations, he can be quite ambiguous. This may not be a bad thing for those who camein with design background, but I have observed frustration among those who is in design studio for the first time in their life and desperately seeking concrete feedback.",
    "Instructor: Michael Young \u00a0Michael Young was a phenomenal teacher who encouraged individual development of each of his students as designers and their separate interests. His plethora of knowledge made it possible for him to engage all of our diverse ideas and designs and aid us with precedents and theories which have come before.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Great professor, very encouraging. Though he might have too much on his plate, often seem tired. Slightly vague in providing suggestions, could be more direct in communicating to students. Rely too heavily on pin-ups, Sunil is most effective and personable in individual desk-crits.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Sunil was great. He had a good ability to recognize the strengths and weaknesses in a project and suggested the best way to proceed. He encouraged us to produce a lot of study models, which served as the best way for me to represent my ideas. Discovering the best way to explore design is an invaluable lesson, and Sunil helped me to that.He really took the time to get to know my projects, understand them, and had a lot of knowledge on how to work with initial inspirations, often suggesting particular projects as precedents, which was further educational.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Sunil was wonderful about encouraging us all to find our own problem within the assignment that we wanted to tackle. Despite having to miss a couple of studio days for travel he made himself available via email which was greatly appreciated and very helpful. There were times when I believe he could have been more assertive. I know that some people took advantage of his relaxed nature and did not fully complete the smaller assignment he had for us over the week. Overall, I very much respect him and I am grateful for the semester.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Sunil Bald was an excellent guide during my first semester in architecture school. He provided valuable feedback and encouraged the studio to think about architecture hollistically rather than through architecture's constituent components such as form, function, or concept.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Sunil was a very insightful critic. Working with him was both a pleasure and very motivating. I appreciated the particular agendas he encouraged through generative assignments. His criticisms were helpful in pushing me to develop my ideas further and produce projects that were outside of my comfort zone. At times, I found some of his comments unclear. In these situations I found it helpful to have him re-state his criticisms, so that a misunderstanding of the initial language used would not inhibit my comprehension. Sunil's leadership of our studio led to a very collaborative spirit amongst our fellow classmates."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I am very pleased with the work i have produced, and have have become comfortable with a number of new tools and techniques for designing - one of my major goals of the first semester studio. As I have already mentioned, i feel there could have been a push for more experimentation.",
    "As someone without an architecture background, I expected to become relatively comfortable with the design process and with representation. The fast pace and of the course and the extensive requirements of final reviews left me privileging quantity over quality at times. I feel like representation suffered because I could not follow through completely with drawings.",
    "I expected to learn the basics of architecture convention. I learned a great deal, but there was no real direction or help in learning the basic tools of architectural representation.",
    "There is a major issue with the overall order of the studio projects. For someone who has never had an architecture studio before, it's confusing to have tectonics as the first project-- not because it's difficult to do that particular project, but it's difficult to do the next to projects in the same mind set. Imagine to think that you need to design a component piece that fits together to design a huge multiplex. It's daunting. And once that idea of tectonics is out there, you can't tell them to forget it. To take a couple of weeks thinking about the piece that makes a whole is too much, when there are tons of other more important ideas out there that we should be learning in studio.Start from big to small. There is a reason why people think that way. Because the big is more important than the small. In fact without having the perspective of the big, you can't really design the small.I recommend that the critics stop poisoning newbies minds with such a wasteful ideas. Just because it's the first thing taught, it becomes a foundational subject when it's not- it's a mental block.",
    "I wish studio had more focus on the practicality of buildings and less on the theory. Of course the idea of the building is important, but the fact that Bob Stern seemed to be the only professor who cared whether or not a building worked was unsettling.",
    "Yes, I think I was able to produce good work with the help of Brennan. The work load was perfect, the pace was a little fast, but it forces you to adapt and become a stronger and more efficient student and designer.",
    "Very difficult, very challenging and rewarding.",
    "I expected to learn the basics of design in the first semester of my first design studio. I learned that basics go far beyond what I thought they were and I was able to use fundamentals towards an overall theoretical approach. Sunil was a proponent of various forms and techniques of model-making. Without the inclusion of these methods I would never have tried them out or appreciated their inherent value.",
    "I didn't really know what to expect but I was happy with the experience.",
    "Coming from an architecture undergraduate program, I was expecting more interesting design prompts from a first semester studio. All three of the assigned projects were similar to assignments that were posed in my undergraduate education. While I appreciate the intention to \u0093build up\u0094 program through the three projects, I think that the second project presented enough challenge to deserve more time for the development of ideas. I think that the first project was successful in the various ways that it questioned the basic formation of space. However, it might then have been interesting for each student to develop a specific program for that space; in a sense, letting us design unique programs for our individual spaces.",
    "I'm not sure how much I learned rather than just produced this semester. While I picked up alot of technical skills that I didn't have before, I'm not sure what was gained in the big picture.",
    "As a design studio, I expected it to be intensive and I was certainly not disappointed in that regard. In terms of what I got out of it, I believe I am ultimately a little better of a designer out of it, though this is difficult to qualify let alone quantify.",
    "My expectations for the studio were definitely met. I improved my presentation skills, and was able to fly through projects. I think that my section leader would tell you I fell back on my skills from undergrad in order to get through the quick projects, which is a downside to the quick projects. I really think that you could lose the second one. It is too big of a challenge for 5,6, or 7 weeks. We had 3, which is crazy. If you want us to push ourselves, we need a little breathing room. 3 projects is a lot of work.",
    "My expectations were for a class in which I would develop my design sensibilities with help from a critic. In general, the things I learned the most about were modes of representation and techniques for model building. This was very helpful, but I don't feel as if my designs developed as much as I wanted them to, in part because the feedback from Jennifer was often obtuse and abstract and unclear.",
    "To learn how to use new computer softwares and school equipment. To develop better model-making, drawing and presentation skills. To learn how to develop a good concept and how to explore an idea in depth. The studio allowed me to do all of these things. I enjoyed the second and third projects better than the first one. It was more useful to be dealing with real site issues than those of an abstract site.",
    "I was a student with no architectural background coming into the program. Studio was extremely challenging. I think I will better be able to evaluate it given more time and more experience in the field.",
    "I knew that the studio would require a great deal of work. I was not surprised by the demands of the studio, but was slightly disappointed that I did not get to devote as much time as I would have liked to the work given the demands of all the other courses. I was surprised, however, the rapid pace of the projects. While the final project was a good length, I felt the first two could have used just a little more time, which could have been taken away from the last project.",
    "First semester studio fails to acknowledge the diverse backgrounds of the students. Some find it too familiar and some too hard. The intensity is acceptable until the four other classes are factored in. Some critics are also too young and too much indulged in their own generation of design to be guiding through fresh out starters.",
    "The class followed my expectations closely.",
    "I was satisfied with the studio, but very impressed with the ability of other students to help each other.",
    "It is hard to respond to this question as I was new to architecture this past semester and uncommon with the studio routine. However, I expected to work hard and that was surely met. It perhaps even exceeded my expectations.",
    "As this was the first studio, I was unsure what to expect.",
    "My hope for the studio was that it would further me as a designer and as a critical thinker, yet I feared that this first year studio would impose a strong agenda upon the students. My hopes were met and although the first year studio had to bring architecture majors and non-architecture majors on the same page, it did this without imposing limits upon the individual student.",
    "Overall I was happy with the studio assignments, their scale and type. They offered the opportunity to solve three problems in three different ways.I wish the work load for other courses was less in order to devote more time, which was needed, on studio. I believe the students\u0092 final work would have been more developed and better represented if other courses were less demanding.",
    "I did not have any idea what to expect. Studio felt like my home base and Eeva like my biggest advocate.",
    "I expected to create quality design projects and learn new technologies during this studio. I am happy to report that I feel confident in my design projects, in particular the second and third projects. I had hoped to be able to develop my ideas more, however there was not enough time in the tight schedule to generate detail type studies for the projects, although I truly wish I had the time to do so. I also hoped to learn new technologies, and I will say that I feel that the demanding studio schedule limited my ability to do so to some degree. I found myself working hard to keep up with the design demands of the short term projects, in the end compromising my desires to learn new technologies in an effort to reach design resolution on the projects that I could be proud of."

   "comments": [
    "The resources are excellent and far exceeded my expectations. I am also incredibly impressed with the school's maintenance and operation of these resources.",
    "Yes.",
    "excellent facilities. My computer was often too slow however and crashed often.",
    "1.More ram. Please. More ram.2.We don't have a place to pin up. A place where we can just place all of our work so we know where we are at....we need to open the file on the computer and we can't get that same sense....",
    "I would like if digital fabrication and software were more integral to the production process.",
    "it was, although the ability to check out books more easily in the library would be really great.",
    "yes.",
    "Yup",
    "The library hours are very insufficient. They need to be open later at night, the predatory lending policies are inconsistent with that of an academic institution. There needs to be more rooms such as those open only to TAs for students to study and discuss projects. Computers are extremely slow though I was told they are being upgraded, but the speed of the machines made them inadequate for the fulfillment of the work assigned.",
    "The computers and printers are abysmal. They never printed when you needed them to and the computers took forever to log on.",
    "For the most part yes. That said I find the library's one day loan policy does not encourage me to use it. I would love to take books out and have time to really use them but with one day, and the possibility to extend for three total, there is not really enough time to absorb them. Maybe a stronger recall policy would allow for books to be taken out for longer.",
    "Yes.",
    "Unfortunately, the temperature and lighting conditions of the 5th floor studio space were a problem throughout the entire semester. There were burnt out lights that were not replaced for more than half of the semester. Cold air was continually blasted from the air vents, making the studio spaces particularlycold towards the end of the semester. Since we spend so much time in the studio spaces, I expected my numerous complaints to be addressed promptly; unfortunately this was not the case.",
    "Computers are slow and constantly crashing.",
    "The resources available are top-notch. The only reasonable complaint I have to level against the facilities are the abysmal performance of our desktop computers which computers I have owned 4 years ago in my undergrad outperformed the ones at our desks. I understand that this issue is slowly being remedied and I appreciate the efforts of the DM staff in this regard. I am only expressing the same frustration as my fellow classmates to the fact that our computers would often hang or crash at seemingly simple tasks resulting in loss work and unnecessary delays--a loss of time which is perhaps the most precious commodity in design studio.",
    "Yes, and no. I don't think that I had enough time to take advantage of things like fabrication labs, because the projects were so fast and our studio seemed to always be playing catch up. The work space was tight. We could have used community tabletop space and other studios needed pinup space, but I understand why there wasn't room.",
    "Yes, adequate",
    "In general, all the facilities were adequate, but I find the Haas Arts Library inadequate - more often than not when trying to find a specific book it is either not in the catalogue or is lost...",
    "Yes, but I wish the project\/our critics encouraged us to use the fabrication equipment more often.",
    "Resources were adequate.",
    "The single day book circulation policy is stifling. If you do not know exactly what you are looking for, it is difficult to get much out of the library.",
    "The computers made available to students are generally not acceptable. The suite of software installed on them is indeed impressive, but (perhaps because of this), their start-up time is really incredibly slow, and toward the end of the semester, I found myself having to restart the machine at least twice over the course of the day.",
    "I was very much appreciative of having two desks and a computer to work at. That said, while I realize the school has limited resources, I (and others) spent a considerable and frustrating amount of time waiting for the computers to process the work\u0097an issue that has since been solved by way a simple upgrade. All of the laser cutter and other tools were wonderful to have, but the school could provide more information to students about operating them (specific settings, in particular), that instead gets transmitted by word of mouth from student to student.",
    "The digital photography room needs to be maintained better. Library one-day-and-one-book only policy makes reading books a pain in the ass (thank god we have google and wiki). Also, I wish the school had a tougher policy of \"pen down\". As a group we lack the diligence of honoring a deadline in name of \u0093pursuit of perfection\u0094.",
    "The biggest obstacle in the completion of my work for studio was Eisenman's Formal Analysis class, which also meets on Thursdays. Every Thursday I would have to compromise my work for studio because of Formal Analysis.In terms of facilities, the computers ran slowly and often crashed, especially with AutoCAD. I would restart my computer at least once per day in the middle of my work, which would be a 10 to 15 minute setback.I was very frustrated with the scanners in the 6th floor computer lab. The large format scanner is unusable. It cannot scan custom paper sizes without making an error. Even with standard paper sizes, the image comes out streaky (even if the glass is cleaned immediately beforehand). I encountered these problems even with the help of the DM staff.The alternative is to use the flat-bed scanners, and then photoshop the different scans into one image, which takes far more time than architecture students have. Even then, the black smudges on the scanner covers appear on the scanned image, even when additional pieces of paper are placed behind the drawing.I know that many people's productivity was also affected by the erratic temperature controls in the studio. Some people's desks were freezing, some were very hot. The facilities staff was unhelpful in fixing this. Many people were very uncomfortable throughout the semester.",
    "The only complaint I have regards my computer's RAM. I was forced to wait very long periods for simple actions to compute costing me valuable work time. I understand the graphics cards will be updated when we return. Hopefully this clears up this difficulty.",
    "The resources were adequate. My only complaint would be that the computers are incredibly slow on the 5th floor, it was difficult to run more than one program at once and they seem to have a lot of trouble with the adobe suite.",
    "All the resources were above adequate, save for the speed of the computers at our studio desks. If more ram could be added to these computers there would be less crashes and our productivity and efficiency would be much higher.",
    "Resources were always available.",
    "Resources were readily available.",
    "The facilities were excellent. It would be helpful to open up the laser cutters for additional hours in the weeks immediately preceding finals...",
    "Yes.",
    "For the most part, the resources were outstanding."

    "The juries provided at final reviews were always knowledgeable and provided valuable insight into design projects.",
    "everything was helpful.",
    "I found desk-crits and pin-ups to be extremely valuable. However, I would suggest having mixed-studio pin-ups prior to the final reviews of each project, so students have access to a range of perspectives over the course of the semester.",
    "We don't have time to enjoy life. We barely know the city.Please reduce the workload.It might be good to pick a site that is located in the city for the first project- a place that we can walk to- like the empty lot next to the Knights of Columbus Museum that is used for parking currently. It will allow us to explore the city and hopefully can lead to a more enriching personal life by allowing us to appreciate the city we live in.Also, architecture does not need to be soooo abstract. It can be iterpersonal. For example, if the site was someplace we can walk to, re might learn that there is a homeless lady who sleep in the bushes and might make us react to issues that are bigger than just a building.Yes architecture cannot solve the issue like homelessness alone. But no subject can do that alone. I think that's what makes me made when people say that there are things architecture is good at solving and there are things architecture is bad at solving. The truth is no subject can solve wicked problems and that doesn't mean we need to just give up. It means we need to think harder and find beyond our scope and make bridges to other disciplines.Sometimes I feel like architecture professors are just too insecure to allow other disciplines to come in and see what they are studying...Enough...",
    "Desk crits were most helpful. I also appreciated getting to see the work of our critics in their presentations.",
    "desk crits were probably the most helpful, and again, I wish that all aspects focused a bit more on the practicality of buildings. The precedent studies were great, and I wish there were more of that kind of thing.",
    "Our juries were very good. While the feedback was always good in desk crits, I think that the studio time outside of the desk-crit could be used more productively and in a more structured way than just \"work on whatever\" (not that that was ever an explicit instruction, but it is practically what happened). I would like more pin-ups and group dek-crits.",
    "Probably pinups were the least helpful, but it was nice to have them occasionally. Kate was good to have for an optional desk crit, though her landscape approach could sometimes be abrasive and her tone was sometimes attacking.",
    "Most valuable: Desk-Crits. Least Valuable: Excessive number of pin-ups, it took up the entire studio time often necessary to complete the assigned work. Most juries and outside experts were great, though Cate-John Alder does not seem to play a necessary role in the course.",
    "Desk crits in pairs of two proved to be really valuable. Also, the mock presentation pin-ups were also really helpful because they pinpointed moments of weakness in a presentation.An aspect that proved to be a hinderance to the studio was the lack of space for pinning up, talking as a group and\/or meeting one-on-one.",
    "All pretty useful.",
    "I think that desk-crits alone or in groups was most helpful. I did like doing the group pinups to see what people were working on but I didn't think they needed to be so often (ie every week). I wish we had had more class discussions where we could have talked about the issues raised about the projects but detached from our own assignments. I also would have liked was more precedent studies perhaps as part of the first two assignments as well. I know there were precedents listed but I found that dividing up the precedents and then presenting them was really helpful.",
    "Spending time as a class building site models was a waste of time. The site models shoudl be re-used each year for the Tobacco Warehouse project.",
    "I think that desk crits and pin ups were certainly the most helpful throughout the semester. It would be beneficial to receive casual commentary from some of the other studio critics outside of final\/mid reviews. It was particularly helpful to learn about each critics\u0092 outside work and interestes.",
    "I would have liked to have more conversations with other critics for a different point of view. Perhaps one desk-crit a week with a different critic? Many interesting things were said by other critics in reviews, and I would have like to expand on those ideas.I liked the presentations made by the other critics about their outside work. I did not learn anything of value from Kate John Alder.I also liked the precedent studies we did before the third project, but it also felt too rushed.",
    "The most valuable aspect of studio was probably desk-crits and guest juries for final review. I found the intermim pinups to be unproductive for the most part as it often involved us just sitting there listening to other people's reviews. While the intent is for fellow students to be involved in the process of another's work and offer criticism and suggestions, this often did not happen. Colleague opinion often came out during day-to-day studio work, and subjecting each other to one another's pin up was ultimately a waste of time and a bore. This may purely be due to the lack of engagement in my section or the instructor not spurring up enough group discussion, but I generally found desk crits to offer much more helpful criticism and a much better back-and-forth discourse with the instructor to progress a project.I appreciate the generally exceptional guest critics that are brought on to our reviews.",
    "Pin-ups seemed very valuable because we rarely did them. Desk crits were helpful, of course, but I wished thatI was getting independent advice and not the same advice of my neighbor (as was often the case)--why say the same thing to all of us individually when you can say it at a group pin up? Class discussions were often irrelevant because they were just individual issues voiced publicly. Juries were the best part, and the outside experts were top notch.",
    "Desk-crits and small group pin ups were great. Pin ups on Mondays were the best, as opposed to Thursdays.",
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was the discussions with my studio-mates - we helped each other develop our ideas throughout the semester when we weren't getting clear-enough direction from our critic. Desk-crits were also very valuable, because it was easier to have a good conversation with Jennifer.Also, the seminars on different softwares and production techniques were very helpful.",
    "Pin-ups and desk-crits were the most valuable. The juries were the least valuable. The juries were not always well-balanced and while some people got 4 outside jurors on their review, other's got 1 or 2.",
    "Good balance of pinups, desk crits, and juries. Did not find too much value in the precedent study.",
    "The least valuable aspect of studio was whole studio pinups. They are sometimes beneficial, but individual meetings are better.",
    "Desk crits and pin-ups were, not surprisingly, extremely valuable. I would have liked to have seen even more pin-ups in our studio to get a sense of what other students were working as well as forcing us to produce presentation material instead of waiting until the last minute. That said, I know it\u0092s a fine line between working on graphics for pin-ups or pushing the ideas further for an individual desk crit, but I still feel as thought we might have benefitted from a few more pin-ups. Pin-upsare also a great way for students to provide one another with their own critiques, which may be different than that of the critic. I found the juries\/reviews helpful, but it was difficult to maintain interest and focus while watching everyone else\u0092s. The lectures I was a bit indifferent to because while its nice to know that our professors are actively practicing, the material or presentation often failed to make it relevant.",
    "I am happy to see some great guest cirits in our reviews. I also like the end of review discussion we get to throw out all our commlaints over wine and cheese. I think open communication is the key and it is handeled very well this semester.",
    "Desk crits were the most helpful, because they allowed for the most thorough discussion of my work. The mid-review for the last project was the least helpful. The schedule which we were given for the last project committed most of the first half of the project to research and conceptdevelopment. We had very little time to develop the scheme which we presented at the mid-review. The review then focused on this scheme, which to me was not helpful in the overall development of the project.",
    "Watching reviews is a lot more useful than it was in undergrad.",
    "The most valuable aspect for me was group reviews. I learned the most when I was presenting my progress to the other classmates in my studio with Sunil present to give feedback. The most frustrating aspect of the studio is that sometimes the exercises do not feed into the final projects smoothly. The exercises in themselves seem valuable but when they do not support the final project directly they can seem tedious.",
    "The most valuable aspects of the studio were my classmates, and the discussions we had about each others projects. I feel that this was facilitated well by my studio critic, who suggested which other students might have strengths or skills that I was lacking and could learn from.",
    "Pin-ups within the smaller studio sections were incredibly helpful as both the professor and your peers are acquainted with you and your project and can aid you in your design struggles most aptly.The integrations of a Landscape expert into the projects was a great idea, yet the feedback was very specific and outside of the scope of the 3 to 6 week projects.",
    "Students were encouraged to offer criticism to each other during pin-ups which I believe was a good opportunity not only for the student presenting but also for the student criticizing. However, desk-crits were always a better way to communicate ideas with Ben Pell.",
    "All aspects are very valuable and contribute to the studio very well, nothing seems particularly lacking in value. Group pinups with conversation between students do not occur often between different studios and might be helpful to have more often. Desk crits or other feedback with other critics besides the primary critic might be a nice addition to the semester.",
    "The most valuable aspect of studio was studio pin-ups. They allowed for open discussion about the student projects without the formal nature of a jury. But the juries were incredible. The least valuable aspect was the class discussions.",
    "I found the pin-ups led by Sunil with my studio very useful. It was nice to have a forum to receive feedback from all my classmates.I also had positive experiences with all juries held for the projects.I had wished to have more opportunities to interface with the landscape consultant, Kate John-Alder, however the time she had available was very limited and she was in high demand.I found the quick pace of the three design project sequence very demanding and the quality of the results achieved similar to my experiences in undergrad. At graduate school, I had hoped to develop my projects with more depth, however the quick pace did not allow for it. My main criticism in this respect is regarding the first project. For those of us with design backgrounds in particular, the first project was an odd experience. I believe that the ideas explored in this project (tectonics, threshold, interiority\/exteriority) could be integrated into the second project. Having only two projects for the semester (Socrates Sculpture Park and DUMBO) would allow for the creation of better final representations, greater depth of research and development, and more technological experimentation in the process."
