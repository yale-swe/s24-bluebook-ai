    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to!!! One of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. Annoying pointless problem sets, a multiple choice midterm, and long, brutal powerpoint lectures. Seriously, don't.",

    "The course gives an overview of air pollution control technologies. It doesn't really require too much math."
