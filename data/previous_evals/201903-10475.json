    "I learned so much about viscoelasticity, fluid mechanics, and all sorts of other mechanical processes as they relate to my field of study.",
    "Some Matlab, cell deformation mechanics, fluid mechanics, polymer mechanics",
    "This class combines a lot of different areas including biomechanics (obviously), thermo, statistical mechanics, fluids, static, etc. Basically everything lol and it's all condensed into one semester. It moves kinda quickly but you do get a lot of exposure to all these areas",
    "Over the course of the semester, we covered lots of different topics, ranging from viscoelasticity to polymer mechanics. It was really cool to be exposed to such a wide array of topics that are really relevant to the BME field. However, we were only able to briefly touch upon some of the main ideas of each topic, and didn't dive as deeply as Professor Murrell wanted.",
    "Some base knowledge about the mechanics of cells and biological materials.",
    "I learned about kinematics and statistical mechanics. I also learned more about modeling in MATLAB.",
    "I learned basic and general knowledge about biomechanics across a wide variety of topics.",
    "This course taught me how to look at biological materials as physical objects that undergo deformations and changes in the microscale during different processes and that these changes in physical properties dictate the biological changes seen.",
    "I got a basic introduction to biomechanics (thermo, fluids, kinetics, viscoelesaticity, etc), but my actual understanding of the material is definitely limited. The lack of a textbook or section made it difficult for me to follow along and understand",
    "I learned about the behavior of elastic, viscous, and viscoelastic materials in the context of biological systems.",
    "Basic biomech principles",
    "Statistical and continuum mechanics, fluid flow, viscoelasticity, thermodynamics, polymer models",
    "Basics of mechanics, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics, as well as an introduction to linear algebra (although this will have to be mastered on your own time, as not much time is spent on this in lecture). Increased familiarity with MATLAB.",
    "I gained knowledge of complex biophysical and biomechanical systems through computational simulations and calculations. Additionally, the course deepened my understanding of advanced mathematics as they are applied to physical phenomena.",
    "I learned to complete extremely difficult problems in biomechanics through the very difficult problem sets, which also required significant effort and learning outside of the classroom to fill in gaps left by the lectures."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were definitely the postdocs and all the knowledge they brought to this course. I also think the homeworks were challenging enough to be helpful for me to try and understand the material a bit better. One of the weaknesses was the shear difficulty of the class. I felt that most of the proofs in this class went right over my head. Further, the midterm was simply ridiculous - the average was like a 52% so clearly the material was a bit too difficult to grasp. I will say that the second half of the class was better and more tangible to grasp. Another weakness was the fact that there was only one TA so there was only one office hour a week to work on the PSET. I could never go to postdoc or professor office hours because they were held at the same time every week so anyone with a class at that time could never go. If I were to compare this with my introductory physics class where there were 4 hours of office hours per day (2hr from the professor and 2 from TA), and the PSETs were at the same level as this class, it is clear that more TAs need to be on staff to assist with this material.",
    "Strengths- the daily quizzes were fair and really kept me on top of things. Professor Murrell is funny and keeps your attention. Weaknesses- the first half of the course was much harder than the second, so I would try to find a way to balance out the difficulty. Though Professor Murrell and postdocs\/TAs were very accommodating, their schedule and office hours did not fit many of the students' well so it was sometimes difficult to get quality in-person help. The homeworks were interesting, but sometimes did not relate to what we learned in class so we had to struggle through them.",
    "Murrell is interesting when he lectures however the p-sets in this course were very unnecessary. Many of them involved Matlab which was both tedious and also not tested on during the exams. I wish more of the assignments focused on the math behind some of the concepts because it would've better prepared me for the exams. The course could also benefit from some help\/tutoring sessions like other courses do because some concepts were pretty abstract and it was sometimes hard to find enough clear info online Also a nice plus is that Murrell occasionally brought us donuts and coffee! Though a small act of kindness, I appreciated this a lot as it's often hard to be focused during a 9am!",
    "Given how breadth of the material covered and its really intensive nature, I thought that this course was fairly well done. Professor Murrell truly goes out of his way to make the class more accessible, whether it be attaching two post-docs from his lab to the course (who were super helpful and amazing) to holding office hours everyday of the review week. This was really helpful since some of the material covered in class was just incredibly difficult. One aspect that the class could be improved is the TA. This year the TA was Sorosh, and he left quite an impression. He was difficult to reach (only half a singular office hour once per week) and usually unhelpful, if not occasionally downright misleading during the times you could reach him. Furthermore, as the one responsible for grading, he gave us no feedback on our PSETS or exams other than subtracting points, frequently without any comment or explanation. The course overall was good, but having a good TA who a), is passionate about the subject, and b), passionate about teaching undergraduates and c), who has a better understanding of the students, is a must for future iterations of this class.",
    "The strengths in this course are in (a) the problem sets, (b) the postdocs, and (c) the content. I felt like the problem sets were fair; I enjoyed doing them, they taught me how to use the equations we derived in class, and the TA's would provide hints to anything that was unreasonable (i.e. sent out canvas announcements. I hope they modify the psets based on what students had trouble with). The frequency of problem sets was also fine. Murrell's postdocs, Pasha and Vikrant, are two wonderful, sweet, intelligent people! I cannot emphasize how much I love these two people. Their lecture styles were great when they did lecture (not too often) and I felt comfortable approaching them for advice. I liked the content in general. It was one of the only classes that I stayed engaged in throughout lecture (I think partly because I was ferociously scribbling notes!). The quizzes in the first half of the semester were generally difficult (partly because everyone was very confused about the material), but the second half was reasonable and I think fairly rewarded students who come to class. Murrell often brings in donuts to class, which is really nice of him! I appreciate this gesture a lot. The weaknesses in this course were the following: (a) Content. I didn't feel like we went super in depth into any concepts except kinematics. I wish that these covered similar content to the corresponding mechanical engineering classes. For example, I felt like in statistical mechanics we glossed over a couple of essential concepts but didn't learn them enough in depth to be useful to me in the future. I know Navier-Stokes can be much more difficult and I would have liked to go further in depth. It was kind of like a sampler to different concepts vs. more in-depth. (b) Lecture style. I'm not sure what it is about Murrell's lecture style, but I would get very, very lost in the first half of the course. It was only when Vikrant re-taught the material that I understood anything about kinematics - after that, kinematics became much, much easier. Perhaps just overemphasizing what each variable means and how it relates back to the previous unit (like the F matrix is the same as the F in the conservation equations?!?) would be helpful. Posting the lecture notes afterwards was awesome - I often referred to those as WELL as my own notes. If Murrell posted supplementary material, I would read that. (c) Exams. The first exam's average was 55% or something of the like. That is absurd and demeaning to me. In no other class that I've taken has the midterm average been that low. In addition, I think the formatting of this exam was highly unfair (picking multiple options for each MC) and there should be more emphasis on short-answer questions - we are engineers! we like math and proofs! and if we learn anything in the class, we should be able to apply our math and proofs! The final seemed a little extraneous - I wish it had more accurately represented the overall material instead of focusing on memorizing one proof we did on a homework. (d) Murrell's empathy. I like him as a person a lot, and I've had good discussions with him. He's incredibly intelligent. I just think that he lacks empathy for his students. He told us that our final would take us around an hour, and no one got up to go until two and a half hours into the exam - this kind of signals that he's out of touch with how fast we can comprehend and reiterate the material. I've been to his office hours, and he will be typing on his computer when you ask him questions instead of being fully present for you. I think he does try to create positive experiences for students; I wish he would work on the little things more instead of grander gestures like bringing us food. I think a section would really help this class - they had one last year and I'm not sure why there isn't one this year. If Murrell could use TA's that aren't in his lab this could provide different teaching approaches.",
    "The course is difficult but rewarding. The lectures were clear and homework expanded on material talked about in class.",
    "I really liked the teacher, but I felt as though there were not enough resources for the class, especially considering how long some of the homework assignments would take. Only having 1 office hour per week to get help with the homework assignments was definitely not enough. In addition, I sometimes felt like if I went to office hours, I would not even really get that much help answering a question. I understand that it is important to push students to finding the solutions on their own, but sometimes I truly felt like I had absolutely zero idea how to solve a problem. In addition, there was no textbook or online way to get help in the class. One time, the teacher sent out a PDF about what we were learning about, and I found that extremely helpful. A textbook or online links to more resources would definitely help in the future.",
    "Clarity on what was being asked for on problem sets is the only thing in my opinion. All of the MATLAB exercises were really cool and fun. Good practice for any engineering student.",
    "The course is strong in that it is really rigorous and really forces you to engage with the material to get the most out of it. Professor Murrell, the postdocs, and the TF all form a strong supportive network that is there to explain things and help with understanding the material as long as you are proactive about seeking help. The course also helps strengthen the bond between fellow students, as without collaborating with each other on problem sets it is very difficult to think of the solutions to the complex homework questions designed to deepen your understanding. This course could be improved if",
    "I do think the material is very interesting. I think more applications could help with understanding the material and putting it in perspective. A textbook and section would help immensely with my understanding. Sometimes the classroom environment felt very uncomfortable and tense. Homeworks we got back didnt say what we did wrong and answer keys didnt fully explain steps either",
    "One strength of the course were the post docs that sometimes would give lectures. They had a really good way of explaining complicated material to the class. The main weakness of the course was its over all structure. I think the professor didnt have intentions of making the course unreasonably hard but the systems (or lack there of) put in place made it so. I think the biggest weakness was that there werent enough TAs. We had post docs but they did not help with the homework which was a large part of the class. We had only one TA which put a lot of pressure on him to manage all the students and for the students to feel like they had enough help and support. Another weakness was that it often was hard to understand the connection between class material and the assignments we were give as well as the exams. Often I would find myself flipping through notes to try and answer a question and realize I hadnt been given the tools to actually answer it. I think a really simple fix for this is for lectures to have an aspect were we solve a problem on the problem set or the professor is intentional about telling us what problems this information will be useful for",
    "Strengths- The course got much better in the last few weeks, as the biological applications were interesting. The free responses on the tests were very fair. The postdocs are helpful and kind. Professor Murrell is very passionate about research in the field. Daily quizzes force you to stay on top of the material. there are lots of opportunities for extra credit. Weaknesses- I've never taken a STEM class in which it is so difficult to get help. Office \"hour\" (not hours) are incredibly limited and at inconvenient times, and Professor Murrell repeatedly refused student requests for peer tutors. Psets are often riddled with typos that make them unnecessarily challenging, and also often require knowledge of concepts or methods not covered in class. Feedback is limited and unhelpful- points are usually taken off without indication of what your mistakes were, and it took multiple student requests to even get them returned once graded. There is also a very adversarial atmosphere between professor and students that is not conducive to learning. This is aided by unfunny jokes aimed at individual students in class on occasion as well as comments to individual students in office hours about the rest of the class being entitled and not worthy of the professor's respect. Improvements: Offering more office hours\/ section\/having a peer tutor, particularly options in the evening that are more accessible to athletes and people who work in labs. Integrating the biological applications throughout the course rather than saving them all for the end, as these are the most interesting part. Proofreading psets and quizzes to ensure teaching staff know what is on them and they reflect what was covered in class and do not have errors",
    "I just wish the course was more designed to student learning. We hardly went over clear examples in class, so I felt as if I was learning the material for the first time while doing the problem set. Vikrant was WONDERFUL",
    "This course was great at improving our MATLAB skills on problem sets. That's about it for strengths unfortunately. I wanted this class to be better because we covered some really interesting concepts. The sheer amount of content meant there wasn't really time to properly teach any one topic. We would move on before to another unit before anyone felt comfortable with the previous material. There was a lack of office hours to get help with the concepts and some serious pushback from Professor Murrell when people asked for more resources for the class like a peer tutor or more homework help. We practically all failed the midterm exam, and then had to fight for Professor Murrell to rectify a mistake in the multiple choice section. A problem set based course like this could use more TF office hours for the students, a peer tutor, and more examples done in class. It could also use lectures, problem sets, and exams which line up with each other in terms of content covered and timing. Lastly, the amount of mistakes in problem sets and daily quizzes was pretty alarming. We would have quiz questions with no correct answer and problem sets that referenced given code that hadn't been given. This class really needs some sort of organizational overhaul to ensure these mistakes don't happen so frequently.",
    "This course covers a LOT of material, so you get a broad spectrum of new concepts. This leaves you with an impression of what's out there, but not too much detail. There seemed to be a disconnect in communication between the professor, the TF, and the postdocs that were assisting in the course, as no one seemed to be fully aware of what the other groups were doing. This led to frustrating scenarios where quizzes and psets did not reflect the lecture material or came before concepts were introduced, and other scenarios where the people that should be able to help the students didn't seem to know what was expected of us. In particular, the quizzes often did not really reflect the material that was taught previously, rather it reflected the material that was about to be taught, which meant you started nearly every 9:00 am with a 50% quiz score from random guessing. This did seem to get better near the end of the course, but the first ~2\/3 were rough. Better communication would greatly help the organization of this class, as well as perhaps another TF and\/or section. Having a single TF hold a single office hour (not plural) per week meant that many students were unable to ever attend. Lectures were often about derivations of equations, with little to no examples of how to use these equations in a problem, and a section might give the opportunity to explore application more.",
    "The course was extremely challenging, and thus was informative because it required us to dedicate ourselves deeply and thoroughly to the topics in order to understand them. At times, however, I feel it was not emphasized enough the need to do personal research and use other sources for answering questions.",
    "This course was only strong in the fact that its content base was relatively interesting. The instructors also became slightly more helpful near the end of the course, so some improvements were being made. Nearly everything else about the course needed improvements. First of all, the lectures are convoluted and often included many minor errors on the board that added up until certain portions became incomprehensible. The problem sets are often very long, include many typos, and ultimately are so vague that, in order to find solutions, many clarifying questions needed to be asked to the instructors. The review sessions for the exams in this course were relatively useful, but we only realized this after the midterm exam, when the long questions on the exam were just versions of the two problems discussed completed in the review session (literally every other practice problem was useless). There were FIVE review sessions for the final exam alone (one each day of reading period) and most were irrelevant for the exam (too conceptual and broad, until the last two sessions). There was no way for students to know this because communication for the class was dismal. So, many students attended all the sessions and wasted precious studying time. The final exam ended up having long questions straight off the practice problems (for which we received no solutions beforehand), so there were no worked solutions to problems that could even be used to study. Overall, the course was poorly instructed. This was only worsened by the fact that different students in the class would consistently tell the rest of the students about how they heard the instructors discussing how much they disliked the class (for one reason or another). It felt unprofessional and was disappointing."

    "Honestly, only if it is required for your major. Otherwise take a fluids or thermo class.",
    "Recommended for anyone interested in Biomedical engineering. The class is very niche. Since it's much harder starting out, if you can tough out the first half of the course it's not bad. As long as you attend lecture and can focus on what's important, I'd recommend it.",
    "If you're a BME, you pretty much have to take it... I'd rate it pretty neutral compared to the other courses I've taken so far. Not as interesting as physio but way better than Intro to biomedical comp. But the course does get frustrating so heads up",
    "You have to take it, so that's not really an option for you. But I thought it was okay overall (until the final trashed me). This content is going to be hard regardless of who's teaching it, but I think Murrell could do a little bit of a better job. And he does try! A lot of the issues in the class are merely organizational issues, which will be fixed as Murrell gets more experience with the structure of teaching the class. That being said, it's not great being in this position when the rest of your BENG education is dependent on you learning these concepts. Be prepared when you go into the class, and talk to other students about what good strategies are for preparation beforehand. If you want a real, in-depth explanation of these concepts you should take the corresponding MechE core classes instead. If you have TA's that hold section instead of postdocs that hold office hours, GO TO SECTION.",
    "This is definitely a great course if you are interested in mechanics. Professor Murrell genuinely cares about his students.",
    "Only if they need to take it for the major or are very, very interested in the topics and would be willing to maybe take it Credit D fail.",
    "Murrell is a nice guy who cares about passing on knowledge to people.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it gives you a really strong background on the physical principles behind biological phenomenon, like solid deformation, fluid flow, and viscoelasticity. The last few lectures on red blood cells, osmotic pressure, and volume changes in cells are also very interesting to see how these principles can apply to real world examples.",
    "I think it is important information for BME or Mech E majors, but unfortunately the structure of the class wasnt actually successful. I like the class in concept but cant recommend it unless required",
    "Absolutely not in its current form. Based on the last few weeks, I believe this class has the potential to improve and actually be enjoyable and foster learning, but in its current form, it was such a nightmare that it singlehandedly prompted me to meet with my dean about changing my major. (so particularly if you are not BME there is no reason to take this class!)",
    "Its a requirement for BME, not many mechE majors took it as an elective",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I don't think any student should take this course unless they have to for the BME major requirement. It was pretty disheartening to take this class even as a BME student. It made me reconsider whether I really wanted to be in this major.",
    "BMEs have to take it, so not much choice there. If you're no BME, only take this if you're extremely interested in mechanics and derivations of equations. Also strongly consider credit\/D.",
    "It would be difficult to recommend the course without proper topic organization. It was the most difficult course I have ever taken at Yale, and required constant all-nighters each week throughout the schoolyear simply to understand the material.",
    "No, do not take this class if you do not have to. If you are a Biomedical Engineering major and are required to, I am sorry."
