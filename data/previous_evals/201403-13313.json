    "This was a neat course! The opportunity to really interact with materials from the Beinecke is something worth taking advantage of, and I greatly enjoyed doing hands-on assignments and research. You do weekly short assignments with cool old stuff, a short midterm essay, and a longer term paper on a subject of your choice. I would recommend taking this class to anyone with an interest in English history, literature, or simply being around very old, interesting objects.",
    "The Book in Early Modern Britain is a chance to explore the Beinecke's collections with Kathryn James, curator for early modern books and manuscripts, and just on that level it's a fabulous opportunity. As an English seminar, it doesn't quite equal the rigor of other upper-level offerings--writing feedback was infrequent, and class discussions could feel a bit disorganized. But it hardly matters; the skills I learned (paleography, using materials in the reading room, etc) were incredibly valuable, and Kathryn James is a lovely person. If you're interested in the Beinecke and\/or book history, this is the class for you!",
    "I appreciated how this class examined history from a unique angle -- using the process of book and manuscript making and circulation to learn about the English Reformation to the Civil War. It was fun getting to work with the Beinecke's collections each week and the field trips to the Art Center and printing press were a lot of fun.",
    "HIST 217J is a great introduction to material culture in a specific time and location. Without being too much work, you will have the opportunity to explore some of the Beinecke's collections. In addition, you will visit the Bibliographic Press in Sterling and the Yale Center for British Art Special Collections Room. It was a good course, although it could be dull at times.",
    "Absolutely take this course! This class introduced me to an entirely new field of scholarship about which I knew absolutely nothing. It was a fascinating angle into Early Modern English history (which is one of my favorite topics of study), as well as a terrific introduction into the Beinecke and the incredible resources available to undergrads. Some times it felt like seminar discussion lacked structure, but that's just because the class is being taught for the first time probably. The weekly assignments was a bit much along with a good deal of reading, but it was manageable. And the midterm and final papers were really fun to write. Most importantly, Professor James is absolutely wonderful. She is so bursting with love and enthusiasm for the course, that every week was an absolute delight. She also is incredibly excited to help students with research projects and papers. My meetings with her to discuss papers were always extremely productive, and I left the room jittery with how many ideas she had given me.",
    "A really interesting class that provides a great introduction to using the Beinecke. Essays are relatively open-ended, meaning you can approach them with whatever background works for you.",
    "If you want to start getting into the Yale collections and learning how to use amazing resources such as the Beinecke, this is a great way into it. There is a LOT of reading, and it can get a little confusing and boring if you are not a history major and are not familiar with the period. But still, a fascinating class, and getting to look at old manuscripts and books and get a taste of book culture is rewarding.",
    "This is an AMAZING opportunity to work with the Beineckes collections. This is truly once in a lifetime do you know how rare it is that you get to see, touch, feel, close read a different set of medieval manuscripts every week? There is something sacred about encountering an old manuscript. Professor James goes through the trouble of finding amazing texts for every single class and for assignments, ones that I never would (or could) have found myself.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that's interested in English history, or in material culture in general. I came into this class more interested in the latter, and yet I found myself fascinated by the prior as well. While I sometimes found some of the readings a little bit dull, this was one minor drawback of the course: the discussions and the thought processes that developed within this class were of the like that I appreciate the most in Yale's academic environment."
