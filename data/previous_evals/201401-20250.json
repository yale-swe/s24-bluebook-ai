    "MATH 120 is not a hard course, and the materials are pretty useful especially if you are interested in physics or any other science that use physics. You should do practice problems (odd number) before you start the homework problems. This way you can realize your mistake and avoid making big mistakes on the homework.",
    "This class was definitely a challenge, and the exams could be a bit tricky, but I do feel that I learned a lot. The pace was reasonable, and you could probably learn the material just from reading the textbook and doing the PSETs.",
    "Take it as long as you get Micki. I had a graduate student as a teacher last semester and had to drop because the level of instruction was so poor. I couldn't believe a Yale course could be taught at such a disgraceful level.",
    "'Twas quite a good course. I did not think it involved learning many ideas that were truly new compared to Calc BC; rather, you learn how to expand and adapt the basic concepts you learned in earlier calc classes. The homework and exams were all very doable and did not take too much time. I highly recommend Professor Datta as he explains math concepts incredibly well."
