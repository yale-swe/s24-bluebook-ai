    "DS Literature with Peter Hawkins is a class I would strongly recommend. The material covered in the course is interesting. Professor Hawkins leads excellent discussions. He grades fairly. He cares a lot about his students and responds quickly to e-mails.This is a DS class though. Be prepared to do some serious reading.",
    "Well, it's DS. All I can say is do it. And count yourself lucky if you get to do it with Peter Hawkins. He's the best professor in town. Why? I hardly know where to start. But here goes. Luminous intelligence; intimate understanding of character, plot, and theme; radiating enthusiasm for the project of literature; the kind of natural and spontaneous eloquence that one ordinarily believes to have perished with the Romans; the cheeky but controlled sense of humor that comes only from having grown up in New York; above all, intense and unquenchable personal warmth. Professor Hawkins lives and breathes caritas; waking up at nine twice a week to meet with him was a genuine pleasure. I cannot imagine having had a better teacher this term.",
    "Directed Studies Literature aims to read the most important works of literature in Western Civilization from ancient Greece to Dante.Yes absolutely. It was the most incredible class for me this semester. The works we read are beautiful, and the professors are unbeatable.",
    "I would summarize the class as a general survey of ancient Western literature with a brief foray into the Middle Ages, to be followed up by DS 002 in the spring, which covers later works. I would recommend the course because I think the texts studied were both important and interesting, and I thoroughly enjoyed the format of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Directed Studies in general but only to freshman who are willing to work very hard despite initial grade disappointment. Professors like Peter Hawkins make this program worthwhile.",
    "Directed studies is problematic. The literature portion is fun, though.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to the Western Canon, going through works that demonstrate a clear progression and tradition of building upon one another. I highly recommend the class, for not only is the discussion stimulating but the lectures are often times fascinating and inspiring. However, there is a lot of reading and several papers to write.",
    "DS is a really excellent way to read the classics of the Western Tradition. I would recommend it, but with the caveat to be prepared for the amount of work you get yourself into.",
    "While the readings for Lit are probably the most interesting for the majority of DS students, they also can feel the most rushed, especially with some of the larger works like the Aeneid. The readings provide a great survey of Western literature from the ancient Greeks to Dante, and is more in-depth than one might initially think. Obviously, this is not a course to take if you don't like to read and write papers. Professor Hawkins did a solid job considering this was his first year teaching DS; he writes helpful remarks for every paper, and shows respect and consideration for his students. However, his method of assigning an order to people with their hands raised to speak in class can make the conversation somewhat stilted. He is extremely knowledgeable, especially when it comes to the Bible and Dante. In general, DS and the Lit course in particular are fantastic!",
    "As I said in Question One, I think Directed Studies is a wonderful program. It is clear to me that it is not suited to every individual, but those who flourish in a discussion and analysis based environment get a lot out of Directed Studies. This being said, one's enjoyment of Directed Studies is extremely dependent on the section one is in, one's professor, and the level of involvement of the other students. Directed Studies is whatever you make of it. If you love reading the texts, discussing them, pouring your energy into continuing your learning outside the classroom, Directed Studies is an intensive, but worthwhile experience like no other. If you have a tight schedule, numerous other interests, Directed Studies might not be for you. The students and professors that do chose it are some of the most incredible people I have encountered at Yale!",
    "A super-intensive holistic program on the classics intended to build our understanding of western culture. For the ambitious, slightly masochist, super-motivated students who are willing to sacrifice a lot for what is probably the best academic experience Yale has to offer for the Freshman Year.",
    "Definitely take this class. I had never read any of these works before and it was great to be able to read and discuss them with Prof. Hawkins, because I gained a strong sense of appreciation for these works from our discussions. Peter Hawkins is a great discussion leader who carefully mixes in his own comments along with the students' comments. He has a tremendous amount of knowledge about the bible and the Divine Comedy, however he doesn't allow his personal opinions to influence discussion. Prof. Hawkins is a really nice person who always makes time to meet with students individually before papers are due.",
