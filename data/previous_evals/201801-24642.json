    "I learned how to analyze different kinds of statistics and information to understand social, political, and economic trends in Latin America. I also learned some history of Latin America, and context for many events in the past century, which helped give me a deeper understanding of them."

    "The course was too development heavy and could incorporate more security-related issues which are interesting. It covered great insights in the academic field into Latin American institutions and policy.",
    "I would have benefited from more readings on the background of the political climates of Latin American countries, and more lecture time vs. discussion.",
    "Good amount of readings, good readings, good discussion in class, good balance of discussion and lecture in class. I really liked it!",
    "This course draws from very strong literature. However, the literature could be analyzed quicker and to a more profound level in class",
    "The class size and seminar format make it excellent for discussing the readings in a low-pressure environment."

    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it is a great insight into politics of Latin America",
    "Yes, if they are interested in anything related to Latin American politics or current events, they will enjoy learning about how the growth of the region happened and its political history."
