    "If you're into photography and have a DSLR, this is a good class for you. If you haven't really had any experience with it before, you can still take the class, but it's probably not going to be easy. This would be a good class to use a CR\/D in, but it's still a lot of work even so. You do get to learn a ton about photography, both history and technique. The class forces you to get out of your room and walk around, look at things more analytically and critically. You learn to assess light, vantage point, and correctly expose to make photographs. You learn to sort and edit them digitally, and how to make professional looking prints. It's a great class, but not to be taken lightly.",
    "Solid introduction to photography. I learned a ton. I wish the course wasn't so structured right from the start. It took me a while to get used to very demanding and precise assignments. Ka-Man takes her job very seriously and has a very disciplined method of teaching. I did not expect this and it took me a while to get used to, but in the end it made me learn a lot more. If only she would loosen up a little about cell-phone use, it got kind of annoying. But she's got her style. I was amazed that she commuted up to school for every class from New York City and was still never late. Except once. But that was like 50 times fewer times than me. She also put so much time into reviewing each of our photos, it motivated me to put even more into the class. She's a phenomenal teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class if you want to further your interest in photography. It is a great first step and a good way to learn how to use the manual setting on a digital camera.",
    "Yes, for anyone serious about pursuing photo in career or for non major serious about photo for a hobby"
