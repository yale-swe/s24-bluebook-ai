    "This studio did not coordinate at all with other disciplines. To be fair, the position of the studio was to look formal languages in architecture without serious consideration of other disciplines.",
    "The emphasis of the studio was on advanced computer-aided design and technique. From an advanced computation angle, the studio coordinates well with any of these disciplines in that way, and yet has only a design-related application to them in terms of a more traditional cross-over. However, we did explore representation issues which touch on structure and landscape elements in architectural drawing."

   "comments": [
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was its engagement with new technologies. Like how learning a new word might actually broaden your ability to conceptualize, learning new digital technologies has broadened my understanding of what is possible in architecture today.The last valuable aspect were the constant pin-ups. Let me first say that Mark was an incredibly dedicated professor and that was very appreciated. But I actually think we were often limited because we had to pin-up every Monday and Thursda for the first two-thirds of the semester. While I understand and appreciate the stance that production trumps process, I think process is still fundamental. As third-year grad students in architecture, we should be allowed to think and process for a week before producing.",
    "The most valuable aspect of this course was that it taught me to think about architecture in an entirely different way than I had previously. This change in perspective was largely enabled by the fact that we were taught a highly versatile program (Maya) which could produce spatial manoeuvres that were previously untenable.The least valuable aspect was the faux-beaux-arts component. I thought that the studio travel trip was highly beneficial in getting us to think about space, architecture and ornament in new ways but this was as far as it went. I thought that the weekly 'presentation-quality' pinups were counter-productive and were not conducive to the production of new spatial languages.",
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was the week-to-week trial and error of attempting to produce productive results within an experimental pedagogy pased around the growth of a formal idea for each student.",
    "Mark is an excellent professor. He is kind, smart, tough, precise, and he deeply cares about his students.The structure of the course was brilliant: because none of the studio participants had appropriate digital skills in order to produce the requested material, Mark provided the necessary support and put us in the condition to thoroughly learn and understand new software. In my opinion this is invaluable because the acquisition of new skills was one of my main goals coming into school, and Mark gave me the chance to do it. Both during desk crits and pin-ups he was available for discussion and conversation and I knew I could always rely on his last minute feedback through email.He cared about my personal improvement as an architect. Not only he gave me the freedom to explore themes that I was interested in, but he pushed me to dare more, \u0091loosening up\u0092 as he would say, and learn more about myself as an architect. During this process, he was always there to provide support and offer advice on what he thought was the best direction I could follow.I am very thankful to him for all he has done for me. He has been a great advisor and an intelligent and passionate teacher, and was always interested in offering the best environment for me to learn and grow professionally. I will miss him and I hope that we will be able to keep in touch. I am glad that I came to the Yale School of Architecture and I had the chance to be his student; in my opinion, he is one of the main assets of the school and I have been and always will be happy to suggest his courses to any architecture student."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of the studio as a pedagogical tool",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength was the emphasis on production--viewing each architectural drawing or rendering as sacred as a painting. This is good because this is how the real world often works. Clients do not read a drawing spatially, so the atmosphere of the rendering or the implication of the drawing is more important than its Revit-like consistency with plan, etc.But I think this strength is also the weakness. It trains students to fake-it, making fantastical buildings without any ability to critique what they've done in a believable light. Obviously, the best is when you have both worlds: a great building with drawings and renderings that capture the spirit of the project. While Mark's emphasis on the image was well-taken, he might do better to encourage students to also ground their buildings in more than the image. In the end, architects must always do both.",
    "The strength of the studio lay in the mastery of the tool which was Maya. We had an excellent TA and a number of very useful workshops which enabled us to become confident with the software. I think that new ideas on architectural languages were produced through this medium.I think the main weakness of the studio was the concentration on presentation. I think it hindered progress and I think the fact that the majority of projects had no interiors reflects this. What was produced were shells or surfaces and I am unsure whether this constitutes architecture.",
    "As mentioned, the studio presented some downfalls when the experimentation did not lead anywhere, which is sometimes the case in any studio. In addition, more known methods of developing massing or programmatic, or circulation strategies were intentionally ignored, which added to the 'risk'.Initially, I personally found it very difficult to pursue the design of my museum addition as a mass or overall formal proposal, as this seemed to go against what was an extremely 'bottom up' pedagogy of form-finding techniques. When working in maya, one has to have a clear idea of the desired form, but this felt paradoxical at times due to the ambition of the studio to simply build on results produced irrespective of typical architectural design motivations."

   "comments": [
    "This was the best studio I've had at the school.",
    "I expected an odd blend of new technologies with traditional, Beaux-Arts design. To be honest, my expectations(I don't say that as a bad thing) were not really met. I quickly fell in love with Beaux-Arts architecture, and I would have loved to have more emphasis placed on them. I think the Beaux-Arts emphasis on spatial qualities--effect, compression\/release, perspectival manipulation, marche, grand stairways, enfilade--these are the real solution to Mark's discontent with theory today--theory that is so self-referential it cannot solve the problems of real architecture. I wished he would have pushed that more, because as he said in his introduction, there must be a reason the Beaux-Art school of thought performed so well for years. But the Beaux-Arts was not just an esquisse or an emphasis on production; it was a way of thinking about what mattered in architectur, the very scope of the discipline.All that said, I thoroughly enjoyed the studio, but I do feel like I was set back because my expectations set me off track.",
    "Overall, my expectations for the studio were for very high level, formally experimental projects which challenge typical methods of creating and represtenting architectural form, aperture, color, and articulation. In that sense, my expectations, and I would assume the studio as a whole, were met. The work produced was very beautiful and we learned a lot when working individually or together to address the very high bar which was set for us to attain in terms of visual results. I felt that my interests and strengths as a designer interested in digital media and advanced forms of representation.I will say that some of my expectations for the potential of the studio to create convincing works of architecture on the site (which is adjacent to an existing Classical masterpiece), had to be adjusted. By the end of the studio, I realized that the work was going to be less 'building-like' and less developed in terms of relating to the existing museum as convincing containers of program. However, for many\/some of us, I think this could have been better with more time to develop the proposals."

   "comments": [
    "Mark's main strength is his relentless dedication. He really did as much as he could to make sure we had the skills and knowledge we needed to do well, and I think that shows in the quality of the work. His main weakness was that that relentless attitude was often made him quite stubborn. Since crits were essentially critiques of aethestics--and since we had no set theoretical framework by which to assess the work--the discussions might end up with Mark and a student disagreeing with no common ground by which to resolve the conflict.I think it is safe to say that in general, the students who just did what Mark asked each time did better than the students who had their own ambitions. The students with the more schizophrenic projects often never found a way to convince Mark that their ambitions were worthwhile. Again, since Mark can be a little stubborn and since he has no backing (no backing that he gave us, that is) behind his aesthetic judgments, many pin-ups left the students more confused than before.",
    "Mark has a strong sensibility and demonstrates a seasoned ability to see potential for good and bad early on from student work. I was drawn to his idea for the studio and I think he did a great job to keep us on track (accept, perhaps, the site model issues) to live up to the great ambitions of the studio.However, I would have actually preferred him to linger a little bit longer with us (individually, otherwise) to discuss the designs. He assesses strategies in a very efficient and quick manner. I think there are reasons for either approach, but sometimes I felt that the criticism, while 'right on', was delivered very quickly, sometimes leaving one feeling a bit rushed.Mark was very available to us and met with us every week. He also focused on helping keep us on task and organized in ways the typical studio instructor does not. I appreciated this a lot. One criticism is that sometimes the studio felt a little bit micro-managed. It can be difficult to design, especially in the exhuberant, advanced way called upon by the studio, under that sort of a studio atmosphere.Mark has a passion for pushing design and his ability to lead a studio was clear in the results. Again, sometimes that passion seems a bit underutilized, as he can seem a bit resistant to really engage us and linger on specifics or speculate about the design process. I think the full benefits of this studio will be more noticeable having finished the process than during the thick of it.Cody Davis, our TA, was tireless and extremely valuable as a guide through the design process and the technical issues. I think as a young person in his position within an experimental setup, I am extremely impressed with his ability to know how to strike the right balance and focus on the correct problems at hand. He was great."
