    "Chinese 120 with Wang and Shen Laoshi is a great course. They do a nice job teaching grammatical concepts and they put a lot of attention and care towards their students\/. The Chinese program is very robust and in general, very enjoyable. In fact, my only complaint is that the teachers spoke a bit more Chinese. Because we spent so much of class time going over grammar in English, we actually did not get as much exposure to listening as I would have wanted. That is a small complaint though. Overall, this is a really strong course with some really strong professors!",
    "An intensive but completely doable course, a good way to keep your life structured through daily classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but definitely not for someone looking for an easy class. It was a lot of work, it took a lot of time everyday, but I enjoyed it greatly and developed wonderful relationships with my teachers and fellow students.",
    "I would recommend that students interested in Chinese 120 either take Chinese 110 first, or check to see if they already understand the vocabulary and grammar taught in Chinese 110."
