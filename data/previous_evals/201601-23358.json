    "This class was an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Why am I studying the case law associated with land use regulations? What's happening?",
    "Marjorie is a bright and engaging instructor, and the content is very interesting. I had the most trouble with how the course was run. It was largely driven by students, and that often made it feel tedious and slow. When Marjorie was driving discussion it was much more engaging, but she preferred to have students lead each class. If there were more structure to each class, I think it would have been more engaging.",
    "Marjorie is great but I just felt like the class could have been more organized.",
    "I had high hopes for this course and was extremely disappointed. Marjorie clearly knows the material and has the potential to teach an instructive and thought-provoking course. However, it quickly became apparent that FES and its student body (including me) do not expect much out of her, and that she in turn expects very little from us. The result was a course in which the students, institution, and instructor failed to hold eachother to anything resembling a respectable standard of academic rigor, and ultimately a waste of time for the students. I feel strongly that courses like this one, which offer students an easy pass in a topic that looks good on a transcript and professionals the chance to 'teach' at Yale, are an example of the very worst elements of our school."

    "I liked our class discussions about Marjorie's current caseload.",

    "The individual project was, in my opinion, the best aspect of the course, because it allowed me to apply what we had discussed in class to a topic of my interest.",
    "I thought the term paper was a great opportunity to research a topic that I had specific interest in.",
    "This course provided a great overview of land use law and planning concepts. I really appreciated the balance of breadth and depth and feel that I learned enough to participate in planning and zoning issues in the future.",
    "The granular analysis of various cases was a very valuable process, and I feel much more comfortable reading case law after having taken this course. The final project was a useful space for me to explore a topic of interest.",
    "When engaged outside of class on questions relevant to readings, Marjorie was animated, informative, and useful in clarifying issues that were glossed over during our poorly structured scheduled time."

   "comments": [
    "Some people need to be held more accountable for their case presentations. Sometimes, they explained things inaccurately.",
    "This course seems fundamentally mis-matched for FES. If this were a law school that'd be one thing. But why did we spend all semester reviewing the case law of land use regulations? I think the class was helpful for the one or two joint law students. For the rest of us it was kind of inexplicable.",
    "The course could benefit from more structure - it's run more like a reading group.",
    "The method of course instruction: class instruction was primarily having students read the case briefs they prepared. I did not find this an effective way of learning. Designing these to be more interactive to include discussion questions or prompts could be useful, or having Marjorie summarize the meaning and impact of each case. Class discussion tends to wander off on tangents - I think focusing on key take-home messages from each case or section of the course would be helpful in focusing discussion.",
    "Reading case after case, it was difficult for me to keep the cases organized conceptually. I think a lecture summarizing key points from each unit could have gone a long way. I thought when Marjorie did a good job explaining material, but often it wasn't directly related to what we were reading about.",
    "I think adding in some readings that were more conceptual and broad would have been useful. Varying between reading cases and reading texts from say, a planning journal, would have added a little more diversity to the readings and the flow of the course.",
    "A higher standard for student work would improve the class tremendously. Likewise, the professor *must* put together a more coherent syllabus with clearer learning goals and chances for students to connect course material to relevant topics in other disciplines. The end-of-term paper\/presentation, which purports to do just this, is a particular weak point where improvements could be made."

    "This is not a survey course of land use regulations and laws. It's case law class. Every day you're going to talk about one or two land use cases. It's interesting if you want a law school \"light\" experience (no cold calling, low stress). But don't expect a comprehensive class about land use. You're going to learn a lot about variances. And you watch a zoning commission hearing on the Madison Beach Hotel three times (that's right, 3 times!). So you're going to become an EXPERT on the Madison Beach Hotel. But honestly this class is hilarious and for some reason I looked forward to it every week even though it seemed random and didn't really seem to fit in. So that's a win! And it's a good introduction to law school if you kind of wondered what it would be like to read a bunch of cases then talk about them in class. Turns out it's kind of hilariously boring.",
    "You will probably get a lot out of the course if you already know a little bit about land use law, but if you don't, the course isn't overly difficult, however it may be difficult to pull out key concepts.",
    "You should take this course if you are at all interested in land use policies -- it's a great foundation and good information to know even if it's not directly linked to your work.",
    "This is a strictly legal course (the land use law is heavy and the planning is light).",
    "Take a course at the law school instead. FES simply should not offer less rigorous alternatives to courses at other schools with the 'environmental' topic tacked on. It is a disservice to the student, who is lead to believe they will be getting something resembling an education, and the school, which I *presume* has an interest encouraging a high standard of scholarship.",
