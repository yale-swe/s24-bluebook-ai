    "I would have liked more modeling practice. The second assignment felt like a big leap up from the first assignment. Maybe you could do another iteration of the first assignment before moving onto the second assignment. The lectures were dry, mostly because the material was dry. Sitting in a U helped the dynamic considerably. I also would have liked more discussion moments. I appreciated the input of student presentations but they could have been structured better. I would have gotten more out presenting and out of watching other presentations if we had presented together: one set of summary slides (instead of 3), followed by an analysis of how each of us approached a project differently. Looking over spreadsheet models together to build that presentation would have enhanced my learning.",
    "Slides \/ presentation could use some more energy, but the concepts and flow of information was great",
    "... improve by providing more brief practice problems for various concepts, especially early in the course.",
    "The strength of the course is teaching students how to understand forests and ecosystems in a financial capacity. There are no weaknesses in that.",
    "Strengths of the course were in the material covered, readings, and lecture material. The course could have been a little more engaging."
