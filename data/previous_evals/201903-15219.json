   "comments": [
    "I improved the way i analyzed film and other media. I sharpened my close reading skills and critical eye.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of African American Cinema and its influence.",
    "I learned more about the intellectual debate around the term \"black film\" than I felt I learned about the films themselves. This class very much focused on the intellectual discussion and politics surrounding films rather than the content in the films themselves.",
    "I learned about the different ages of black cinema since the late 19th century. Learned how to watch a film while simultaneously thinking critically about its meaning and underlying themes.",
    "broad history of black film in america; thought to star function & the power of performance; grappling with blackness on screen",
    "Some historical context in Black american film history. thinking more about the burden of categorization\/genre",
    "This class exposed me to a bunch of films that I would have otherwise not watched.",
    "Of course, I developed a vast knowledge of African American film and culture, but I also gained a very useful approach to complex topics that span decades. I also learned how to look at film and art as a powerful reflection of reality.",
    "This class shows you some of the strangest black films you will ever see. I now have a starting knowledge of some independent black films I would have never seen and have read challenging papers on the nature of Black film. This course definitely is intellectual challenging.",
    "I developed a much greater understanding of the significant events and projects during the evolution of African-American film."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses, and the strengths were found in the wonderful class discussions and readings.",
    "I think the presentation aspect of the course would be more productive if they could be longer and touch on more of the film than the readings.",
    "For an introductory course, I think the films chosen were strange picks. I think the more classic films were ignored under the assumption that they had already been seen. I think more of these classic films should have been picked for the syllabus instead of the strange alternatives chosen. The 3 papers on unassigned films were too short to actually say anything. 600 words are ridiculously little. I would have preferred a larger limit on these smaller papers and a shorter final paper (or no final paper at all and just a fourth of the smaller assignments)",
    "Strengths: Prof Forster is really kind and eager to help, exposed to some really interesting Black films I definitely would never see on my own, class dynamic during weekly screenings was a joy, learned some film theory along the way, v low workload (only weekly blog posts + 1 presentation + 3 v short papers + 1 final paper), had 3 super cool guests back to back to back! Weaknesses: this class could be really REALLY tedious at times b\/c there were a lot of readings that ppl just wouldn't do and then a good portion of class time throughout the semester was taken up by ppl just kinda staring at the table or the walls or anywhere that wasn't Prof Forster's face (he was v against cold calling which made ppl feel even more guilty), a LOT of readings, we cut out the recognizable movies in the syllabus in the first few weeks (which was a bummer for me b\/c i'm not a film major and probably won't see them on my own), we watched some WEIRD movies that were not necessarily enjoyable for the untrained eye",
    "strengths: reading that came from such varied sources! pretty cool movies! weakness: could do with some more structured discussion",
    "The blog posts were nice but the instructur didn't really provide much feedback after a certain point so they ended up feeling more tedious. We didn't really speak much about hte films we watched, which definitely deincentivized me and other students from attending screenings as much as we could. Sort of an exorbitant amount of readings, especially in comparison with my other films classes, but we definitely discussed them.",
    "I think the structure of having one 2 hour seminar per week was a little tough.",
    "I really appreciate the structure of this course--both in regards to weekly assignments and the final exam. At times, the readings seemed a bit long and not entirely necessary, but others proved very useful to our understandings of each film's context.",
    "The strength of the course is that the films are widespread in genre and content. A weakness of this course is that it sometimes misses some of the more commonplace films simply because they're easy to find (but those are usually the ones you want to talk about.) Another weakness is that it's a discussion-based class so you really have to speak up if you want to get everything out of it.",
    "I felt like there was a much stronger focus on independent film and non-mainstream films than popular films that were made or featured black people. I wish we could have watched more films that were publicly popular rather than academically popular."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would. Professor Forster is the best!",
    "Yes, I think it is a good way to learn about Black film and discuss Black film since there really aren't many classes at Yale that allow for that space.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. I found the work tedious most of the time even though I love the study of film itself.",
    "If you're looking for a class where you don't necessarily have to be engaged and are interested in niche independent Black cinema, then yes. The class is pretty gutty but you'll get a lot out of it b\/c you can speak up in class and create discussion (ppl don't really talk despite the small class size). If you're looking for a survey of the biggest Black films in history (like I was), this is NOT for you. If you're somewhere in the middle, the rest is for you. As one of the more active class participants, I can honestly say that there were lots of times when I had no idea what was going on both during the films and during class. That being said, when we actually did discuss things in class, they were really interesting and you could easily find tangents to bounce off of. When that happens, there's a pretty good balance of Prof Forster talking and student discussion. I really hope he lightens the reading load b\/c that was a big burden for us. But outside of the readings, the workload is really light which is a big plus.",
    "( i think i accidentally switched the answers between ur two classes sorry) yes! because the class itself is really fun and inspiring but also because there are so few classes of this nature with interest and care for black filmmaking",
    "There's really only one of these classes. It felt like a once-in-a-decade opportunity. definitely recommend for this reason. Nick is also great.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. I found the somewhat focused syllabus to be applicable to countless other areas of study and greatly enjoyed the mixture of different styles, messages and eras of material.",
    "Yes, if you want more exposure to black films and an opportunity to discuss them in an academic environment.",
    "Yes, if anything for the conversation facilitated by Professor Forster during class. The conversations we had really stimulated me to think in a headspace that I was not used to whatsoever. It was definitely useful in furthering not only my understanding of film in general, but also complicating and deepening the way I thought about blackness and what that quality entails."
