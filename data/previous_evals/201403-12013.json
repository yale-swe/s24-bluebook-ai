    "I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE, even to people who aren't particularly interested in sociology. This class really broadened my horizons and shattered my preconceptions. The title of the class doesn't do it justice. Even though it does focus a lot on sex and gender in society, that is hardly all it talks about. We talk about race and class and just about everything else under the sun. This is the only class that I still like at the end of the semester, and if I could change one thing about it, it's that I can only take it once.",
    "This class is a great introduction to sociology. It is fun and understandable and interesting and relevant. I think this is a must take class at Yale.",
    "In ER&M 264 01 you gain valuable knowledge about how society shapes sex and gender. Everything you learn in this class somehow relates to you, causing you to examine your own life and realize how much people are affected by society.",
    "A fun, relevant course. For most of the semester, I spent too much time annoyed at how high-school-like the class was - spending time on \"logistics\" in the beginning of class; slow, slow pace; lots of class participation in a lecture. Little, very dumb things annoyed me: like if someone sneezed, the professor would pause to say \"Bless you!\" I wanted the course to be more rigorous, more in depth, more - I don't know, just less high school. I wish I had just accepted this and enjoyed the material and simple presentation of it. By the last few lectures, I realized that this is a very very broad, overview course, and that's just the nature of a class when trying to teach all aspects of SUCH a large topic. Although I learned few concrete things, I did gain a very different and interesting perspective, one that is so applicable to literally everything. I also very much enjoyed the research project, which requires you to do original sociological research, based on data from interviews and surveys you conduct. I've never done that before, and it was so so satisfying to produce something original, rather than just gathering already-published thoughts. Take it, but with the mindset that this IS a somewhat shallow overview course.",
    "Yes!",
    "This course was mediocre at best. It felt like a high school course. Pr. Almeling should expect more from her students. All of her lectures were minimally informative. We simply glossed over many topics. The overall structure of the course through the course themes she outlines in the first couple of classes (which guide the class) are excellent, however she doesn't do a good job of building on them. The amount of reading is a bit high for an intro-level lecture course. The grading distribution for evaluations does not make any sense. There are two papers for this class, the first of which is a 5 page paper, which is worth the same percentage as the 10 page final paper. The expectations of the first paper do not really make sense given the scope of the outlined project. The two quizzes are a joke. You need to do all of the reading! Section is an absolute joke, but you need to complete a weekly reading response, which can be annoying. The lectures on how to write a paper (are you kidding me...)",
    "It's great at getting you to think about the social construction of gender within the context of class, race, nationality, etc. A decent amount of work required for the 2 papers (need to conduct interviews, create\/send out surveys) and grading can be a bit harsh.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Seriously everyone should take this class. It was so well organized with only two (very easy) quizzes and two five paged papers, and every week you will learn something new and interesting. But it also all connects and builds on itself. This is probably the only class at Yale where I can say that I've actually read every single course reading AND that I enjoyed each one. I love how passionate Prof. Almeling is about her material--for the good of Yale, I hope she teaches more courses in the coming semesters!",
    "An excellent course, especially for freshmen. Each lecture was well-organized, reasonably engaging, and conveyed some information, though we occasionally spent excessive time belaboring a point. Probably because the course had genuine political content, the section was among the most dynamic I've had at Yale, though it was sometimes obvious that no one had bothered to do the reading. The paper was interesting and one of the most motivated I've had, though it requires you to have a good pet project to investigate, and to pretend a sample of 10 people conveyed genuine information in the final. RA is a strong sociologist, and the occasions she brought her own research in to the fold were especially strong as a result. But sometimes she treated lecture as an opportunity to prepare us for the paper, in an attempt to guide those not used to college writing. This may have helped some students, but it led to non-trivial periods where we did no reading and learned no sociology. Overall, the elements of this course designed to make it easy for the unacquainted (explaining papers ad nauseum, videos in lecture, hilariously trivial quizzes) detracted from the overall experience, which was a charming and thorough introduction to sociology.",
    "Pretty fun and easy class.",
    "I would recommend this course. It might not necessarily be mind-blowing, but I think it's consistently interesting, has a chill workload, and is very applicable to real life. It will change the way you see gender and gender differences. If you've taken gender studies classes before, you'd probably find it fairly basic. I liked the way the class analyzed gender from childhood (preschool, elementary school) to young adulthood (high school, college, dating) to adulthood (the workplace), and parenting (mothering vs. fathering). We also spent some time focusing on reproduction technology, and sperm\/egg donation, which is Prof. Almeling's are of expertise. The two quizzes were easy. The research paper was the best part of the course for me. You choose your own topic and interview 2 people and survey 10 people. It was one of my favorite assignments out of all my classes this semester. Make sure you choose a topic you're really interested in!",
    "Everyone at Yale needs to take this class! It is not too difficult, the professor is amazing, the material is so important and relevant to everyone's life, and the readings are fun.",
    "Take this course, and take it with Almeling. The course is a survey of Sex and Gender issues in modern society (duh) and takes you through the construction, socialization, and performance of gender. It then runs through its various manifestations in, for example, the workplace, reproduction, education, etc. It's worth learning, and it's knowledge that will change the way you view and interact with the outside world The course doesn't involve much work other than the readings, which are super interesting and not particularly dense. Make sure to do them, because there are two quizzes that will test you on it. As long as you keep up, you'll be fine. You also get to complete a (baby) research paper using two methods. The papers build up, starting with a 2-page proposal and then a 5-page initial paper using one research method, and then a final 10-page paper using 2 research methods. All the papers are on the same topic, so all you have to do is continuously expand. The 'research' only involves 2 interviews and 10 surveys, but it's a great way to start social science research if you've never done it before. Also, there's no final!",
    "A lecture that you actually don't want to miss! I am pretty well-informed about this stuff, and have taken more \"advanced\" WGSS courses, and this class still taught me a LOT. However, it also does act as an intro course, so if you're new to the field then you should also definitely take it. Basically, no matter who you are, you will learn a lot of really important things about the society in which you live, in addition to societies across the world - and the workload is not bad at all.",
    "This is a course that will radically alter the way you view the world. You will begin to see the way gender is produced in every interaction. You will also learn how to write a sociology paper. Basically, this is an incredible course that is applicable to your everyday life. You should take it.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class to another student. There are better means of teaching introductory sex and Gender concepts than this. Honestly the course seemed to be a bit of a waste of time for me, particularly in the amount of work put into the final paper. I feel as though a majority of students in the class put in a large amount of work to the final paper only to see that work go unacknowledged, which definitely seems as a wast of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The course covers a broad array of concepts immediately applicable to problems we face in society to this day.",
    "SOCY 134 is a general overview of many different ways gender is constructed in society. I would definitely recommend it to anyone--it is a different way of looking at life, and I think it is really useful.",
    "This class was really interesting. I didn't know that there were so many issues surrounding sex and gender in society and I felt like I was exposed to a lot of necessary concepts to understand the way society approaches sex and gender. The class, though not incredibly difficult, was not a gut class. The papers were graded pretty rigorously. Professor Almeling is definitely passionate about this subject and she integrates her own research into our class. What I really enjoyed about this class was that the lectures weren't repetitive. We had different topics every week and didn't just reiterate the same few concepts again and again as I've found social science classes to do.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It is an intro to sociology, and if you have any interest whatsoever in the sociology of gender then you should take this class. Even if you don't have interest you should take it! Professor Almeling is a leading scholar in this field because she is able to connect the interactions of gender with other fields such as economics, race issues, biology, medicine, etc. This class will challenge your views on gender and defy stereotypes that you may have had. Something that I really liked about the class was that we spoke about the problems faced both by women AND men and then looked at the intersectionality of other factors. This class was just great!",
    "Sex and Gender in Society is a fantastic course for anyone. It has a great selection of readings and the concepts you learn apply in daily life. I would recommend this course to everyone because it covers a subject that can be applied to anyone.",
    "This course explores the various ways in which sex and gender manifest in our lives and have real world consequences. It is absolutely a class that should be taken before graduation.",
    "Besides the 10 page paper, this course doesn't require too much work. There are usually two interesting readings a week and a short reading response required for section. Lectures are very interesting and I definitely came out of the course with a fresh perspective on sex, gender, and even race and health in society.",
    "Take it! Especially if you are at all interested in feminist issues, it was really formative for my feminism and awareness of the issues facing poor women and women of color. Do as many of the readings as you can. Professor Almeling's lectures are very engaging and not too dense. Watch out for the quizzes though, they're super specific and a real pain. (This year we were tested on reading assigned for the day of the quiz so watch out for that.)",
    "Yes. Material is very eye opening",
    "If you want to learn about \"social construction\", \"gender norms\", and all those other stereotypical terms you hear thrown around- this is the class for you. It was enjoyable class overall, and not very difficult either.",
    "It's a great class if you're interested in gender roles and things of that nature. Be prepared to be angry with yourself and almost everyone around you for giving in to these gendered behaviors and stereotypes. Overall, it was an amazing class!",
    "Very interesting survey course of Sex and Gender! There's a lot more to just male\/female in it though. She talks a lot about race and the gender spectrum. You will learn so much! The quizzes are very easy if you go to class and have done the readings (make sure to do the reading for the day of the quiz too!) Papers can be harshly graded (some people got C's) but with the quizzes and participation grade you do alright in the end. TAs are very willing to help",
    "I think everyone should take this class in order to better understand current issues in our society - especially pertaining to gender and sex. It equips you with enough knowledge to engage informatively in conversations regarding reproduction, the wage gap, the labor market and sex. I thought it was a wonderful introduction into both sociology and women and gender studies. Also not a lot of work!",
    "A class that opens you to the reality of inequality issues in our society based on gender. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Yes \"Sex and Gender in Society\" doesn't sound as exciting as some seminars you might find in these departments but it's just one of those truly solid classes. I love the intersectional aspect of the course and it makes complete sense that it's listed under three departments. The research paper is a lot of fun--you basically get to do whatever you want as long as it's somewhat related to gender. You work on it over the semester which allows you to get really invested in your topic over a longer stretch of time. Don't cram it last minute though! I did work throughout the semester but still wish that I had put more time into it. I also really appreciated that the professor really cared about teaching--she always asks for student feedback and seems to put a lot of thought into improving the course. It's so important to have a good professor who also cares about her profession as a scholar as well as a teacher and we too often forget that.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the lectures and the material but more could've been done to help us understand and meet their expectations for the paper assignments. Otherwise it was not too much work and I would recommend the class.",
    "Perfect introduction to sex and gender. Would recommend highly.",
    "Very interesting course on sex and gender, changed the way I analyze and view the world",
    "good class, few assignments, but not a gut in the general sense of the term because grading was unnecessarily harsh for the papers, though it was often many students' first time writing sociology papers. There's a lot of reading for every class too, which is necessary\/helpful for section",
    "A conglomerate of sociological methods and grossly oversimplified intersectional race and gender studies. A course that abuses methods of data analysis and reduces gender studies to an offensive caricature toxic enough that I almost dropped the course just to stop hearing Prof. Almeling butcher lecture after lecture. A course that I would hesitate to recommend to an enemy, and would never recommend to a friend. The SO credit is just not worth the truly awful experience.",
    "The class is a bit dull during the first few weeks as a lot of gender theory is discussed, but after that, a lot of interesting topics such as eugenics, workplace structure, and healthcare policies are explored. There are two short quizzes, weekly section meetings, and a ten page research paper.",
    "This course isThis course is a great introduction to both sociology and the study of sex and gender. It strongly illustrates important concepts, but sometimes glazes over some of the smaller details. Not too much work, but expect to put real effort into the papers."
