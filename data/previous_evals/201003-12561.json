   "comments": [
    "Wonderful survey of the history of the Indian subcontinent told through its art. Insight into a lot of religion and material culture. Prof. Goes off on tangents a bit, tries to show materials unprepared for and it takes up time. But very knowledgable and has great first person accounts of all the places she's been to (many of the slides are her own pictures). If you thought the Cathedrals of Europe were the only wonders of the world, wait until you see some of these temples. It's mind blowing.",
    "I would recommend it to an Art History Major to fulfill the Asian art requirement. If you're not majoring, though, don't take it, as the information is inherently random. That being said, if you're interested in East Asian culture and art, by all means take it.",
    "I would recommend this class just for the experience of learning about Indian Art.",
    "YES!This was the best class I've taken at Yale as an art history major. Indian art\/monuments are beautiful\/sensuous\/erotic\/fascinating\/rich...but more importantly, Sears is a wonderful teacher who brings up the discussions of fundamental aspects of art history as an academic discipline, visual culture, ways of seeing, different meaning of architectural forms and temple programming, etc... I would think that besides the Critical Approach seminar, this class is the best class that forces you to think about what you are really doing when you take an art history class..it is not simply about memorizing slides (although, i have to say, memorizing arabic\/sanskrit names is extremely tricky), but about reconstructing the past with images and physical objects that involves great creative energy and curiosity. You actually get to practice working with unknown, new materials, and thinking through them in visual studies assignments, and get to train your eyes with looking at sculptures and temples in addition to paintings.The class is divided into three parts: pre-Buddhist+Buddhist monuments, Hindu temples, and Islamic period of South Asia. The class tries to cover a LOT of materials, and I feel that she did the best job with Buddhist\/Hindu monuments...It could be that the time crunch towards the end (and general stress level\/my tired body towards the end of the semester)combined to make the Mughal material the least engaging (although the art works themselves are extremely beautiful).However, it is a lot of work: 4 papers (3 visual studies paper which took me as much time as it did to write the final paper) + 1 final paper), and also 2 exams. A good amount of readings are assigned, it is good to read them and also think through the lectures, as they complement each other...I feel that Indian art history is somewhat new (at least compared to things like Renaissance and modern), and each scholar has very different ways of approaching the monuments...its good to think about layers...",
    "In this course, we study the art and culture of India from the prehistoric Indus Valley civilization to the Mughal dynasty, following the art as India shifts from Hinduism to Buddhism to Islam. I strongly recommend this course--interesting material, well taught, worthwhile curriculum.",
    "This is an amazing survey of Indian art--ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT. It covers an enormous amount of material at a fast pace, but you will learn SO MUCH. Professor Sears has fascinating interests and her lectures are really brilliant--CAVEAT: she is sort of awkward and nervous at the beginning of lectures\/reading period. But have faith and take a chance--stick it out a few classes and she will blow you away! A decent amount of coursework but its all really interesting--heavy emphasis on Yale Art Gallery material which is always great! Best non-western (for art history majors) you could ever hope to find!",
    "If you have any interest in India or an artistic tradition outside of Europe take the course. Dr. Sears is great and the work is reasonable."
