   "comments": [
    "Excellent resources.",
    "Fine.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, most resources were available. Two things would have been helpful:1) receiving copies of the slides2) having a list of key concepts, people, laws etc at the start of the course rather than at the end. this would be helpful for taking notes into during the lectures.",
    "The course did not require much in terms of physical and digital resources.",
    "Yes.",
    "It would be good if our library had many copies of Garvin's book \"American City: What works, what doesn't\", and students were able to check it out to work at home as well as prepare for the exam.",
    "Yes.",
    "Perhaps some more information on how to complete the games, so less time is spent figuring out how the spreadsheets work, and more can be devoted to how to manipulate them.",
    "Yes.",
    "Resources were adequately available.",
    "The resources were more than adequate. A few smaller assignments on the way to the larger submission of entries for the games could have produced better results. Often the lectures did not fully clarify all the important aspects of the games. Consequently, at the beginning of each assignment a lot of time was spent understanding what the driving factors and important considerations of the games were, this could have been cut down with a little more treatment in lectures of what was expected in the games, or by stretching the games out to allow re-calibrations midway through.",
    "We had adequate resources for this class",
    "All of the materials we needed were posted online and on the school server so it was readily available. This is to the credit of the TAs who were prompt about uploading it. That said, while Garvin\u0092s slides didn\u0092t often have text, it would likely have proved useful if the slides from class had been posted as well.",
