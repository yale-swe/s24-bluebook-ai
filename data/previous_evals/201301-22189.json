    "I would recommend this class to someone who is genuinely interested in Astronomy and wouldn't mind being overwhelmed with countless details, equations, theories, etc. that talk about planets and stars. For you to do well, I would recommend reading the textbook thoroughly, understanding the concepts extremely well, and working on problems with peers.",
    "Astronomy 110 was easy for the most part and not too in depth. The math is pretty easy. But, in order to get an A you have to put in effort.",
    "Do not take this course.",
    "Very hard class. Not worth it just for the QR or science credit. The midterms are just so hard.",
    "Not a gut, so don't treat it that way. Requires actual work and (unfortunately if you're going for a QR credit like me) a lot of qualitative information. I wish I could have concentrated on the quantitative, since that's what I was trying to knock out.",
    "do not take ever.",
    "This is a great class, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to work. The course material is really fascinating \u00e2\u0080\u0093 partly conceptual, and partly based on learning facts (particularly about the planets). Dr. Edwards is extremely devoted to her course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very approachable, friendly, and passionate about the subject. As for the workload and grade structure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there are 6 problem sets (20%), two midterms (15% each), a final (35%), weekly online quizzes (5%), an unforgettable night time observing experience \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we saw the Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn! (5%), participation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which includes participating in class discussion, voting with your color card in the multiple choice in-class activities, submitting occasional in-class hand-outs, attempting all online quizzes, meeting deadlines etc. (5%), and some bonus activities (0.5 added onto your final score for each \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so helpful!). There is definitely always some work to do, but the exams and problem sets are all fair, and the lectures are fun because of the participation and occasional demonstrations. Weekly sections help revise concepts and address questions (particularly about homework). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever been fascinated by space, take this class!",
    "I would recommend it because it's really interesting and pretty fun. But it's not quite the gut that had heard. There are lots of quizzes (which are pretty easy if you've done the reading), 6 assignments which were pretty time consuming, 2 mid-terms and a final. Professor Edwards was great.",
    "I recommend this class if you are actually interested in Astronomy. Otherwise, don't do it.",
    "If you are taking this class thinking it is a gut, it is not. The problem sets take time and reading the text book actually helps you in understanding the material. With that being said, this was a very interesting class that was out of my typical lineup of classes (as a Political Science major) and it was well worth the investment of time. It's cool to get to know about something that isn't in your usual area of interest sometimes. I recommend it.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 110 for anyone who is looking for a manageable, fair science credit - there may be a lot of \"busy work\" and it's not easy, but it's pretty straightforward. Also, I think the material is quite interesting, especially when we get to relativity and black holes at the end of the course.",
    "I would not recommend this class. A lot of tedious work.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class credit\/d\/fail. Taking this class credit\/d\/fail is somewhat of a trap, because you get a false sense of security that just completing the reading and problem sets will be enough. It is not. You need to work just as hard in this class as in any other to pass it credit\/d\/fail, so you might as well take it for a grade and get the qr credit.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 110 to a student if he or she is willing to put in a lot of work. Also, as a heads up, someone taking this course should know that it is definitely a QR and a science, and therefore it might be better to take a math or a science if you are just looking for the credit. However, if you are genuinely interested in learning about astronomy, then I would recommend you take this course.",
    "Take the course if you want to learn more about planets and stars. You definitely will. The work is not pressing. It is actually fun and interesting.",
    "No. never take this class.",
    "Not a very good class. The weekly quizzes are an annoyance, and the small assignments should be removed and the midterms and the final should be weighted more heavily.",
    "Its a great introduction to Astronomy. Take it if you are at all interested in learning about planets and stars, you might not have another opportunity to learn about this. Also, it's a pretty easy science\/QR credit.",
    "Not a gut. Take it because you're interested. It really is cool, and unlike a lot of non-science major science classes, you learn SO MUCH information.",
    "Very intensive for someone not fascinated by astronomy and just trying to fulfill a QR req.",
    "Quantitative parts of the class are extremely easy if you know anything about math. Some material will be familiar to anyone who took high school physics. Edwards likes to do a lot of class participation and working in groups during lecture, which is nice if you like that style of teaching but annoying if you don't.",
    "This is a good choice for non-Science majors with an interest in physics or astronomy. Professor Louise Edwards is very clear and enthusiastic in lecture. Tests are challenging but perfectly fair if you are going to lecture and section. This class is a lot of work, but if you keep up with the reading and work hard you will do well. I would take another astronomy course or another course with Professor Louise Edwards.",
    "You might as well, if you need a science or QR credit. It could be worse.",
    "I would say there are two situations in which I would recommend this class. First, if you're actually interested in planets and stars then give it a try. Professor Edwards is extremely peppy and enthusiastic, and seems to genuinely care about what she's teaching. You will learn a lot about astronomy if you put in the effort. Second, if you need a fairly easy QR or SC credit, then this is a pretty good bet. Your grade is spread out between assignments, online quizzes, 2 midterms, an observing experience, participation, and the final, so even if you bomb one midterm, you'll probably still be okay. And anything 90 or over is an A, so if you at least try a little in the class, it shouldn't be too difficult to get the A, or at least an A-. Also you should find a buddy in the class to check answers for the psets with. Assignments are worth more than you would think in that class as compared to midterms for example.",
    "I wasn't very fond of the course at first because I wasn't doing so great in it, but while I definitely did not earn an A in it, I would still suggest that you take this course. I took it for the QR credit, and I ended up falling in love with the course material and with Prof. Edwards. She makes everything so engaging, and if you reach out, she will make sure you figure out what to do. A couple of people complained that she didn't explain the equations or formulas very well, but it would be almost impossible to do that in lecture anyway; that's the sort of thing you have to do at home. And while I felt there was a lot of work, that was mostly because I'm not very good at QRs. If you're good at them, this class should be doable.",
    "Don't take it. It's not a gut; it's actually rather difficult. Perhaps most importantly, it's graded harshly.",
    "This class has interesting material, but never take it if Louise Edwards is teaching it.",
    "It is an interesting subject. But the structure of the class and the instructor make it unenjoyable.",
    "Astronomy 110 is a fairly interesting course that focuses on our solar system and the life cycle of stars. Ms. Edwards is a pretty good lecturer, and the course as a whole was decent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more work than you might expect, but still fairly easy.",
    "This class sucks. The math is insanely easy, but you have to memorize bullshit information for the tests and it is not clear at all what you are supposed to study going into it. Annoying weekly quizes, annoying problem sets with not that much partial credit, and annoying tests that are not curved (so even though an 85 is an A-, only 25 percent of kids got in the A\/A- range on the second midterm, and that was after a bunch of people dropped after the first midterm)",
    "This is often advertised as a gut class and an easy QR. It really isn't. Though the class is advertised as QR\/science for non-science majors, the instructor assumes all the students have a much better math\/sci capacity than most of us did. The material was interesting enough, but a lot of it wasn't really related to the problem sets or exam questions. I studied a lot for exams and never did very well on them. This class was the main source of stress for my friends and I this semester. I wish someone had warned me about it.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting and altogether new subject for me, and I intend to continue thinking about astronomy in other academic disciplines.",
    "If you're looking to fulfill a QR requirement this course is nothing to write home about. That said, it's not particularly difficult. If you're prepared to endure large quantities of busy work that's not too challenging nor particularly fascinating in the name of a QR credit, then by all means, take this class. However, I am sure there are more interesting classes that you could take to earn this credit."
