    "Excellently taught class with weird grading.First, material wise--this is definitely neuroscience on the micro, rather than macro, level. You will not talk about thoughts or emotions--these are crammed tangentially into the final two lectures. You will, however, learn about the biophysics of ion channels, how neurons fire, how neurons form networks, how they undergo developnent, and a number of model systems.Grading wise, its rough. The textbook material does NOT help for the exams. Take meticulous notes in class--this is VITAL. The only grade in the course is for the two midterms and final, and the first midterm hit me like a sledgehammer. Really, write down everything the professor says.Haig and Paul are both great lecturers, very clear and accessible. I recommend the lab as well--its a blast.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in biological sciences, and even those who are just interested in learning neurobiology. This was the best introduction I could have had to neurobiology. It made me excited to take more classes, and excited about covering this topic (hopefully, eventually) in medical school. Everything was very clear and organized. The professors were amazing. The class was outstanding -- one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "take it!! this class was not at all as hard as people hyped it up to be. it's definitely easier than cell.",
    "It was very interesting, although it goes a little psychology on you in the second half.",
    "This class is very good if you are interested in Neurobiology. The first section has a lot of physics involved (they aren't kidding when they list it as a highly recommended prereq), but it is manageable. The material in the course is interesting and presented well. To do well, much studying is required.",
    "Take it if you want to know more about the functional brain. If you don't like electricity from a physics standpoint or you don't find brain nerual circuits interesting, you won't have a fun time. Only 2 exams and a final. No problem sets, so make sure you're on top of your stuff.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend neurobiology. The material is extensive and difficult but extremely fascinating and you will not regret taking the time to learn it.",
    "A good class. One of the best in the MCDB department. It covers some basics about how an individual neuron functions that get skipped over in a lot of psychology neuro classes. I loved Paul Forscher's part--made me think about neurons as circuits, like, fo' real (every neuro class is all, \"blah, blah, the neurons make circuits,\" but in this class the hand waving stops and the circuit diagrams come forward). Still, that level of gloriously thorough biolophysical understanding is limited to Forscher's lectures. Haig Keshishian covers a lot of stuff that's pretty typical of other neuro-y psych-y classes. There's plenty to memorize and not as much to actually understand. Still, even the material I wasn't crazy about was reasonalby well taught.",
    "The first half of the class seemed like a flurry of information, and Forsher didn't always label things. The second two thirds here taught by Haig and he was always quite clear :)Material overlapped a good bit with other classes I've taken, but this was good to synthesize them together.Testing was kinda frustrating. It is important to study the channels, neurotransmitters, what ions go through and Whig drugs affect them. Have a running list so each time you learn a new one you file it in the right place in your mind. (not that there are that many, but it'll really help for the tests.)The book was not helpful for anything, and some of the information is quite difficult to find online too. The class could be much better with a useful reference.I didn't have a reliable list of pathways or descriptions of channels or anything like that. I could synthesize a lot out of my notes, but ever missing a lecture made that quite difficult. Also, I always want to study from something more reliable than my notes just in case, and I only like to use notes as a guide to help my organize my thoughts, so having references would help a lot.",
    "Being an upper level Bio course, Neurobiology is a difficult class; the curve is steep and the exams are hard! That being said, the workload is very manageable and the subject is extremely fascinating, so I don't regret taking it.",
    "LOVED it. It's a little scary, and this class is no joke. Definitely worth putting in the extra time to study the material well as you go along in the course so that you're not stuck cramming for each exam. There is a lot of material, so don't expect to take another hard science course unless you'reinsane or you're taking one of them credit\/D. If you're interested in neurobio, you MUST take this course. It's a great overview and Forscher and Keshishian are hilarious, nice, and very student-oriented. You will learn a lot. If you're just looking for an interesting bio course, this is it. But be warned... it will probably be your hardest class.",
    "Neurobiology is a great course for anyone who is interested in the brain. The course does a great job going over the fundamentals to the more complex aspects of the brain. Be prepared for a cellular, physics-heavy introduction though!",
    "I would recommend it. It is a lot of material, but it is all very interesting and worthwhile. Only 2 midterms and a final in terms of grading.",
    "Neurobio covers a lot of really interesting material, from ion channels and the biophysics of how a neuron works (taught by Prof. Forscher), to synaptic plasticity and memory (taught by Prof. Keshishian). There are reading assignments, and the only grades come from the two midterms and the final. I would recommend neurobio - it covers material that is very interesting and certainly worth learning for anyone interested in how neurons and the brain work, and it's taught by very good professors.",
    "Difficult class content wise (you'll spend nights memorizing information), but it is extremely interesting material!",
    "Oh man. So I came into this class with no official prerequisites except AP Biology (three years ago) and a semester of Chem 114 (which I took concurrently). I also took Brain& Thought last year.The results? Somewhat terrifying from purely grades-minded perspective, and EXTREMELY rewarding from an academic one (and isn't that what we're supposed to be here for anyway)? Basically, physics NEEDS to be a requirement for the class, unless there's a way that Day 1 could be spent explaining what the hell circuits are. After the fairly brutal first third of the class, though, the clouds parted and every lecture became an utterly fascinating exploration of what we think is going on when we think. Prof. Forscher was a pretty clear lecturer (though the physics killed me, if you couldn't tell from two sentences ago), but Prof. Keshishian was even better. He will make about a half-dozen jokes during his 2\/3 of the semester, so keep your ears peeled. Each will be really, really funny.Regarding workload, I'm putting \"same\" for the little bar graph, because there kinda isn't any work. Which gives you less of an excuse not to keep up with the reading. Two exams, no problem sets...it's not the workload that's hard, it's the concepts.So yes. It will probably be very hard, but it won't kill you. Just study, and read the book (which I didn't do until pretty much right before the exam, and it was actually super helpful. Who knew?). Worth it, worth it, worth it. Especially if you don't mind a healthy little love-tap to your GPA.",
    "This course is great if you're serious about the subject matter and really want to have in-depth knowledge of how neurons and nervous systems work. It can be tough so don't take it unless you're really interested. I definitely recommend having some basic physics since this will make the first part of the course a lot easier to understand, though it's possible to pick up on the fly.",
    "A good class. Personally I enjoyed the first third of the course the most, despite not having any physics background -- it was really difficult, but also really rewarding. The second part of the course was a little more disorganized and, to me, somewhat less interesting although definitely still cool. I'd recommend it.",
    "It's a pretty difficult course. Definitely one of the harder bio classes that I've taken. Be sure you listen carefully during lectures because the professors don't use powerpoints and don't always write on the chalkboard.",
    "Probably one of my favorite biology classes at Yale. The material was super interesting and the professors were all very good.",
    "Great class! Fascinating material. Try to keep up with the reading because if you end up cramming right before the exam you can't think about it as much as it deserves. Thought-provoking and interesting material, teaches you skills and makes you think about hte material you've learned in interesting, difficult ways.",
    "Probably the best class I've taken at Yale. Excellent teaching with no frills or gimmicks-- just fantastic chalk-and-talk lectures with the occasional diagram\/picture on a slide. The professors are both brilliant, and their teaching really focuses on creating a narrative (somewhat independent of the book). The workload is actually pretty light, provided you have enough background. Two midterms, a final, no psets-- all you have to do is go to lecture and learn absolutely everything, which I really enjoyed. Definitely do not take this class if you haven't done E&M physics. I had also taken Psyc 160 and Psyc 170 before this class, which helped a lot, but there is surprisingly little overlap. This class feels a lot more science-y, with a much greater focus on learning how everything works from the ground up.",
    "This course provides a good survey of the basic topics in neurobiology. You learn membrane physiology and biophysics, the principles behind synaptic transmission, the workings of some basic neural networks, and some more advanced processing mechanisms (visual system, etc). The class moves at a very reasonable pace and the lectures are interesting. The textbook isn't great but I'd still recommend taking this class.",
    "I would recommend it. Interesting material and well-taught. I like the survey format; we covered a bunch of different topics within the semester. Not your run-of-the-mill biology lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are really interested in the subject area. There is a lot of information to be memorized.",
    "take it credit\/d\/fail",
    "Very interesting class, mixing biology with physics with psychology. Highly recommend. Got me interested in the field (as a biophysicist).",
    "I would recommend it if the subject material seems interesting. There isn't much to prepare you for the tests with past exams, but overall I learned a lot. The tests weren't very comprehensive and instead focused on only parts of the course, but that was mainly due to time restrictions.",
    "Very hard"
