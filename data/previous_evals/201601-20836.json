    "Standard higher-level language course. L3 will prepare you pretty well, but still challenging.",
    "Very similar to spanish 130",
    "Take it with Prof. Alexandrov!! She is FANTASTIC--she cares so much about her students, and she makes it a pleasure to come to class every day.",
    "Great class. I would recommend it because it actually makes you learn without doing that much work.",
    "Yes, it's a great course. You learn a ton and it's fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's a small step up from L3, and it is very doable. There are a couple more presentations and in-class activities in L4 as compared to L3, but they aren't too hard by any means. We also read a novel at the end of the class, which helps to make use of all the vocab and grammar learned throughout the year."
