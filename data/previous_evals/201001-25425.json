    "yes, I would recommend it to any student who has time and an interest in the Great Depression. Don't take this class expecting amazing movies -- they are selected for their historical context, not for their style.",
    "Take it!The class is a lot of work. It requires about 150 pages of reading and two films a week, a 20 page final paper as well as a 15 minute film. That being said, it is completely worth it. If you are looking for an engaging and interesting seminar that attracts an interesting group of students, this is it. Professor Fein is a legend."
