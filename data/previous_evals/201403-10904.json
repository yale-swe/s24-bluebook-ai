   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class for someone who is interested in the human side of diseases and is looking mostly to know an overview of the most relevant mechanisms for different diseases.",
    "PATH 690 consists of discrete, topical lectures that are usually very interesting. I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, the lecture topics were great.",
    "PATH 690 01 is an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying a variety of diseases, primarily focusing on the role of inflammation in disease. I would recommend the course to another student, because it is very interesting and provides a breath of knowledge that a PhD student who focuses in on a topic may no otherwise obtain.",
    "Excellent ioverview of immunology and disease mechanisms",
    "I would summarize the class by saying that each lecture a different lecturer who is an expert in their field presents on the basics of their field. I would recommend the class but warn that some classes will be great while other will be mediocre.",
    "it was an opportunity to learn more about human physiology, I would recommend that if that is what you would like to do",
    "It is a introductory course showing us the mechanisms of different diseases that cover different facets of pathology. So if someone is interested in inflammatory diseases and diseases related to immune system malfunction, I really recommend this course.",
    "Very interesting and not too much work.",
    "PATh 690 will open one's eyes to a myriad of human diseases, some that are less well-known than others. The quality of lecture depends on the presenter: some put more focus on basic understanding, other aims to present current research. I would recommend this course to students who are more interested in immunology and the role of inflammation in human disease. A significant portion of the course is devoted to that, which may make it hard for someone with minimum immunology understanding. It may also be less interesting to people going into neurological or metabolic research.",
    "An interesting course that provides introductory knowledge about common and a few rare diseases. I would recommend the course due to the reputable professors in the lecture lineup.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student. It provides a good overall description of a variety of diseases and opens door to you for more in depths research if some aspects or certain disease interest you during the course.",
    "I would recommend this to a student more interested in medicine than investigative science.",
    "This course gives a good overview of the pathologies of various diseases. Most lectures also gravitates towards the clinical aspects of pathologies.",
    "Not really a class that explores the molecular mechanisms of disease but more of a class on the pathologies of the diseases."

   "comments": [
    "Although I was not interested in some of the themes of the lectures, I believe that I have learned not only a better picture of each disease taught, but also I has made me research in a more detailed way my future topic of research.",
    "This course had no little to my department but I found it very useful and interesting as a part of MRSP.",
    "While this course did not specifically get into my field (neuroscience), it gave me an appreciation for other medical diseases, which I believe will make me a better translational scientist in the long-run, as I need to consider the side effects and potential pathological consequences of certain drugs or diseases that affect more than just the nervous system. While this course did not directly contribute to my dissertation\/research, I believe that it gave me a foundation that will make me a better scientist in the long-run.",
    "Not sure yet what my discipline\/profession will be but leaning towards cancer bio which this class did help me with to an extent. However, it was the basics of cancer which many other classes i have taken have gone over.",
    "didn't really learn anything that applies to my research",
    "This course lets me know some diseases that I did not pay attention to before but are still very important. So the major function of this course is to give me more knowledge that I may use in the future.",
    "I am in the immuno track, and majority of the diseases discussed in the course related to the immunological aspect of the disease, which is quite informative to me.",
    "As an immunologist, this course is definitely highly relevant to my discipline. By learning about the current obstacles to the complete treatment or eradication of many different diseases, it has prompted me to think about how immunotherapy can come into play for various diseases especially cancer and alzheimers."
