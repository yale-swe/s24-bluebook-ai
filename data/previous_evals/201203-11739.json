   "comments": [
    "It's a really rewarding course - take this instead of 205 even if you're not a music major, and try and take it with John. Sometimes I wish we had more homework (to really hammer in concepts); in particular, I would have preferred more composition assignments (these take much longer though).",
    "I highly recommend this class. It is not an easy class, nor does it involve listening to pop music, but it increased my appreciation for and understanding of music of the style we studied by quite a lot. It is a small and friendly class.",
    "John is quite a good teacher, and a very likable guy. The work is pretty front loaded, since the beginning involves quite a bit of technical nitty gritties related to voice leading and basic compositon. Towards the end the class takes a more theroetical turn, focusing more on analysis and topics such as Caplinian structure, sonata theory, and hypermeter.",
    "Music 210 is a great class. Although there is a lot of overlap during the first month with 205, it moves onto new material quickly enough. John is a great teacher with a quirky and inclusive teaching style that keeps the class engaging (expect random references to everything from 19th century poetry to Buddhist philosophy to current television shows). He is also very accessible if students ever have any questions (something that I certainly appreciated as the class became more challenging in the second half). Take it.",
    "It is a challenging course, but definitely worthwhile. It teaches important musical concepts in a classical context that can be applied to several different styles.",
    "A good intro into music theory studied with a strong emphasis on classical music and composition. If you are like me and are interested in studying music theory for the purpose of understanding popular music, this course will not fully satisfy you. There are many units, such as the one on sonata theory, that are quite useless beyond the classical music realm."
