    "Definitely. The professors are generally good, and before class, you are given the lecture slides in advance. There are about four problem sets\/reading responses that are based on either textbook readings or supplemental readings; one 3 page essay on a book about polio (which you really need to answer each and every question on the prompt); a heavily scientific midterm (which you really need to study for because it's easy to get confused) and a final paper and presentation on a topic of your choice. Easily one of the best science classes at Yale (for non-science majors). If you don't want to be stuck in a lecture and want to learn something applicable to daily life, then take this class!",
    "The best science credit at Yale. Sophomores, try to take it because it's only offered to freshmen and sophomores. Although be warned, the first part of the course is VERY biology heavy. The second half of the course is a bit more mellow and incorporates social science approaches to immunological topics. You get to read really interesting scientific novels and the final project is very open-ended.",
    "Take this class! You will learn useful and interesting facts about the immune system, and you will also have a chance to look at diseases in social, political, and artistic contexts. A highlight was a class trip to the Yale Art Gallery!",
    "MCDB 109 was a pretty good class. It is an interesting and engaging class, though the lectures could be somewhat boring. I would recommend it if you have a preexisting interest in medicine and immunity.",
    "This course was a huge mess. The co-teaching did not work at all, since one frequently interrupted the other, leading to a dynamic in which students were validated in not respecting either instructor. The material was not presented in a clear way--the slides were hard to follow and the explanations were convoluted.",
    "Yes, it's a great and interesting Sc credit for non-science majors, especially in a Spring semester whose other offerings include good ol' History of Life and Science of Water. That said, I would advise against taking it if you're not genuinely interested in the material. The first half of the semester, pre-midterm, gets pretty detailed and complicated if you don't keep up and the second half is spent discussing sensitive topics like HIV\/AIDS and HPV. To be frank, the second half of the course can get pretty uncomfortable if you're socially conservative, which obviously almost everyone else in the room is not. Also, it's pretty popular during shopping period, so make sure you can come up with a unique reason why you should get in (rare autoimmune disease, allergies, get sick often, relative connections, etc.). Good luck!",
    "Take the course. It is a great way for freshmen and sophomores to get a Sc credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to fulfill a science requirement. The first half of the course before the midterm reminded me of AP Bio--the midterm was straightforward, as long as you put in the time to memorize all of the lectures and small details (again, just like AP Bio). The second half of the course was a lot more relaxed, with book discussions. I enjoyed the discussions because they were laid-back and more about discussing overarching concepts than picking out small, pointless details. I don't know how much I actually learned in the class, but I am happy to be done with my science requirements.",
    "This is a great class! You learn a lot of science, but you also get to examine the larger importance of that science. The professors are good, and lectures tend to be engaging and creative, with lots of interesting info tied in to important concepts. I would highly recommend it.",
    "MCDB 109 is an AMAZING class. You learn so muchabout the immune system (which in case you didn't know is REALLY IMPORTANT), and you do it in a way that's fun and easy to understand. Sarah Bertino is an incredible person and will make you never want to take a class from anyone else ever again, and Paula Kavathas is so incredible, knows so much about the immune system, and really really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Such a great duo is pretty rare, but they are fantastic, fantastic teachers who will make you love the subject. The material before the midterm can be pretty challenging, but as long as you study for the midterm you'll do really well. After the midterm, the class is incredibly fun, you read a few really really interesting books, and the final presentation\/paper are low-key and easy to write. Overall, this class is a must-take for anybody, whether or not they are science types.",
    "A science class that yes, IS a science class at the beginning (don't be fooled into thinking this is a gut because while after the midterm the material is easier and less science-y, before the midterm WILL be a struggle if you haven't done a lot of bio - I hadn't. That said, it's totally do-able and totally worth it.) After the midterm it's SO INTERESTING - you're learning about really genuinely intersting things like the details of the polio vaccine, Henrietta Lacks, superbugs in hospitals, HIV, etc. Great great class and I actually came out feeling like I'd learned a lot.",
    "This is a fun science class that targets non-science majors, but it actually teaches a lot about the immune system and pathogens. I recommend it if you're interested in learning about about the social and biological aspects of diseases.",
    "Great class for non-science majors!",
    "I think it's a great SC credit for non-science majors and it's interesting because you get to study diseases like Polio and HIV while learning about an important part of the human body--the human immune system. It's a good amount of work but there is only one exam (a midterm), which works out in favor of humanities people. Professor Kavathas and Sarah Bertino are also great.",
    "Take this course because it will make you feel more confident in the science of global health while expanding your knowledge of its history. It's super fun and engaging!",
    "Great science credit-- not gut in any ways but not too difficult and very interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a science credit; the information was interesting, the professors were helpful, and the course was formatted in a fun way. The first half of the semester is purely scientific, while the second focuses on literature and art related to diseases, this variation made the class exciting and enjoyable!",
    "Pretty hard to keep up with for the first half of the course, unless you've had a pretty extensive background in cellular biology. Second half of the course is much more interesting and accessible for non-science people.",
    "Immunity and Contagion was a great class because it taught me a lot about the immune system and contagious diseases. I liked how the class was a nice balance of lecture and seminar. The first half of the course was dedicated to the immune system and was pretty sciency. After the midterm, we read interesting books and had discussions. This class was interesting and a great class for someone that is not a science-major, but is not necessarily a gut. The work was not difficult (the problem sets, exam, and papers), but the material taught in lecture was sometimes difficult.",
    "YES.",
    "The first half of the class requires a pretty solid Bio background (like AP Bio). I had no Bio background and struggled a lot."
