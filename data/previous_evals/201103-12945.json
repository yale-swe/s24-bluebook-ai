    "This class is a lot of work, a lot of memorization, and its pretty early in the morning. If you aren't a morning person, stay away.",
    "Ancient Greek 110 is designed to cover the basics of Greek grammar in a semester. It equips one with the necessary understanding of Greek syntax and grammar required for the reading of beginning Greek texts.I really enjoyed this course and I would definitely recommend it to another student interested in either Classics or in Directed Studies, especially one who already has a working understanding of Latin grammar.",
    "If you're interested in learning Attic Greek and Jessica is the teacher, now is the time to do so. In general, the material is enjoyable and manageable, but if, like me, you've very little language experience, it can be particularly difficult sometimes and with quizzes every week one has to make a point of not getting behind.",
    "If you want to learn ancient Greek take this class. Just be ready to put in a lot a lot of work.",
    "It is a lot of work, but you will learn a lot of Greek. I don't recommend it if you are not quite committed to the language, but if you are it is worth the requisite effort.",
    "Take it if you have a reason. Its a lot of work to do on a whim."
