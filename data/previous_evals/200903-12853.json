    "The coordination was very good. The ability to talk with specialists was very helpful.",
    "some coordination w thomas auer. poor landscape experts. no coordination with structural experts",
    "The studio incorporated a major part of landscape design and sustainability issues that were important to the design process.",
    "Great studio overall. Excellent range of scales from urban to detailed wall sections. I wish stephan were there more often rather than just there for 2\/3 days at a time every 2-3 weeks. The conference call is a good experience- once, but can never come close to replacing an actual desk crit. John was available a good deal and helped to bring the final phase of the projects into focus- lineweights, presentation prep. etc. I would have liked a bit more design guidance from both John&Stephan. what they did offer was sometimes contradictory.",
    "The studio was very successful in terms of its integration with landscape architecture, structures, and sustainability. The semester began with a urban plan that was carried out as a studio. This phase could have benefited from consultations with landscape architects and urban planners. Once we began designing our buildings however, we had multiple consultations with Thomas Auer and a landscape architect from Steve Stimson's Boston office. Both John and Stefan made structural recommendations early in the design process that were very helpful.",
    "The studio successfully combined architecture with the disciplines of landscape design and sustainability."

   "comments": [
    "Video conferences were used in place of desk crits. these were not helpful because it is a difficult format in which to get timely feedback and physical instruction. the time spent preparing drawings specifically for the VC was not worth the amount of feedback gained during the conf.",
    "exposure to level at which stephan practices the decipline was the most valuable. other studio had NO critical outlook on architecture, the was no pushback.",
    "The desk crits were the most helpful part of the studio, we were able to meet with various critics to discuss the different areas of design such as landscape and environmental design. The reviews were less helpful than the desk crits.",
    "the outside experts were wonderful. from the time with Thomas in Muninch to his desk crits as well as the lanscape architect from Steve stimsons office. both were valuable meetings. Good mid term critics as well. much more helpfull\/ thoughtful than the final jury.",
    "Stefan and John advocated using desk crits throughout the semester and these were very effective. Selfishly, it would have been interesting to see other groups' projects in a pin-up format, but we did this on an informal basis in studio anyway. Having one-on-one time with Stefan and John more than made up for this. The tele-conferences with Stefan were surprisingly helpful. Consultations with landscape consultants and Thomas Auer were invaluable.",
    "This was an incredibly valuable studio 1. for the way it integrated sustainability and design from the very beginning 2. for the emphasis placed on site analysis through the elaboration of a master plan 3. for how interesting and challenging the brief was - a museum for the 21st century in Munich. The desk crits with visiting specialists Thomas Auer and designers from Studio Steven Stimsonwere invaluable. The emphasis on desk crits was altogether appropriate, ensuring we made maximum use of our time with the critics. The mid term jury was excellent - critical and supportive at once, while the final jury did leave something to be desired - a little too prone to focus on a detail of a project instead of discussing the larger ambitions and assessing whether they were realized or not."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of the studio as a pedagogical tool",
   "comments": [
    "there was too much emphasis on production and not enough time lent to design development. I was docked for exploring alternate designs too late in the semester.",
    "we tried a little bit of everything- masterplanning, environmental, landscape etc. but therewas little to no idealogoical principals driving the studio",
    "I thought it was a great format for the studio. I agree with stephans approach to continue to move from one scale down to a more refined and detailed scale every week or two. i also really enjoyed the group master plan exercise to start off with. very helpful discussions amongst the students and profs alike. also- good to allow for some groups to form and other to work solo.",
    "Phenomenal. Stefan made it clear that he views architecture as an auto-didactic discipline. This translated into a studio in which each individual or group was free to pursue their own interests with the guidance and support of the critics. While this was initially an adjustment from other studios where each meeting has a list of deliverables, it created an environment where the onus was on the students to bring up issue they were grappling with and encouraged them to ask the right questions to get the most out of John and Stefan. This way of working engendered an independence of mind and self-reliance that are a much more reflective of the profession itself. Overall the studio felt professional, the standards were high and the students felt invested and accountable for their own work.",
    "The studio was brilliantly paced with a generous four weeks spent on master planning, allowing for a thorough analysis of the site and the possibility of working in large teams, all followed by two solid weeks of design for a museum before midterms, which gave us a chance to run first concepts by a jury. Then we had six weeks to develop our concepts and project our ideas for the museum into a large-scale detail. The opportunity to work at different scales - from master planning to wall detail - was invaluable."

   "comments": [
    "i expected more emphasis on research orideas and less emphasis on basic skills. Yale seems limited to small thinking. the project was a contemporary art museum and john eberhart doesnt know who jeff koons is. this is an endemic problem at ysoa.",
    "I had high expectations for this studio and all were exceeded. The studio was valuable to me in that it allowed me to explore the areas of design and reach a level of resolution that were never possible with shorter projects.",
    "All exceeded.",
    "All expectations for the for the studio were surpassed. I developed as a designer, model-maker and draughtsman and produced a design I believe in."

   "comments": [
    "The assistant teacher was the main weakness of this studio. he does not have appropriate theoretical knowledge to teach an advanced studio especially one where the studio head is not in the country. He has some good technical knowledge but as a yale student paying the price to attend yale, i expect a much much much much more advanced teacher for an advance studio. I dont think the assistant teacher is qualified to teach advanced studio and i very much hope for students sake in the future that he is not allowed to teach advanced studio again.",
    "behnisch was concerned with pragmatics and john isnt qualified to make-up on the critical end. Projects across the board were safe and dull. the was no angle for research\/ theory.",
    "Professor Behnisch was extremely helpful and receptive, he was interested in helping us realize our design goals to the fullest.",
    "Stephan was great, very thorough knowledge and explanations of env.systems. lacking in design critique.John- helpful on the details, getting the drawings to full resolution etc. but lacking in design feedback",
    "Stefan:He was a consummate professional when it came to teaching. A very talented and experienced architect with a temperament that instilled respect and reverence among all members of the studio. The best studio teacher I have had, and an incredible asset to the school.John:John was instrumental in Stefan's success as a studio head. He offered great advise and guidance when needed, but also knew when back off and let ideas develop on their own accord.",
    "Stefan Behnisch is am exquisite teacher, with no over-bearing pedagogical agenda other than to understand the design intentions of his students and to help them develop the full potential of their designs. He is an excellent listener, an intellectually honest critic, ready to engage a project at any level - conceptual, technical, presentational. I would happily take another studio with Stefan. John Eberhardt was an amazing assistant, diligent in facilitating video conferences with Stefan when he was away, otherwise always available and ready to give support and excellent advice on design, sustainability and presentation. It was invluable having him in the studio, of course, for the assistance he gave us in digital technologies as well. A good tandem, Behnisch and Eberhardt."
