    "Hindi 101 is an intense, but worthwhile introduction to Hindi. It is difficult for a complete beginner to take, but it is definitely a class that can be mastered if the time and effort is put in.",
    "Hindi 110 is an elementary Hindi course. Starting with no hindi knowledge, a student can learn a lot over the semester from a new alphabet and script, new vocabulary, and a number of working tenses. I would recommend the course because you can learn a lot.",
    "TAKE IT. There's about fourty-five minutes to an hour of homework a night and if you take the time to do it well it's extremely rewarding. I looked forward to reading the Hindi textbook. The material in the book is concise and clear and the teachers really polish off your understanding in class. There are sometimes the class structure gets iffy, but if you stick to the textbook and ask questions in class you'll learn a lot of Hindi. Also Swapna Ji invites you to her house for dinner! Honestly, take it just for that meal...",
    "Yes, if you have interest in Hindi."
