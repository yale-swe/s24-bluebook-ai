    "Directed Studies Literature spring term was a wonderful introduction to the literature of the western canon post Petrarch. The works were chosen to ensure a feeling of continuity and flow as the course progressed. I feel after taking this course that I acquired a surprisingly deep understanding of the works despite the large number of works studied. I would definitely recommend taking this course, especially if you are looking or a seminar-based course.",
