    "Requires a lot of work and dedication. Fascinating material.",
    "If you get in, you have to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. It's a great way to meet very interesting students across Yale's different schools. The course has a comprehensive AND focused approach to \"strategy.\" This is often hard to find because discussions on strategy usually come with classes that have broader topics.",
    "Transformative. Yes.",
    "You'll be glad you took it. There is a lot of reading, and I recommend you really invest the time in doing it, otherwise you won't get as much out of the course. Also, if you are not a history or classics major (like myself), you might want to invest extra time in some of the works. I felt like I was at a disadvantage because I hadn't done any of the readings before, and even though they try to have a class with diverse academic interests, it didn't seem valued very much.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in politics, diplomacy, economics or military issues and how these factors relate to history. I would dissuade anyone who was largely swayed by the prestige of the course.",
    "+ Course is a series of lectures on 'big man' history.- Walter Russell Mead did a particularly poor job in discussing colonial history - with an overemphasis on contemporary events. History should be able to stand on its own two feet. Clearly not engaged, WRM actually *yawned* twice during the ensuing discussion. This is when Paul Kennedy's absence was most obvious.+ Minh could not have been more helpful. The stars of this course are: Gaddis, Kennedy, and Minh - and to some degree, Hill. There would be no value to this course without their contributions.- The tropes become a bit tiresome, then students get marked down for returning to the same tropes in essays.- Would *not* recommend the course to peers."
