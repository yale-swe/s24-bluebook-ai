    "If you are at all interested in architecture, take this course. Weekly sketchbook assignments, one paper, and two design projects. there is literally no reason to go to lectures or do any of the readings, but you should do both anyway (especially lecture because it's AMAZING). you don't have to be any sort of artist to take this class; it's an opportunity to explore with different medias in a way that no other art class at Yale allows you to do. Seriously though, go to lecture.",
    "If you're horrible at drawing, don't take this class. Otherwise, go for it, and enjoy it. Put your heart in it and you'll be fine. The only frustrating thing is that you will never know how well or how badly you're doing in the course -- even the one paper we had to write for the class came back without a grade on it. Otherwise, it's great. If you are ok with spending a lot of time drawing, then go for it. It's a great balance between paper-writing, readings, and problem sets.",
    "The class grading system is a little obscure. You never really know what your grade is. So if that bothers you maybe this class isnt for you.",
    "Lecture is the best part so go, but if you can't make a few it doesn't matter because there aren't any exams. Weekly drawing assignments could sometimes be annoying and time consuming.",
    "You draw once a week... pretty simple",
    "absolutely. even if they weren't interested in architecture, this is an excellent class.",
    "YES! It's a really different course from other courses at Yale, particularly intro courses. Lectures are always awesome. For homework, Professor Purves assigns readings and sketchbook drawings. No one really does the readings, though they're really, really interesting, if sometimes dense or super artsy. The sketchbook drawings are really fun, and you get more out of them if you put in a lot of effort (and how much effort you put in is usually very visible to the TFs and Professor Purves, who personally reviews all the sketchbooks). Discussing the sketchbook assignments takes up all of section usually. Then there is one short paper, which is really fun to write because you can be artsy and experiment with different writing techniques. Last there are two design problems: both really fun and time consuming. Again, you can tell how much effort you put in! Overall, manageable workload, really fun and different course, and really meaningful in presenting a new way to think about theworld.",
    "A wonderfully engaging course\u0097I took it at 9:25 am but never once was tempted to doze off during Purves' lectures. You go through a lot of material and concepts, but Alec presents it in a concise, clear and VISUAL manner. Visual learners will love this class, since you are expected to have a high sketch-to-writing ratio in your note-taking. No matter where you're at on the drawing-skill spectrum, you'll build on your abilities in a low-pressure environment, and notice yourself developing a unique style, which molds itself particularly well with the later assignments (all of which are really superb). TAs are hit-and-miss, guest lectures are mostly great. TAKE IT!!!",
    "This is a pretty good class. If you have interest in buildings, our relationship with them, general aesthetics, or just want to enjoy walking around Yale and the world a bit more, it should engage you. There isn't necessarily one dominant theme the class builds on so I don't think it'll drastically change your views, but it does open you up to a new genre and teach you to \"see\", as Purves says early on. Drawing can be a nice change of pace from the rest of work at Yale too and is a great way to become more observant of buildings.",
    "Architecture 150 is a great introductory course. It includes weekly sketchbook assignments, one design project, one paper, and a final design project or paper. Each week, there are two lectures focusing on themes and one section with graduate teaching fellows, where the sketchbook assignments are talked about. There are also some great guest lecturers and a final review of the design project. I would highly recommend the course to students whether or not they are considering the architecture major, as long as they are prepared to devote enough time to the sketchbook assignments and other projects. I found that I wanted to spend more time on them as the semester went on.",
    "This class is a great introduction to architecture. Professor Purves is a great professor and has really interesting lectures. The majority of the assignments are drawing problems, and although no previous experience is necessary, it would be advisable to take some, as TA's can be pretty critical. Rest assured, they're patient and are there to help you improve :)",
    "This is a great class. Lectures are a pleasure and the assignments are fun and force you to think creatively. It's a nice change of pace in homework as opposed to reading or problem sets. It forces you to think in a different way.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are interested and good at drawing. This is for architecture major students so it may be tough if you are not one.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in architecture (as it is a prerequisite to the major) and for people interested in taking a well-taught humanities course.",
    "Take it.",
    "yes. it is a great class in which you will do things you do not normally do. it is interesting and makes you engage with the world around you. it is not a lot of work , however there are spurts of LOTS of work. also, if you are not artistically inclined (i am not particuarly) it is definitely a bit of a challenge.",
    "I would for sure recommend Arch 150 to another student, obviously for those who want to pursue architecture, but also for those who are just interested in learning more about the subject. It's not too demanding of a class, and is a nice change of pace from the other classes you'll have on your plate.",
    "Architecture 150 is a class that teaches you how to observe in the context of buildings. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. Even if you aren't sure if you have any interest in architecture, it is a class that will definitely give you a new perspective on the world. Purves is one of the best lecturers that I've had here.",
    "Yes I definitely would. Great way to see what architecture is all about",
    "You need to take this class. This is one of those courses that changes the way you see the world. The drawing assignments were incredibly rewarding, the readings were interesting and the lectures were always compelling. Profesor Purves is wonderful, and one of my biggest regrets of the semester is that I slept in and missed the urban design II lecture. Each week you are told to go with your sketchbook out into the city and to make drawings which emphasize qualities such as light, structure and enclosure. These assignments were always a perfect break from my other coursework. I also really loved my section. My final project in this class, a 10+ page paper on the urban design of downtown New Haven, was one of the most satisfying things I've done at Yale. If I had taken this class earlier, I probably would have applied to the Architecture major on the strengths of this class alone.",
    "Yes, take this class if you're interested. It's exactly what it sounds like--a wide introduction to architecture. It's not a history class and it's not a math class. It's an introduction to architecture.",
    "Absolutely. Even if you're not interested in being an architecture major, take it as a 4th or 5th class, or for the humanities credit.",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale (coming from a Bio major). The lecture is amazing, and Purves really knows what he's talking about. I expected this to be somewhat of an architecture history course but it isn't. Every week you talk about a certain aspect of architecture, such as natural light, materials, or groupings. I was afraid that my inability to draw would make this impossible, but I definitely got better as the semester went along and it seems to be based mostly on improvement anyways. Cannot recommend this course more highly.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. The drawing assignments make a good break from all the papers and psets i had. Though looking back at the lectures, it is hard to say what I have really learned from this class, because each lecture provides a little insight into a specific topic but does not go any deeper. Overall, the class does make me want to take more classes on architecture and i am considering the major at this point.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the arts; it is excellent. I am not an art or architecture major, so the weekly sketchbook assignments were challenging and at times time-consuming. But it was completely worth it. The class makes you think about spaces differently, and Professor Purves\u0092s knowledge of theory and history is incredible. Having section in Rudolph Hall with two School of Architecture students\u0097who design buildings in foreign countries for their homework\u0097was a treat. There were two design problems: the first was a small model, and the second a lampshade. Several School of Architecture professors together critique the lampshades. While some students found this intimidating, I loved it. It felt like watching aesthetes walk through a museum. Ultimately, the course has something for everyone, whether in history, theory, or design.",
    "Definitely take it if you ever had any thoughts about being an Architecture major or even any remote interest in space, form, function, anything. It's a great course.",
    "Brief summary of architectural theory, techniques, and patterns through out history. Lectures are really interesting--Professor Purves shows pictures of buildings from the past and the present and you dont have to just write everything he says down, instead all you have to do is make a few sketches of the buildings shown. One drawing assignment per week, two models you have to build, and one paper. Such a reasonable but incredibly enjoyable class. TAKE IT WHETHER YOU LIKE ART OR NOT!!!!",
    "This was an incredibly worthwhile class and I would definitely recommend it- I'm now considering the major, which I wasn't before. You won't know your grade at all until the end of the term, so that's something to take into consideration. But you will learn and grow so much, seeing the architecture around you in a different way. Make sure to get a section with good TAs- they can make or break the experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Whether or not you plan on majoring in architecture, this course will change the way you see the world. Each lecture is captivating - Purves is a boss! Plan some time to do the assignments if you don't want to be disappointed by yourself in section though. People really get into it, and its awesome to have a body of work you're proud of at the end of the semester.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn a whole new way of looking at the world, and acquire a visual vocabulary that is applicable across disciplines. Assignments are a joy. I actually looked forward to them. I spent hours on the final because I wanted to rather than because I had to. Some variation in the quality of the class depending on section leaders, but not much. They're all great--not to mention very diplomatic in their critiques of your drawings.",
    "One of the best humanities credits. No final. Problem sets are drawings and take about 4 hours per week. Take it.",
    "Purves' lectures are wonderful, they really make you see the world in a different way. The assignments are generally great, TAs are hit or miss (but most are good) - I actually liked section because we went over drawings and projects and the TAs were helpful. You don't ever need to do the readings. The class is pretty much you get out of it what you put into it. And I have no idea how it's graded - I took it CR\/D and got a much better grade than I anticipated, mostly because there's literally no letter grade feedback until your final grade.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who wants to understand the spaces we live in and to engage with the built environment more closely, which we often forget about. The class has made me more aware of my surroundings, which has made me appreciate human civilization more. Also doing sketchbook assignments and models is a great alternative to writing papers and doing problem sets. This class is great for a better liberal arts education.",
    "This is a fantastic course. Take it if you want to improve your drawing or see the buildings around you in a different way. You don't have to be an architecture major (or a good drawer) to take it.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in architecture. Don't take it because of the evaluation or you might hate it. Basically if you can draw, it's an easy and fun class for you. If you cannot, you will suffer for a while and then find yourself improved a lot. The lectures are very rewarding if you can get up in time.",
    "It is a great introduction to the field and can help see if you are interested in architecture. The homework is mostly to complete several drawings for each section and reading, which you don't need to do, but is very interesting.",
    "YES TAKE IT. Even if you don't intend to major in architecture. Plenty of juniors and seniors take it just for fun.",
    "Take this course. I didn't know how to draw (still really don't) but it's amazing to be able to express and explore creativity. I don't think I'll find a class like this again. Even if you don't want to major in Architecture, take it!",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class. The lectures have changed the way I walk around campus, and have converted me into an architecture major. Purves is good-natured, obviously passionate about the subject, cute, and knowledgable. It's not that much work, though putting more time into the assignments will make you prouder of the outcome. Assignments are fun! As is the final. Readings are also pretty interesting, though we didn't really have to do them since we don't go over them in sections that much. Section was fun too- you get to see everyone else's work.",
    "I took this course Credit-D, which was probably unnecessary, but I didn't have the time to pour hours into my sketchbook. It's the only thing you're graded on, besides one short paper and the final critique (on the lampshade project, which is pretty cool). But it was worth it regardless, particularly for the lectures - Alexander Purves is undoubtedly one of the best lecturers at Yale. More than anything, this course teaches you how to LOOK at architecture - it's not a history course, nor are you supposed to write down names and dates and all of that. Instead, Purves insists that your notebook functions only as a sketchbook. I appreciate architecture across genres far more now that I thought possible at the beginning of the semester. Fantastic course - if you shop even one lecture, you'll be convinced. It's also unlike anything else I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes yes yes. Recommended. Purves is wonderful, and the rare instructor who can convey how much he cares about his students even in a lecture setting.I took it credit-d, and I enjoyed that because it gave me the liberty to explore and make mistakes without worrying about grading. I would, however, recommend that even if you take it credit d GO TO LECTURE and sketch as much as you can, because it is a blast and changes the way you look at buildings and think about conveying information.",
    "I was pretty disappointed with the class. I would not recommend it for someone who's looking for a fun, different kind of class. The TA's seemed to expect that everyone taking this class was potential architecture majors and thus should devote over 15-20 hours to their weekly sketchbook work (and many did). Assignments were given with little direction, and we never received feedback on how well we were doing in the class."
