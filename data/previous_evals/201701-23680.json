    "I am a more confident speaker and writer. My grammar skills significantly grew.",

   "comments": [
    "This class is a typical L4 Spanish class. It was taught well and had a decent mix of activities to keep class every day engaging.",
    "The strength was the readings and novel. The weakness was the composition on the exams. I feel that it took up a lot of time resulting in a lack of time to answer the grammar questions and review answers.",
    "Meeting 5 days a week helps build speaking\/reading\/listening ability but can be very demanding. Feedback was helpful and frequent. Can be boring at times for students not interested in learning about cultural aspects of Spanish speaking countries.",
    "I thought the class time was very unproductive because we would spend the whole time doing the same textbook exercises that we had just done for homework on supersite the night before. I became much better at understand spanish both listening and reading, but I think practicing more conversational spanish would have helped me a lot because I still don't feel like I can speak very well unless I have prepared for what I'm going to say (i.e a presentation).",
    "This is a very well-run and organized course. The tests and quizzes were fairly difficult.",
    "Strengths are the professors that are chill, errything else a weakness."

    "Only take it if you want to become more proficient with your Spanish ability.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get better at speaking Spanish.",
