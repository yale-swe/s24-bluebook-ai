    "I learned how to write an annotated bibliography, how to write a literary analysis, how to narrow my thesis topic, and how to present my research to a room full of people unfamiliar with my topic!",
    "Definitely learned how to format a thesis, do a comprehensive literature review, and overall organize my thoughts.",
    "Worked on my thesis and learned how to narrow down my topic and write solid scholarly work",
    "I learned about a location and subject matter that Id had basically no exposure to before, and on top of that I think my conception of individual research has deepened immensely. I also feel much more confident about reviewing literature now."

    "Senior Colloquium is really useful in that it keeps you on your toes and holds you accountable. I found the deadlines annoying, but necessary; I wouldn't have gotten nearly as much done with my thesis otherwise! While weekly discussions were not so useful, I enjoyed reading over my classmates' materials, as well as small-group or one-on-one meetings with my Colloquium adviser.",
    "The main strength was definitely the colloquium advisors.",
    "It's good to have the class meeting time so that we can discuss with each other our projects and get to know each other better, but also some of the time would have been useful for actually working on our theses. Also sometimes deadlines would come early in the week, meaning short turn around from when we discussed previous work to handing in something else\/",
    "The seminar part of the colloquium was a bit pointless after the first month or two, but the research process itself is very well guided but also very demanding on individual effort. As a result this past semester has been really rewarding."

    "Seeing as this is a required course for the EVST major, there's no choice in the matter whether you take it or not! That being said, I found the class fun, and a great way to get to know fellow majors better. The fall retreat to the Adirondacks was an absolute BLAST--try to go on it if you can.",
    "I really enjoyed the colloquium because you get to hear about other EVST projects and what people are passionate about. Also the professors really do everything they can to help you succeed.",
    "Chill class, youll obviously be in it if youre an EVST major. A great time to bond with other people in your (admittedly small) major that you might not have met or gotten a chance to know before!",
    "With a good topic and a good advisor this will be a great experience. Ive read so much, learned about a location and subject matter I had very little exposure to before, and I take a huge amount of pride in the product of my efforts."
