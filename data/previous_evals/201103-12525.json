   "comments": [
    "An interesting class, though most likely a requirement for you. Certainly a worthwhile class, especially if you like math. If you are more of a computer science person you might want to look at CPSC 202 instead, but I enjoyed 244. This class does not give you knowledge, but teaches you how to think in a certain way. Make sure you put in the time to actually understand what's going on and you might find yourself pretty interested. 80% Combinatorics, 20% Graph Theory. 40% HW (around 10 of them), 20% Midterm (not too hard), 40% Final (mostly another version of the midterm with a bit of graph theory thrown in).",
    "Understand the homework sets (solutions were posted online), you'll be fine. Not too much work, but don't put off the homework until the last minute.",
    "I would recommend the class for those with little experience in proofs who would like to get better. It also does a good job of making sure you understand concepts as opposed to mindless memorization.",
    "good class",
    "Math 244 is a broad introduction to discrete math. It focuses primarily on combinatorics and gets into graph theory at the end. I wouldn't take this unless it's required: the material is useful but very dry.",
    "Decent class. Material is really easy, Osipov teaches it slowly and repeats it a lot. Generally speaking you'll enjoy the class because it isn't too hard, a lot of the material is sort of neat (graph theory etc.), and the homeworks are really light. That said, if you're looking for a hardcore super serious complex analysis-like course, this isn't the course for you. It's a pretty superficial covering of discrete math.. you'll gain some cool facts and a bit of proof skill, but that's about it.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. Everyone thought it was better than CS202 if you're thinking of choosing that one. Much more material, but still easy. Final was not easy though",
    "The class is essentially like contest math for credit. Many of the problems are interesting and enjoyable to solve, and the weekly assignments don't take up too much time.",
    "A good course for learning combinatorics and graph theory. Not too hard and interesting.",
    "Discrete math seems to be different every year, depending on the instructor. (There have been three different instructors in the past four years, I think.) With Professor Osipov, we spent a lot of time covering combinatorics and probability, and less time covering graph theory. The assignments started out very easy but got tricky fast. Only about half the homework problems were proofs, so the course was generally more applied. (In contrast, I've heard previous years were almost entirely theoretical\/proof-based graph theory.) Lectures were very followable and the homeworks and exams pretty reasonable. Probably a lot of the material is redundant for people who did a lot of competition math in high school. I would certainly recommend this course, but since it varies so much, it's probably worth it to shop it\/get ahold of the syllabus\/talk to the professor to make sure it's appropriate for you. Definitely a good class for CS majors!",
    "Yes I'd recommend it to a math major.",
    "Discrete math is a really cool class. The material is extremely interesting and the course gives a very good introduction to proofs. The homeworks and exams are also very straightforward. Definitely a solid math class.",
    "The problem sets take a long time but the exams are very well written. The teaching is average but Osipov is friendly and available\/able to explain concepts outside of class.",
    "Better than the Computer Science alternative, with some very interesting and useful things -- like solving recurrence relations. The course started out very slow, but then sped up to where you would expect a math course to be. Very fair and representative homework and exams.",
    "Started off very very slowly\/poorly, but as the semester rolled on (and, as I think, the material got more interesting), Andrei really hit his stride. The beginning stuff was a bit too easy, I would say, and I wish we had spent a bit more time on graph theory because it is so applicable.Definitely a class worth taking, not only if you are interested in puzzle-like problems, but also because it teaches you how to think in a way unlike any other math class. There is a huge emphasis on lateral thinking and relating new problems to ones you've seen before, and I think that is a great skill to have.",
    "I took this class as a fun course for my senior year, and it was, fun that is. The material is much more relatable than other math courses like set theory or probability. There's a lot of combinatorics and not quite enough graph theory, but the textbook is excellent for your shelf and you can peruse the graph theory for yourself.",
    "As it is a required course for some majors, many students cannot choose whether or not to take the class. I do recommend, however, that students shop the classbecause the professor changes every year (and therefore the structure of the class and material covered changes). Professor Osipov focused on combinatorics and did an overview of graph theory. It is not the most exciting class, but if you dedicate time to it, it can really change the way you think. It differs from other proof-based math classes in the department in that it really hones the different ways to approach proofs. With Professor Osipov, I would recommend the class as he is a very concise lecturer.",
    "Yes I will, especially if you are interested in thinking about these problems.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you like mathematics, not really a for fun course.",
    "Math 244 is a relatively interesting, relatively easy course. If you've had no prior exposure, it is a good way to appreciate math that is not calculus; it is a very beautiful branch of math. It serves as agood platform if you want a challenge, but to get the most possible out of it, you'll want to do problems from the textbook for fun. Take it to be a better mathematician, computer scientist, or gambler!",
    "Most of mathematics curriculum takes you through a set sequence (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus...), but a lot remains unexplored. This class takes you through a lot of the different unexplored areas, but at a pretty basic level. If you've done much extracurriculur math before, it should be a pretty easy class. If you haven't, it can be a lot of ground.That said, if you pay attention in class, it really goes pretty slowly, so it's not hard to keep up. It can just be a bit hard to pay attention, because it is so slow and because Osipov is a pretty bad lecturer.As far as content, it's like 9 weeks of combinatorics, so if you've done some probability before, don't sweat the class.",
    "If you enjoy proof-based mathematics then this is a pretty good class. The workload is not too bad, around 6 hours a week. Unlike analysis and other calculus based mathematics, I found discrete math to be much more elegant. Sometimes you can't help but admire a really slick solution that you found or saw from someone else. If you are trying to decide between this class and CPSC 202, this is probably more difficult but also more rewarding in my opinion.",
    "A good (but rigorous) introduction to proofs-based mathematics. The problem sets are weekly and vary wildly in difficulty (ranging from doable in-class in weeks 1 to 3 to 5-7 hour proofs marathons for me), although they count for 40% and the exams are much simpler. Andrei Osipov is a pretty typical math lecturer, clear but somewhat dull. Take this class if you want to try proofs and actually spend time on it. Don't necessarily take it if you're a computer science major, as it is somewhat less relevant to the major than the CPSC version.",
    "A pretty general and not-too-difficult sampling of combinatorics (first) and graph theory, and a great course for people without proofs-based math backgrounds. The class's content could be a bit easy and dry at times, and Prof. Osipov, while clear, has a rather sleep-inducing voice. However, overall, the content is what you need to know and well-taught. Much heavier on combinatorics than graph theory, however.For combinatorics, we covered simple choosing\/permutation, proof by induction\/contradiction (great for people without background in proofs-based mathematics), generating functions, sequences, and Catalan numbers. Graph theory included matching (Hall's theorem), bipartite graphs, planar graphs, trees, and various proofs thereof. Pretty rigorous, but just right for CS majors good at math yet without too much intensive math background."
