    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students. The way the course was structured was extremely helpful in terms of thinking about how to break down the work of research projects. The subject matter -- saints -- was also very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student specializing in medieval history, though not for a non-medievalist.",
    "This class is primarily an exploration of different approaches to historical research concerning the middle ages, couched (in this case) in questions about Medieval Saints. One learns both about the general issues surrounding medieval historical inquiry, and about the specific history of Sainthood.I would highlyrecommend the course. Obviously, I certain knowledge of Latin is required, so I would recommend the course to those who had the basic skill set!"
