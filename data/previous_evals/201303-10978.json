   "comments": [
    "Take this section of 125, especially if you are a Freshman or this is your first experience with English at Yale. Professor Frank is, on the outside, a lovely and kind woman who leads interesting yet not altogether earth shattering discussions. But, on the inside, she's absolutely brilliant and will help you at every turn in your writing (with a very generous grading system I'd say). Also, important to note the difference in finals policies for the various sections. This one I found to be incredibly fair and relevant, whereas others included lots of rote memorization worth up to 60% of the final grade. Overall, a very enjoyable class.",
    "English 125 is a standard English class. I wouldn't recommend it for people just looking to fulfill a writing requirement. Chaucer and Donne were interesting reads, but Spenser dragged on after a while.",
    "Survey course of two horrible, boring authors, and two good authors. Don't take it whatever you do.",
    "A close look at specific works for Chaucer and Spenser, and selected close readings of Shakespeare's sonnets and Donne's poems. I would definitely recommend this course - I had not heard of any of the authors besides Shakespeare before, and now I feel like I have an understanding of three English writers that I would not otherwise have been exposed to.",
    "Definitely take this class, and take it with Professor Frank. The process of taking apart the language and themes of poetry that is beautiful, riveting, and iconic (love my Redcrosse Knight!) is incredibly valuable and eye-opening. I always came out of class discussions with a new perspective. Professor Frank is amazing - very knowledgeable and passionate about the poetry, and simply a wonderful person as well.",
    "A survey of Chaucer, Spenser's, and Donne's great works, with a small showing of Shakespeare's sonnets. Yes, on the condition that he or she wishes to be an English major or enjoys the period.",
    "I would not recommend this class to non-English Majors or for someone's first English class. 120 is much more interesting and really helps develop writing skills, I would recommend that over 125 any day. Alternatively this is a requirement for the Major and that being said it isn't terrible. Sometimes it gets boring but overall I am glad that I took the course and found some sections to be extremely interesting.",
    "If you're taking this course as a prereq for the English major: go for it because A) you have to and B) the poetry is actually a lot of un. Professor Frank guides you through, and while the poems increase in complexity the language decreases, so by the time you've reached Donne it will feel like a breeze.If you're taking this course because you love poetry: good for you! The poems and passages selected provide a solid foundation for further study, and Professor Frank has a lot of interesting insights to make.",
    "English 125 offers a brief, catalogue introduction to a few of the major poets in the English canon. Because of the way this class is structured, it can often feel that the curriculum just moves down a checklist, crossing off one poet and poem after another as a sort of obligation, without really diving into any text deeply. That said, it is not a bad course. Some of the poems are truly beautiful, and you will leave the semester with verses ringing in your head. I'm not sure that I would necessarily recommend English 125 to another student, but since it's a prerequisite for the English major (which is why I took the course), that point seems irrelevant. If you are going to take or need to take 125, I would recommend taking it with Prof. Frank, since she is an insightful and sensitive professor who makes the semester worthwhile.",
    "English 125 is an excellent class to take if you are an English major. You must read these poets to consider yourself fully educated as an English major. However, search for a section that has a lot of class discussion. You will then be pushed to really understand the poets and their work. I would recommend this class to a fellow English major, but I would caution them to find a section that fits."
