   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provided a great opportunity to engage in community-based work and apply skills learned at YSPH on the community level.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. There was a lot I gained from it: the ability to work in teams, opportunity to partner with a community organization, gain qualitative skills, and managing communications with multiple people. I think it is great because it gives great practical experience.",
    "Great course for me to interact with people outside the academy. However, heavy workload since I do have certain background knowledge. Maybe the group selection process could be more flexible or having students send a simple resume or proposal for certain project to see if they fit. (Downside: may increase much workload on the instructor or TA)",
    "This was a really great course and give me a good exposure to working with communities to do public health research. I really liked working with my group and my preceptor so it definitely translated into an overall positive experience in the class. Some critiques: I think more working days and skills sessions would be helpful during the course. I want this course to be year long!!! I think we would be able to make an even bigger impact by having more time to work with and engage in these communities. A whole semester seems like a lot of time, but it really isn't! We definitely didn't get everything done to the extent we would have wanted due to these time constraints.",
    "The strength of the course is its practice-based nature, and I learned a lot about doing research in the field of public health. Weakness is that the course load is too much considering the length of the semester, but I guess everybody made it work somehow.",
    "The class is very well intentioned and attempts to provide students with an opportunity to work closely with community members. However, the level of satisfaction ranges vastly based on what project you were assigned to, and the time management of the instructor can be greatly improved. There were too many classes that spent time on topics that students were already familiar with (or could have read about before class), when the project groups really could have used time to work as groups. Since there is so much work assigned, it is unrealistic to expect students to find all that time outside of class. Moreover, communications regarding assignment deadlines and expectations tended to come too close to the deadline. Finally, more class time should be spent on writing the final report. It took an unreasonably long amount of time when all students were extremely busy with other finals. The timing of the final presentation on the last possible day of finals period was also inconvenient.",
    "This class is only worth it if you very interested in the project that you are working with. You hardly get in class time to work on the project and your class times are used to go through very \"fluffy\" topics like group dynamics and respecting the community you are working with. Of course these things are important, but they felt very elementary and a waste of time.",
    "The strengths of the course were primarily in the instructors and the TAs. They were also available to talk and help advise in the projects. Much of the success of the projects are in large part due to their constant support throughout the process. However, sometimes the work related to the course was slightly overwhelming on top of the already present responsibilities and work related to the projects. Making quizzes open notes might be a bit helpful and ease some of the burden.",
    "You feel accomplished by the end of the semester, but this is certainly a challenging course.",
    "The class provided an excellent framework for engaging in a community based-group project that resulted in a powerful learning experience. I do however feel that the end of the class veered off course. I wish that our final presentation had not been to the class, but to the community organizations we worked with. There should be more structure in place for final deliverables to make sure that they are clearly communicated and usefully designed for the community organization.",
    "Strength - leaving the class with many skill sets, challenged to reach new lengths with work load, learning new communication processes, worked with community partners, great professor-student and TA-student dynamics, great course Weakness - distribution of workload Ways to improve - consequences for students who do not pull share of work, consistent check ins with students individually",
    "It is an excellent exposure to community health research",
    "The strength of this course is that you get practical experience. However, it often felt disorganized and I didn't feel like class time was useful.",
    "I think the overall class is great but some of the class sessions were a little redundant and boring. Having the students work on such amazing and valuable projects is worthwhile and impactful.",
    "Great course if you are interested in learning how to work with a community organization\/partner and with a team of fellow students in conducting research. It required a lot of outside-of-class work.",
    "I liked being able to apply what we learned in class.",
    "Strengths: A really great balance of practical skills and broader analyses of the public health field. I felt like I was finally learning actual skills and gaining experience. Weaknesses: I had a hard time knowing how we were doing throughout the course, as 60+ percent of our grades came at the end. I also do not think undergraduates To make the class more fair, groups should have equal numbers of students. Also, students should be encouraged to reflect on their workload and previous commitments before signing up for this class. Students should have to be able to commit a certain number of hours for weekly meetings and site visits.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "This course gave a lot of programmatic skills to students. I really enjoyed its comprehensiveness in connecting the literature we were reading to the type of projects we were all working on. I really enjoyed the environment and intellectual freedom the classroom gave to students."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries was very helpful at providing feedback and support.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0a great person you can learn a lot from.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is great! She is always such a positive force of energy and is always available to assist groups and answer our questions. She has a lot of experience and connections in this field of study and is the perfect instructor for this course.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is a brilliant instructor. I enjoyed participating in her class.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I believe the content of the classes should be reviewed, and allocate much more time on group project work.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries is a caring and invested professor. She clearly demonstrates knowledge in the field of public health, but also has a large heart as she dedicates her time to helping these amazing organizations. Moreover, she is always willing to discuss any challenges or obstacles you may have throughout the semester and consistently provided advice to help guide us. I do feel adding extra scheduled meeting times with Dr. Humphries might have benefited the project as there were a few times when we had questions about the project. Maybe a final check in towards the end of the semester would have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries was phenomenal. She taught a very well rounded curriculum that touched on many nuanced points hugely important to the sensitive dynamics of community-based research. The course could be improved by having a clearer syllabus and more organized dropbox. Sometimes assignment due dates were brought to our attention seemingly out of the blue.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Strength - provided unique and helpful insight on various parts of project, made herself available to every group, showed passion for type of work, cared about students Weakness - wished she checked in with every student to assess how they perceived group dynamics because the outside perception of what is going on is not always how the inner workings of the group are operating Ways to improve - individual check ins, especially when suspicions arise",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She is an excellent teacher.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I didn't have much interaction with Dr. Humphries. I appreciated that she focused on the relationship between academia and community partners, but I often felt like discussions ended up favoring the academic perspective. This makes sense given the fact that she is in academia and we are in a classroom at Yale, but I wish there had been room for more discussions and perspectives that came from a community partner perspective. In this sense, it felt more like the class was maybe geared toward students with no work experience or experience in community based orgs.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I felt as if she truly cared for us and the work we were doing.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Yale needs more professors as passionate and critical as Professor Humphries. She did such an amazing job weaving practical solutions with larger lessons.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very thoughtful and an amazing role model on how to practice ethical community-based public health research",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0The professor has a true understanding of community research and her passion was present during her lectures. Having a really enthusiastic professor made this course very enjoyable. Her philosophies were progressive and emphasized the big picture that is public health. This is an openness more faculty need to have in their courses."

   "comments": [
    "The course provides a great opportunity for community-based work. I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommend this class. Be prepared to do a lot work, but it is worth the experience.",
    "Students wanting some experience with organizations outside the academy.",
    "This course is great for anyone interested in working with CT organizations. There is room for students from all departments, and it makes the course\/projects that much richer when you have a diverse team with a diverse range of interests and public health backgrounds. Very well organized course taught by quality faculty and TAs. It is definitely a decent amount of work, but the concrete deliverables you make at the end and the experience you gain through this course are worth it.",
    "Overall this class is a wonderful opportunity to learn, but also students need to be aware that this is a heavy load class! I would've still taken it anyways but for some students who don't enjoy challenges of this class, this class is not for them.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student. It was an amazing experience and I feel like I have learned many tools and teamwork skills that I would not have otherwise. It also helped introduce me to an amazing non-profit organization which I hope to continue to keep in touch with during my time here at Yale. However, I would caution that whoever does take this class is prepared to give 110% as the course itself has its own assignments on top of the responsibilities and products needed by each project. All in all though, amazing course.",
    "Excellent opportunity to engage with a community based organization on very important research areas. Also excellent opportunity to learn best practices for working in groups.",
    "Great course! Learned an extreme amount of information for a semester's worth of time, and was able to create relationships with community partners and make something that will be useful for them to move their work forwards.",
    "Recommended",
    "I would recommend this to a student if the project was something they were very specifically interested in and if they are of without having a lot of structure. Also, it seems particularly geared toward people with no work experience.",
    "This has been an incredible class. I learned so much from the readings and especially from the work we were doing.",
    "I think this should be a required course for YSPH students.",
    "The best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Great for those interested in hands-on experience!"
