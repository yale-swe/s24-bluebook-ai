    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially to people interested in linguistics as a major. This is a good introduction to what experimentation can look like in linguistics, and if you are interested in brain-language relations, this will give you the background to delve more deeply into research questions. If you've only seen the theoretical side of linguistics, it's worth taking this class to get a more rounded view of the field. If you are looking for a senior essay topic, the thinking involved in formulating an experimental proposal for the final paper will prepare you for that, and your topic could even become your senior essay topic. Prof. Pi\u00f1ango knows her stuff and is helpful outside of class. The course material is interesting. The readings take a bit getting used to if you haven't read a lot of linguistics or experimental papers, but section really helps.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in cognition in regards to language and don't mind working hard.",
    "I would recommend this class as long as you're not looking for an easy class where you don't need to do the reading or don't need to go to class and section. During the first two weeks, I thought I was going to hate this class because it required me to think and work and it was a lot of material I didn't have any experience with, BUT it ended up being the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. As the course progressed, I actually became super interested in the material and wanting to figure out the answers to the neurolinguistics we were discussing (even though I didn't have any prior interest in linguistics) and feeling super satisfied when we learned about a study that did answer the question and tell us more about the field. Dr. Pinango is so great in a small class size setting like this one, where you can interrupt and ask questions whenever. She really cares about you learning the material and will always try to answer your questions. She is also great one-on-one at office hours and listens very patiently to your questions and talks them out with you. You do need to do the readings and stay on top of your work because there's a lot of discussion and you can be called on, but it's also okay to get the answer wrong and you don't feel awkward about it, because everyone else is usually a little confused about the reading when you first start talking about it and it leads to Dr. Pinango clearing up confusion. Also, section was helpful for clarifying any confusing concepts or readings we were doing, because you could speak very candidly and ask the TA any blunt, seemingly obvious questions. Dr. Pinango is super passionate about this topic and really wants people to learn about it, but she does it by making you think, and even though it can be a little frustrating, if you go to class and pay attention and take good notes, you'll learn a lot and get your answers in the end. Also go to office hours if you're confused at all, she won't ever make you feel bad about any questions you have. There's a midterm, a final, and about 10 homeworks that are just questions about the readings. One annoying thing is no laptops in class, because I almost always type down everything a professor says and I couldn't do that here, but I adjusted to it very quickly",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the brain at all. The class is very language specific, but it offers a new perspective on the brain that not many people usually think about. It is a lot a work, but it's very rewarding the professor is great. The class is small and intimate and the material is interesting."
