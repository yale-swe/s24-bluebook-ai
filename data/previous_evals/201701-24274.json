    "This class was a great opportunity to bring together both PhD and master's students with research interests in water to discuss current research (by students or others). I really appreciated the opportunity to learn about what other students were working on and stay abreast of interesting findings in the field. It was also a good opportunity for students to practice public speaking skills in a supportive environment.",
    "I really didn't feel like this class met my expectations. I didn't really learn anything new, though I had the opportunity to present my research which was good. That was really the only benefit I saw honestly.",
    "This course was a one-credit seminar on Fresh Water Topics and I expected the professor to develop curriculum that the class would follow to be sure we got the most out of the class as possible. Yet, I was disappointed with the class. The professor did not prepare anything for the course. He assigned no readings and no homework and did not lead discussions. By assigning student-led presentations for every class, the class felt disjointed and did not follow a theme nor allow me to develop a base of knowledge on the topics presented. It felt more like a PhD class where students presented their research as practice. It did not feel like a course that was truly open to students not conducting their own research, although it was promoted this way."

   "comments": [
    "Pretty good overall, but maybe a field trip to someone's research site would be nice (especially if it's just across the road).",
    "I think it just needs a little bit more structure... The free-form structure can be kind of difficult, and the course only being an hour doesn't really allow for enough discussion. I could see this course being really useful if we dove into topics that were really difficult to grapple with, rather than having people present for the full-time and then just having a question-and-answer session. The format just doesn't make the course for useful or thought-provoking. There are so many issues with freshwater resources, and I feel like we didn't really even scratch the surface.",
    "I would prefer if the class has structure and the professor led the class in some kind of discussion each class. The student-led presentations did not follow any kind of theme or topic structure. If the students had presented their research based on a general outline for the semester, it would have felt much more useful and engaging. If the professor had invested more time in the course and presented something at the beginning of each class or simply led a short discussion at the beginning or end of each class, I believe I would have learned more. Although it was only one-credit, based on other one-credit classed that I have loved, I feel as if the professor could have given more time to this class and helped it be a more meaningful experience for the students."

    "Ideally, I saw this is kind of an advanced seminar in freshwater topics, but it wasn't really advanced at all, and was very superficial. Despite doing the readings, we had very little opportunity to discuss them in any kind of critical way. I thought this course not only would be a great opportunity to get feedback on my research, but also discuss topics that are difficult to grapple with in this particular context, but it seemed like everyone presented very general topics, and not anything really specific to what they were doing and their perspective, which is what I really wanted to learn about.",

Rather, I did not get out of this class what I hoped to. The research presented was very specific and did not speak to problems that most people are dealing with today, thus it felt more like a PhD research seminar, especially since many of the students were advisees of the professor and often discussed specific research that they were doing together, which did not feel inclusive."
