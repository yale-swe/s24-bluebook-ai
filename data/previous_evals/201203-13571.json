    "This is the most important class a Master of Forestry student can take at FES. The material and hands-on nature of the course is critical to learning and bringing together concepts taught elsewhere in the MF curriculum.",
    "best class at FES. also the most monstrous--soo much work and for the most part the pedagogical approach is to just go over the basics and let students figure out the rest.",
    "This is the most practical class I've taken at FES.",
    "While the lectures are valuable, most of the learning is done outside of class. The process of constructing the plan is a valuable experience and I think that I learned more and applied my learning more in this class than in any other class I have taken at FES. Professor Ashton and the TAs were exceptionally helpful.",
    "The only less-than-excellent areas, question 4 (pace), and question 10 (clarity of explanation), are not really because of the teaching. Mark's teaching is excellent and is the best we can imagine for the circumstances. However the circumstances are the problem. The semester is too short for the amount of information, synthesis, and application of the information that needs to take place. Work continues into the spring semester, and is sometimes not finished until June.The solution is not obvious, but it's out there somewhere. Making this a 2-semester class, or introducing elements of it in earlier classes like silviculture (squeeze), may be beneficial. The intensity of the pace affected the quality of the work, especially with other classes being neglected. By necessity of course, we were still learning much needed skills during lectures near the end of the semester that we wished we had learned in the beginning, though of course there was just not enough time. We would have liked to hit the ground running, but never had a moment to see the powerpoint on walking, and ended up crawling at lightning speed across the finish line. In nappies."

    "Biometrics lecture (and how to analyze data through calculations) should be provided by someone other than Dr. Ashton -- this is not his strength in explaining clearly.",
    "Dr. Ashton is much better in the field than he is in the classroom. The classroom lectures could be tightened up, and the concepts could be more coherently explained.",
    "The lecture time could have been more structured to discuss key subjects. For example, the lecture on basal area would have been more helpful if we had worked through some examples.",
    "we needed more time--maybe we could have at least been assigned to properties and visited our sites once in the spring semester prior.",
    "Some of the lectures are too theoretical and aren't as helpful as they could be at explaining how students should tackle certain aspects of the management plan. In particular the sampling lecture and the data analysis lecture should be more focused on technical skills rather than the theory behind this concepts. I think this would be much more helpful for students and it would avoid a lot of confusion on the part of groups. It seems that every group had to figure out the data analysis portion on their own rather than having a clear set of instructions that we all followed.",
    "This is a course where you can never have too much time.",
    "I think that there is a need to add lectures pertaining to management alternatives for non-forested ecosystems. Or bring in a lecturer who can speak to ecological engineering, green infrastructure and landscape management more broadly.Another possible area of interest to students might be additional lectures on data representation\/communication. How can we use the information from our bar graphs and pie charts and present them in a way that a lay-person, rather than just a forester, can understand. Some tips and techniques or references on this front would be helpful.These may just be added bonuses, as the class covers many topics broadly and (appropriately) leaves it up to the student to make the most important decisions.",
    "As stated above, pace and clarity. We are getting a great overall experienceof what we have to go through to put together a plan. However, if the data is what is most important, it is not necessarily going to be that accurate because of the season and the limited time. We are learning as we go, and so the quality of the data changes over the course of the semester. Also, because of what we learn, our values and goals change over the course of the semester, and this also affects the gathering of the data.Overall still, it is a great experience. I say \"is\" because we're still working on it! This issue may also need attention.",

I think that perhaps a check in with Mark half way through the semester would be helpful, as well as an evaluation of all the team members at the end. I think maybe each person should have to write what they completed for the course. I would also like to know what my team mates think my strengths and weaknesses are and if there was some way to communicate this I would appreciate the feedback from my classmates.",

This was a good lesson in managing group dynamics, as well as keeping work in perspective.
