    "General overview of a few centuries of Spanish history. I took this for a pre-industrial credit for the history major and it was fine for that, but honestly it was a prettyyyyy boring class sometimes. It's very repetitive. I'd recommend this class only if it's necessary for your major.",
    "Golden Age of Spain presents a good overview of the cultural and political landscape of the 16th and 17th century in the Iberian peninsula. Although the class is divided thematically, this really only addresses the readings, since the lectures remain focused primarily on court politics and wars. Prof. Eire is a great lecturer, and the TAs were excellent. There is not too much work throughout the semester, just one paper, a midterm and a final exam.",
    "Golden Age Spain is the course to take if you are at all interested in Spain or ever been mesmerized by the king-sized jaws of the Habsburg monarchs. After taking this class, I only regret that I chose to major in economics and didn't give history a chance when I was a freshman. Prof. Eire is amazing and will entertain you in lecture. You will walk away with a view of Spanish history, culture, religion, and society quite different from the common misconceptions of the Hispanophobic and anti-Catholic Black Legend. So basically, the Inquisition really wasn't all that bad. Really, wasn't all that bad! You will learn about interesting anecdotes such as King Charles II doing penance in front of the Host of Gorkum or the letter correspondence between the sex-addict Philip IV who married his own inbred niece and the bilocating Venerable Maria de Agreda who became a scribe for BVM. Those miscellaneous stories are sure to make you popular at fancy cocktail parties or just to impress someone over the dinner table of Davenport College. Of course, history is never about stories. This quote from Don Quixote (one of the assigned books) still resonates with me, \"take virtue as your goal and be proud of doing virtuous deeds, for there is no need to envy those who have possessions, glory, prestige, even if they are princes and lords; because blood is inherited, and virtue is acquired, and virtue is worth by itself that which blood is not.\" This is a lesson that is true today as it was during the highly hierarchical society of 17th century Spain. Many things come and go, but something is eternal, and should be treasured. Somebody once described the Golden Age Spain as \"a republic of enchanted beings\". I am enchanted. Are you?",
    "HIST 282 is an incredibly interesting class that weaves together Spanish history and Spanish society during the Golden Age into one compelling narrative. I would recommend this class to anyone with a passing interest in history.",
    "GA Spain is a cool time period. I'm not really into this period of history, but if you are, then you will LOVE this class. Interesting secondary readings, although sometimes things seemed repetitive. I hope you enjoy learning about Catholicism. Not much work, a nice class to take as your fifth or sixth.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! Fascinating study of the period from the Spain's unification in the time of Isabella and Ferdinand, to the conquest of the New World, to the Inquisition, to the dynastic intrigues of the Habsburgs, and the gradual decline of Spain under different monarchs, amongst other things... Really sheds light on a fundamental period of European and world history.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Golden Age Spain is an excellent survey course of 16th and 17th century Spain. The readings for the course are particularly well chosen, and they helped to create a full image of life during this era of Spanish history.",
    "Carlos Eire is a great professor. One of the best at yale. This class was really interesting and so much fun",
    "Absolutely take this course, or anything else with Prof. Eire. I promise you won't regret it.",
    "Take this class! It's literally the best, as long as your participate and test everything else will come by! Not to stressful and the workload really makes it easy to keep up with it and have a good time.",
    "If you have any interest at all in the period, take this!",
    "Great class. Not a lot of work. And a kind teacher.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in Spanish history and have some background in it. The class could be tough if you knew nothing about Spain or Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The book-a-week nature of the class was tough to handle; at times, it seemed pointless to do the reading. Prof. Eire is remarkable, though, so take that into consideration.",
    "This is what a history course should be. Take it. Professor Eire is a great lecturer who genuinely cares about his students. The class is a midterm, a paper, a final, and weekly section. The reading is actually manageable and you do come out having learnt a lot.",
    "Golden Age Spain is a review mostly of the political, military, and religious history of the Iberian Peninsula from the early Medieval Ages to the 1700\u2019s. Carlos Eire brings a refreshing perspective to history. The workload in this class is manageable. It is not essential to do every last bit of reading, but some is necessary to participate in and enjoy section. There is one 5 page paper, a midterm, and a final which covers the second half of the course and is not cumulative. I think everyone should take at least one history class at Yale, and this would be a reasonable course for a non-major. I would suggest this class to anyone interested in the spread and development of Christianity in Europe, the influence of Spain in the New World, or the building of the Spanish Empire."
