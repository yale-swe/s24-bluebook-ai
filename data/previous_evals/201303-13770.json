   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to other students, unless they had a clear motivation to learn more about JDM (that is, I would not recommend this as a filler class). If they're not from the business school, I would warn them that the class is very much geared toward business school students.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course if you have Behavioral Psychology interest or Cognitive Science interest. The professors are excellent and the material is good. Best of all, the professors ask you to be critical of papers, and then are critical themselves of your critiques, which pushes you to do a better job in your challenge of the data.",
    "I'm not sure that you couldn't get the same benefit from just reading these articles on your own asyou got from discussing them in class. However, I think that the final project is a really great assignment, and it's pretty cool that the whole semester leads up to that.",
    "I would recommend the class to anybody who wants to understand patterns in decision making and gain experience critiquing academic research. People looking for a broad overview of the field not for research purposes would not benefit as much."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course has deepened my knowledge and understanding of the sub-field of behavioral decision making in somewhat narrow terms. This course did not contribute to my research.",
    "The content was great for my research, but I think more importantly (and maybe this was the intent) it helped me be critical of my own research methods. A lot of time in class was spent discussing alternative explanations for results, and thinking about how to rule out alternative explanations through further research."
