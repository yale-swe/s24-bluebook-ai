   "comments": [
    "This course was an interesting look at the American electoral system. The workload was manageable, the readings were for the most part engaging, and the final paper (a research proposal) was a good way to consider continuing work on representation in the future. Professor Butler clearly knew a lot about the material and was interested in class discussions with students. He sometimes seemed to get flustered in class and may not have explained some concepts as clearly as he would have liked; but overall, the class was enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You don't just learn about different electoral and governmental institutions but a lot about experiment design, which will be really helpful in other classes. Laidback, interesting classes; not very much reading. A couple easy reading responses and a final project which is actually interesting to write and is not intimidating.",
    "I would suggest for any one interested in a class that address politics through a statistical lens. Although no Stats background is required it is a great way to introduce yourself to political analysis.",
    "The course is engaging and not too much work; if you want a solid Political Science Seminar with a great professor, this is a way to go. I would recommend this course!",
    "Yes, it's a great class which teaches you how to read political science papers and understand more about our political process in general.",
    "The course will be renamed \"Designing American Democracy\" in the future, which I find very appropriate. All of our readings were based on America. However, I would also like it to point out that research and statistical design and criticism are exceptionally key to understanding this course, and it could indeed be titled \"Criticizing Research Papers about Various American Democratic Systems: Where Poli Sci Researchers Go Wrong, Intentionally or Not\". It's not so much a study of the variety of democracy, as I thought it would be.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A quantitative approach to electoral institutions. You're probably familiar with most of the subjects covered in this class - redistricting, different primary systems, term limits - but what makes this class different is that Butler is really into a quantitative approach to these topics. You will read about three articles a week and spend most of the seminar time dissecting the methodologies of each of the studies. Butler has no problem letting you know when he thinks that the studies are flawed... the class might as well be titled \"a survey of weak attempts at quantifying social science.\"Unfortunately, the class isn't as rigorous as it could be. The coursework is not at all demanding, which is good from a general workload perspective but terrible from a discussion quality standpoint. Unless Butler ups the difficulty, expect to be in seminar with a lot of people who clearly haven't done the reading and don't even bother to hide the fact.All in all, the class is moderately interesting and you will get something out of it (even considering how little work you will put into it). But expect some disappointment, because the class could be so much more."
