   "comments": [
    "This course is quite intensive with a lot of homework every night. There are tests every other week and quizzes as often. The class material itself is not very difficult so as long as you keep up with the works you should be fine. If you take French 130, take it with Madame Burton. She is awesome! Her classes are lively and seldom boring (which is impressive for a 9:25am class). I would definitely take French with her again. She is super helpful and laid back.",
    "French 130 is a great class that meets daily and requires a lot of work but it is good if you want to keep up your french.",
    "This is a fun and engaging class that has a sensible workload. You will learn a lot of French, but also become close with the class and Madame Burton. I would recommend this class to another student, because it not only helps you speak French, but also helps you appreciate it.",
    "Pro: Teachers are great, and you'll learn a lot, whether you like it or not. Though tiring, meeting with your class five days a week allows you to bond with your classmates, which is something that you really miss in college as compared to high school.Cons: Excessive work load, unforgiving examinations, material that hurts your appreciation for the language, classes five days a week and throughout reading period.Bottom line: Take this class if you truly appreciate and enjoy the French language and culture, but be prepared for the possibility that appreciation might wane over time.",
    "This course is basically a review of what was taught in L1 and L2, so if you did not have a solid foundation in those classes, you will struggle. The material is interesting, but definitely reliant on a solid french understanding. It is a lot of work, most if which is assigned daily. I wouldn't recommend this course if you had a weak foundation in L1 and L2."
