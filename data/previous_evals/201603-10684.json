   "comments": [
    "English 114 with Professor Klemann helped me enhance my writing skills tremendously. I came to Yale not having written many academic papers over the course of my high school career, and I did not feel prepared for college-level writing. After this course I am. Even comparing the first paper I wrote for this course with the last one I did shows how much my writing improved.",
    "This course really helped develop my writing and analytical skills in literature. Before taking 114, I had only a very rudimentary understanding of how to approach writing academic papers and how to analyze academic writings. I have learned many writing skills that I will be able to transfer to every piece I must write in the future. Through this class I have also come to very much enjoy the writing process instead of dreading it.",
    "I learned how to write at the college level -- how to research, how to construct (and deconstruct) an argument, and how to present my argument to others.",
    "I learned how to write a paper with a strong claim.",
    "I learned how to read to find the claim And the other inner workings of scholarly writing, as well as how to formulate those skills for myself.",
    "The most obvious skill developed is knowing how to write. And not just how to organize or style or whatnot, but the most important thing that I learned was how to approach a topic. The first couple of stages in the writing process are perhaps the most important in dictating where the paper is going to go, and if there is anything I learned, it is how to approach the topic and how to start writing.",
    "I learned how to write a college leveled research paper, as well as writing longer academic papers in general. I learned how to read an evaluate arguments in more advanced pieces of academia.",
    "I learned how to approach analytical essays better. I learned to be a better writer.",
    "I learned how hard academic writing is and the basic construction of a good essay.",
    "I learned the differences between college academic writing and the writing I have done in the past.",
    "This class is a thorough introduction to academic writing. Students learn how to annotate readings, write a well-reasoned analysis and create a clear, debatable claim. Students are also taught how to write an academic research paper and how to cite sources well. The importance of editing and revising papers is very emphasized throughout the course.",
    "My knowledge about good writing greatly increased in this course. I developed great insights into the writing of a thesis and the creations of good arguments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe that the course is incredible for all students wishing to improve their writing skills. The only \"weakness\" I can pinpoint is that the course was quite reading-heavy for the first half of the semester and at times that seemed like a bit too much. However, I also understand that to become a better writer it is necessary to read a lot of good writing, so, frankly, I am not even sure that this is a weakness thus, the quotation marks.",
    "I think that this course was great in teaching beginner writers, like myself, how to approach a variety of writing genres and provided a very solid foundation. Through workshops and personal meetings, I got really great and effective feedback on my writing that made me a better writer. I think that the class was a bit fast paced at times, but it was definitely manageable if I put in enough time. I also thought coming straight out with the James Kincaid reading was a bit daunting, so maybe putting that a little later in the year and easing our way into it would have been better.",
    "114 does an amazing job easing you into writing at the college level -- the first essay doesn't feel very different than a high school essay, but by the time you're at the final essay you're writing at a high level, and it doesn't feel like a steep climb. I also loved that it was a small seminar -- 12 students is the right number, since it's big enough to have interesting discussions while not being too big.",
    "Professor Klemann is amazing and a great professor. She really cares about her students and does everything she can to help you.",
    "The main strength and weakness is, I feel, a double edged sword. The course moves at an extremely rapid pace, and it is possible to feel slightly overwhelmed, but at the same time, the speed definitely pushes you to try and achieve more.",
    "Strengths: The course definitely felt specifically designed for freshman, so there was a level of comfort and reasonable learning curve for everyone. The readings were reasonable and interesting, and discussions were engaging for the most part. My instructor was very energetic and was effective in interacting with students during class time. Weaknesses: There were definitely not enough opportunities to practice or evaluate skills before having to turn in assignments that counted for significant portions of our grade. A lot of skills and tips were left up to interpretation (or assumed that we had prior knowledge of) so there was confusion. Maybe more direct instruction and personal feedback would have been nice.",
    "Good seminar interaction, but a lot of reading.",
    "It was well structured, I believe some of the reading weren't as pertinnent to the general topic of the class (or my idea of what the class was going to be about) but they were still interesting.",
    "This is a hands-on course that gives students the tools they need to write an excellent academic paper, something they will do regularly throughout their years at Yale. It is a great class for students who feel like their writing background is not as strong and want to reinforce their abilities. There are many sections with diverse and interesting topics that can interest anyone who is looking for a 114 section. Academic writing, however, is not as entertaining as creative writing or poetry. Regardless of the interesting section topics, this is a serious course that is not particularly \"fun.\"",
    "The workshops in this course were great for the whole class. There were no real weaknesses. The articles were relevant, the writing advice was pertinent, and the way the class was run was orderly and efficient."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course, especially with Professor Klemann. The course improved my writing skills tremendously, and I see a clear difference between the papers I have written at the beginning of the term and the papers I am writing now. Professor Klemann provided plenty of feedback and was overall incredibly nice and helpful.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. I thought that this class was a great way to build a solid foundation in writing that gives you the skills that you can bring into writings in other classes as well.",
    "Yes, since you learn how to write good.",
    "Yes, this course definitely made me a stronger writer.",
    "Yes. Specifically because professor Klemann ran such an engaging and informative section. It was a lot of fun going to class every day.",
    "Yes, it will help you learn how to write properly.",
    "Although I didn't feel like my writing improved any significantly after this course, I do feel like I have an idea of what level of writing is expected in a college setting. Because I experienced ENGL 114, I would feel comfortable taking other writing courses at Yale. As a freshman, this is probably a good experience for everyone to at least pass through once.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others.",
    "Yes. Good for freshman looking to succeed in their academic writing at Yale",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to students who don't feel confident with their academic writing skills or feel like their high schools didn't prepare them for college-level writing. Instructors are extremely helpful and willing to meet with students whenever to answer any questions or struggles they may be dealing with. It may not be the most amusing class, but it is worth taking and will help students in the long run.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any student wanting to improve their academic writing. Also the topic of Digital Childhood is related to everyone which is why it is a great topic to base the class around."
