    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Britain's topography or relatively recent history.",
    "A hearty: yes! This class taught me so many interesting ideas about the world and its peoples. Travelling the British countryside allowed me to gain a first-hand perspective on the historical climate in which these painters lived. I was fascinated by the impact the English had on so many other artists and was able to form threads through a variety of disciplines by studying British Landscape Art: cultural, historical, political, and the state of the world during the time in which these paintings were created. Excellent course, I would happliy have spent an entire year studying this subject."
