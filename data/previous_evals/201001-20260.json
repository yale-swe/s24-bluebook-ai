    "I would highly recommend the course, and I think it's almost crucial for anyone who's working on written materials.",
    "I would strongly recommend the course to other students and I would also suggest that the course be recommended by the faculty as an important part of graduate training in yale's anthropology department.It seems odd to me that many graduate students in Yale's anthropology department would go through their training without at least garnering an introduction to or overview of the theoretical engagements in linguistic anthropology which overlap with, or even inform, the theoretical concerns common to sociocultural anthropology. I had a slight interest in linguistic anthropology prior to taking the course, and now, having taken it, I've become much more interested in pursuing the subfield more vigorously. In addition to my pre-existing or primary interests in sociocultural anthropology, I've become much more interested in using linguistic anthropological theories and methods to attend to many of my interests."
