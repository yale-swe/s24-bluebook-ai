    "informal and collaborative.",
    "The primary instructor is very good. This is not the case for all invited speakers and other instructors.",
    "The course should be more practical, we should get real training instead of learning what the training entails (psychological first aid, for example). It was nice to have a lot of guest speakers to get different perspectives!I think more events outside of class (observing more drills, taking higher level ICS classes) would teach us a lot more than listening to a lecture every week.",
    "good introductory course. could have been more interactive.",
    "strengths - interesting set of topicsdid change my way of approaching disaster scenaariosweaknesses - many lectures were literally read off powerpoint slidesmore examples of real world scenarios should be usedmany final exam questions (especially multiple choice) were very picky and overly specificjoanne mcgovern should be more involved with the class wherever possible given her real world experiences and practical knowledge",
    "An interesting, broad-based coverage of many aspects of disaster epidemiology.",
    "Strengths: Guest lecturers who really know what they're talking about as they're working in the field of public health and disaster management. The class also had a good solid practical approach to public health management in disasters. The assignments were always relevant, which was great. I also left the course completing work in real-world disaster management systems like ICS.Weaknesses: Because there are no tests during the class you're not really sure what the questions will be like on the final. They were very specific sometimes and that seemed slightly unfair to not have anything to practice from. It would also have been nice for Dr. Durante to have been in class more (even when there was a guest lecturer presenting), but I understood that she was very busy this semester.",
    "Very good course. well taught. classes could be long and boring at times and breaks may need to be introduced.",
    "There were so many guest lecturers that it was really had to keep track of the information and what was important."

Dr. Durante was not very timely in getting assignments back, and included things in the final exam that were not on the study guide! Overall though, she was great when she was lecturing about things she really cared about!",

    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Dr. Durante was good overall. She is an okay lecturer - sometimes her powerpoint slides are pretty unclear when you go back to look at them after class because a lot of them are empty and are just questions. It makes reviewing them difficult. She was good at engaging the class in discussion usually, which was nice. She also created good, practical assignments.",

    "I probably would not recommend this class unless the student was specifically interested in career directly related to disasters.",
    "An interesting look into public health's role in disasters. Not very difficult or time consuming, but it also seems a little light on content.",

    "This course has the potential of being really good if it had a goof professor."
