   "comments": [
    "It's a prerequisite for most students taking it so there really isn't any way out of it, but it's a class that goes at a comfortable pace and you get to learn a lot of chemistry. A good class overall.",
    "You go over problems from the previous problem set and sometimes learn how to do problems on the current problem set. Pretty standard discussion section.",
    "It's a great place to get individual questions answered because the TAs are very friendly and willing to help. Often it can get repetitive, especially toward the beginning of the course with easy material, so I'd bring a problem set to work on.",
    "A good introduction to chemistry.",
    "If you're going to take CHEM 112, you have to go to the two mandatory sections: one in the evening in WLH, and one around noon up on Science Hill. So, if you don't want to have to go to these chem sections, I wouldn't do CHEM 112, but if you think extra sections would help, then I would say do CHEM 112. It's nice that CHEM 112 is a lot smaller than CHEM 114, so it is slightly more personal. The additional sections can also be useful depending on when you have them in comparison to when your problem sets are due. The actual sections do not add any additional work on top of CHEM 112 work.",
    "It is very helpful and I would have died without it.",
    "This is irrelevant. A required section that comes with CHEM 112",
    "Take this class!",
    "It was a helpful section that I was glad to have as an addition to class. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "This is a very manageable intro chem class that I highly recommend.",
    "It was okay. It summarized concepts Dr. G touched on pretty well.",
    "Chemistry 012 01 was enjoyable but very difficult.",
    "I would recommend to the course to a fellow student because the course teaches the skill to critical thinking and problem solving. The most important value that I gained from this course was problem solving and working meticulously. The class is worthwhile even if you are not considering a science major or Premed.",
    "Take this course if you have no, or very little, background in Chemistry. The material is manageable and the professor and TAs are always willing to help.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course--there are lots of resources available to students in this course.",
    "you have to take this to take chem 112. it's just the extra section.",
    "I would recommend Chem 012 to any student who is looking for a solid introduction into chemistry. It is helpful to have some chemistry background but if not then the course is not too difficult to follow.",
    "Overall, it is helpful because you go over the homework problems that gave you some difficulty and learn how to do them."
