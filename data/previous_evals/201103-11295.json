    "Question 4: The workload for this course was heavy, and it was all loaded at the end of the semester. It would have been helpful to have started group projects earlier on in the semester.In addition, a syllabus with all assignments and due dates would have been very helpful. Most of the assignments in this class were surprises and we only had 1 week's notice to complete them; it made planning workloads around other courses and schedule very difficult.",
    "4. The workload towards the end of the semester was far too heavy. A Group paper, presentation, and final exam all in one week is overwhelming. Also, due dates of Christmas Eve discourage efficiency.",
    "More field trips! Field trips are very helpful, often more so than lecture in communicating river dynamics and processes",
    "This was an interesting topic of instruction. However, it was a lecture based course and I did not find it particularly engaging. I would have liked if the professor provided more case studies for analysis and class discussion after learning the basics.Also, towards the end of the course we worked on a field project. I would have liked if we could have started a little earlier. This would have allowed us to put more time into the project and learn more."

    "too much busy work\/book report-type assignments",
    "Need a complete syllabus with assignments listed on them!",
    "The syllabus needs to provide more detail regarding the semester's workload so that students can budget their time accordingly. Also, having a group paper and presentation, in addition to a take home final was too heavy of a work load for the end of the semester.",
    "Too often a long essay was dropped on us at the last minute. Given that we all have multiple commitments, it is very difficult to plan when we have no idea what is going to be assigned. Ideally, homework is assigned in advance to allow for proper planning.",
    "Basically the course mainly deals with the identification of various terms and characteristics. After having this course I may have good knowledge of fish passage but may not feel much competent about the the other technical issues which are supposed to be addressed quite often.",
    "Too much river classification. That should have been one class and that's it. Much too much Rosgen.",
    "It would have been very helpful if the final projects were distributed to the class at the beginning of the semester rather than at the end of the semester. The project was the most beneficial part of the class, so it would have been helpful to have some more time to focus on the content of the project.",
    "We could cover more material in class to add to the technical skills.It would be useful if examples were extended outside US as well.",
    "Final projects should be assigned a little earlier. We had to do: 1) class presentations on a paper, 2) final projects, and 3) final exams within a short space of time."
