   "comments": [
    "Pretty self-explanatory. Very little work, but the work feels like busy work so if you have problems with that then this course isn't for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are really interesting and current, and the electronic nature of this class means that readings are also constantly being updated, added, and changed. The workload is fair, as are the amount of readings, and it's a very relevant topic in today's age.",
    "Do you love the New York Times? Do you hate the New York Times? Do you think Facebook is cool? The class has lots of potential to really dissect what is happening in legacy media as compared to new media. The political connections did seem to come as side-commentary.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, by all means, take the course. The work load is low, and this is one of the few polisci classes that involves technology's impact on politics to a significant degree.",
    "It was an interesting topic, but it seemed that there wasn't enough to talk about for an entire semester. The guest speakers were interesting.",
    "If you're interested in the topic of Politics and the New Media, then I would definitely recommend this class. You may be taking it with Paul Bass rather than Cynthia Farrar, but both are good instructors and can do a good job at guiding the classroom discussion. The readings aren't too intensive, but are very interesting, and because you get to pick the topic of the presentation, you'll probably enjoy doing the research and putting the presentation together.",
    "I would recommend it. The subject matter is important to understanding the modern political landscape and you are literally watching history being made. However, I would caution republican or conservative students as the class tends to get one-sided in debates."
