    "The project is quite time consuming, but you should definitely take the class. It's my favorite class I've taken at Yale and I got a ton out of it!",
    "This course is a lot of work, but you also learn a ton, so I highly recommend it.",
    "Tests not too difficult but lab portion very independent so make sure you're willing to spend that lab time",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it also is very interesting and covers a lot of exciting material. If you are even the slightest bit interested in tissue engineering, this class is definitely worth the effort!",
    "Overall, the course was very informative. However, I advise that if you are going to be a senior taking this class to rethink that decision. This course has a LOT of out of classroom\/in lab work so if you are trying to juggle your senior project and this class' project, things become really difficult really fast. Juggling essentially two labs is NOT something I would advise to do, especially if your senior project requires you to go to lab often."
