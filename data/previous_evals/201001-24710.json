   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. Be prepared for a lot of work, and keep in mind that you might disagree with a lot of what you read, and content in the lecture. But that is ok. I have learned a bunch in this class about a subject we should all know more about.",
    "I would not take it. I was really excited about the class because I am Cuban, but I was not engaged. The class really lacked objectivity, which bothered me a lot. The workload was really manageable, and the readings were usually interesting. The films were pretty good. I just did not enjoy the overall experience of this class.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this to anyone who has even the slightest interst in the topic. Your interest will increase immensely as the course goes on.",
    "I would recommend it but it was overwhelming at times in terms of material and a little opinionated. Should be on either Cuba or Puerto Rico.",
    "The class will not be offered in the future in the same way.",
    "YES. DEFINITELY.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "It is one of the greatest history classes you can take about a region of the world that has long been subjugated and treated by the U.S. as neocolonial. I would definitely encourage you to take it since it is the pillar of modern Latin American affairs and deals with the relationship between the U.S. and it's closest neighbors. However, I do not know it will be the same without Professor Guerra.",
    "A great overview of the histories of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Kind of a lot of work, but great if you've ever been curious about the history of either of those two islands. A good lecture history course, and totally great for LA studies or non-history majors.",
    "Tons of reading, not a very well-organized class. Very interesting history but Guerra strays too far into her own politics for my taste. Potential if the syllabus is re-worked.",
    "This is a tremendous course. Really comprehensive overview of both island's histories, and Professor Guerra does a great job of tying them together, even in a modern-day context. Guerra is fantastic! She will be sorely missed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but be prepared, the workload is WAY heavier than any other class at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it to any history major at Yale simply because this is the only course offered that focuses on these two countries but with Professor Guerra leaving thatay not be possible.",
    "I would absolutely recommend History 362 to another student. Cuba and Puerto Rico are fascinating and (Cuba especially) critically important to one's understanding of the twentieth century. Professor Guerra is amazing, both in her experience with the countries, and interpretation of events, as well as with her belief in the importance of this history.",
    "This was a great class. Engaging lectures, good readings, fair workload. Guerra is politically to the left, but she makes no bones about it, and she draws on a lot of different media to teach the material-- awesome films, poetry, etc. Take it!",
    "This was a great history class, I learned a ton without it being too overwhelming. Definitely take it to fulfill history department requirements, but also if you're at all interested in Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, or Latin America. Hopefully the History Dept. will find another professor of Caribbean history to teach this vital discipline.",
    "I would recommend the course. It gives you a good sense of how the Cuban Revolution was different from how it is portrayed. Also, it is important, as an U.S. citizen, to learn about Puerto Rico.",
    "A solid, though not very easy, ROW History course. You'll learn A LOT, though it's a lot of material to get through for the midterm and final. But the reading is usually pretty good, and the content is interesting (Cuba moreso than PR).",
    "A class on the history of Cuba and Puerto Rico focused on the people of each country and how leaders' policies affected the people. There was also a strong anti-american imperialism trend.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class provided a fascinating look into Cuban and Puerto Rican history, which is shockingly underrepresented in the field. Professor Guerra was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material and wisely incorporated music and film to engage student interest. The workload is fair for a history lecture: two short papers, midterm and final exams, average-length weekly readings, and three film screenings outside of class. Sections were also surprisingly enjoyable and both TAs were great resources throughout the semester. It is a shame that Professor Guerra will no longer be around, but even so this course fills a necessary gap in American and Latin American history and so is highly recommended.",
    "Yes. It's revelatory and interesting."
