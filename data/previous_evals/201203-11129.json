   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if they're willing to commit a lot of time to the course.",
    "This class is hard!",
    "If you're not afraid of the fire, come join this intellectual stir fry. Professor Goldberger's pace is exceptionally fast - and the material's pretty hard to boot - but he's also one of the clearest, classiest, coolest lecturers you'll ever have. The first semester covers material from the first four chapters of Peskin and Schroeder plus the crashiest of crash courses in representation theory to develop the algebraic underpinnings of QFT. All told this was a pretty damn good course, take it take it take it.",
    "PHYS 609 is a challenging and illuminating class. I highly recommend taking this course if you can.",
    "Not to ones doing experimental physics in an unrelated field.",
    "This is a very tough and abstract course. Expect to spend a lot fo time on the homework, and to spend a lot of time going over notes and textbooks.",
    "Only if you would like to get into theory would I recommend this course. Due to the limited amount of time in a graduate career experimentalists should probably stick with something more technical as it will be more used in the future."

   "comments": [
    "The theory and mathematics covered in this course form the foundation of particle physics theory, so it adds depth to my understanding of the field even though it won't be useful on a daily basis as an experimental physicist.",
    "Definitely contributed to my knowledge. But it was a struggle!",
    "Extremely useful course. It's the most rigorous physics course I have ever taken and I do not doubt that the techniques I learned will continue to be very useful no matter what I do in the future.",
    "I would like to do research in particle physics or condensed matter physics in the future. PHYS 609 has obvious relevance for particle physics, and based on material covered towards the end of the course, it seems that PHYS 609 is also relevant in condensed matter physics. Taking PHYS 609 has opened up a world of research topics to me, and the understanding I developed over the semester will be very helpful for pursuing graduate research in particle physics or condensed matter physics.",
    "Quantum field theory will most likely be crucial to my dissertation research."
