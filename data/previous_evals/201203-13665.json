    "many professors teaching. Gentry is great and is a crowd pleaser, but Raymond gets a bad rap. i fear hemay not get good feedback here on his work, which is bogus. People should have understood they were enrolling in a class that had an element of science to it.",
    "This class was a major waist of my time. It was superficial and time draining and did not teach me anything,",
    "There were three professors in this class. Brad Gentry was absolutely amazing in every aspect. The context he provided, the pace he went, the material he covered and his passion for the subject were all amazing.Julie Zimmerman was also kind enough to teach this class during her sabbatical. However, I found her lectures less useful. She did not provide enough context about why we should care about her topics, or what problems the technology she described would solve.Pete Raymond provided more context, but rarely seemed like he wanted to be in class. His lectures were fairly dry and hard to want to follow.I also really enoyed many of the lecturers in this class, especially those from Yale (including the world fellow, who blew my mind) Some of the non Yale lecturers, especially the long island sound ones, were less useful, as they did not seem prepped on what we already knew and covered well trod territory.In general, the TAs were very helpful, if slightly disorganized. Next year, it would be super helpful if it was clear for each assignment, or even across the whole class, how assignments should be turned in. Also, announcements made in class should be repeated over email so we would know when things were happening.",
    "The professors did a good job in trying to take a topic seemingly all over the place and break it down into comprehensible form. However, this course still felt like a mess, but I don't know how you would make it better. I suppose that's part of the challenge.",
    "good course, good to have something on integrated water mgmt, but still spotty. workload heavy on the second half of the semester.",
    "Too many readings that were tangentially relevant. The structure of the class with so many professors and different student interests really didn't work. A clinic style class would be more pertinent in obtaining these skills in a more real-to-life scenario.This class should not be mandatory.",
    "Three professors taught this course: Brad Gentry, Peter Raymond, and Julie Zimmerman. I really appreciated the guest lecturers who were brought in to talk about the cases we studied.I thought Brad Gentry was a great professor for this course. He was well organized and had thought provoking insights. I got the impression that he is really passionate about students learning through practical experience. His commentary on our papers was very useful.Peter Raymond was less organized and less thought provoking. I did not get the impression that he was there to add value for the students. His science-based lectures were rich in information but lacking in enthusiasm and cohesion.",
    "The professors were very helpful and clear, but some of the intense science work by Pete was difficult and it would have been nice to slow that down and make it a bit more clear.",
    "This course should not be required for the MEM degree.",
    "There is a big different among instructors.Professor Gentry - great lecturer, always talk about interesting points of view, engages class and is very responsive to students commentsProfessor Raymond - I did not fell motivated by his lectures, and preferred to go over readings to clarify the materialJulie - great lecturer and very engaging in using her practical perspective during classes",
    "This course had a lot of potential - particularly with the emphasis on applying an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to solving problems. However, it was difficult to apply a case write up format to the written assignments without having had any of the in-class case studies presented as such.For example, lectures on each watershed \"case\" ranged on one end from extremely technical science\/collection\/quality issues to fuzzier qualitative components, such as consider all stakeholders involved. However, with the exception of the Bangladesh case + the World Fellow who came to speak about his project in Bangladesh, which had a very specific problem definition to begin with, none of the other lectures tied together components of a case into a final synthesis or applied framework leading to an innovative solution. The lectures would have been more useful had each case had a specific question and\/or set of questions directing\/framing the problem at hand. We would have learned more from our case study write-ups.",
    "Professor are great, however it would be great to have at least 3-4 classes of economic instruments andtools as part of an integrative course.While this class was excellent, I would recommend having more integrative framework courses because this class focuses specifically on water issues.",
    "Overall this course can be useful for any professional.",
    "Okay I like the course material and plan on going into a field very very close to this. BUT it moves so slowly and the expectations for thepaper seem very unfair. The group project was horrific, but I understand why you made us do it. But still it was horrible.And if you\u00c2\u00b4re going to make us do the labs why treat them like a joke? With a TA session walking us through steps 1-20?I\u00c2\u00b4d recommend more cases and collapsing the lectures together. Have each professor take part of a lecture rather than spreading the case out over several weeks. And I\u00c2\u00b4d also say pick fewer, more helpful readings and don\u00c2\u00b4t repeat the material in the readings during lecture. I think that was a serious disincentive to doing the readings.Overall I think water is an essential topic to understand and clearly should be required for an MEM BUT the way the course is taught is kind of a disappointment.",
    "The readings were helpful, but the recommended textbook (Anisfeld) was not utilized enough to justify the purchase.Raymond was an excellent lecturer, but could have taken more time to explain complicated figures for those without a sciences background.",
    "Some of the labs seemed to not really add much value (NAMI) and felt more like an assignment for the sake of an assignment.",
    "This course is one of two options for a requirement under the MEM program. While I understand the concept of the class and the reason forthe approach it takes I think a number of improvements can be made. First, time was disproportionately spent on different case studies. We spent far too long on the NYC watershed case study, especially because we did not have a paper on it. Basic concepts needed to do well on future papers were not well explained in the NYC example (which was its purpose as I understand) and we found it difficult to correctly identify and apply the \"adaptive management\" approach in writing our paper without much further explanation. Another improvement is to limit group size to three people. Our group had several issues largely stemming from the size of the group. It is also important to make sure that group evaluations determine a larger portion of the class grade than 5% - in our case two people did 60-70% and two people contributed minimally (and in one case not really at all) yet this is not well reflected by the grading system. Third, the case selection ought to be broadened. Many of us did not understand why the Long Island Sound was the final case, given that we spent more than 1\/3 of the class on the NYC watershed case, and that the major water quality issue is hypoxia (addressed in the GOM case). There should be an option for the final case (e.g. San Francisco Delta, Great Lakes water quality, etc...) so that people can apply what they have learned in the class to areas they are particularly interested in. Finally, Brad's lectures were informative and well organized, but Pete's lectures were extremely hard to follow (e.g. lecture slides were not clear - graphs often not labeled at all).",
    "Although I am focused on energy, this course instilled a systems-thinking that can be translated from water issues to any other issue. The professors covered much of the needed information for our papers and gave us a very good foundation on what technologies, approaches, and policies exist and how they work.",
    "On instructors - I enjoyed the lectures by Brad Gentry and Julie Zimmerman, and didn't enjoy the ones by Pete Raymond.",
    "Gentry was excellent, Raymond was a bit scattered and uninterested, Zimmerman was somewhere in between.",
    "It's a difficult class to both teach and take. Ultimately, the point of the class seems to be that the real world is full of messy, difficult to solve problems and we will be tasked with investigating these problems in our future degrees. Though this is an important skill to improve, I struggled with the lack of understanding on what the professors and TAs expected to see in the class papers. I wish it had been a little clearer on expectations."

   "comments": [
    "Case study-structure. brilliant. so interesting. so many hard questions. I liked how we were treated as adults who had to make hard choices.",
    "The case studies chosen were extremely interesting and the guest lecturers who were invited to class were wonderful.",
    "The multiple class periods per case. I really appreciated covering less material, but being able to dive deeper int it. I also will use the frameworks provided in future work!",
    "Guest speakers and the NYC case.",
    "Guest speakers from NYC watershed and Bangladesh cases were fantastic. The style of group work to create proposals was a good idea, but the assignments themselves were a bit too theoretical.",
    "Class discussions post-guest lecture or with Brad\/Pete\/Julie facilitating.",
    "Writing the papers were very valuable experiences. The guest lecturers were a highlight. Brad Gentry was a real asset to the course.",
    "Great experience with group work and real life experience writing proposals.",
    "Gentry is a great lecturer.",
    "I thought the team-taught aspect was really great - it was super helpful to get so many different perspectives and areas of expertise to weigh in on the topic at hand. I also really liked how much group work was involved, and frankly wished more classes at FES had more group work. I also really enjoyed the guest lecturers and think they rounded out the cases really well. The lack of structure for the papers seemed daunting in the moment, but looking back on it I think was probably a good thing since there is no right or wrong way to approach some of these topics in the real world.",
    "The ability to have an example case study before being thrown into writing a paper was very helpful. I think the labs were very relevant to the course and they helped me visual how to address the problem.",
    "It was great that they were able to compact so much information into a semester. Overall the faculty coordinated well together.",
    "The structure was really good. Mix of lectures with different professors and guest lecturers; lab sessions; and group and individual papers. Also, professor Gentry was the reason why I kept taking this class - he is a great professor, kind, helpful and knows a lot.",
    "Introductions to relevant topics in water management and visits from those involved with managing and working under each case study.",
    "Integrating various policy, science and conceptual frameworks to make decisions about solutions.",
    "Professors, invited professors, Bangladesh case, working in a team",
    "A number of valuable tools were taught that would be useful in policy making and understanding effectiveness of policy.",
    "I really appreciate that this class attempts to mirror real-world group work approach to problem solving. The group work was a very valuable part of the class. It's also a wonderful foundation course as it exposes students to a flavor of the many different areas of the environmental world that they could focus on (scientific research, policy evaluation, engineering, etc). The \"systems approach\" (causal loop diagrams) is VERY important. I feel like \"systems thinking\" is talked about all the time in the environmental field, but is rarely taught or practiced as a real skill. I would love it if Julie would bring back her Systems Dynamics course to build off of the intro we get in Science to Solutions (will bring this up to the academic dean). I also really enjoyed guest lectures who were brought in to give their first hand experience working in Long Island Sound, India, New York Watershed, and the Gulf of Mexico; their stories and perspective really helped bring the material alive.",
    "Paper writing where problem identification and tools assessing involved.",
    "The course gives a hands on experience in solving problems with case studies. It gives us a training on how can we design solutions and propose actions.",
    "The various perspectives of the professors. IT was very helpful to see different sides of an issue.",
    "Outside lecturers provided a fascinating lens on how these management decisions are made.",
    "Faculty member knowledge.",
    "Working through the difficulty of defining a problem, weighing possible solutions, and then \"selling\" the chosen solution; the Bangladesh and Gulf of Mexico cases were the best because they were drastically different from each other (e.g. easily defined \/ difficultly defined problem and completely different organizational frameworks to work under).",
    "The adaptive management concept was interesting, and I enjoyed using science to describe a problem and develop a management policy.",
    "The professors were all open to questions, responsive to students' needs and thorough with conceptual material. I also appreciated the papers because although they were very challenging, these types of assignments are important to have experience with.",
    "The cases were the best part of the class, as they provided the opportunity to think creatively and apply various solutions to a problem. I particularly liked the Gulf Coast case because it was more challenging in scope.",
    "A lot of the readings were interesting and helped me learn about these interesting case studies."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Continued work on integrating between professors.",
    "It was difficult to feel satisfied with the amount of time we spent on each case study, since they are large problems that could be studied for much longer.In addition, Ithink the order of lectures should be examined and maybe rearranged, so that the first lecture gives a general summary of all lectures on the topic. I think this would be more supportive of learning and lead to less confusion.The instructors may want to think about creating groups themselves and switching group members for each project instead of keeping the same group together. Students would then get to experience different group settings.",
    "Productive use of classtime and communicaton with students. Verbal announcements should be complemented with emails via dropbox.",
    "Pete - I love him - his lectures are just...incomprehensible. I was glad I had scientist in my group to explain to me what was going on. That said, he was very accessible outside of class.Brad - very accessible, but lectures could be a tad try.Julie - lectures were great and she's a snappy dresser; an inspiration for us to get out of our hoodies and jeans.As said before - this course was all over the place and hard to follow. The reading generally didn't comprehend the lectures and as result, I stopped doing the reading early on.I would be interested to do a mod on a European water system.Finally, there needs to be standardization for how labs and final papers are turned in. Sometimes its email, sometimes its dropbox, sometimes its both. It's unnecessarily confusing.",
    "Course felt very disjointed between the multiple professors and the integration of policy and science was not effectively done. Between labs and papers, there seemed to be a lot of busy work instead of allowing students to work in more depth on a single topic. Perhaps it would be better to have 3 case studies instead of 4 - cases felt rushed and didn't get to the in-depth level warranted.The class as an overview of tools and options was way too broad for graduate school level. It was too general to the point of lacking meaningful substance at times. Also, not enough emphasis on the policy\/law\/social science aspect of the topic, which was a reflection in the balance of professors.",
    "The timing needs to be redistributed amongst the cases, and ideal the cases cut down to 3. One professor needs to be the lead professor who is in charge of providng some basic overview material - its not helpful when the first day we just dive into the nitty gritty of the nitrogen cycle in the MARB, without any introduction to what we are doing or why it is important.",
    "Labs - didn't seem relevant to the point of the course.",
    "I think Peter Raymond needs to reassess his approach to teaching the course and bring more organization and energy to lectures.",
    "Better feedback on the papers. Strict grading with not a lot of critiques.",
    "This course should not be required for the MEM degree. Pete Raymond is not an engaging lecturer and his slides are poorly thrown together.",
    "Some of the labs felt forced and didn't add much to my understanding of the particular case to which they related or to the subject as a whole. I'm specifically referring to the first lab and the NANI lab. I did think that the policy lab was one exception, as it was helpful in getting us to think harder about potential options for the Gulf hypoxia situation. I would suggest either more labs of that sort, or getting rid of the other labs and letting groups spend that much more time on their papers. I also found it hard to keep up with the readings given the significant time commitment involved in the papers, on top of the labs.I also think that groups should be assigned based on backgrounds\/skill sets\/school affiliation.",
    "There are too many assignments, and the labs didn't feel like they always coordinated to the course. It seemed like they were there to address topics that couldn't be fit into lectures.",
    "I strongly suggest to use at least 2 international cases, instead of only one. Also, the final paper should be open for students to choose their own topic - it is more engaging, and students can apply the tools and concepts they learn in an area of interest (at least for me, that is the main way I learn - when it is useful after school).",
    "The lectures seemed disjointed, and the final individual paper was scheduled poorly.",
    "The lectures sometimes don't align well leaving us feeling like there isn't always congruence.",
    "Introduction to various frameworks, application of potential frameworks, versus just stressing considering all components of a problem.",
    "Diversification of cases, international focus, more social science",
    "Formation of groups, Either they should be rotated between two papers or they should be created by the professor themselves. Also, groups should be limited to three people only.There should be additional emphasis\/class on how to write\/structure papers.",
    "I know this is a large class, but it would be good to incorporate some level of class discussion to complement the lectures. Perhaps break the class into groups to discuss and present something small once a week. The papers are wonderful, but it may also be good for one of the case studies to have the final product be a presentation in lieu of or in addition to a paper.",
    "Workload heavy",
    "The course has vey little social and economic aspect in it which i feel is very important in problem solving. There was very little coverage on these particular subjects.",
    "Move faster on the NY case, be less rigid in the formulas for the paper, more cases.",
    "The NYC and Gulf cases were interesting, but the subsequent focus on the LIS felt redundant. Perhaps pick either a different system for the final paper or keep the LIS and jettison the Gulf?",
    "The labs. The labs did not seem to be as relevant to the topics or real build professional skills.",
    "The Long Island Sound case study was too similar to GOM and NYC watershed cases. Another international case or a water quantity issue would be better. For the final project, I felt very limited for finding a problem in LIS - many of the \"problems\" were already being addressed, which limited the topic options. I would have preferred to have a different case study all together or to be able to pick one of my own.",
    "See question 13.",
    "The course should be split up a little more evenly between cases. We spent most of the course covering the New York City case and a few classes on the Long Island case.",
    "It would have helped to have even just a small assignment for the NYC case so we could think creatively about it and get a little practice before the Bangladesh case.",
    "I struggled in some of the lectures as they didn't seem always connected to what we were talking about."

    "It may not exactly fit.",
    "Required component of MEM.",
    "teaches tools in evaluating effectiveness of policy on different criteria which is directly applicable to academic background.",
    "Having 5 years of working experience, I really thought this class was most reflective of how \"real world\" work is, especially in terms of working in groups. It was helpful in giving me exposure to the many potential academic\/professional focus areas to explore further at FES.",
    "I opted for it as it offered mostly water cases. Since my area of interest is in water law and policy, this course fits in my overall program very well. I wish it included some aspects of trans-boundary issue.",
    "It does fit very well with my program. I feel I will always remember this course. It is very useful in environmental management.",
    "It was a good introduction to the topic which I plan to pursue in more depth.",
    "As an integrative frameworks course, the systems analysis module neatly tied together many of my interests.",
    "It does not really. I think this requirement should either be eliminated, or better yet, the classes offered should be expanded. For example, I can easily see how this model can be applied to air quality, energy policy, wildlife policy, etc... More options would be preferable since I do think the material and strategies taught are valuable.",
    "While I took this class to fulfill a requirement (integrative framework), it ended up being more interesting and applicable to my focus on energy than I anticipated. The suite of policy solutions had some applicability (such as taxes, user fees, etc.)."

   "comments": [
    "advantages: different disciplines coming together and discussing.Disadvantages: some people are meanspirited, lazy, etc.",
    "Too much group work and to much of our grade depended on other people",
    "Advantages: getting to know other people better, being able to compliment one another's knowledge, learning new things from group members.Disadvantages: Unequal work load for group members",
    "They pushed me further than I would have gone on my own. However, it was difficult to get everyone together. I wonder if 3 person groups might be better logistically. Would also reduce freeriding.",
    "Group work is tough, but I was lucky in that my group complemented each other really well. Thank god I had geologists to do the science stuff.",
    "Group work was positive and a skill I really hope to improve. However, it would be better if the assignments had more grounding in reality and the proposal prescriptions were less theoretical. Perhaps a clinic style with more granular focus on a single issue area.",
    "Scheduling and working at other people's pace was a challenge. However, writing that many 10 page papers would have been a nightmare on your own. I thought my group worked very well together and I learned from them. I would recommend keeping this aspect of the course.",
    "I hated the group work.",
    "The work group was an excellent way to replicate more real world situations and to gain access to multiple perspectives on a specific topic. I learned as much from my teammates as I did from much of the rest of the course, and that was invaluable. I also think that the workload would be far too much if we had to do all the assignments individually.",
    "Advantages - working with people that we mutually selected as partners.disadvantages - required meetings for the paper, everyones schedule is crazy",
    "The group work was a burden. The experience of working with my group was fine, but coordinating schedules was a hassle, and it just adds to the feeling of busy-work that makes these kinds of courses frustrating. In general, I would venture to say that no one is excited about group work. On the positive side, it was good to talk through some of the course concepts with others.",
    "Advantages - learning how to deal with people form different backgrounds in a problem solving situation; it prepares students to work by themselves on the final paper.Disadvantages - groups should be assigned.",
    "Advantages - forces you to see other points of view, incorporate diverse backgroundsBad - tragedy of the commons, doing too much for the others too late in the game.",
    "Advantages: interesting to work with policy and research focused students, some who are water experts, one with law background, etc.Disadvantages: these students have never been taught the case study method - i.e. fundamentally approach assignments as comprehensive research papers versus identifying a problem and potential solutions within a certain framework. Was frustrating and ultimately ineffective at convincing them to adopt more problem\/solutions oriented approach versus research paper approach.",
    "Advantages: feedback, learn from myself, learning from others, and having a rich discussionDisadvantages: the group was very big, there were a lot of problems regarding leadership and working as a real group.",
    "Group was too large, hard to find a time to meet. We did not have a good balance of experience in policy making within the group. It is better if groups are either created by taking into account diverse backgrounds or groups are rotated between the two papers.",
    "I had a really good group experience in this class, but others maybe did not. The instructors mentioned pre-determining groups ahead of time. I would suggest a class or two on the beginning to lay out some material on how groups should\/could function, troubleshooting, communication, leadership sytles, etc (someone from SOM could do this really well). I also mentioned that perhaps offering the students to take their Myers Briggs or DISC assessments could not only be valuable and eye opening to them, but could also facilitate building complementary groups. The group evaluation at the end was really helpful - that kind of feedback is good. The evaluation could perhaps be a little more in depth, and\/or allow for open-ended responses.",
    "Advantages:Diversity in ideas and knowledgeDivision of LaborLearning from each other, inter-disciplinaryDisadvantages:Too much time spent on discussionsDiverse ideas difficult to synthesizeNot everyone is punctual",
    "Advantage: It was very bewildering to see how people from different backgrounds looked at solutions and problems. This made us brainstorm for more practical solutions.Disadvantage : Time to meet with yourgroup members was a challenge especially when you have more than one case study together. Since everyone of us didn't know each other very well, it was a challenge to form a group in the first place.",
    "Not helpful. Everyone is on different schedules which makes group work difficult to coordinate.",
    "I hated it but I suppose it\u00c2\u00b4s like the dentist.",
    "Would have been nice to pick a different group for the second paper.",
    "It was a good way to work with my peers. Not sure if the point was to teach us to work together as it may actually occur in our professions.",
    "Advantage: pulling together several backgrounds to collectively come up with a plan. Disadvantage: I would've preferred to work with different people on the second case study.",
    "See question 13.",
    "When the groups worked, I benedited substantially through discussions with my group members. However, when they don't work, it can be challenging to focus on the task at hand.",
    "Our group workedreally well together. I think it is key to find people that have skills and expertise that complements yours so we had a variety of backgrounds.",

It also is great experience in working with groups and writing policy-oriented papers. It's not an insignificant amount of work, but worth the effort. The team-taught nature of the course is what really makes it great. Finally, the different frameworks the course presents (causal loop diagrams, policy matricies, problem framework) are really helpful.",
    "Picking your own group members is key, be strategic and try to find people with a variety of strengths (policy, science, etc)",

International with no special interest in water should think carefully about this course.When taking - take the readings really seriously, otherwise you'll feel lost in class; put a lot of energy on your papers, they were the main learning method for me; talk to the instructors if having issues with your groups, professor Gentry was really helpful.",

    "Concentrate more on the methods and analysis. Get good group mates and meet with them more often. Try working on labs with group mates so you can have a consensus on methods when you work on your case studies. Most importantly you will have a better understanding of each others capacities and can work together better.",
