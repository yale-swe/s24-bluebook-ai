    "Strengths: Sophie is great! She gives 100% in the class and will get out of her way to help you out. Also, the class is very carefully designed and will actually help your language skills a lot. Weakness: Its at 10:30 in the morning which is way too early for me. Take the 11:35 section if you can and try to convince Sophie to teach that section.",
    "The textbook and online homeworks are not great. The homework in particular is kind of pointless. All the professors are really wonderful, though, and the class is taught very well. I know more German from 110 and 120 than French, and I took French for 7 years. That really says something.",
    "Sophie taught the course really well. The activities covered reading, writing, listening and speaking evenly and thoroughly, and I also found the emphasis on speaking freely without notes to be nice. Classes were primarily exercise-driven, which was also good for practicing. However, it is definitely a lot of time commitment. While the work isn't terribly difficult, it is of considerable amount and is consistent."

    "German is really fascinating because its so different grammatically from English, and the class is super fun and chill."
