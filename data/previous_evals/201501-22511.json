   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class and the entire department to any student looking for a language class. These classes are more interesting and engaging than most language classes I have taken previously, using more music, poetry, television, stories, and political debate to convey meaning and teach new words. The immediate ties of hebrew to Israel makes for not only a strong language class but a class that is interesting on the sociopolitical level as well, as much of our reading teaches us history or Israeli culture.",
    "If you take Hebrew 110, you're probably going to have to take 120 too because you'll need the credit and that's a good thing. I'm glad I went with Hebrew. It's been nothing but a pleasant experience and a welcome break from my other classes. Yes, it's challenging, but I can't believe how much my Hebrew has improved, particularly because I'm not particularly skilled with languages.",
    "Take Hebrew for your language requirement! Hebrew 120 is a fun class (with fun events as part of the course) where you also learn a lot of Hebrew. The Hebrew language has a fascinating structure as well. The Hebrew department is small but super-super welcoming to its students which makes learning Hebrew at Yale a great experience.",
    "Definitely take Hebrew! it's a great language and a fun department. I learned so much in just one year of Hebrew."
