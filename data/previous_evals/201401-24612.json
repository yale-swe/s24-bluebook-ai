    "I recommend it if you are curious about what we really mean, for instance, when we say that something is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. That is, if you are curious about the theory behind statistical significance and key concepts of social science research, you will learn a lot from this course. The course has no prerequisites, but it really helps if you have a bit of background in quantitative research or STATA. This was the first year this class had ever been taught so it was an experiment, but I do think I gained useful knowledge from this class that I will be able to apply in further studies. Also, I think this course will get better with time. So, yes, I do recommend the course.",
    "Maybe not in this iteration, but I think Kocher can make some improvements.",
    "Yes. It's challenging, unstructured, and will demand a lot of self-directed learning, however it's incredibly rewarding.",
    "A good course if you want a basic overview of statistical analysis, but it does require some background knowledge of STATA (particularly for the final paper). If you're a Global Affairs major it may be best to take it after AQA. Evaluations are based on a few in-class midterms and a final paper. The midterms were fairly straight forward as long as you paid attention in class and read over the lecture slides. Professor Kocher is very helpful if you are having trouble with concepts, particularly for the final paper which proved to be very difficult for everybody. He was very generous with his time and provided step-by-step guidance.",
    "I'm sure there are better research classes to take. If you are interested in learning about the theoretical underpinnings of regression analysis etc then you might find it interesting if you actually want to learn how to empirically analyze data, do not take the course.",
    "Yeah, but be on your game and don't expect silence in the class about the project of assignments to mean that you should not be working on them earlier. Pay attention in lecture and take good notes. Just be sure you understand exactly what the course is giving you before you take it because it may not be what you expect.",
    "Don't. You want take anything away from it (except maybe a decent grade) and you'll regret it"
