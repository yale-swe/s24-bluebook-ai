    "I expected this course to teach me how to understand financial concepts, not how to do them. While it is necessary to know a little bit of doing, it felt like we weren't focusing enough on the theory and concepts, and spending too much time on the details of how to manipulate financial statements. Since most of us won't be going into those roles, what would be more helpful is learning how to INTERPRET information.",
    "A lot of people complained about the material being presented too fast, but it seems to me this course was meant to be a survey so you now have a familiarity with the material which it accomplished. I don't know the material inside and out by any means but there were several 3 credit semester long courses crammed into 1 credit, so I wouldn't expect to. At least now I know where to find some of the information in the future.",
    "This course a farce. It is designed such that the student is not expected to retain knowledge or master the content in any meaningful way, and that the professor is not expected to teach. That a graduate course could have such low standards disgusts me, and that a faculty person at Yale could be receiving payment coming in part from my tuition for such exceedingly lazy performance is a discredit to the school. If I had any conviction that Yale FES or professor Burke were committed to improving the course, I would offer suggestions in the boxes below, but my only conclusion is that this class serves the purely transactional purpose of granting students a credit and an easy pass in a topic that looks good on a resume, and granting the professor a paycheck and a chance to 'teach' at Yale. The single most negative experience of my time at FES.",
    "Some things were breezed over so quickly I didn't get how they fit in to other parts of the class - like what are stock - how do they actually work?",
    "This course should be a 3 credits course. It is not effective in a 1cr mode.",
    "Class was great but too fast!! Also, because it's at the end of the day it's hard to concentrate and keep up with the pace.",
    "I was extremely disappointed with this course overall. The professor was not good at explaining concepts and even though she had powerpoint presentations 75+ slides long and lecture notes and in-class exercises, she still managed to leave out vital steps for completing the homework assignments. There was even inaccurate information in the lecture notes. On one assignment for instance, there was an example of how figure out a certain calculation in the lecture notes but when the exact same calculation came up in the homework, I was informed (by the T.A.s!) that I had done it wrong and there was another step that had been completely left out. She uses examples in class that seem almost purposely misleading. On one of the first assignments the example she had used lead me to understand one thing (specifically that the numbers don't show up on the income statement until a transaction is considered completed by both parties), while the T.A.s again had to clarify that actually it meant something different (that even if one party doesn't actually pay but the other party completed the work, then the transaction is considered 'complete' and the party that completed the work gets to count it on their income statement). This would have been easy to fix in class and I felt intentionally misled. Letting students \"figure things out\" on the homework is one thing, being so bad at explaining things that the assignments are impossible to complete on our own or intentionally trying to be tricky is something different, and not okay.",
    "Mixed feelings. Huge course (60 students), late evening in a dark room in Sage, taken my final semester. I am usually motivated to soak up knowledge in all courses, and couldn't muster up energy in this one. That could be a reflection of my unfamiliarity and disinterest with the subject matter, the instructional structure, or my own personal motivation. I did not get much out of this class, but I felt like I should take it. Homework was stressful (despite beyond-fantastic and very dedicated TAs). Pace of class was rapid-fire: far too fast to take notes. Felt more like a speed language course than a conceptual foundational class at times, but again, I only put in minimal effort. I recommend: if you do take it, decide beforehand how much time you'll put in. Consider doing a self-paced course instead if you're like me. But, since you're taking the effort to read through these evaluations, I bet you're very motivated and will get a lot out of the professor's vast knowledge of the subject and thorough lectures.",
    "The class moved way too fast to truly understand the concepts taught, explanations were confusing as well.",
    "8) Professor Burke covered a lot of material in a short amount of time. She is clearly very knowledgable but didn't always give the fullest or clearest explanations. This could have been due to the amount of material she was trying to fit in. Overall the explanations were good but not quite as sharp as some of these concepts were covered in other classes I've taken.",
    "I expected this course to provide a big picture understanding of basic financial concepts (as the course title led me to believe). Instead, it felt like an overly detail-oriented accounting or bookkeeping course. The pace of teaching was way too fast for an introductory level course, and the information was very poorly communicated. There were way too many slides that did not convey information clearly. I rarely felt prepared to complete the homework assignments and felt I left this class without any useful knowledge that I had hoped to gain. I would have preferred to take a full semester course on finance at FES.",
    "In general about the course: The course is on-point, all substance, no fluff. Bout the instructor: Professor Maureen Burke is knowledgeable, enthusiastic, clear, concise and engaging. A wonderful educator.",
    "This material is so vital to so many MEM students seeking an introduction to finance. But the instructor presents material way too quickly and uses far too complex examples before anyone has a chance to begin to understand the material. This course would be better served as a full 3 credit course, and SHOULD NOT take place during the final weeks of the year.",
    "This course includes more accounting content than finance. I would call this course \"Introduction to accounting\". At any time the course treated environmental issues of any kind. Rather, the course goes through general cases but not environmental ones. The instructor goes very fast, at least in my opinion that I had any background in accounting. In some situations, the instructor did not have enough time to explain adequately important concepts since she overestimated the amount of information. Thus she went too fast in important concepts in order to be able to cover all the content she had planned fro the session. There is one assignment per week.",
    "There was too much material to be covered in a six week time period. The lessons were rushed and I left the class feeling like I did not know much more than when I started."

    "The examples provided and exercises were very helpful.",
    "The most useful parts of the course were the in-class exercises, the lecture notes and the assignments we had to work through. That said, the lecture notes were not well-organized and were not complete. The concepts reviewed in class and in the lecture notes did not prepare you to actually complete the assignments. The assignments themselves were useful but unnecessarily difficult because the concepts in them had not been well-explained by the professor at any point. It was as though assignments had been prepared with the expectation that we would just guess the right way to do them. It's one thing to throw a challenge in or something not explicitly covered, it's another thing to completely leave out vital information that is needed in order to get the correct answer. I will also point out that multiple times the T.A.s and the professor didn't necessarily agree on the answers to the questions for the homework. Or the T.A.'s would point something out or have us do something for the homework that wasn't incorporated into the answers given by the professor. In other words, the T.A.s seemed to have a better grasp of the concepts and were better at explaining them.",
    "Maureen was great at explaining concepts",
    "Learning basic accounting skills. Professor Burke covers a range of basic topics that seem very helpful to know. She also learned everyone's name immediately, which was really nice and made the large class feel smaller.",

    "Sitting and listening for two hours to a professor read off of powerpoint slides is never and never has been a good way for any human being to learn. That's exactly what class time was and it was a completely waste of time. A more useful exercise would be to provide us with the lecture notes beforehand, spend 10-15 minutes going over a short lecture boiled down to the basic, important concepts, and then spent the rest of the time working through problem sets. I would have gotten the exact same thing out of the class and wouldn't have wasted three times as much time on it. I really can't stress enough how useless it is to spend class-time (two hours!!!) reading off of powerpoint slides.",
    "The course seemed very disorganized. The lectures did not flow well, the instructor's teaching style did not translate information well to students, and slides were fairly incoherent. The assignments were largely busy work and didn't provide a great deal of additional understanding.",
    "The Excel spreadsheets could be very confusing in terms of understanding what cells we could change and which ones were supposed to be left alone",

    "We went way too fast for beginners. The homework was too technical for my level of understanding. I got lost so early on in the course that I got nothing out of the homework because I had no foundation to build off of to even attempt the homework using my own brain without asking the TAs enough questions to try and piece something together and still not understand what I did.",
    "Material presented too quickly, with too complex examples.",
    "Improve the organization of what to include in each session, in order to plan the class' contents realistically and not overestimate. I would include cases of different types in order to understand better how to classify the components of the projects.",
    "Overall was good unless it only a one credits course meaning that a lot of materials have to be covered in a very short period of time. Some times the instructor was too fast to cover the class materials.",
    "The course goes too fast for someone who hasn't taken finance before. Also, the professor just reads PowerPoint slides, which could be done by students themselves online. Also the assignments are waaaay too long for a 1 credit class!",
    "Go slower when explaining an excel formula. Also, answers in ppt are not as helpful when they are taken from an excel doc since the formula is lost and it is difficult to see how the answer was determined. Review of homework was too fast for more difficult assignments."
