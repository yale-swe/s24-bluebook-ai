   "comments": [
    "It is a lot harder than it used to be. Now they have a new format\/structure.",
    "It is a good general calculus class. I would recommend it to a fellow student wishing to learn calculus.",
    "Math 112 seemed at first to be unnecessarily hard - class taught us only basic skills that were not of much use on the tests when we were expected toapply the concepts in ways we had never seen before. That being said, there are definitely more painful ways to earn a QR credit. The homework is pretty easy and once you figure out what the tests will demand, they're almost predictable. Take it with Wells if he's still teaching it, some of the other instructors were very difficult to understand when they ran review sessions.",
    "Its pretty much a refresher from High School Calulus so be ready to have people in your class who have already learned the material and are just taking it for a requirement. Go to the review sessions, do your homework and you should be fine.",
    "This course is a great introduction to calculus (in particular, limits and derivatives). I had never taken calculus before, but I feel I got a good grasp of the material. Math 112 definitely taught me important analytical methods, especially for economics.",
    "Meh, take it if you must. Some years apparently it is better than others",
    "The test material, in particular the final, is absurdly more difficult than what is presented in the book\/lecture. That is because Stephen Orsag uses these tests as an opportunity to boost his self-esteem by proving what he knows and how much the students do not.",
    "Yes",
    "Yale math has been very disappointing to me. Avoid it if possible, but if you have to take this then it is what it is... Also, if you're a person that took Calc AB and is deciding between this and 115, take 115, this class covered less than Calc AB and therefore was all basic review, and even with this, the tests were ridiculously hard because it was always on high level applications of problems that we had done minimally and simply in class."
