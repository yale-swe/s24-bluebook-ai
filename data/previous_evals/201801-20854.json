   "comments": [
    "Learnt quite a bit about explanations regarding different puzzles in finance. The focus on psychological models and behavioral explanations offered a fresh perspective from the \"rational\" framework.",
    "This course provided a survey of the field of behavioral finance. I left with a clear understanding of some of the \"big\" ideas and questions in behavioral finance, and some insight into avenues for future research in the field.",
    "I developed a big picture of the field of behavioral science. Reading papers suggested by the instructor helped me learn more about specific stands of research I am especially interested in.",
    "I developed a solid understanding of the behavioral finance literature",
    "I learned a lot about behavioral finance and how it helps explain many concepts in the aggregate market, cross-section of returns, and corporate finance.",
    "Greatly appreciated this survey course which equipped me with the conceptual frameworks necessary to continue learning and reading about behavioral finance.",
    "Behavioral finance concepts, research from the beginning of the field to present-day, developing research questions, analyzing published research and familiarity with understanding the evolution of behavioral finance from the rational to the psychology-based frameworks and models.",
    "Important facts, puzzels, issues in asset pricing and corporate finance. Important behavioral models that can explain those facts.",
    "An engaging, structured, and rigorous overview of behavioral finance accessible to majors and non-majors alike."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was well-structured and clear.",
    "The course was very well structured and clear, which really helped us to follow it better. The professor is amazing and always very nice to listen to our doubts and questions.",
    "The course is very well organized and structured, which helped provide clear takeaways from the course. Broadly, behavioral finance can be divided into a set of empirical facts that traditional finance models have struggled to explain, and a set of \"behavioral\" theories that have been proposed. The course is well-structured to clearly outline puzzling and important empirical facts in finance as well as behavioral theories that can be used to explain these empirical facts.",
    "Strengths: It opened a whole new world to me, a student who had only studied finance in the rational framework. Weaknesses: The pace of the course is not uniformly distributed over the semester. It is a little bit tight in the first half, but too loose in the second half. Improvements: It may be a good idea to ask students to write a summary for some of the papers in the reading list. For example, they can choose 10 during the whole semester. It does not have to be long, a page maybe. It might be too much of workload, but it definitely helps students read and learn more.",
    "Strengths include: course notes were very well organized and clear, very clear teaching throughout, solid broad overview of the behavioral finance literature. Weaknesses: n\/a",
    "The professor does a great job of clearly presenting a large quantity of concepts.",
    "Strengths: structured, well-organized and clarity in explaining concepts. Improvements would include more timely feedback on assignments to track personal progress on the course, as well as clearer outline of the exam format.",
    "Structure is very clear."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a well-organized course in which you could develop a very clear understanding about the Behavioral Finance with the minimal cost.",
    "It's an interesting course to take; it's not difficult to follow even if you have no prior background in finance.",
    "As an undergraduate, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is very interesting and gives you a nice foundation for developments in behavioral finance. I also found the homework assignments to be thought-provoking and very reasonably spaced out. Overall the course is definitely manageable for undergrads and Professor Barberis does a great job of providing alternative assignments that undergrads can choose to complete if the main homework is too technical. I'm really glad I took this course - it was a great experience and I feel like I got a lot out of it.",
    "Yes. For students that are interested in finance (in an academic and practitioner sense), this course provides a great combination of facts and economic theories that have been proposed to explain those economic facts. I took away interesting and useful background information about the field of finance, and also learned about potential avenues of research to pursue in behavioral finance.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in finance. Even if they are not so convinced by behavioral finance, it never hurts to know more. At least you know what others are talking about at seminars and conferences.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend. I think it is an important literature to be aware of as a finance\/accounting\/economics PhD student, and I thought the class was very well-structured and organized and the teaching was clear.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in finance.",
    "Yes - for a student interested to learn about the field of behavioral finance, its methodologies and applications to current financial problems, this course will contain many insights. Professor Barberis is very knowledgeable and structured in his instruction.",
    "Yes, students can get big pictures of financial markets and behavioral models.",
    "The best economics class, maybe the best Yale class, I've taken, full stop. If you're looking for a primer on behavioral finance or even economics, take this class. Barberis teaches very well, providing an engaging and structured overview of the subject, backed with plenty of paper citations that gives the course a comforting amount of rigor, as opposed to the other \"Behavioral Economics\" SOM class that at times sounds like pop psychology. Barberis also draws out the math and models underlying the content, but emphasizes the broader qualitative conclusions in a way that makes the class very accessible for non-hardcore finance types like myself. I found this class very refreshing in the face of all the other economics courses centered around rational markets, because let's face it, people aren't totally rational, and those classical models only go so far. As a bonus, Barberis's British accent and cadence makes lecture pleasant to listen to."
