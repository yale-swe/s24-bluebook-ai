   "comments": [
    "I learned about various techniques psychotherapists use (i.e. CBT, ACT, DBT, etc.) by learning about their underlying theory as well as using the techniques on myself and others in the class. I also learned about how those techniques change when working with individuals, couples, families, and groups and gained insight on how therapy techniques can be improved.",
    "a lot about multiple methods of therapy and myself",
    "I learned a great deal about where the field of psychotherapy currently stands. The weekly responses allowed me to test out and critically evaluate the claims and skills proposed by each therapy.",
    "So much!!! I learned about methods for providing good therapy, what it takes to be a good therapist, and why different therapy treatments are effective.",
    "This course is a survey of a number of psychotherapy modalities. You get to learn about the core aspects of each modality and practice some elements of the therapies themselves. The seminar discussions allowed us to begin important conversations about what administering these treatments in therapeutic settings is\/should be like. Part of me feels like this should be a two semester sequence in the psychology department offered every yearwe covered a lot, and I also think there is more to learn! The class was great, and I would definitely take another semester of it.",
    "I learned about the different forms of psychotherapy.",
    "Great overview of a variety of therapeutic techniques used in the field. Opportunity for introspective reflection using these techniques in a relaxed environment.",
    "We learned various psychotherapeutic techniques via videos and handouts and were often instructed to try out these techniques in our own lives.",
    "Despite being a psychology major, I had never learned very much about psychotherapy before taking this course. Now, I feel like I have a working understanding of a wide range of different therapies and their uses. This course was really enjoyable and I not only learned about many different skills and techniques in psychotherapy, but how to apply these skills to my own life. I especially appreciated that the class started with a unit on cultural competence in psychotherapy and learned that many therapy practices are not as straightforward or universally helpful as they may seem."

   "comments": [
    "This course is informative and fun. Having discussions about therapy-related papers and techniques with others in the class, as well as hearing about how Mary, who has tons of experience, thought about them was very rewarding. Learning the techniques also made me feel like I've left the class with something tangible that I can incorporate into my life. However, the course was new and still gaining some footing, so we didn't get to spend as much time on everything as we would have liked. =",
    "amazing class, 10\/10 would recommend",
    "Professor O'Brien is the course's greatest strength. She encouraged us to think and respond originally, and is an excellent facilitator (as to be expected from a licensed therapist). I wish that the class had slightly more lecture. I appreciated the discussions greatly but also loved the guided moments of lecturing by Professor O'Brien who is so knowledgable, which were more rare.",
    "Mary OBrien is just amazing.",
    "It was hard to balance the personal and academic in this course. While completing some of the exercises from the therapies themselves was definitely helpful and important in talking about the treatments, I think that having to turn them in as assignments was tricky. I think it might make it easier to keep the conversations focused on the treatment from the therapist's perspective if we were given sample scenarios of patients for whom to fill out the worksheets etc. For example, we are given the background of a person coming in with concerns about social anxiety in classroom settings, and the assignment would be to fill out what a fear hierarchy might look like for this person. In class, we could discuss what difficulties we came across in constructing the hierarchy\/how it might be helpful\/how it felt to do the exercise putting ourselves in that person's shoes. This makes it a little less uncomfortable to be graded on completing therapy exercises, probably for the student and professor alike. Also, I think it would be appropriate to encourage students to complete the exercises for themselves outside of class if they wanted to in addition to the assigned scenario. They just wouldn't have to turn in their personal responses for a grade. I think the way the grading\/response format of the course was structured in general, though, was helpful and led to many fruitful class discussions.",
    "This course was great for seminar style discussion and class participation. I felt that the first few sets of classes relied too much on student input and subjective opinion stuff. More specifically, I felt like we didn't have enough objective knowledge going in to give the conversations we were having value. It felt like students with experience in therapy themselves did a lot of talking and speculating which was interesting but did not leave me with the feeling of having objective information I could trust. If the beginning could be a little more lecture style or informational to give others a baseline to develop opinions, then it may improve the value of discussion later on. The vignettes and other exercises were really helpful in learning and the video presentations were supremely helpful! Also taking the skills out of the classroom and working on them ourselves was helpful as an immersive aspect of the class.",
    "I think the writing assignments could be shortened, but other than that, Professor O'Brien is truly lovely and I loved every other aspect of the course.",
    "Strengths: (mostly) weekly response papers that helped us retain information from each therapeutic technique, Professor O'Brien's constant kindness and care for our learning and well-being (as evidenced by her prompt and thorough feedback to our response papers), experiential learning of the techniques Weaknesses: for some of the techniques I wish we had read more manual-type sources instead of trying to rely solely on experiential learning because I don't feel like I remembered them as well",
    "I really liked being able to have an open discussion with a relatively small number of other students which made each class feel both engaging and personal. The weekly reading responses helped me stay on track with the material without feeling too overwhelmed toward the end of the semester and it was really interesting to hear what different ideas each student had come up with each week. In future years, it might be helpful to make the schedule of reading responses a bit more regular by having them due on the same day each week, but overall, I loved everything about the class!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes! If you are interested in any career field that involves therapeutic practice, this class would be an excellent fit for you. In this course you will learn a little bit about many therapy practices and even get the chance to practice some of the techniques on yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend. I'm personally interested in pursuing psychotherapy as a career path, so being exposed to some of the skills and scenarios a psychotherapist deals with was invaluable to me. Also, because the grade (at least this time) was only comprised of reading responses, there was very little pressure to overdo it. We could just focus on the discussion we were having, which was super nice.",
    "YES! an amazing teacher with really cool material",
    "Yes. If you have any interest in being a therapist or even learning more about the ideas behind each therapy, this course gives a comprehensive overview without feeling too rushed. The responses are quite a bit of work, but they really helped me to develop my own thoughts; plus, the two free skips helped on the weeks when I had a lot of work in other classes.",
    "Yes! It's wonderful that this course was offered. It's great that the department is expanding course offerings in clinical psychology and this was a truly fantastic addition. My only criticism is that the class felt a bit too much like a group therapy session. The assignments that asked that you apply the material to your own life--though extremely personally helpful--I think detracted from the possibility of exploring psychotherapy from an \"academic\" perspective. Giving students tools to apply to themselves is a fantastic goal, but perhaps it shouldn't be part of the grade or of assignments. Professor O'Brien is truly extraordinary and a role model.",
    "Yes! Please take a class with Mary! She will change your life.",
    "Absolutely. You learn a lot from this course, and I would strongly recommend if you're interested in pursuing a career as a psychotherapist or are just interested in clinical psychology. Prof. O'Brien is one of the best, most invested, and most thoughtful professors I've had at Yale. You learn a lot from your classmates and from the discussions in class. There is a lot of reflecting and writing involved, but it's definitely worth itit helps you engage more deeply with the material.",
    "Yes, I definitely think this course is great for anyone looking towards the fields of psychology, therapy, or counseling. Mary is a great source of information and the topics she covers in dept give wonderful insight into the field.",
    "Yes, it was very illuminating to me to discuss all the different forms of psychotherapy that exist.",
    "Yes, absolutely! It's pretty low-key (we were required to write 13 1.5-2 page response papers over the course of the semester, with no quizzes, exams, etc.) and Professor O'Brien is an excellent teacher. It's also just the only psych class that goes into detail about how to conduct therapy, so it would be super enlightening to take if you're interested in going into clinical psychology.",
    "This is the best class Ive taken at Yale. I wish every student had the opportunity to take it, because the material is so relevant and valuable to know. Professor OBrien is truly lovely and makes class discussions engaging and effortless.",
    "Absolutely! This was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. The professor is very kind and respectful of all students in discussion and uses interactive activities practicing skills in psychotherapy to make each class engaging. The discussion format worked great and it was really fun to hear the ideas that other students brought to each class. The weekly reading responses made it so that the workload was evenly spread throughout the semester. I not only gained a working understanding of psychotherapy from a clinical perspective, but learned how to use many skills from therapy in my own life. I would definitely recommend this course to others!"
