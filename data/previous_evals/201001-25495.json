    "Its an interesting class and you'll definitely enjoy yourself. I would recommend it if you like having a good time while learning.",
    "Hindi seems to be a relatively easy language class, but it is taught in a somewhat arbitrary way. Sometimes we would have an enormous amount of work, and then for days we wouldn't have anything due. There are quizzes every week, which are annoying but do help you keep up with the material. Seema Khurana is a very good professor, but Swapna Shwarma is less good, and they switch off every other day. There are creative, fun midterm and final projects, though, and it's cool to learn a completely different script than English.",
    "Fun class, super nice professors. I wish class time was more often spent doing other things besides going over concepts straight from the book, but this was sometimes pretty helpful regardless.",
    "Absolutely! A beautiful language in an environment that is relaxed and fun. Weekly quizzes are a bit annoying at times, but well worth it. The teachers are amazing and the class definitely forms a tight-knit community.",
    "I would recommend Introductory Hindi to another student, as it offers a solid introduction to the basic concepts of Hindi grammar. The teachers are really good, the material is fairly accessible, and the workload is very light."
