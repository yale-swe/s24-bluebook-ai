   "comments": [
    "Great great French class. Mme Koizim is a legend. We have been stimulated to use our French in the class instead of thinking how we can import English vocab to phrase our sentences. The small discussion groups were useful. The grammar does not bog down the class. The texts were amazing, right at our level. Be careful though, there is HW almost everyday and it is never a good idea to leave it to the last minute.",
    "I think I would tell another student that it is a pretty steady workload, and sometimes it can feel like a lot of work but it is very worth it and you can definitely see improvement throughout the course.",
    "Take it. You read an assortment of French books and watch movies. The grammar is essentially a review of what you have learned in 110\/120. The major new component is the vocabulary, of course. This class is very discussion-based. So the effectiveness of the class really depends on who is in your section and how active everyone is in discussing the books and films. Have an opinion and just say anything you can in discussion to get practice.",
    "A great class, but not for the faint of heart. Good grades are possible if you work hard, are disciplined, and are good with languages",
    "French 130 is very different from French 121 (which I took before L3). The semester is spent reading and dissecting French novels and two French films (subtitles are included, don't worry). I was very unsure of my French abilities coming into this course, and was very unsure of speaking my French in front of others, but this course (and Mme Koizim) gave me the confidence to do so. The material really is manageable, but does require that a lot of time is spent on homework every night. Most nights, you will have about 2 hours of French hw, so be aware of that, but it is really worth it, and the work is not boring if you are at all interested in French. Also the work studied is very interesting. Overall, a great class, whether or not you are required by language requirements to take it.",
    "Strongly recommend. Rigorous and interesting.",
    "French 130 reviews all the material covered in French 110-120 and adds additional grammar structures, vocabulary, and cultural exposure. It feels like the logical next step in language progression. It isn't a super exciting class, but can be fairly enjoyable, especially if you get Ruth Koizim."
