    "(1)Text was essentially a repetition of the the lectures, and while more content was present it was not presented any clearer, so served as a poor reference to improve understanding.",
    "The class was a little bit slower paced than my other classes, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.I feel that I really learned the fundamentals of the certain sampling methods, and have already started applying them in my MESc masters project work. However, the end of the semester got a little rushed due to rescheduled classes from earlier in the semester, and the final project did not get assigned until finals period was beginning. I really would have benefited from in-the-field demonstrations of techniques that were learning about in class, and really feel that I missed an opportunity to solidify my understanding of the content from the last half of the class.",

None of conservation, academic and research projects would be conducted without estimating the samples to be applied in the process.

    "Tim is very responsive to students' questions and general needs. The course had an overall feeling of being laid back, so there was not much stress associated with taking this course.",
    "Great overview of those sampling methods which are generally only touched upon in intro statistics courses, and also provides some new ones. The course leaves you with a good intuition for when and why a certain sampling method might be called for.",
    "The best aspects of this course were the assignments and home works on which students were working on for the whole semester. Every section of the course was sanctioned by a homework, which allowed students to deepen their understanding of the course. Also, the way the instructor commented students' works was very touching. Thus, students were encouraged and supported by the instructor to improve their skills and knowledge in the course anytime they needed it."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were NOT engaging, not to mention confusing. Especially as the notation used is not even necessarily universal, its utilization was a constant source of confusion, which could have been easily remedied with regular references to what each of the variables mean within the lecture text. Similarly, the text has essentially the same presentation of content as the lectures, so things that were not clear in one were not necessarily made more so by reading the other. While it was recommended for students to make our own \"key\" of the various variables used, I think it would be appropriate for the professor to provide this to students, as often in the text this is not clear, explanations are not always clear or linear, and small subtleties (eg cap or subscript)could mean very different things. For a student trying to learn the concepts being presented having to search through the text constantly in order to remember what a variable refers to (which is not always clear itself when it is explained) is an unnecessary draw on time that could be better devoted to understanding the conceptual material. More real-life examples, lectures that then demand students to work through problems in real time in class, rather than hours of discussion of greek letters in equations would be a vast improvement to help with understanding of concepts and applicability.",
    "The course was not very useful to students outside of forestry. The material taught in this course should be expanded to include a broader range of methodologies or FES should introduce another course to do so.",
    "The course moves slowly compared to other math or stat courses at FES.",
    "More exercises",
    "It would be good to have a file trip, where the use of different instruments and different sapling strategies can be applied",
    "Since students in the class come from different background but interested in gaining important skills and knowledge to be applied in their conservation, research and academic projects, I would suggest to resolve many exercises (examples) in the class, if time allows, one per section, and continue the approach of one home work per section."

    "The theoretical conceptual lectures of this course need to be linked in a practical sense to usable applicable knowledge for practitioners, and I feel as though too much emphasis was placed on explanations of concepts and theory, but I still don't necessarily feel as though I have a firm grasp for on-the-ground sampling, or options for methodologies in actual studies. Examples discussed in lecture seemed to represent non-environmental data and very specific examples of environmental data (tree surveys) with little discussion of sampling that may occur for other kinds of data sets",
    "Yes. The relationship between the class lectures, discussions and labs was effective. The course was designed in a way that there was a home work for every section of the course, which allowed students to improve their understanding of the course through these practical exercises."
