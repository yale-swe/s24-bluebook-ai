   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in anything. I think it is fundamental for someone in the STEM fields, but not only. When we did differential equations, I understood how many were the applications of differential equations.",
    "I reccomend the class yes",
    "Solid course. Definitely would recommend. Manageable workload and interesting math concepts",
    "It explores concepts and applications of Calculus. I would recommend it as it is a core class necessary for further math courses.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to a fellow student and let them know that the class is definitely not impossible to do well in. It requires a lot of learning outside of the classroom because it is a flipped classroom, but I believe the videoS are really beneficial. I would also recommend to take this class with John Hall as the instructor if at all possible.",
    "MATH 115 is a good intro class that has reasonable expectations and assignments.",
    "I'd recommend it if you need it for your major or if you just happen to love me.",
    "Yes I would recommend. It's helpful for continuing in math or economics",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in math or needs the class as a prerequisite.",
    "Please do not take this course if you have not taken an advanced level calculus course in high school. I would only recommend this course if you know you are able to put in the work to learn the material, because it is not easy.",
    "I would recommend MATH 115 01 to fellow students because the class was well taught by the instructor, but i would warn them about the flipped classroom aspect.",
    "I would summarize it as a well-taught math class that you probably have to take some equivalent of as a pre-req. If you just need qrs I would recommend something more niche \/ \"exciting\" but there is great merit in what this class teaches you.",
    "Take this class if you still have any interest in Calculus. You will really learn a lot in this class and will see math in a whole new light.",
    "I would absolutely reccomend this course to my peers in the future, the course was well run,well designed, and very imformative.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 01 to any student who is looking to become comfortable in mathematics before jumping into any higher level math. I would however warn them that the difficulty of the course is quite high and that a lot of studying on their own may be required.",
    "MATH 115 provides a very good overview of the concepts of calculus. Although I hear the quality depends quite significantly on your instructor, it is about as good as an introductory math course should be.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward calculus class. I took this as a prerequisite for my major, as I'm sure many students did. This class isn't overly difficult, but you should definitely do the homework if you want to learn the concepts. The homework is a weekly problem set and video lecture\/prep problem or two. The flipped classroom set up is fairly helpful. Before each class you watch a video explaining new topics. You may or may not answer a few easy problems related to the new concept, before going further in depth during lecture. I thought this helped me come up with questions before class, and did not make understanding the concepts any more difficult.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the class for a current student, because the format requires the student to essentially teach themselves the material, and that is difficult for math.",
    "It is a good course if intended to be used somewhere in the future. Well taught but not those classes you can just take",
    "The flipped classroom is helpful, but it can be a bit tedious to remember to do the prep problems multiple times a week. Examinations are definitely challenging and the style is very different from other math exams I've taken, so make sure not to fall behind. I had trouble with series since I had never taken Calc BC before, unlike many of the students in the class, which made the course more difficult than I expected. A solid course, but most of the material won't come up again in later levels of math.",
    "Yes, I would recommended as the course is well-designed and there are online videos and quizzes to help you learn better.",
    "I would recommend it as an intro math course for those who took call in high school. It provides a strong base in calculus for any other mathematical field."
