    "Some cool guest speakers, but class is mostly optional if you feel like skipping. Class is schedules for maybe a fourth of the weeks. Start the cases early. Not too much work, but you don't want to leave it for reading\/finals period. Just tell your to team to get it done before thanksgiving!",
    "One of the best classes I've taken so far: you really get a lot of hands-on experience (absent from many - if not all - Yale classes), and really learn a lot from the case writing process. Do expect to spend A LOT of time on the case, though, and please start early (especially the media processing work that everyone seems to put off until the last minute).",
    "I learned quite a bit in this class, considering I had very little background in Social Enterprise. However, the course would benefit from more substantial academic content. Great opportunity to work with a real social enterprise startup on the ground, rather than in the photoshopped hyped conferences in the u.s.",
    "YES YES YES! If you can get in definitely take the class. This is the second semester of a year long class. During the fall semester all the groups basically are focused on getting the case study in order. Putting together such a case study will help you develop a skill set which would be valuable in a lot of places. Yes, you'll have to put in more hours than your usual class but, at the end of the day, it'll be so worth it. Also, Bo would probably one of the best instructors you'll encounter at Yale.",
    "If you have any interest in the intersection of business and development and\/or the field of social enterprise, take this class for a really hands-on approach to studying a social enterprise. No other development classes address this incredibly interesting and relevant field. You'll learn to think about the opportunity and challenge in pursuing both social goals and financial sustainability, and you might find this class to be something that changes the direction of your career interests. Be mindful that the second semester of the course does require a heavy time commitment.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and definitely would recommend it to other students- it's a fantastic opportunity to travel and get a look at social businesses. The course is flexible in the location you go to and the company you study so you are completely free to follow your own interests. The first semester is definitely more scheduled than the second but both have equal amounts of (not overwhelming) work. Bo is a lovely guy who really cares about his students, and you get to meet some cool people along the way. This, if you have any interest at all in social enterprise I strongly suggest you take this course.",
    "TAKE THIS!!! Even if you don't know what a social enterprise is\/have never heard of one (ahem, me), you will learn what it is and so, so much more in the process. This class gives you the analytical skills to shallowly assess a business model and then gives you the opportunity to actually apply them on a trip to the social enterprise itself. If you're interested in social development, this is such a breath of fresh air and an invaluable learning experience.",
    "Take it if you see a lot of structure and guests in the syllabus. The summer experience is fun. Thats about it though.",
    "Yes, take it. No other opportunity like it at Yale!",
    "The way the class is formatted is very conducive to actually really getting a solid understanding of social enterprise- you learn more theory\/empirical examples of successful social enterprises\/the big\/general questions in the field first semester (i.e. pros and cons microfinance, BOP targeting, mission tradeoff, financial viability, impact investments, etc.), and then you work with your group to find an actual social enterprise you like and then go there over the summer, and then this semester we built a case study with a targeted question based on all our interviews\/knowledge of the company.Very unique class, even among Yale's selections. A must take if you're interested and can commit 2 semester and a few weeks of your summer (you can still do another internship). By far the best class I've taken at Yale."
