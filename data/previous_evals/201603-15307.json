   "comments": [
    "This course does a good job providing an overview of techniques, but I found that the quality of coverage varied depending on who was giving the lecture of the day. I think that this course presents an amazing and unique opportunity to do research as part of a course, but I think that there are limitations on the techniques that are feasible, and this results in lots of people using the same basic technique.",
    "Strengths were the teaching style, small class, teachers' knowledge, the flexibility of the class in allowing us to undertake our own project, guest lecturers and field trips. Weaknesses were very few and far between, can't even think of one."

   "comments": [
    "I think it is a decent overview course, and is required for archaeological studies majors; however, I think that there are probably better and more interesting courses if you do not need to take it.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course for anyone interested in Archaeology or just exploring how we test things. Great instructors, great content, great guest lectures and field trips (to West Campus), this course is well-rounded and complements any degree perfectly. Also the independent aspect of the final is good preparation for senior projects. Outstanding course.... take it!"
