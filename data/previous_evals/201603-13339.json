    "This was by far my favorite course this semester, and one of the most useful courses I've taken at F&ES. Ann is a true teacher as well as a scientist, which is a quality that I believe academic institutions should value over everything else. I would suggest Stand Dynamics to anyone with an interest in forest development and management.",
    "This course required a lot more reading than I was expecting, and more theory. It also required some self direction, as there were never really any \"guidelines\" per se for the assignments. The field trip was AMAZING and Professor Camp is wonderful.",
    "-Course was perfect other than the exams, which didnt motivate much in terms of work (I did all of the reading for the course, not because of the grade-motivation, it being grad school, but because I felt I needed to learn the material). The exams did motivate last-minute terminology memorization, which makes me think that itd be useful to hand out a glossary of terms that summarized each for students. -Anns experience as a practitioner was really valuable for the course, and its a real shame that shes retiring. F&ES should have made a stronger effort to keep her; this is a classic example of how the narrow-minded focus on research-based academic experience is a detriment to the school. Ann was by far my best teacher this fall, perhaps because she had made a conscious decision earlier in her time at F&ES to focus on her pedagogy instead of on research. A narrow-minded emphasis on research and publication cuts out practitioners for certain disciplines (e.g., urban forestry; how many urban forestry researchers looking to join academic faculty are there versus the number of folks who have actually practiced urban forestry?)weakening the schools offerings. This research\/publication emphasis also goes against the goal of the school, which is, in my understanding, to train professional practitioners using the best available science. A course with a practitioner (and one who also, but not exclusively, did innovative research!) like Ann is far more valuable than one with a researcher who has been holed up in their conceptual echo chamber for the past few decades. And of course, there is some question in my mind whether an anti-practitioner bias inadvertently (assuming the best of intentions) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities, by limiting the pool of eligibility to the traditional bastion of white male patriarchy: the academy. Yales current solution seems to be to offer less-than-tenure-track-positions (e.g., lecturer) to the female practitioners, reserving the tenure track for the male researchers who have been around the academy for longer. Is that really a viable solution?",
    "The field trip to Great Mountain was a lot of fun, but we did not go over much that I hadn't already learned before.",
    "I love the class and I'm sorry to see Ann go. I won't every look at forests the same way."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor's knowledge and familiarity with the topic, as well as extensive field experience.",
    "Very clear lectures and well structured in-class discussions.",
    "This seems like half-joke response but it is not: I learned what I expected to, in the way I hoped to learn it, by taking this course. Ann lectures with confidence and a passion that is tangible, and she comes with a high level of experience as a scientist\/researcher in the field. Most importantly, she expects students to put in the time and effort to master material. This is not a class where you can tune out until the end of the semester and then throw together a quick final project to squeak by. Ann holds students accountable, but she also holds herself to a high standard of teaching. We could use many more of her here.",
    "The field trip to Great Mountain Forest was very, very fun. It's nice to get to know classmates a little bit better and Professor Camp really fostered a nice ambiance.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the processes of forests, and the main drivers behind their dynamics. Though this class had a heavier reading load than others, it introduced me to a wide range of research and literature that I can build on for the rest of my time at FES. The student presentations the last few weeks of class were definitely the highlight.",

    "Though I certainly wouldn't push this actively, I think any student graduating from the Yale School of Forestry should have at least a little bit of forestry knowledge. Ann provides an excellent learning platform for people with all levels of previous experience in this course. I came into Stand Dynamics as an MESc student who has not taken a forestry course since undergrad--which was a few years ago--and I found this course to be very helpful. I have friends with more and less experience who have voiced similar opinions. This course has shifted my research interests so that forestry dynamics are more at the forefront. It has been one of the most impactful courses I've taken at F&ES.",
    "This course was very relevant to the MF, MFS, and MESc degrees. The needs of these students should be upheld after Ann leaves.",
