   "comments": [
    "Great exposure to lab work. You will be involved with an active, patient, and educating team.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psychology 492 with Dr. June Gruber to another student. You will learn so much about emotion research and have lots of fun!",
    "It's a great way to get research experience. Though the time commitment is a lot, lab itself is generally pretty fun.",
    "This course provides a great avenue through which students can conduct their own research in the field of psychology. I would certainly recommend it for those students who have already identified a specific area of interest that they would like to research.",
    "If you can find a good mentor, take it!",
    "It is an opportunity for you to carry out your own ideas and research, you should try it starting junior or even sophomore year. You can also use this option for your senior thesis.",
    "This is a self directed research course. The content and schedule varies between professors and projects, so just make sure you know exactly what you are signing up for by asking all questions before you enroll. I would definitely recommend for seniors who are trying to write an essay on a topic in which they have an interest.",
    "I'd recommend it, if you want actual research experience o the day-to-day work.",
    "yes.",
    "You do a research project. It's up to you what that means.",
    "Definitely do this if you're looking into doing an empirical project on your own at some point, or just do it for fun. I had a great time working in doing research.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in research.",
    "Yes, do it if you want to do your own research. Especially if you're considering grad school, taking this class will give you a taste of what it's like to be a grad student (structuring your own time, taking and initiative to get your projects started, etc.) and let you figure out if you want to spend 4+ more years doing this. Don't expect the opportunities to come to you while you sit back, though; you really have to get things started on your own if you want the most out of this experience.",
    "Great way to balance out a schedule - doing research for credit is not only fun and educational, but you'll meet some interesting people. Just be sure you are willing to dedicate as much time as a regular course would take.",
    "Do it. It's really a great opportunity.",
    "yes, its a good way to get lab experience! i had a grad student (anna) as the researcher, so i helped her run studies. just had to write a 20 pg paper at the end which was really grueling but not too bad considering thats the only major piece of writing you do all semester :)",
    "great experience!"
