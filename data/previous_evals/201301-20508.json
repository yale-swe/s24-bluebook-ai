   "comments": [
    "This is a great introduction to the topic of global health as approached by medical anthropologists. We covered many of the seminal works from the field across a number of topical areas. I would definitely recommend the course to other students, but warn that they be prepared to dedicate the required time to reading. The reading load is a bit of a commitment, but well worth it if interested in global health from an anthropological perspective. I especially recommend this class to public health students doing global work, since it introduces studentsto important theoretical approaches.",
    "I would say that in this class you read an ethnography a week on a different topic in medical anthropology, and these topics range from AIDS to polio to ebola to reproductive health. I would only recommend this class to fellow students if they were willing to do a lot of reading, and possibly only if they had some background in medical anthropology. If they were interested and motivated, I would happily recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was really helpful for seeing the various styles in which people have written ethnographies in medical anthropology. Some authors are more present in the text than others. Some are clearer with their methodology. Some of are more critical than others, while some emphasize policy implications of their work. They utilized a variety of theoretical approaches (both cultural and biological). Overall, it was really helpful to be able to compare the various approaches to one another and deliberate as how what worked and what didn't and what was more of less useful.",
    "This course really help deepen my knowledge of medical anthropology, as it exposed me to many works and perspectives. I don't yet know to what extent it contributed to my research, but I believe the knowledge and insight Igained from this course will be good to have."
