   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The variety of formats used to portray the class topics (e.g., books, news articles, videos, music, etc.) enhanced discussions and provided helpful sources for assignments. All of the assignments were engaging and allowed us to expand our thinking. Weaknesses: The discussions could have been a bit more structured by receiving the questions from the student facilitators a few days before the class.",
    "I found this course extremely hard to access. Perhaps I should have known, given the title of the course, but the readings are extremely theoretical, to the point of being largely inaccessible to me. Class discussions felt very hurried -- Prof. Fischel is brilliant but often has so many ideas, his attempts to cram them into the beginning portion of class frequently feel rushed and muddled. It would also be better to leave more time for students presenters to present and facilitate discussion -- it was frustrating to have class presentations\/discussions be extremely short and rushed, and then bleed into the following week's class, when students no longer had the texts fresh in their minds and which perpetuated the problem of not having enough time. There are also an unusual number of assignments -- too many, in my mind -- which could easily be culled down into a more focused and more manageable number of tasks (regular Facebook posts, attending events, writing an event reflection, a book review, leading class discussion, and a final paper or syllabus project).",
    "This was a fantastic course. Great discussion, excellent readings. Joe Fischel is a very talented instructor."
