   "comments": [
    "I think this was a great way to learn a lot of really interesting and very important history. It's definitely a survey of a lot of history, but I think that you have the opportunity to learn a ton.",
    "If you are considering taking a class on the modern middle east, take this one. Professor Amanat is a bit disorganized at times, but the reading is great and section is very well led. Try to get into Waleed's section if he is around next semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. Regardless of whether you know nothing about the Middle East or whether you know a lot, you will learn more information by taking this class. Professor Amanat is a great professor with a dominion on the subject, The lectures are very interesting and full of really great personal stories. The readings are very manageable and very interesting (especially The Arabs book, one of the best books I've ever read). The work is also very manageable and the exams are very straightforward. Both of the TA's are great. Take the class!",
    "If you are looking for a fascinating overview of what has happened in the Middle East in the last 250 years, take this course. It starts far back enough to give students a very necessary sense of context for events that come later, and yet still leaves room to discuss recent events. There's a lot of reading, but if you do most of it and go to all the lectures, you will learn a great deal. Professor Amanat is incredibly knowledgeable and good at presenting material clearly. Past students have complained that he is a dry lecturer, but I think that if you come to class alert and are actually interested in the material, you'll get a lot out of the course. You need not have background knowledge about the Middle East to take this course.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to get a brief introduction into a very complex topic. Professor Amanat and the TAs was absolutely fantastic! The sections are fun, and the readings are super interesting - the only time I actually did the readings for a class.",
    "Definitely--one of the better \"rest of the world\" history courses offered at Yale.",
    "Hist 348 is a great survey course on Middle Eastern History, but be prepared for it to feel like sort of a touch-and-go on a plethora of different topics\/stories, without much of an in-depth look into any of them (in other words, if you already know your Middle Eastern History well, don't take this course). Readings are very heavy and sometimes dry; lectures are long and easy to lose focus in (not because Prof. Amanat isn't fascinating, but simply because of his tone of voice\/manner of speech); there's both a final paper AND a final exam on top of weekly reading responses and a midterm, so make sure you go into this class with genuine interest."
