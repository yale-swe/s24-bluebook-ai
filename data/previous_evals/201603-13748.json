   "comments": [
    "Had a bunch of good discussions about Korea and Japan. Learned some history and current events of both.",
    "This was the first history-esque course I've taken at Yale (because it immediately pertained to my interests--Japanese pop culture!) and was probably the most rewarding course I've taken at Yale. I learned to contextualize the present with historical systems of colonialism in the past. I became #woke about the international relations and relationships between the West and the East in ways and built on previous (albeit undeveloped) knowledge on capitalism, globalism, media, etc.",
    "How to approach comparing cultures--in effect, what is \"culture\" and how do you compare two things without either conflating them or just saying \"A is not the same as B\" Bringing historical context to contemporary issues.",
    "I learned how to analyze intercultural texts and gained a deeper understanding of historic context of popular culture.",
    "It was very interesting to weave the history of imperialism between Korea and Japan through a focus on popular culture."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the readings and discussions were good. I think the presentations were hit or miss for how good of a discussion they provoked.",
    "I loved the course actually! I don't think anything needs to be improved.",
    "Strengths-- obviously any course that lets you analyze manga, anime, and K-Pop is interesting right off the bat. The course is well-organized and even though the historical background section at the beginning feels like a slog, as the course progresses it's clear that it's necessary. The various weekly assignments keep you on top of the readings and aren't a huge time commitment. Weaknesses-- again, the imperial history section feels a little dry when compared to the real \"pop culture\" part of the course. How much you get out of the weekly meeting is dependent on how many of your classmates put in effort to do the readings, so, if you're the only one who seems to know what's going on that's just kind of rough.",
    "The conversational nature of the course was very engaging, but at the same time more guidance during lecture would also be helpful.",
    "The timeline of this course is great. It starts with the history of imperial Japan and its influences in Korea and then slowly ties in bits and pieces of popular culture that shed light on the nuances of imperial rule."

    "Professor Textor is fantastic. She is very helpful and chooses very interesting resources to discuss in class. I enjoyed going to seminar every week and I can't say the same for my other classes",
    "If you are interested in learning more about Korea or Japan since Japan's colonization to present or want some nice discussions I would take it",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU LIKE ELEMENTS OF JAPAN AND KOREA. It'll give you a broader understanding of the media you consume (and maybe even make you consider changing your major tbfh).",
    "I recommend this course to any student interested in Japanese and Korean culture beyond modern popular entertainment."
