   "comments": [
    "A good course. Less tedious than lower-level Chinese for sure and a lot of fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for students who want to keep up their Mandarin and eventually take more advanced electives. The courseload is quite manageable, so depending on what you're looking for, you may feel like you aren't getting as much out of a language course as you can.",
    "Chinese 154 was a fair amount of work (I thought it was more work than previous semesters of Chinese). However, my Chinese improved immensely this past semester. I feel much more comfortable reading, writing, and speaking Chinese than when I started Chinese 154. Also, Zhou Laoshi is an amazing teacher. He is very good at working with all different types of learners and is very funny. He gives very detailed grammar packets that havereally helped with my reading and writing proficiency. He often goes out of his way to make sure all students are accommodated. If you have a chance to take a course with him, I fully recommend it.",
    "I recommend it. Good for keeping Chinese near the front of your brain.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it if you want to keep learning Chinese. If you're coming back from a summer program in China, you will feel like the workload is very minimal. You don't get as much practice (meets 3 times a week), but you still learn, and the lessons are cool. Professor Zhou is the most caring professor you'll ever meet. He doesn't really correct pronunciation, which is the only downfall, but that's not too significant. Overall, awesome class!",
    "a Yes, take this class with Zhou Laoshi! Zhou Laoshi is a fantastic Professor who really cares about the students, and you'll have a lot of fun in the class. Chinese 154 only meets three times a week, which makes the workload much more manageable than with other Chinese classes before that. You can try to get into a higher-level course in Chinese if your Chinese is really good, but Chinese 154 is a good class that will also strengthen your grammar. Go to the Chinese language tables and spend as much time as you can speaking Chinese out of class."
