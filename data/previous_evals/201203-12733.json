    "PLSC 207 is the perfect class for those who are wanting to learn what it takes to make a good social science research paper.",
    "The workload isn't bad at all: the readings are usually pretty short and don't take more than 1-2 hours per week. You just have to have some answers to basic questions ready for class. That being said, he cold calls on people (basically just goes in a circle around the room) to answer these questions, so just make sure you have an idea of the readings.Also, at the beginning of the course, he said, \"Grade inflation as a problem at Yale... but it isn't my problem.\" That being said, I haven't gotten my final paper\/grade yet, but the grading hasn't actually been that easy through the semester (and same for my friends)... so unless he curves stuff up magically at the end, I'm a little skeptical of that statement.",
    "This class is all about research design. If you think you might want to do research or do any kind of graduate work in Political Science, take it. But it's really helpful to have some kind of stats background. Make sure you do the readings because this class is entirely discussion based, so it becomes quickly becomes obvious if you haven't done the reading. And then it's awkward. You should have at least a passing interest in state governments, otherwise researching their little quirks will be tedious. Overall it was a good course and I learned a lot about research design.",
    "This course is about experiment design, as examined through political institutions. The course has good readings, several articles each week, but the discussion is subpar. Perhaps knuckling down on preparation and seminar rigor might help, but this last semester was a more of a laidback chat during class.",
    "Overall, if you are interested in learning how political science research is conducted, this course will serve you well. Highly recommended for anyone who is considering going to grad school in American politics.",
    "I learned a lot about representation and cool things that affect our government. This class focuses heavily on research designs, so if you're not into political science research, don't take this class."
