    "mehhhhh...only take it if you have to. it's not hard, just boring.",
    "Pretty solid course. In the opening lecture, Prof. Beecroft spoke about the course's main goal: that we understand the forms of poetry, drama, and epic across cultural particularities. I think this course helped me get closer to it.",
    "I would not recommend this course at all. As a graduating senior with 43 credits spread about English, Humanities, Philosophy, Classics, German Studies and Comparative Literature, this course strikes me about the worst that Yale has to offer in the humanities. Completely disorganized, almost entirely irrelevant, and utterly bereft of insight, it offers nothing to its students but annoyance and ideologically inflected tedium. It truly made me embarrassed to be a Literature major.",
    "Wouldn't really recommend it, but you have to do it for the lit major.",
    "Don't take this class unless you're a Lit Major and it's required. It's a shame, and it could be improved, but it hasn't been yet."
