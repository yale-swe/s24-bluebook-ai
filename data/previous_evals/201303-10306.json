   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. I think that it offers a very comprehensive view on American and European foreign policies towards each other and the rest of the world.",
    "Seriously a great class with a great professor and a very interesting topic. Take it! I looked forward to class every week.",
    "Excellent, fascinating, and important course. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the modern transatlantic relationship and its relation to geopolitical issues in the past two decades and today.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Professor Howorth is one of the best professors, especially for a seminar, that I've had at Yale. Group discussions could sometimes be dull, but Howorth would actually take the time to teach or give a \"mini-lecture,\" which I appreciated. Relevant topic, engaging course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it\u00e2\u0080\u0094 very interesting, wide range of material, good density of material.",
    "Definitely recommend. A very interesting choice of topics, perfect for a global affairs track of study.",
    "Global Affairs 369 is a seminar-type class that covers a wide range of topics in the broader subject of transatlantic relations. The readings for each week prepare us really well for the discussion in class and every student can participate very easily since it is a small class.I would thoroughly recommend it to another student interested in transatlantic relations because it contains as much general information as precise topics on the matter, allowing the students to get a good grasp of the state of the relationship.",
    "An incredible seminar that discusses the intricacies of transatlantic relations since the end of the Cold War. Wonderful professor; and very useful class to analyze the modern world. Definitely recommend."
