   "comments": [
    "-maybe there could be a brief bullet-point outline of some things we could focus on each readings each week, so that we know what to look out for in readings",
    "Strengths: Diversity in weekly readings, small discussion group style where there's no apprehension of sharing an opinion, material can be universally understood between students of all majors, backgrounds, and years. Small break in between reading discussions during class. Prof Merrifield can lead discussion well throughout the class with interesting outside info, invites other students to lead discussion as well Weaknesses: Class would be more engaging if spread out over two days, talking about two readings for nearly two hours can be draining especially after a long night\/day",
    "The biggest weakness is the how the class is structured: two straight hours of discussion. I do not think that speaking with other students about the readings for two hours was the best use of that time. We were tired and out of ideas after about an hour, and as a result, a lot of time was just lost to awkward silences where people were trying to figure out what to say. I think that giving Professor Merrifield (her knowledge is a huge strength of the course) more time to lecture in the two hours would have been much more productive. The biggest strength of this course was the readings because they were relatively concise and very, very interesting."

    "Absolutely! It was so much fun talking about food for 2 hrs every week, would definitely recommend it. Always got to talk about fun things and read fun things.",
    "Yes! Redefines how you think about what you put in front of your plate 3-4 times a day, helps you inspire fascinating conversations over food with your friends\/family\/strangers. Learn much about food and what shapes it for a couple of hours of reading a week and 3 papers spread over the semester.",
    "If this course was still based on two hours of pure discussion, I would not recommend it. If the structure was changed to incorporate some other teaching methods instead of pure discussion, I would recommend it.",
    "yes, the proffessor helps understand the readings and provokes insightful thinking."
