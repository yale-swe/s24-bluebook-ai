    "I recommend it! It's hard, but worth it.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Russian!",
    "I certainly would if they have a spark of interest. The material as mentioned is difficult but the course is understanding and a large amount is learned with proper dedication.",
    "Russian 120 was a fairly standard beginning language class. Russian in general is definitely harder than a lot of other languages, so we go a bit slower- you won't be speaking fluently after two semesters. But the class is extremely rewarding and does a great job teaching a lot of pretty complicated grammar ideas.",
    "If you enjoy learning languages, I highly recommend Russian. It can be challenging but is super rewarding in the end.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. There is homework every day but it is not onerous and definitely worth it to learn the language. Professor Titus and the TAs are great and more than willing to help one-on-one."
