    "I had never taken a film class before so I learned a lot. Learned how to watch a film closely, following more than just the narrative, paying attention to important thematic details. Learned how to discuss the formal elements of a particular film. Learned how to analyze films in writing.",
    "Analysis of horror films throughout the later half of the 20th century.",
    "Deeply analyze film.",
    "I expanded my film repertoire which was amazing! And learned a million things about film that I never knew before as I've never taken a film class before. The syllabus is awesome!",
    "I learned about the theories behind why we enjoy horror films and the ideas behind their writing and directing. We did close analyses and studied some scenes in depth.",
    "I learned a significant amount about the horror genre, production of horror films, and film theory. We had interesting discussions, watched several films, and wrote two analytical papers."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent syllabus for the most part. Of the films I had not yet seen, I particularly enjoyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Videodrome (please don't remove it from the syllabus!), and Scream. The one film I felt should be removed from the syllabus was Bram Stoker's Dracula, as I felt it was a poor film that did not fit in well with the rest of the syllabus. This is most likely a matter of personal preference. I think the Production\/Reception presentation assignments should all be divided up amongst students during the first class, instead of piecemeal at the end of each class. A potential consideration could be sending a list of specific things for students to look out for while watching each film (e.g. The Shining: use of space, Native American symbolism, temporality, etc.) to help facilitate class discussion afterward.",
    "Wonderful class! Engaging and fun!",
    "The discussions are sometimes dry or heavily run by the professor rather than by student contribution. I think this is because the students in the class never got to know each other so few would feel comfortable or inclined to build off of each other's thoughts or push back against one another.",
    "The course is a good survey of the subject matter, American Horror Films from 1960-2000. I didn't like how heavily the class focused on theory, but then I'm more interested in the technical side of filmmaking.",
    "It was a great class -- it was a productive and interesting seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it! Professor Peucker is amazing and leads the most interesting discussions. The films were all great, and it was so cool to look at them in new ways. It is a class on horror films, so if you can't handle the gore or other taboos, then this is not the class for you. Workload is very light. Minimal reading, one or two films a week, and two short papers.",
    "For anyone remotely interested in horror films, this class is a must. The best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "It was an enjoyable course. One of the strengths is that there is high interaction with graduate students. But I think the course may have been geared more to the graduate students more so than to the college students. For them it would have been an easy course to knock out a requirement, whereas for the college students it was more of a course to hear what the graduate students wanted to say. I enjoyed the syllabus, though, tremendously.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can. It's a great 5th class!",
    "This course was very interesting! I learned a lot about elements of the horror genre and got to watch some great movies in the process! I feel like I understand a lot more references in society none actually. It was really eye-opening to different forms of art.",
    "Great and fun class for someone who is interested in horror films but not a film student",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in horror films and who enjoys studying film theory. If you don't enjoy the theory so much, the readings and some of the classes can be a slog.",
    "Yes, if students are interested in film and\/or horror, I would totally recommend the class. It it a fascinating seminar, and is a unique opportunity to learn more about horror films."
