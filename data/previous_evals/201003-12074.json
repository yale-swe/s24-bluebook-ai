   "comments": [
    "A course worth taking whether or not you are an economics major. It is extremely relevant if you want to understand what is happening with the economy.",
    "A course about the United States economy: how it functions, how the government gets involved, long term growth...Yes! You come out of it with a much better grasp on the economy.",
    "Great intro to macroeconomics. Lecture boring at times.",
    "Material is great and very connected to current events. Ray Fair has a very monotonous voice though... The textbook is great. Go to class and try your hardest to pay attention - it will teach you necessary things about how the world works and make understanding the news much easier.",
    "It is a good class on understanding the real macro economy and grading is very fair.",
    "This is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. I loved intro micro and thought the concepts of macro would be interesting - and they might be, but you would never know it by taking Ray Fair's class. Professor Fair is well-intentioned and makes himself available to students for help, but his lectures were utterly incomprehensible and sleep-inducing. The psets are thankfully graded on a check\/check minus basis, but the midterm was very unfair and contained random things that Fair may or may not have talked about in class but were not in the book. Don't torture yourself by taking this.",
    "It's a pretty standard intro econ course.",
    "If you're REALLY interested in econ, are an econ major, or need this class as a prereq, I would take this over the seminar. Sure, the teaching quality is diluted by the sheer size of the class, but it's also more bearable.",
    "I had low expectations coming into this class, as it didn't have very good reviews last semester. So I was surprised after attending the first lecture: this is a very good class!If Econ 116 with Ray Fair has any fault at all, it is that it is not an inspiring class. It will not make you love the subject if you didn't already like it.But if you are interested in economics, this is a great class that will give a strong understanding of the intuition behind introductory macro-economics and also some insight into the current state of the American economy.As far as lectures go, this class rates pretty highly. Fair may seem a little dull but he is a very effective communicator. He explains each concept in a straightforward way that gives you exactly what you need to know. This is very helpful to taking notes.The textbook is one of the best textbooks I've had, although I'm not sure how many will agree with me on this. It is paced perfectly for my tastes, without excess density of technical material and with a well thought-out composition of prose\/graphs\/side notes\/news. Each chapter can be finished in 15-30 minutes skimming and in an hour reading carefully. The textbook follows the lectures closely which is also helpful.My TA, Brian Kelly, was also very good. I always attended section because I found it extremely helpful to do so. There is no BS forced discussion and you won't be quizzed in section, but you WILL be given useful hints for the next problem set.The best part about this class is that it is application-based. Fair opens all lectures with a review of current economic news and throughout the lecture, ties many of the topics to real-world examples. Many of the problem sets will have you researching economic data from government websites. If you were confused by the extremely theoretical micro-economics, this is the class that ties those topics to the real-world.I found the concepts in this class to be tricky but not extremely challenging, if this is a concern. The course is not math-intensive.",
    "i'm not an econ major and took it credit\/d. it's an intro econ class so it's gonna suck. don't go in expecting more. fair is a brilliant economist, but a boring lecturer. though he's KIND OF funny. sometimes.",
    "Its not an easy or enjoyable course.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Otherwise, you might want to think seriously about whether this is something that actually interests you. Ray Fair is not the most interesting lecture, and the material is not as relevant to understanding everyday issues as you might think.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "Look, if you need it for your major, take it. If you don't, you might as well just read the textbook or the Wall Street Journal and save yourself the time and the numbing lectures.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the Macroeconomy in the slightest. It's relevant and not particularly time consuming.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone, as a working knowledge of how the macroeconomy functions is extremely valuable.",
    "Much better than intro Micro with Tim Guinnane.",
    "This class gives one the important tools from which to approach and understand macroeconomics. Fair isn't the most dynamic lecturer, but he is a great guy and keeps the material connected to current events, which is valuable.",
    "It's a basic introduction to all of the economics you see in the news. You learn all about the Keynesian model, inflation, unemployment, and output. I'm really glad I took it.",
    "Great introductory class. It teaches you everything you need to know about the major macroeconomics news happening around us in the real world! Lectures aren't 100% engaging, but you learn alot by reading the textbook.",
    "Yes, take it, especially if you've taken intro microeconomics, because it's good to have both. The workload is manageable - weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Yes. Take it. But note~Econ 116: You will fall asleep.Econ 116 book: You will fall asleep.In fact, you may not even want to go to class.Warning: Dont go to class + dont stay conscious = BAD GRADE + Brain fail.Fair isnt organized, and it may depend on how lucky you are with your TA, and whether or not they decide to hold productive discussion sections - but there is a lot of material so be prepared.READ the book, and the fine print too! If you follow my advice, you will actually learn stuff from this valuable class.",
    "General overview of macroeconomics. Very general. I would recommend it to those interested in learning about the economy as a whole and understanding the news (about economic indicators like the unemployment rate and output). I think everyone should have a basic understanding of macroeconomics, but perhaps Fair isn't the best professor to learn it from. I probably wouldn't have done as well in this class if I hadn't taken AP Macro in high school.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. For me personally, I struggled understandinga lot of stuff throughout the length of the course because it is slightly confusing and it all builds off of each other. However, towards the very end it all finally clicked together for me and know I have an excellent understanding of why our economy is the way it is and what factors affect it.",
    "Honestly, I think everyone should have a basic understanding of macroeconomics, which this course provides.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If possible, I would recommend that you take this class with a different professor. If I came out of it with a good grade, the only reason this happened is because I had a good TA and had 5 days before my final with which I had the chance to read the entire book. You will have no idea what's going on in this class if lectures are your only resource. However, even though I don't love macroeconomics, I think it's an important class to take. After taking this class, I feel like I can participate and weigh in on current economic affairs. I think this is a really important skill to have, and one that i definitely didn't have before taking this class. But honestly, take it during whatever semester Fair doesn't teach it. He's a nice guy but is completely clueless at lecturing.",
    "Econ 116 was a good course. Ray Fair can be a bit boring, but he tries very hard to bring a real-world framework to the material. Go to section, and get Chris Fiore if he is still a TA.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "Econ 116 is was it should be: a good and solid introduction to how the economy works, both in the US and in the world as a whole. It is a great satisfaction now to be able to understand economic articles in the newspaper every morning. I would highly recommend it to any student. The material of this course is something everyone should be familiar with.",
    "This class (and Ray Fair) have a really bad reputation, but I actually thought it was an excellent class. The textbook (co-written by Fair) is good, and combined with lecture, really give you a good understanding of the macroeconomy. I would definitely recommend going to every lecture. It really reduces the amount of work you have to do on your own. Weekly problem sets were easy and did not take long. Professor Fair has a reputation of being a very boring professor, but I don't agree. The material was really interesting, and Fair always knew what he was talking about, and was sometimes even funny. He did a great job incorporating current economic news into the lectures, and I came away from the class with a great understanding of the current economy. I would definitely recommend this class. I rarely had trouble paying attention in lecture.",
    "Let me start off by saying I don\u0092t think Professor Fair has been given fair evaluations in the past. Many students in the past have complained that he is a bad lecturer and the course is therefore lousy simple because Professor Fair\u0092s voice is a tad monotone. Yes, I admit he is a tad monotone, however, if you actually listen to what the man is saying then you will realize his lectures are really quite superb with fascinating material. Professor Fair\u0092s passion for both macroeconomics and teaching are evident in every lecture. He eloquently ties together concepts from prior lectures in order to better enhance his students\u0092 understandings of macroeconomic concepts. His integration of current events into teaching is truly superb and has allowed me to think clearly through the ramifications of any world event and how it will affect output, unemployment, inflation, and other variables in the country\u0092s economy and the economies of the rest of the world. Professor Fair\u0092s high level of effort is obvious in the way he would come to class extremely well prepared to teach the day\u0092s lecture and the manner in which he would deliver the lecture, leaving no detail unmentioned about the intuition behind aspects of the macroeconomy and why variables are related. Overall, this course covers all of the goals it sets out to meet as listed in the YCPS and I can truly say that I feel competent in understanding (and explaining to others) at least the simple intuition behind how a certain event will affect the economy. Professor Fair\u0092s textbook (the one assigned for the course) was really great and gave good examples and summaries of the material taught in class with insight into examples from both history and contemporary times. I would highly and without reservation recommend Introductory Macroeconomics with Ray Fair to any student who wants to learn about the macroeconomy and who has the necessary prerequisites because of the superb quality of teaching and the importance of the material in terms of public policy and the future well being of the world.",
    "The material in this class is absolutely fascinating and every college student should be exposed to it. Though the lectures can be a little slow and confusing, it is still definitely worth taking.",
    "The material is easy but involves a lot of memorization, since you basically have to know the whole textbook by the end. That being said, the book is very good and easy to understand. Despite Fair's words to the opposite, lectures can be skipped with no repercussions, as long as you know the style of questions he asks on the midterm and final. Not a lot of work during the semester, not that enjoyable, but a very doable class.",
    "I would say take it with a professor other than Fair.",
    "Econ 116 is the basic macroeconomics class at Yale, which explains the basic economic model and theories that are used today to describe the economy. If you are interested in the macroeconomy at all, I would recommend taking this class as it provides a good overview of the subject.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students of all majors. The information was very well taught and very applicable to real life\/current events, which made the class particularly interesting.",
    "Obviously, if you're gonna take it, you're gonna take it. But Ray Fair will be the most boring professor you have at Yale. And it won't be an easy A.",
    "Macroeconomics is useful and can be interesting. Try taking it with someone other than Ray Fair, though, either in the Spring semester or in a seminar. If you do take it with Ray Fair in the fall, then sit up the front of the lecture theatre with a cup of coffee. That's the only way to remain awake.",
    "yes its a good overview of macroecon",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you're trying to get to higher level econ classes...certainly not a walk in the park.",
    "Macro is super interesting and relevant. This is a class everyone should take. Ray Fair is a good professor and is very approachable.",
    "Very important stuff to know,",
    "I would not recommend Intro Macro with Ray Fair. Take it with any other professor!",
    "It's a good class for learning about the macroeconomy. While lectures can be boring, the material overall is very interesting and you learn abouta lot of things every informed person should know like the federal reserve and currency exchange. If you're thinking about econ as a major or are interested in the subject matter then take the class.",
    "Introductory Macroeconomics is the best class at Yale.",
    "Macro Econ is definitely a course that is worth taking, while difficult at times all the work is fair and reasonable.",
    "Lectures were kind of boring. The information is relevant, although some may argue you can easily just read the textbook instead of taking the class. Grade is based on where you fall on the curve.",
    "This class is incredibly fascinating and you will learn a lot of important things that are worth knowing today, especially given the economic crisis on hand. Note though that Ray Fair is a dreadfully boring professor so be prepared to motivate yourself a lot to stick with this class. Or just read the book. it's great!",
    "Sure -- students interested in the macroeconomy or who have to take 116 for the econ major would not do poorly to take this class. It's decently interesting and not very hard.",
    "Easy enough of a course--good SO if you're looking for one.",
    "The information is interesting for everyone - it's a base that everyone would benefit from having. But get ready to self-teach!"
