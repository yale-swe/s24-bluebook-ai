   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it because I found it not intellectually stimulating. Besides, it was very ambiguous in terms of its orientation. It was not that theoretical or applied in the Professor's teaching.",
    "A course that requires interaction with other students and the professor. I would recommend the course.",
    "It's pretty unfocused with a lot of dry reading. As a theory course goes though, it's a decent overview of IR theory basics, but that's probably repetitive from other courses in the IR program. Wouldn't recommend unless someone is really passionate about the theoretical role of non-state actors in every facet of foreign affairs.",
    "Good class on non-state actors and their roles in global governance. Includes theories that goes along with realism and against at least some aspects of traditional realism, which is a nice breather. I would recommend IR 650 because it has an excellent instructor and interesting readings\/discussion."

   "comments": [
    "It definitely broadened the issue areas where non state actors do play roles.",
    "It made me analyze how one attacks an issue and come up with a solution.",
    "Because it allowed a flexible final paper, I was able to research and write on organizations I'd like to work for or with in the future.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of IR theory because the focus was not so much on the State, but the \"other\" players, the ones I'm interested in moreso. I'm currently using some of the theories laid out in class to better analyze the organization I'm currently interning with (and their practices).The course definitely contributed to my major paper, but to what extent I am not wholly sure yet."
