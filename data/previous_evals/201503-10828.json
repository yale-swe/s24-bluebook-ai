   "comments": [
    "Physiology was a good course.",
    "I would not recommend that other graduate students take this class. It tripled my course work and made balancing class and laboratory responsibilities very difficult at times. I felt that I was at a disadvantage (in my other classes and in lab) compared to my peers because I took this class.",
    "I think anyone interested in physiology should take this class although it is definitely a cursory overview and not an in-depth view.",
    "AMAZING CLASS! One of the top 3 classes I've taken in 3.5 years at Yale so far, highly recommended. It is of course a lot of content, but you come out having a solid grasp of (and real appreciation for!) the way the various systems in your body work. The class is even set up to try to help you out--weekly problem sets that let you practice\/engage with the material in a low-stakes way cause you get an 100% on them if you do the assignment and attend section that week. There are also two midterms and a final, and they are tough but fair. Overall, you learn a ton of downright fascinating material, and it is definitely worth it. Take it!",
    "PHAR 550 01 is a general overview of human physiology with emphasis placed on main organ systems. I would recommend this class to another student because I feel that I learned a lot from this class. Also, there is material covered in this class that would be useful to know for a variety of different careers in biology.",
    "I highly recommend this course for someone who is interested in getting an overview in general physiology, and I think this course will also be suitable for physics major students.",
    "Very good review of physiology.",
    "Recommended, but much information will only be tangentially related to dissertation research.",
    "Yes",
    "Great course. You will learn a lot. There is a lot of work so stay organized and on top of the reading. I would definitely recommend the course to someone thinking about medical school.",
    "C&MP is an excellent overview of the pertinent anatomy and physiology for any biomedical researcher. At times, it feels like a huge stream of information to memorize. I would recommend the course to another student only if they arent taking any other highly demanding courses.",
    "Take it if planning on med school. Helped me study for mcat",
    "I enjoyed what I learned from this class. I would summarize it as a general overview of cellular and organ-level human physiology, and I would recommend it.",
    "I can't imagine taking this as a first physiology class or without any biology background, but if you like this stuff, it's a great class that teaches you a ton about the body. The most comprehensive physiology class I've ever taken."

   "comments": [
    "It was a good course.",
    "I really learned a lot in this class. I am glad for that. This class did not contribute to my research at all because my research is in basic science.",
    "This course immensely deepened my knowledge of my discipline. As a biochemistry student, it was awesome to get to zoom out a bit and see the bigger picture of how biochemical interactions\/properties\/feedback leads to system-wide functions and changes.",
    "This course was a very good general overview of physiology, which has helped me better understand aspects of my metabolism-based research. This course did not greatly contribute to my dissertation\/research because I am still trying to determine what research I would like to perform.",
    "I think this class is great in the way that a lot of empirical relationships and physics laws are introduced. i think this class gives me a good background at higher level biology which compensates for me study in biophysics.",
    "Helped me understand some of the biological aspects of my research to a greater degree. Somewhat helpful",
    "I had never taken a physiology course in undergrad, so covering the basics of each organ system that we discussed was a necessary part of my early graduate training. My research is focused on molecular intervention of disease states, so being acquainted with the fundamentals of physiology was immediate relevant to my other coursework (and will be important for my dissertation).",
    "So much! Kidney lecture was the best",
    "I didn't know much about physiology before, but I am now very interested in it and feel I have a much better understanding of the topics.",
    "It was incredibly useful for both my discipline and my research."
