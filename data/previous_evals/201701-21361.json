    "After this course, I am a lot more cognizant of the stylistic choices I make when writing. This course will help you focus on the structure of sentences and flow of writing. You will be asked to pay close attention to the words you choose, what parts of your writing are actually necessary and help further the narrative, as well as how you start\/end paragraphs.",
    "My writing significantly improved, and I became a better reader.",
    "I learned a lot about writing, especially the editing process. This course is unique because you focus on the actual writing exclusively rather than making an argument or understanding a topic.",
    "Writing and critically reading nonfiction. Through readings learned a lot of random stuff about different subjects.",
    "How to write various different types of essays, including interview essays and political satire, and writing tools that can be used across all genres",

    "The course is enjoyable and well structured.",
    "I think overall the class is very strong, it might be improved by pacing the reading out for each class more evenly. I might also add a requirement to meet with the professor about your final draft after it's been graded - almost all of the one-on-one workshops are about what to improve on after writing the first draft, but we never seemed to go over what was still missing at the end.",
    "I really liked the regular schedule of drafts and revisions. Readings were typically quite engaging.",
    "The readings are pretty interesting and the essays were fairly enjoyable to write. I wish we dedicated more time to workshops, since they always seemed to be cut a bit short.",
    "readings are interesting, discussions very useful, feedback is good don't receive much general feedback on what is consistently good or bad in my writing"

    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who likes to write personal essays. There is a fair bit of reading, but the vast majority of the pieces we read were enjoyable. I felt that my writing improved by the end of the semester, and I really liked writing the essays.",
    "If you enjoy writing take this class.",
    "Yes, I thought every aspect was rather interesting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in writing about their own experiences.",
    "Yes, if you want to write different types of essays that aren't just about literary analysis or history.",
    "Yes, essays can be quite fun, readings are diverse and interesting"
