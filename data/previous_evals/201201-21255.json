    "Scribbled in the margins on the first day of class: \"This is the kind of class I came to Yale to take\". By far the best class I've taken at yale. When they say that what makes or breaks a class is the quality of the teaching, and though there were some issues regarding exactly how we were examined, this class really allows you think about the big-picture political questions under the articulate, super-engaged guidance of the best teacher I've had.Housekeeping:The aim of this course is to define a liberal public sphere, get a sense of the socio-economic-historic-political-philosophical context (history of nationalism and the press, Rupert Murdoch's media empire, globalization, new media, even the history of Yale as a liberal institution) and then use it to evaluate the public spheres we speak in today, both in the US and around the world.This is not a strict Poli Sci class-you read journalistic pieces, extracts from books written by journalists, an amicus brief, some historical texts, interviews, and some political theory. The readings are fascinating, accessible, and pertinent to basically everything political. Conversation regularly strayed from the formal curriculum onto Yale-NUS, the role of the YDN, and even the political power of facebook. Expect 3\/4 visitors in class, mostly journalists and professors, and even some cool young Yalegrads. In many ways it seemed more like a ambitious ENGL 114, but is generally less focused on the raw quality of your writing and more on how you actually contribute to conversation both inside and outside of class.Prof. Sleeper has his opinions, but is more than comfortable listening, interpreting, and engaging in a satisfying way with what you are trying to say, even if it runs contrary to his thinking. He goes out of his way to make himself available, and office hours were always crowded with students. Do expect to have to justify yourself, but if you are honestly interested in the public sphere and concerned about the future of democracy in the Western world, take this class.",
    "A necessary and slightly philosophical course on the liberal sphere, nationalism, and the role journalism. Taught as an applied, contemporary look at the theoretical Fergusonian and Habermaasian discourse. Professor Sleeper is a very insightful thinker and instructor, but not an academic in the traditional sense. However, his first-hand knowledge of journalism and the interplay between it and the public sphere--an extremely challenging concept to nail down--make for an immediate and refreshing perspective.The course experience will depend a lot on your fellow classmates, so definitely shop it.",
    "I would recommend this class. It will either really challenge how you look at journalism, nationalism, and public spheres, unless you already agree completely with Prof. Sleeper's views. The readings are not too much throughout the week and was completely manageable. There was generally one or two long readings a week, which really allowed you to delve into the material in detail.",
    "Take it of you care about democracy, capitalism, journalism, or the fate of this world.",
    "This class should be taken by anyone in the Political Science major. The impact it has upon a constant facet of our lives -- our writing -- is invaluable. Know that the most is gained form this class when doing the readings, though.",
    "This course touches on important issues about global liberal public sphere. It definitely makes you do some serious reflection on some of the most important topics of all time, including globalization, liberal notion of individual, nationalism, the rise and decline of public sphere. Recommended.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I learned a lot thanks to Jim Sleeper, who is an amazing professor.",
    "This course is entirely grounded in Professor Sleeper's theme of civic republicanism; the title of the course itself doesn't entirely reflect what it's about. Though discussion and the syllabus as a whole can often feel disjointed, they also make you consider issues of journalism, globalism, and capitalism in ways you haven't before.",
    "I came out of this course wondering how I could have possibly called myself a student without a grasp on the ideas Professor Sleeper introduces in this course. My life is richer and more satisfying with this new way of thinking. Every class I left baffled and confused and frustrated about these foreign concepts, only to delve into fulfilling conversations throughout the week with everyone I met to try to sort them out. Take it to learn what a Yale education is supposed to be.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student who is interested in learning about humans as political beings, and of course, students interested in venturing into journalism. This class makes a thorough examination of fundamental concepts and values of political organization and institutions. I absolutely enjoyed the readings - interesting journalistic pieces that look introspectively at how journalism serves the public sphere and outward-looking at where human political societies are and could be headed."
