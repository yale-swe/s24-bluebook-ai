    "Many people in this class will have taken a few years of Spanish, which is quite nerve wracking if you come into the course having never taken Spanish before, like I did. Although at first there was this disparity in ability after a few weeks I was at the same level as everyone else and loved the course. This is a really enjoyable course where you will learn so much. Luzmaria was a great teacher and always made the classes a lot of fun.",
    "Definitely! It is so much fun and if you're at all interested in Spanish you should take this class.",
    "Yeah, this is like any entry level language class basically. The homework is really simple and not too time consuming, but what is difficult though is remembering vocabulary and understanding grammar. Make sure to spend time studying before oral exams and tests. Other than that, Spanish 110 is an easy class.",
    "The course is an intro language course. But Luzmaria was great!",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, thisis obviously the place to start! I felt like this class was challenging, but well worth it. It wasn't too hard, if you're willing to put in the work. The first couple of weeks will probably be the hardest, so if you really want to learn Spanish but think it's too hard, persevere until week three or four and you'll probably be okay. Also, Luzmaria's a great professor!",
    "This is a pretty standard Spanish 1 class. The work is often tedious, and class can be a bit boring. Overall, you'll learn what you're supposed to learn.",
    "Highly recommended. Course work is easy, but tests, oral exams, and CENTRO online exercises can be challenging.",
    "Unless the person has previous experience with Spanish or another romance language, and is willing to do more work outside of class in order to actually learn something substantial, I would not recommend it to anyone. There are many other languagesat Yale which are far better taught in the elementary levels.",
    "definitely definitely definitely. i'm a senior and this is a great fun course to break the intensity of the course load."
