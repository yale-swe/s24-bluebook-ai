    "Great class! It moved pretty fast (especially at the beginning of the semester) but I feel like I learned so much! Jonas is an awesome instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend ARBC 110. Arabic is a daunting language to start learning but this course did an excellent job, and Professor Elbousty is an amazing teacher.",
    "Hard. Very very hard. In all honesty, if you don't get professor elbousty, I would not recommend the class unless you have a significant Arabic background.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to a fellow student. I learned how to read, write, and understand Arabic in a very short amount of time, and my fellow students can benefit from this experience as well.",
    "This course is a quick, yet relatively thorough, introduction to an intimidating language. The professor is interesting and makes what could otherwise be extremely difficult actually quite fun. You will learn much, much more than you anticipate."
