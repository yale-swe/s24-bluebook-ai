   "comments": [
    "Yes, its a lot of work but Dr. G guides you very well",
    "Instructor is hilarious and always helps lighten the mood before a brutal 3-4 hours ahead. Really appreciated his help and reviewing of the lab prior to lab work.",
    "i would definitely recommend Chem 116L, though the workload can be a bit hard to manage at times. We have a quiz every week and the lab reports often take much longer to complete than does the actual lab itself.",
    "I would recommend it in conjunction with Chem 114.",
    "This course is a good lab course and I would recommend it to a student who needs a chemistry lab course for their major.",
    "This is a very basic intro lab course that's great if you haven't had tons of experience working in a lab. It really tames what could otherwise be a very intimidating intro course. The labs are fairly repetitive so you learn the techniques really well. There are weekly lab reports but they're pretty manageable and really try to guide you through the steps. Pre-lab quizzes every day weren't very difficult but could be annoying when they asked for very specific info. Dr. G's a funny\/entertaining guy when lecturing but was kind of condescending if you asked him questions that he thought were obvious. Lab (though 4 hours) seemed shorter than a lot of my other classes.",
    "The lab is not too difficult to understand because it follows well with the lecture. As long as you read the manual prior to lab, everything will go smoothly. The labs are designed to reiterate topics from lecture but also help you learn how to function in a chemistry lab. I think this beginner course did that effectively, considering I have never been in a chemistry lab before.",
    "The lab assignments are usually interesting, but it can get tedious at times. Four hours is a long time to be in lab, but luckily you can usually get out early if you're focused. Overall, it's a pretty average lab.",
    "Yes. It's a lot of stress, but if you need a lab, this is a good lab to take.",
    "I am not a chemistry person, so I often rand out of time and I didn't enjoy class. BUT The professors and my TA were great and it was largely my fault.It was a very stressful class but I might recommend it for someone who likes chem.",
    "Labs were always interesting, as the concepts in the prelab lecture were fascinating and can easily be distinguished through the experiments. However, as lab is lab, most of it was simply too tedious. Of course that was unenjoyable, but there's really no way to get out of this sort of thing when your taking a lab course.Dr. G was a fantastic professor. He is very clear, helpful, and funny.",
    "this class should be renamed Titrations 116L, because that is all we do. if you suck at titrations, get outttttt because you gon' fail, son.",
    "It's a good class to get an easy A in. There are a lot of titrations, but those become second nature after a while. It helps teach you about organization and time management.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to. It's a lot of work, and a lot of stress.",
    "It is tough to take a four lab course, but if you are thinking about taking it, you probably have to. Be prepared to work. Overall, it's a solid lab course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. The skills you learn are indispensable, especially if you're going to take any other lab course at Yale. However, this 1\/2 credit class is a LOT of work. I added the number of words of all of my labs together and it wasn't much less than the number of words of all of the essays my friend wrote for Directed Studies during his first semester. And that doesn't include the lab sheets you write while doing the experiment.",
    "Chemistry 116L is definitely a lab class to take if you are planning to have a future in chemistry\/biology, even if you are uncertain. It helps in learning how to follow instructions carefully and you learn lab procedure that will come up several times in the future if you plan to pursue a degree in the sciences.",
    "a good adjunct to gen chem.",
    "CHEM 116L is a comprehensive overview of general chemical laboratory techniques...it's as simple as that. A lot of titrations are involved, and accuracy and precision is key. Dr. G is very nit-picky about these sort of things, and messing up can cost you big time! However, Dr. G really did make the class. I would recommend taking it with him! His knowledge of the material and techniques is truly amazing, and he is kind, respectful, enthusiastic, and often hilarious. Furthermore, he is always willing to help, which is important.",
    "Twice the work, half the credit. Don't take unless you have to.",
    "This is a general chemistry laboratory course, which is helpful to take with the general chemistry lecture course (Chem 112 or 114).I would recommend this course for a student who would like to learn basic laboratory skills and techniques.",
    "I would recommend the class. Professor G is really helpful and it's a great introduction to chemistry experiments without being really stressful. Also, the experiments were interesting and a lot of fun to do.",
    "I recommend taking this lab.",
    "Did you want to learn how to do a titration? You didn't? Well too bad. You will do noting else. One titration a lab. Titration every day. It literally took me about 45 seconds to understand all the nuances and benefits of titration. Then I spent AN ENTIRE SEMESTER repeating the method. Good luck. May the force be with you.",
    "I don't think taking Chem 116L is ever really a choice.... You either take it because you need to for a major or for pre-med requirements... Otherwise you don't. In general, I think that's the consensus amongst most people.",
    "Of all of my courses, I found this Chem lab to be the most satisfying in terms of grading and workload. Your grade is made up of about 70% lab reports, 20% quizzes and 10% lab final.If you can, try to pick a day when Dr. G is there and does the pre-lab lecture. Dr. G's pre-lab lectures are great. They clear up what may have been unclear in the lab manual and prepare you for the quizzes. Also, Dr. G is very helpful in the lab.",
    "A great course for learning basic lab principles, mostly about titration. Can be a bit boring.",
    "I would recommend this lab to another student because it is a great way to further and enrich the information received in the actual chemistry lectures.",
    "You're taking Chemistry 116L because you're taking Chemistry 114. Only take it if you need to. Dr. G is a great instructor, and I'm pretty sure he teaches it every year. If so, go for it. If Bennett Thompson is still a TA next year... avoid him.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a4 hour lab and does take a while, but if you read the procedure beforehand and just follow the manual's instructions, it is not hard to complete. You often work with partners, which is fun, my only complaint is that you do a lot of titrations. The TAs are very helpful and Dr. Ganapathi knows what he's talking about. My suggestion is to not take a night lab (6 to 10) if possible, because Dr. G goes home after 5ish, so a TA teaches the whole pre-lab lecture, which I've heard is not as comprehensive or as helpful as the one Dr. G gives.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 116L to other students. Regardless of whether you have lab experience or not, the labs are very easy to complete. Don't be intimidated by all the rules and regulations in the syllabus, once you actually attend class you will see how easy they are to follow. CHEM 116L is a great class for beginners and I highly recommend it.",
    "A manageable lab course. Don't save the labs for the night before. Definitely take it if you are taking a similar level chem class.",
    "Overal pretty easy lab course. The lab reports get annoying, especially if you leave them to be done the night before lab. But Doc G is funny and it solidifies some of the concepts learned in CHEM 114.",
    "Pretty straightforward chemistry lab. The class should be renamed Titrations 101 though, because that's actually what you do all semester. Other then that, the lab write-ups are not too long and the lab final is actually pretty fun! I would only take it though if I had to, but like I said, it's not too bad!",
    "Only take this if you have to!! It is very tedious and stressful (especially since it is only half a credit). Hard to make it enjoyable.",
    "It's a pretty standard lab course. No reason to take it if you don't need it for your major or pre-med, but if you have to take it it's really not much of a hassle.",
    "I liked lab overall. It was a bit tiring to do every week for 4 hours, but if you're interested then deff do it. I really liked my T.A. and he was very helpful during lab if I had any questions. Lab reports did take longer for me to write than I had expected.",
    "Chemistry 116L 01 is an introductory lab course that teaches you all of the basics about working in a lab. It follows along closely with the material from general chemistry lecture courses. I would recommend it any student that does not have much experience in lab and needs it for their major because the titrations can get tedious and repetitive.",
    "Take it to get the basics for any lab.",
    "A good addition to Chemistry 114",
    "A solid introduction to the precise methods of chemical inquiry - if this is your first college lab, be aware that the experiments are much longer than those in high school, and accuracy is of paramount importance. Give yourself some time to get used to college-level experimentation. Workload outside of the classroom is moderate, especially if you are prompt in writing lab reports.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a very good introductory chemistry lab that will be helpful for subsequent lab courses that students will take in their academic career. It enforces good habits both in the laboratory and in the write-ups. Also, it helps reinforces some of the concepts taught in class. Indeed, it is a course I would recommend to another student.",
    "I don't think this is necessarily the best way of understanding lab in terms of research or exploration of knowledge, but I think that this is a good way of introducing techniques in a way that is applicable to what is learned in class.",
    "Take the lab if you need it for a requirement of some sort. But, in general, it's all titrations, and it won't be fun. I hated going to lab every week.",
    "This is a good, fairly relaxed intro Chem lab. Writing up the lab reports is kind of a pain, though. Dr G is great!",
    "Chem 116 is a tedious course. The material is relatively simple but there is a large amount of work that needs to be done for each class. Writing up the lab reports takes a very long time, and does not have significant benefits. However, if you are planning to go on in science, this course is one that you'll need to knock out.",
    "I would recommend the lab. Although, it is disappointing that the lab is only worth half of a credit. Some weeks you'll put in just as much time for the lab as you would for any other class.",
    "Chem lab... ugh. Not difficult, but a pain. Lab reports take a good chunk of time, and for only half a credit it is frustrating. It was something I kind of dreaded going to, to be honest.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the laboratory or experimental sciences. It can be hard to perform these long experiments, but they are ultimately satisfying and rewarding, and chemistry is a great subject from which to learn essential skills.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class, unless you have to take it for your major. It is a lot of work (graded completely on accuracy) and it takes up a lot of time. A lot of the information felt redundant and repetitive (especially titrations) and will not necessarily make you feel like you learned something interesting and new.",
    "No. You should only take lab if it is a requirement for your major or some professional school",
    "Chemistry 116 was a totally fine Intro lab course. It was not particularly interesting, but it was a fine accompaniment to the lecture class.",
    "It's an intro chem lab class but it has a really hard final and the quizzes are okay.",
    "Yes. Good to get some hands on experience in the classroom. Four hours seems daunting but it flies by.",
    "This was a good class in which I learned a lot. The workload is a lot especially since the class is only worth half a credit. I would recommend this class to anyone who needs to take a chemistry lab.",
    "Chemistry 116L is generally taken only by students who need to and it's a course that everyone just needs to push through to continue learning chem. It goes well with the chemistry lectures and puts some of the things about which you're learning to use.",
    "You learn the basic skills needed to function in a chemistry laboratory. Quite a great deal has to do with neatness and preparation.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a pleasant course. It is not too challenging and the material presented is interesting. The course does take some work and effort but that goes for any course for that matter. Overall, I would very much so recommend this course as a beginning laboratory course for any student.",
    "It's a chem lab. It's every bit what you would expect. Fairly simple experiments and a good introduction to lab techniques and equipment. You will be good at titrations by the end.",
    "I think it is a nice course for introductory chemistry lab concepts but I cannot recommend it without knowing the intrest of the student.",
    "if you are premed and didn't pass out of gen chem, this course is a requirement. it really isn't that bad. the workload is about the same as a standard Yale course. i felt like lab reports were easier than they were in high school because the outline for the reportwas given to you in the manual. just read the lab before you get there, come prepared with questions, and don't procrastinate on lab reports, and you'll be just fine in the course! study for the quizzes too!",
    "what you would expect of a intro chem lab. the lab reports can be very tedious and take a good amount of time. the labs themselves are fine, though slightly monotonous at times.",
    "Absolutely donot take unless it is needed.",
    "I would recommend it if you are also taking Chem 112 or 114. It definitely helps reinforce the concepts you are learning in class, although the labs didn't always match up exactly with what we were learning in lecture (sometimes the lab would be about a subject we had learned in class a week or two before).",
    "It's not going to open your eyes to a passion for experimental chemistry, but then again, you're probably taking it as a requirement for a major, etc. It's kind of something you take because you need to, and with that in mind, it's not that bad. Enjoyable at times.As far as how the workload compares to other courses, I would say that because it is only .5 credits, it is greater than.",
    "This course is a good overview of how to work in a college chemistry lab. Be prepared to write a lab report every week.",
    "Chem 116L is an introductory chemistry lab that is a nice way to begin exploring the realm of chemistry. The main techniques learned in the class are how to use measurement tools to take accurate measurements, and how to titrate. I would recommend the course because I feel like I have become more proficient at working in a chem lab, which I believe one of the goals of the course.",
    "It was a good intro-level general chemistry lab. The labs and quizzes were educational and very manageable.",
    "Useful and enjoyable. Recommend - fun, integrates well with Chemistry 114, and workload was not excessive.",
    "Chemistry 116L is primarily a lot of titration. While this seems dull, you do not realize the effectiveness of the course until you test your skills on the final. The results are surprising.",
    "If one is only doing chemistry as a requirement, do not take the lab. It is a lot if work.",
    "If you need to take a chem lab then I would recommend this course. The lab reports do take a while to complete but you get the hang of things pretty fast. Reading about the experiments in the lab manual before class was very helpful. For a half credit course, it can be a lot of work.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a good lab to take in conjunction with general chemistry and follows along for the most part with that course. The lab requires a lot of work for being a half of a credit, but it is not overly complicated.",
    "CHEM116L was a good introduction to lab courses and I feel much more comfortable in lab now, having never taken such a course before. If you read the lab beforehand and ask questions, lab itself is not too difficult. The prelab lecture is also helpful and using provides important tips for the lab. The prelab quizzes include both concept and problem questions based on the lab, so pay attention when reading through the lab and if any calculations are being worked out or explained during the lecture.",
    "Lab is long, but if you prepare adequately you'll be fine.",
    "Chem 116L is not a very difficult course so long as you put in the effort. Getting lab reports done on time and studying the reaction formulas are key to getting a good grade. Dr. Ganapathi is a wonderful professor and very approachable. I would recommend the course to anybody and it is not one of those prereqs for science majors that is dreaded.",
    "This class is for the beginner chemistry student. It's main focus is learning how to do titrations and proving some basic chemistry constants (Rydberg's constant etc).",
    "Basic chemistry lab. Standing for 4 hours (often less) is no fun, but it becomes a sort of bonding experience with other students near your lab station if you choose to make it so. Not exciting or something to look forward to each week, but Dr. G's packet is thorough and delineates what you need to do. Would not recommend for fun.",
    "You will learn how to titrate. The class is straight forward but the labs often took longer to write up then the professor told us.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I enjoyed seeing the practical applications to the concepts I was learning about in Chemistry and I found the experiments to be very educational and fulfilling.Note: Do be warned, even though lab is only once a week, it is draining, and outside of lab, the class is A LOT of work. Writing up lab reports, studying the lab for the next week, and preparing for the weekly quizzes all take up a lot of time on a weekly basis. So it's lots of work for 1\/2 a credit but it's not a bad course and I found it to be interesting.I *would* recommend this course but if you don't need it for your major, you may want to avoid the workload lab brings with it.",
    "Lab is four hours a week out of your schedule, plus the few hours it takes to write up lab reports and pre-labs. The course is fair if you need it for pre-med requirements, but I would not recommend the course if you are not pre-med because the class basically consists of following instructions and is not very enriching intellectually. It is a good course for familiarizing yourself with a laboratory setting though.",
    "a lot of work, good luck",
    "Chem 116 provides a different way to look at the concepts we learn in class. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This is a good introduction to basic lab concepts. My major complaint is that many of the experiments felt very similar to one another; do not expect a completely new interesting technique or idea every week. I would recommend this course to anyone with minimal prior experience in chemistry.",
    "This lab course greatly helped my laboratory abilities and was a good step up from high school. I ended up finding many of the procedures and labs very interesting and fun. I would recommend it as a good Gen Chem Lab Course. The quizzes can sometimes be a bit tricky.",
    "A four hour lab doesn't really sound too appealing, but its really not that bad. If you read the lab beforehand, show up, and follow directions, you shouldn't have a problem doing well.",
    "The lab was necessary for the pre-med requirements, and it was a fine class, but I had to take it from 6-10 on Tuesday nights. I had Dr. van Staveren for my lab because it was a night lab, and she was great. I also had a really good TA. Some of the lab reports took a really long time, but it was still doable.",
    "Chemistry 116 Laboratory was a great introductory chemistry lab course. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's not as bad as people think. Some of the lab reports are simply not fun, but the actual lab can be quite pleasant.",
    "You're not necessarily going to like Chem 116, but it's a good course to take. The labs can be pretty dreary and mindless, and the lab reports aren't much fun either. That being said, the instructors are quite good, Dr. G in particular, and you will learn a lot. The work is annoying but the payoff is there. You gain an appreciation of basic lab skills. I personally improved much more than I would have expected, and the attention to detail required by the course is genuinely very useful. So don't be discouraged by it. It will be frustrating, but it will be worth it, especially if you're going to be a science major.",
    "Do well on the quizes, they end up counting more than you expect them too. Develop some sort of routine to prepare for the labs (say reading the lab before lab) or the night before. And stick to the routine. Lab isn't too hard, just follow the lab book.",
    "It's not the most exciting class, so if you're just trying to get science credits out of the way for the graduation requirements, find alternative science courses. If you're pre-med or a chemistry major, don't fret because this course is pretty easy.",
    "Chem 116L is a very straightforward lab course, and it corresponds well with the Chem 114 lecture course. The lab reports could be difficult at times, and the same for the quizzes. However, Dr. G and the TAs are wonderful - they are all eager to help you if you ever need help. Overall, Chem 116L is a fine course.",
    "If you are taking Chem 114 then you should take the lab, especially if you are pursuing the premed track where 1 year of chem lab is needed."
