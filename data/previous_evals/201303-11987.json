   "comments": [
    "Great class. If you have interest in the period you will love this class.",
    "I would recommend it as it taught me how to get through lots of reading and take out the meaningful bits for discussion. But I would caution that you really have to love history to be willing to devote an entire semester to such a short period of time.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone very interested in this topic (or someone who thinks they would be). If you take this class on a whim, you will probably still en up enjoying it but it may be kind of a struggle at the beginning (or maybe a little longer). If you take the class, I'm sure you'll enjoy it but if you are not super interested in the topic, you may enjoy something else more.",
    "History 028 will be a ton of reading, but every word will be worthwhile and make you all the smarter. It is an extremely comprehensive look at arguably the most legendary cityin the world and will make you want to be a historian. Everyone who wants to become twice as smart as they are now should take this class. All others should stay away.",
    "It's okay. Don't expect anything amazing. Be prepared for weekly readings that are not very exciting. The classes themselves are fairly stress free- it is basically an hour and a half of pure discussion each time. The professor doesn't really give a clear direction in discussion so I can't really say I learned too much. A lot of the times it is just listening to the same people talk over and over again.",
    "It's a great class, where you learn a lot about New York history in a different and unique context- one that most high school history courses never covered. Take it as your freshman seminar!",
    "Don't pass up a chance to take a class with Professor Huyssen! Even if history isn't your thing, you'll learn how to look at the world around you with a more critical eye. Class is almost exclusively discussion-based, and it is true that you'll only get as much out as you put in. You have to keep up with the reading (just 2-3 hours twice a week) if you want to get anything out of the discussion, but it's very much worth it. You read a nice mix of sources for the assigned reading: some secondary sources that fill out the facts and background but then plenty of interesting primary source stuff written by New Yorkers a hundred years ago. The final paper at the end of the year looks daunting but you have enough time and freedom to really get comfortable with your topic and potentially take advantage of the really cool primary sources that Yale has in their holdings. At the end of the day though, the best part of the class is getting to be in a room with Professor Huyssen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he's the man.",
    "THIS CLASS WAS AWESOME. Absolutely take it if you have any interest in New York, or history, or even if you don't think you do. The class was pretty small (about 14 people) so we were able to have really great, engaging discussions. The workload, in terms of reading, is fairly heavy, but certainly manageable if you schedule your time well. There are also weekly reading responses (very easy, just a paragraph about questions, things that surprised you, etc, in the reading), along with one short essay (5pgs) in October and a 10-15pg final paper with flexible topic selection. The readings, for the most part, were very interesting - some of them, I felt like I was reading for fun. This class gives you great exposure to a highly important period of New York history, but also one shrouded in chaos and uncertainty. The class gives you a really strong, multifaceted image of what the city was like during this era.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. Professor Huyssen's passion for the history of New York City makes the class exciting each day. Discussion is always enlightening with readings that frequently made me think carefully about American history and current American society. It is a truly fascinating class in which Professor Huyssen allows the history he teaches to extend beyond just the Gilded Age in order to create a better understanding of current issues in modern society.",
    "The class was enjoyable, I liked the readings the best, they gave a better picture of life in the studied era. But if you get confused I would recommend looking into background yourself because not a lot will be provided by the instructor.",
    "I would recommend this class, because while the topic may seem a little specific to be pertinent in everyday life, the history of New York during the Gilded Age has more impact on modern day politics than one would expect. The writing requirements aren't too intensive with weekly reading logs, a short paper, and a final paper. Professor Huyssen is an excellent professor. He's humorous and insightful, but can sometimes leads you to rhe answer that he wants in a discussion."
