    "Great overview of the challenges facing Italian politics and the economy. Anna is a fantastic teacher and you learn a lot in the class. If interested, definitely take!!!",
    "Really enjoyable class that I looked for to going to every time. The atmosphere created by the teacher was great and we always had very interesting discussions. I learned a lot about Italy that I would always love to tell people about and I got to practice my speaking and written skills. I would recommend for a class with not too much workload and relatively low stress.",
    "Anna is the sweetest professor you'll ever meet in your life and her passion for the subject is so obvious. Because she is Italian, she has a special knowledge of Italian politics, which makes the class more personal. The workload is pretty low and the class is very relaxed.",
    "It is good investment in usable knowledge."
