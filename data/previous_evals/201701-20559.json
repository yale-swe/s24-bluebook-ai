   "comments": [
    "This course was very similar to DS. I learned how to read critically and develop my writing skills.",
    "I got a great base of knowledge and perspective that I can use to think about most issues. I think that the class really allowed me to look at most modern problems and ideas through a critical lens, now with an informed perspective.",
    "Deep understanding of political institutions and their economic and philosophical underpinnings. Professor Sabl challenged us to write, think, and speak clearly and effectively.",
    "Writing concisely and thoughtfully Time management The value of institutions",
    "I developed an ability to better write argumentative essays and think critically about arguments presented to me.",
    "I learned so much about various political philosophies as well as their implications on our current political views as Americans. I learned about various economic theories, ideal states with regards to the role of citizen and the role of the government as a healthcare provider. I learned about capitalism. But most importantly, I learned two things: 1) most people only identify with a political party because they are informed and agree with their party about a few issues. When asked about issues they know less about, they align with their political party simply because they are expected to. There has never been more party polarization. 2) Stereotypes are a consequence of political polarizations. Although stereotypes and common assumptions\/associations are necessary for humans to some extent for survival, when they start replacing the interest in the actual truth\/reality, miscommunication and intolerance becomes commonplace. Problems just like people need to be seen as complex, not black and white. Even when people are exposed to unbiased information, they will often pick and choose the information that supports their preconceived notions about people\/problems. We must show greater open-mindedness, not just socially but politically, if we are to become more tolerant."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is that it is extremely relevant for the current political climate. The readings are strong, structured, and organized thoughtfully. You can choose when to write your essays for the semester, which makes the semester significantly less stressful. The instructor is very accessible, so its always easy to ask him for help. The only weakness of this course is that the essay development is demanding, so you shouldn't take it if you have a ton of other heavy classes on your schedule. Although the instructor is accessible, he does live in NY so you will have to meet with him via Skype for feedback occasionally.",
    "Important strengths of the course are that we read authors that have very tangibly shaped contemporary political and economic theories. I really enjoyed reading Hayek, Schumpeter, and Schattschneider. There was a diversity of viewpoints presented in each week which made for productive discussion by contrasting authors\/arguments. No notable weaknesses, given that the instructor was incredibly knowledgeable and sharp, the class discussion was valuable, and the essays were very cool ways of becoming better at presenting arguments.",
    "The strength is the curation of the reading, which was wonderfully done. And yet paradoxically the weakness, to me, was the volume of reading. It was at times very difficult to finish all of the reading, and I often could not, which I felt detracted from my experience in the course.",
    "Strengths: Wonderfull balance of readings, great discussions and discussion questions, and I very much liked the organization of the course. Weakenesses: Professor Sabl's writing parameters simply went too far. He's too strict about style to the point where a well written but less intelligent paper would receive better grades than one with great content but not written to his stylistic parameters. THIS SHOULD BE A WRITING CREDIT -- it fulfills the requirements and professor Sabl loves to focus on writing style as is. Readings often included irrelevant sections. The amount of pages assigned often seemed inconsiderate to the density of the ideas presented. Overall this class was so so much work, and I don't believe this significantly improved our learning.",
    "This is an excellent course. I would not include a final exam, but would instead assign a 10 page paper on a very broad question about institutions or some more reflective topic.",
    "The biggest strength of the class is the feedback that Professor Sabl provides the students regarding essays, and the small seminar style classroom that allowed for thoughtful discussion of the weekly topics. In addition, the topics were set up in an interesting order regarding political institutions. The biggest weakness of the class was that there were a few readings that were just incredible dense and dry reads, with hundreds of pages of reading assigned.",
    "The strengths of the course were the intellectual challenges and the variety of the readings. The questions our professor asked were provocative and fascinating. The weakness was the amount of readings assigned per week. By far, this was the class with the most readings assigned weekly compared to all the other classes I took this semester. We were often assigned over 300 pages per week."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone! EP&E or not. It is similar to DS.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to someone else. The course is mostly taken by EP&E students, but students interested in the theoretical aspects of economics, the intersection between law and ethics, political theory, and important applications of the former ideas in the welfare state, political parties, and capitalism, would all find the course valuable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course; Professor Sabl was great and the course material is fascinating. My biggest piece of advice is to really invest and do all of the reading. I didn't do all of it, and when I went to review for the final exam, I was saddened to see how much I hadn't read. It's a really great class, and Professor Sabl has done a great job curating the syllabus; it's worth your time to read it.",
    "Definitely glad I took it, but this class was so so hard -- strict grading, lots of reading. More work to try for an A than any other class I've taken, but I also learned so so much. Sabl is great if you can look past his sometimes patronizing feedback, and unnecessarily strict writing style requirements. The course definitely stressed me out -- some of the other teachers seem to run a less intense version of the course -- but in retrospect, I'm glad i took it.",
    "Professor Sabl teaches an extensively curated, well constructed syllabus that advances a nuanced thesis about the nature and value of institutions throughout the course. You will learn a lot from each text, but through the careful assembly of an excellent syllabus, Professor Sabl brings what could be a dry survey to life.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The writing assignments were not overwhelming, and the readings were for the most part pretty interesting, although there is definitely a few that were quite dense reads. The seminar style of the class really helps improve the class as we were able to discuss really interesting takes on the many different arguments we read about in class in a much more meaningful manner than if the class was larger. In addition, Professor Sabl is pretty good at leading the conversation. He does grade pretty strictly, but he leaves a ton of feedback to help students improve.",
    "This is a wonderfully interesting course and it will force you to question your liberal\/conservative bias which is very important if you want to be a more open-minded citizen."
