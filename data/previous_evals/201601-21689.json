    "This course is a complete waste of time unless you are taking it to fulfill a requirement for the English major.",
    "A good introduction to a very particular poetic tradition that is far more broad than anticipated",
    "Helps you get extensive knowledge about poetry.",
    "A surprisingly good class. I took it for an English major pre req and I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "I went into English 125 with the usual grumblings of a prospective English major taking the class because it's required, but ended up really enjoying it. Professor Minnis is an excellent professor, extremely approachable and helpful. I actually had some fun writing papers for this class and am quite proud of them. I feel I have a deeper understanding of the readings, the social and literary context which produced them, and a deeper appreciation of them as a result. The workload is very manageable, even with all the papers. Much more painless than I was expecting - actually, a lot of fun!",
    "It's an introduction to medieval poetry; lots of close reading and analyzing (much more than high school level) is necessary--stretches your mind in a good way. If you weren't an English Major and were more into modern literature\/poetry, I probably wouldn't recommend it, but you learn a lot!"
