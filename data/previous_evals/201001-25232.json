    "Great class; Dean Flick is great.",
    "Definitely!!!! A must-take course, the only big contributions are your midterm and final paper and your presentation. But you'll enjoy it.",
    "This course is decent. I knew nothing about the Ramayana coming in, and I definitely learned. It's pretty slow paced, and you get what you put into it. If you're looking for a chill but interesting course, go for it. I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it if I had some experience in the subject beforehand.",
    "This class focuses a lot on articles about the Ramayana and was very interesting. I would have appreciated more discussion of the text of the epic itself, but I'm very happy that I took it. The flexibility on the final paper is great.",
    "very easy class. fun. but not the intellectually stimulating yale course.",
    "Please for the love of God (Lord Rama that is) - take this course.",
    "It's an interesting class but be prepared for some boring presentations.",
    "A very meticulous study of the one the two major epics in Hinduism.",
    "Yes. Take it, take it.",
    "take it!",
    "Yes",
    "Take it if interested in Ramayana."
