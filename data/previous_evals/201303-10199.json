   "comments": [
    "The course is very interesting. If you are at all interested in Scorsese's work, or in studying and analyzing good films in general, I would absolutely, wholeheartedly recommend this class.",
    "Highly recommend! The film screening are very long but well-worth the time commitment. The paper assignments (there's 3) get longer later in the semester and the pacing can seem too quick at times but just keep up - like I said, all the screenings and readings are worth the time commitment.",
    "Definitely recommend. The films are great and the discussions were always interesting, and the essays and reading are manageable.",
    "The Films of Martin Scorsese is an amazing class. Over the course of the semester, we covered 18 Scorsese films, learning about the director's work and his life, as well as film history. Professor Kerbel makes the class fun and interesting, which helped make seminar discussions enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this course to another student as an opportunity to learn about the career of one of the most talented and influential American directors alive today. The films are fun to watch and its great to get a sense of Scorsese's range--this course covers period dramas, mob films, religious epics, dark comedies, and thrillers. Nothing gets old and nothing feels stale because the movies are great and discussions make watching them even more meaningful.",
    "This class was excellent. Very enjoyable, films that are shocking and really grip you. You'll walk out appreciating Scorsese.",
    "Take it. Seriously.",
    "YES!! If you can manage to secure a spot in this seminar, TAKE IT. You won't regret it. It is not too much work, the papers are very enjoyable to write, the professor is awesome, the material is awesome, and most likely, your classmates will be good people.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to a fellow student. The films are iconic, the professor knows what he's talking about, and the discussions are always interesting. Of course, some screenings will take you 3 hours, but it's all worth it. Take the class!",
    "YES! An amazing class with amazing films! Great topics for discussion. Great for both film and non-film majors. Overall, a must take class!"
