   "comments": [
    "Continued to hone my reading and writing skills",
    "writing organization schools ways of approaching a text understanding the legible city putting texts in communication with one another developing thesis",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of what it means for a city and its inhabitants to be \"legible\"--that is, how we read the places we come from and the communities that shape us.",
    "I took this course to become a better reader and that's what I got. We read twelve works over the course of twelve weeks which for me, wasn't easy. By the end though, my reading speed had increased, the joy with which I read had increased, and also my time management with the reading had gotten infinitely better. I was also introduced to an incredible reading list. Also, my essay writing skills were really pushed to their limits!!! The fifteen page paper was something I'd never done before and the way Professor Dimock workshops and pushes your ideas with you helped me come up with a product that was way better than anything I'd done before. She is a fantastic professor with a lot of insight to offer.",
    "Since I had pretty much only taken English courses where I followed prompts for writing papers, this course really pushed me to come up with my own paper topics, and I was surprised and pleased with the results.",
    "You will improve your skills as a writer and as a reader of American Literature. You will also develop your confidence in leading a discussion through the class presentation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You read great books, Prof. Dimock does a great job running class discussions",
    "Loved this course. One of the best English courses I have taken at yale. Very diverse in genre and authorship. Great at facilitating group discussion. Really nice ownership over class dynamics. Thought provoking. Needs no improvement.",
    "The book list is incredible and varied. Take it even just for the readings! Professor Dimock is very kind and class discussions are always interesting.",
    "Professor Dimock put together an amazing reading list, which offered a breadth of themes but also lent itself to deep analysis. A lot of wonderful conversations resulted from that!",
    "The course has an excellent reading list, and Professor Dimock is an excellent discussion leader. The books are long, however, and sometimes I found it difficult to complete the books assigned on time for our class discussion.",
    "I think the strengths of this course lie largely in Prof Dimock's availability, especially in essay writing and also in her choice of readings. She readily meets with students and encourages you to do so. Prof Dimock works with you and encourages you to think about and refine your concepts. A lot of the reading is new and current literature (not old white males if you're into that) and Prof Dimock has no problem teaching these novels in a classroom setting. I'm happy she introduced me to books I would otherwise never hear of. I think the weakness of this course is the discussion sometimes felt a bit stifled. I think that's because Professor sometimes elaborated on what a student was saying unnecessarily. Prof Dimock has a lot of insights and she's itching to share them but I felt that her short monologues sometimes cut short the train of thought of the discussion. I think Prof Dimock could definitely let the discussion run free for longer before pitching in and ask more pointed questions after she has finished expressing her thoughts.",
    "I thought the paper assignments were well spaced out. Having a student lead the discussion each week was helpful for engagement, but I think the expectations for the student leader might have been better explained at the beginning of the course--it was somewhat unclear for the few who went first. I also think the website could have been used more fully or not used at all.",
    "The student-led discussions are perhaps the best part of this class, only rivaled by the quality of the texts that it covers. There is a good deal of coverage for each of the three cities that Professor Dimock advertises, though the class might benefit from the inclusion of a city from the American South to balance the perspectives. New Orleans came up in discussion and could be a very good fit."

   "comments": [
    "If you get the chance to take this class, you should. The reading is eclectic and fascinating--how many other classes let you read the Maltese Falcon one week and Mumbo Jumbo the next? In addition, Prof. Dimock is legitimately brilliant, and completely dedicated to her students' growth. She is such a good resource to have at Yale, so make sure you visit her office hours at least once during the semester. The workload is fairly standard, with slightly heavier reading than normal: you generally read a novel for each class, but none are that heavy and\/or dense, so it moves quickly. Two papers, one 5-page and one 15-page. Stay on top of it and you'll be fine.",
    "Absolutely, I think it's one of the rare English classes where the books are chosen not because they are part of some imagined canon and not because of their intellectual importance but because they all have important messages and lessons about our contemporary world. That's invaluable",
    "Yes! Loved this course. One of the best English courses I have taken at yale. Very diverse in genre and authorship. Great at facilitating group discussion. Really nice ownership over class dynamics. Thought provoking.",
    "Yes! If you're going to actually read the books, then you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Taking a course with Professor Dimock was a privilege and anyone should take the opportunity to study with her.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to another student. Start the readings the day of class! You'll read of lot of funky, hip books and you'll write about them with complete freedom with an incredible professor to bounce your ideas off of.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There was a great deal of variety in our readings, from genre to style to time period. I enjoyed pretty much all of the readings. Professor Dimock is a very fun discussion leader.",
    "Global Cities is a class that will get you thinking critically about the multicultural flavor of life in American Cities, as well as the challenges faced by the immigrants who live there. The focus is on New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, though Professor Dimock says she might change bring in a new city, perhaps New Orleans, in the future. Whether you are an English major or not, this is a class that is definitely worth taking to expand your critical thinking skills through very accessible works of American Literature. Wai Chee Dimock is a treat as a professor. She has a deep knowledge of the American canon and gives students the opportunity to spearhead the discussions, even though she has plenty to say herself. Writing papers in this class can be challenging, but Professor Dimock's insightful commentary will be very helpful in improving your writing skills if you are willing to put time into your assignments. You aren't going to find a American Lit course that is as easily accessible and as rigorous at Yale. Definitely consider taking Global Cities. If you're a senior English Major, this can be a fun way to fulfill your senior seminar requirement."
