    "This was a challenging but incredibly rewarding learning experience. It required that I developed my work ethic further and maintain self-discipline by setting deadlines for myself given that the class did not meet at a regular time. Writing my senior thesis also strengthened by research, argumentative and writing skills in a focused manner driven by my personal interest and autonomy in choosing the topic.",
    "The senior essay project challenged me to think critically as I composed a research question, identified historical source material, and crafted a structured narrative that responded to my original question. I learned to conduct historical research; identify and describe historical themes of science, medicine, and indigeneity; and integrate academic knowledge with lived experiences to synthesize an analytical essay that tracked the changes in a specific phenomenon over time.",
    "I learned how to design and execute an independent research project. I learned how to consult a variety of academic literatures and how to synthesize this information and craft arguments responding to these literatures."

    "Yes! This is a great way to take on a topic of your interest into much more depth than you'd normally be able to in a normal seminar. It also allows you to pace yourself by pursuing a year-long senior thesis and to produce a piece of work that is specific to your personal interest."
