    "Typical lab course: create measurement plans create lab notebooks and lab summary reports error propagation is very important and learn how to use it in different cases.",
    "I learned a lot about using common lab equipment.",
    "The course was mainly about data analysis and error propagation. There was some learning about general lab skills and writing lab reports.",
    "I learned a lot about the scientific method.",
    "I learnt a lot about error analysis, but that was about it. The course is a little repetitive if you have taken a lab course before.",
    "- Definitely my favorite class this semester. I would highly recommend this class to engineers over the other physics labs. It's intellectually challenging and a lot of work, but you'll leave with a much better understanding of how physical systems work. - Got a very good sense about how circuits work (which is much easier to understand in practice) - Learned a good amount of statistics - Got a sense for how physicists see the world, describing complex systems with a few powerful equations to govern seemingly unintuitive behaviors.",
    "Lab techniques related to physics.",
    "How to use lab equipment, propagation of error",
    "I sort of learned how to use an oscilloscope",
    "This course was my first lab course so basically all the skills were new to me, like writing a lab report, keeping a lab notebook, and experimental procedures. I also learned a lot more about forming circuits.",
    "I learned a ton from this course, as it was my first lab course at Yale. I learned how to use a wide variety of instruments, gained a much better understanding of some of the PHYS 260 and AP Physics concepts I had learned 2-3 years ago, such as circuits, torque, gyroscopes etc. In addition, while we didnt learn the most rigorous statistical tools to measure and interpret experimental uncertainty (I am an intended data science major, so I am being a bit too picky here), we learned methods to quickly approximate and calculate statistical uncertainties in a timed lab setting that I had not previously learned and are much easier to quickly apply. I also learned how to efficiently keep an organized notebook and write and organized lab summary.",
    "I acquired skills at using some of the basic physics lab equipment in addition to key elements of elementary statistical\/data analysis.",
    "I gained a lot of skills in this course such as how to use a torsional oscillator and how to set up a circuit. I also got way better at writing college lab reports, analyzing error, and working with histogram graphs.",
    "Gained knowledge about learning a topic in physics in the pre-lab, and applying during the lab itself.",
    "I already knew some of the physics from high school, but I did learn some new concepts the optics of a Keplerian telescope, driven and damped oscillation, how RC circuits respond to AC current, and how to measure radioactive decay. Most importantly, though, I came away with a much better understanding of error analysis and statistics. I hadnt really seen either concept before taking this lab."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could use more psets to help with error propagation.",
    "The handouts were well written and instructive. Some of the older lab handouts though were poorly written or ran over allotted time. Error propagation was not taught well in my opinion. Spending more time on proper error propagation would help this course a lot.",
    "Strengths: Great textbook, very good at teaching about error propagation. Weaknesses: The amount of time the labs take is wildly inconsistent. Also, sometimes the pre-labs are mislabeled and don't get re-labeled early enough.",
    "Well I dropped this course halfway through so I'm not sure why I can still evaluate it, but it was fine. It was just really time inefficient, like they felt like they had to make us go slower if we were understanding and completing the experiment quickly.",
    "Good to work with so many devices and physics concepts to develop laboratory and science skills--however, workload WAY too excessive for a 0.5 credit class (spent 6-7 hours outside of class preparing for each week)",
    "I dont think there is much that can be improved, it is a well run and necessary class. But it is repetitive if you have taken an EE lab or done research yourself before. Perhaps well prepared students could go straight to 206L?",
    "Strengths: - Really teaches physics concepts very well. I am much more a hands on learner, which is perhaps why I found this class more useful than my actual physics class. Weaknesses: - Pre labs were confusing and I often had to complete them after the lab to understand what was going on, which is self-defeating - Much of this lab's work is well outside the scope of PHYS 180\/181 sequence. I was confused when working with radiation emission, optics, and sound waves as we did not cover than in our class.",
    "Labs are generally a boring but probably a necessary skill. This class was much more laid back than typical labs which was very nice.",
    "This course was very frustrating because I put a lot of time into it doing what seemed like busy work, and I often still did not really understand the concepts. I think the experiment guides need to be rewritten, the concepts need to be gone over better in class, and expectations for the written lab summary must be made clearer. In addition, this lab ought to be 3.5 hours, not 3, because we almost never finished on time.",
    "The only strength is that if you can get yourself to do the work it's not that much time. But it sucks so much that it's really hard to get yourself to do the work. At least it was only once a week.",
    "Some of the labs in this were a little too basic. I get that they were intended to teach things like procedure and data analysis, but testing things like a force on a spring was something I could have done in middle school. The course was definitely more interesting when the labs required more understanding.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is so hands on and there are many assignments that force you to keep up with all the material and learn it until it is second nature. The only weakness with the course is that the workload sometimes feels unnecessarily heavy. I feel like for half a credit, the amount of time I spent outside of class filling out my lab notebook was probably equivalent to the workload of a regular class. I also feel like a lot of the time I was filling out the lab notebook, I was not learning anything and just trying to get a good grade. I think that learning to keep a good lab notebook is a valuable experience, I just wish we werent graded on it every week. Perhaps some of the labs could be designed so that most of the grading could be measured by a few numbers and results put in the lab summary, or perhaps, after 4-5 weeks of lab notebooks being graded (enough time to develop the good notetaking skills) they will not be required. I like everything about this course except the amount of time I spent filling out the notebooks. In class I jotted notes on the experiment guide handout and found this was sufficient for taking observations from the experiment.",
    "I thought it was a good general introduction to some of the basic lab equipment and data analysis. However, I have a few suggestions for improvement: 1) I think the data analysis\/error propagation should have been taught in class (we were expected to learn it from the book). I think even if one or two labs had to be sacrificed as a result, I think having it explained in class and working through examples together would have led to a greater depth of understanding for these fundamental concepts. 2) Oftentimes, components of the labs felt redundant or unnecessary (ie sometimes the questions from the lab and the expectations for the lab report overlapped significantly, resulting in a lot of repeated information). Additionally, some of the lab exercises felt like they were there for the sake of extending the lab rather than really adding any more skills or knowledge. Also, sometimes the equipment failed or instructions were written confusingly, and the lab staff didn't always know how to help. 3)A survey was sent out about it this year, but I really feel that students should receive a full credit for physics lab. I spent as much if not more time both in and out of class on lab as compared to other classes I have taken. So, I disliked receiving only a half-credit for the amount of effort I put in.",
    "I thought this course was very strong. We learned a lot and each week, the lab seemed relevant and new. My partner and I really enjoyed a lot of them and I feel like I came out of the course with a much better understanding of many basic lab concepts such as error propagation.",
    "The course did well as a basic introduction to lab methods and elementary data analysis without being too restrictive. On the other hand, I felt that it could have gone more in depth on the physics and statistics behind what we were doing--we usually had to take the concepts on faith, and simply use them without really understanding where they came from.",
    "This course could be improved by having clearer expectations of lab write-ups explained at the very beginning of the course.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was probably the professor and TF. Prof. Irons was a really nice guy, and was always happy to help us. I especially think that the TF could make or break this class. If it hadnt been for Jae, Im not sure that I would have enjoyed it. Hes really smart, knows the material very well, and yet is also incredibly nice and helpful. He was also pretty relaxed, and didnt make a big deal out of stupid things (like people having trouble printing their homework). For some reason he wasn't listed as one of the TFs for this course, so I could only evaluate him here. Also, in general the course material was good, and from what I've heard it's improved from previous years. Some of the earlier labs were a bit tedious (especially the measuring g lab, although I admit that it is important to learn error analysis), but I really enjoyed some of the later ones, when we got to try out some fun experiments (like building a Keplerian telescope). I would, however, suggest making a few revisions to the course material. Some of the labs are a bit too long, and I often felt rushed trying to complete them. I think this is unfortunate, because some of the best science happens when people take a little extra time to think about their results or to try something new. I have taken other labs that encouraged their students to try coming up with new little experiments, and I think the physics lab should do so as well. You could create this time by cutting down on some of the more tedious parts of various experiments, or by simply not requiring such detailed lab notes. I understand that you want to teach students how to take good notes, and it makes sense in the early labs, but by the end of the course I found it to be somewhat of a waste of time. For the last few reports, I would make the lab notes count for less, and the lab writeup count for more. Near the end of the course, you could have the students write something more like a real scientific paper (albeit shorter). Finally, I would suggest spending more time discussing some of the concepts in the labs. There were certain things I never understood well (for example, the regions in which damped vs. overdamped oscillation occurs). I also never learned where any of the error analysis formulas come from."

   "comments": [
    "It's rather fun at times, and if you have relaxed people in your lab section, you'll have fun.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students who are required to take it.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. But there's no reason to take it if you don't have to, it's uninspired.",
    "Only if you can take the huge workload, and want to learn more about data anlysis and science\/laboratory skills.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it. All of the course instructors are awesome, but the course material can be repetitive if you have previously taken a lab course.",
    "For engineers, I would strongly recommend taking this course over the lower level physics lab. You will learn how to use an oscilloscope and build simple electrical systems through many different experiments. It's a really helpful class if you also have trouble understanding E\/M abstractly as it is taught in class.",
    "Only take labs if required. Not as bad as other labs, but still pretty tedious work.",
    "A decent lab class. Less work that other lab classes I have done, and you get to use some cool equipment. Only work is 4 short psets at the staart of the semester, and a lab book you write up during lab, along with a 2 page summary you do at home.",
    "I guess this class is kinda fun but also really frustrating because of time constraints, busy work, and not understanding what is going on. However, it pretty fun to do things hands on. But most people taking this class are doing it because they have to anyway.",
    "If you're REALLY into physics take this. Would not recommend for an MB&B major who's looking for a challenge.",
    "I have heard the experiments are more interesting than 165 (or whatever the alternative lab is I can't remember the exact number) so I would recommend it to someone over that course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student majoring in Physics or just trying to be exposed to experimental methods. The class is a fair amount of work for just a half credit, but the material is really easy if you are have taken on upper level Physics courses such as 260-261, 410,420 and 440 (as I had). PHYS 205L is not always fun because of the high workload but in class it usually fun and rewarding.",
    "I would somewhat recommend this course to another student. I felt as though many of the exercises could be dry and tedious and that lab TAs\/faculty sometimes weren't able to help when things went wrong. I think there should have been a greater emphasis on data analysis\/error propagation skills and that I would have understood them much better if they had been taught in class. It is also difficult to fully recommend this course at the moment as it is a lot of work for merely half a credit.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Physics Lab to another student. I thought the grading was very fair and we received a lot of good feedback that improved my understanding.",
    "Definitely. You do learn, but it's also a very relaxed, fun atmosphere.",
    "Most in my class took this course because it is a requirement of their major, but I took this course just to learn new physics and experience a lab setting even though it is not a requirement for me. It ended up being more work than I would have liked, but I did love and become fascinated by many of the topics we covered.",
    "Physics 205L isnt bad, as labs go. Some of the experiments are fairly tedious, but some of them are pretty interesting for example, we got to build a Keplerian telescope and measured its magnification. Youll learn a bunch of error analysis techniques, and while theyre not exactly fun, theyre really useful. I dont think the class was little work as the other reviews have suggested. I spent three hours a week in lab, and I generally spent 5+ hours outside of lab finishing up my notes and writing the prelabs\/summaries. However, the grading is fairly lenient. Overall Id say that if you have to take a physics lab, this one is a pretty good choice (compared to the lousy things Ive heard about 165L). Note, however, that your experience will depend on your lab professor and TA. My professor (Stephen Irons) was helpful, and my TF (Sangjae Lee or Jae for short) was really smart and very chill, so I lucked out in that department."
