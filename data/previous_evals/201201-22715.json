   "comments": [
    "The course isn't very hard if you've had L4. You will have to do hundreds of worksheets throughout the semester, and they'll probably start to feel like busywork. I probably wouldn't recommend the course (there were no major flaws, it was just a bit boring).",
    "take it if you want to improve your spanish! it's awesome .",
    "This class is great for learning the niceties of Spanish grammar and also just reviewing\/ recalling all the things you've forgotten from high school. In all my high school Spanish classes, I had lots of very specific questions, and all of these were finally answered in this class.Obviously the class deals mostly with grammar, so the class has a lot of repetitive elements. I still found it interesting and stimulating, though, since I had wanted to learn the subtler aspects of Spanish grammar for a long time. Take it if you're of a similar mind, but otherwise you won't probably won't enjoy it quite as much.Professor Seymour is also amazing, fun, sweet, and very helpful. I really liked having this class with her.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to improve their grasp of Spanish. For me, the advanced conversation class improved my vocabulary a little, and my fluidity when speaking, slightly, but advanced grammar was FAR more practical. It picked up where my high school classes left off and clarified common grammatical problems, leaving me much more confident about speaking because I don't fear making so many mistakes. The workload is light and manageable, just don't let it build up. Professor Seymour is wonderful, also.",
    "I would recommend that you take this course if you really want a better understanding of Spanish grammar. This course will really help you know the grammar to say exactly what you want to say. The workload is doable, as long as you keep up on your homeworks. The tests can be difficult, but they're not unreasonable. Professor Seymour is really great, she's just so nice and is great at explaining grammar.",
    "Yes, it is a very good class to take if you want to perfect your grammatical skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn Spanish grammar. It is especially helpful for improving writing skills. There aren't many chances to practice speaking other than the final oral presentation, but learning the grammar is helpful for that too. Professor Seymour is the best--she's very accessible and helpful and classes are well-organized and productive."
