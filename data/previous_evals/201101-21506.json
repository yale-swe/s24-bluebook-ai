   "comments": [
    "I think this was a very tight and well thought-out and taught course. It was one of my favorites this semester despite times when I felt that the course was more out at sea and less deeply focused on a book or text as a whole and too focused on a particular issue. Nevertheless, I feel like it helped me get a strong command of almost all the texts we read in the course and provided a great groundwork to keep on reading similar work--it also has given me a new energy to do just that and read more related work, and I think, taught me how to read it better.",
    "P North described it as a \"greatest hits of German critical thought\" class on the first day. I don't know enough about German studies to assess that statement, but I feel pretty confident that I'm comfortable with the trickier elements of Luther, Kleist, Feuerbach, Marx, Kierkegaard, Freud and Kafka. I absolutely recommend this class if you have any interest in critical thought or intellectual history. P North makes everything you read relevant to your lived experience as a human being, as well as contextualizing the works within their respective time periods. Such a great class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Definitely. You'll be exposed to some incredible literature, and be challenged to think and articulate ideas in entirely new ways. Especially if you're interested in German intellectual history, this class is one of the best!",
    "Great class. Taught well, a fair amount of work, and some interesting (though quite bizarre papers). You read great authors and Paul North is awesome.",
    "A somewhat random overview of German critiques of ideology and religion. Be prepared for very frequent and very strange writing assignments that will make you want to cry when you're writing them, and then be prepared to wait for weeks to get any feedback. I wouldn't recommend this course to a student because I didn't find it very engaging, but others might feel differently.",
    "Take it if you are interested in literature in an ideological context. If you take the texts seriously enough, it will change the way you think.",
    "I loved this class. The syllabus is fantastic and attracts a talented group of students. Paul North is so knowledgable about the texts and leads great discussions. There were five short papers, but the assignments were very specific and fun to complete.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the critique of religion in the German-speaking world from Luther through to the 20th century. The readings are interesting and varied in both style and tone. Assignments are likewise varied, allowing students to express their understandings of the readings in different forms. This is a great introduction to the critique of various theologies and to new genres of writing. I would recommend this course to all students interested in German philosophy&literature, theology, critique, or non-fiction writing.",
    "Excellent."
