    "DS H\/P is a helpful introduction to what some smart armchair philosophers thought about politics.",
    "DS H and P allows one to understand the trend of thought for the most important writers of the modern era.",
    "This course helped me develop an understanding of the relation and interaction between some major works of political thought of the Western canon. I learned to critique the points of view of different thinkers that we studied and improved my writing skills as well.",
    "This course gave me an insight into the major currents and thinkers of modern opinion on history and politics such as Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, and Hannah Arendt. In addition to equipping me with this knowledge, it demonstrated how these theories intersect with practical institutions, as evidenced in The Federalist Papers and in The Souls of Black Folk."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a little more contextualization of the works at some point might be helpful. For example, it would be great to be able to spend the last few classes talking about the influences of works on society over time. Right now it is easy to read a work and come to the conclusion that it is irrelevant or inaccessible to our contemporary experience.",
    "This course does a fantastic job in allowing students to understand the trend of thought for these thinkers through section and lecture. I wish I got more an idea though as to what the goal of H and P writing is, when creating an essay.",
    "The strength of this course is its focus on analyzing the connections between the different works we study and understanding the value of the works as they interact with one another, as well as the teaching format that combines seminar and lecture. One weakness is that the small amount of time spent on each text makes the discussion of its ideas seem superficial, especially when there is an interest in discussing, for instance, the problematic aspects of the texts' attitudes towards inequality.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is the connections between the works that we read. It was easy to understand the progression of thought from Hobbes to Locke to Rousseau. Because of these connections, the course seemed coherent, and I came away from it feeling that I had a basic grasp of the trajectory of Western thought. The greatest weakness of this course was the selections of what we read. Although all the texts merited inclusion, the passages that we read from them often seemed random and distracted from the main thrust of the text. Trimming the length of the passages and finding better ones to select would improve the course."

   "comments": [
    "Take DS H\/P if you want to engage with various influential political theories in the details. This course isn't really understanding how political theories influence the world but assessing the theories on their own merits.",
    "Yes take DS if you are at all interested in developing an intellectual framework for western thought. DS will cause you to change the way you live and appreciate life. For H and P, it will cause you to alter the way you view politics and social change.",
    "yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in gaining a foundation in major works of the Western canon and learning to write and argue coherently, but also would not mind sacrificing an in-depth reading of the works for an overall grasp of trends in Western historical and political thought.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who want a basic understanding of historical and political thought. All the texts that we read are foundational works whose ideas have shaped the modern world. Being able to discuss and comprehend these texts is essential skill that this course develops.",
    "Yes! It's a great course. You get to learn about so many amazing thinkers like Kant, Marx, Nietzsche and Arendt, to list a few. It'll give you a good overview of the main schools of thought from enlightenment to post WWII. And the faculty is amazing. Dazzling in many ways."
