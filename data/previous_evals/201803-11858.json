   "comments": [
    "I gained a deeper appreciation for the workings of influence and the conversation between the English poets of the 16th and 17th centuries.",
    "simply put: how to read a poem. Bloom always asks at the end of discussion, \"What makes this poem work?\"--a question I had not been asking myself before.",
    "I learned so much, this course was a very new field for me, so everything I was able to gain, from our wonderful professor, to the carefully selected readings to the insight of my peers was fascinating. I still have an endless amount of improvement that I can make, but I was shocked at how effectively I was able to be at least initiated into the world of poetry through discussion and just simply jumping in. I'm very aware that I was often missing references that my more seasoned peers were able to catch, but if anybody is interested in even trying to engage with material like this, I think they should consider taking the class as there is a lot to gain regardless of skill level.",
    "I learned how to read literature critically and how to take into context the life of the author. We focused a lot on reading authors as responding to their predecessors, which was really insightful to practice."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is wonderful, and cannot be improved.",
    "the course depends a lot on student input, and though we were shy with each other early on in the course, by the time Tennyson or Browning rolled along the discussion had reached a satisfactory level.",
    "The course presupposes a certain degree of exposure and awareness of context; it potentially could be challenging, but if one is already sufficiently familiar to keep up, Professor Blooms lessons are a truly rich education.",
    "I don't see any obvious way to improve the class. Prof. Bloom was an absolute master at guiding discussion, and I was always excited to see what readings he would select since I don't have sufficient background in poetry to know what works rank among the most important. As far as strengths, Professor always took great care to impart us with his knowledge, but also leave space for us to expand and reach conclusions on our own by having a perfect balance of his insight and our discussion.",
    "This course is incredible. Professor Bloom is a great teacher, but the class itself is a very fun, welcoming dynamic because it is so small and filled with people who love the material."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The course is fun, interesting, engaging, and not too much work.",
    "10\/10. expect to view Romantic and Victorian poets in a completely new light. I was simply blown away by what Bloom said about the ending of Tennyson's Ulysses or about the mental landscape of Childe Roland.",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough. Professor Bloom is one of the most delightfully warm and welcoming people I have had the pleasure of interacting with at Yale, and being welcomed into his home for regular tea sessions has been one of the highlights of my time at Yale. It's a welcome removal from the stress and pressure of other classes, but still an amazing opportunity to learn. This class is truly one of the most unique at Yale, and failure to take it if given the opportunity would be a shame.",
    "Yes definitely. This course is really fun and I also learned a lot."
