The second year lightning talks also seem like a waste of time because they are not long enough for the presenter to actually describe their project. We also don't receive very meaningful feedback (none from the instructors, and the quality of the feedback from other students varies). It doesn't seem like the goal of the class is to help us improve our presentation skills. It seems more like this is just a requirement that we all have to do, but no one actually cares about it.",
