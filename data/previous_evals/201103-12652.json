   "comments": [
    "Awesome course! I think this course has been around for long enough that the structure of the course has very little to nothing to improve on. Low stress until concert week.",
    "Yes. This class has the best undergraduate musicians in the school.",
    "Great course. If you like chamber music, audition! As a non-string player, coachings and masterclasses were not always as helpful for me as I felt they could I have been. Still, it is wonderful to have the opportunity to play chamber music in a more structured environment.",
    "Yes, do it. It's a fun experience, but make sure you have the time to commit to it.",
    "if you're a musician at a somewhat serious level, definitely give this course a try because you will gain a lot out of it both as a musician and person",
    "Basically, you work with a small group of fellow musicians, meeting for 1-2 hours each week individually and 1 hour each week with a coach, and end the term with a final performance.",
    "Just playing chamber music. The most work is going to the two really long concerts in one day.",
    "Anyone's experience with this course, I am sure, would vary from year to year based on instructors, repertoire, and instrumentation. But I really enjoyed it. If you love playing chamber music and want to hear and play with some of Yale's most dedicated musicians, you will love it too.",
    "Great if you love chamber music and play at a high level!",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. It's a great way to become involved in chamber music and relieve the stress you may get from your other academic courses. The coaching sessions and studio classes are always helpful, you'll have a ton of fun, and you get to play awesome repertoire. What's not to like?",
    "Take it if you are interested in chamber music. You will not get a full high-level experience, but it is nice to be able to work with other musicians at Yale.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it - it's just rehearsals with your group, a coaching every week, and a performance class a few times per semester. It depends mostly on who is coaching you and who is in your group, but if you have good people then it's a very good way to keep your group working and rehearsing.",
    "If you are a serious musician then this is definitely something worth looking into. The class is pretty low key because the rehearsals are planned by the groups themselves, and you get a credit for playing music.",
    "Music 220 is a great course, with a healthy atmosphere, and good feedback from the coaches. If you take it seriously, it's a big time commitment for a 1\/2 credit course."
