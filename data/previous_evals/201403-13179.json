    "Paul Fry is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. Like most Yale professors, he's brilliant and accomplished in his field, but unlike many, he's a funny, charming, and thoroughly engaging lecturer. There were stretches of the syllabus that I personally didn't love (Wordsworth and Byron for the most part), but their importance in the canon is undeniable, and Professor Fry's lectures were always interesting even when I didn't find reading the texts themselves to be.",
    "There's a reason this class is called \"Romantic Poets\" and not \"Romantic Poetry\" - I'm pretty sure we talked about biography all semester without substantiating any claims in text. If that's your bag, go for it, but don't expect to come out with a better understanding of what the poetry's actually like.",
    "Definitely worth taking as a low stress English class. In terms of actual assignments, the workload is really light. There is a fairly large amount of reading throughout the semester though, so be prepared for that.",
    "Professor Fry is an excellent lecturer he offers interesting, engaging, and rigorous readings. I still don't *love* English Romantic poetry Shelley is a snooze! but Professor Fry is the best professor I've had at Yale.",
    "I had never taken a poetry class before this, and I really enjoyed the class. I would definitely recommend it, and it is a good class for cred\/d because it is easy to minimize the reading and still get a lot out of the class.",
    "Romantic Poetry was a wonderful course and was invaluable for my completion of the English major (not as a distributional requirement, but as a course covering the Romantic poets). The course provides a thorough grounding in the biographical details of each poet, their historical contexts and trajectories insofar as those things influenced their poetry and connected them to one another. It also assigns the, or many, major works of each poet, provides readings for those poems, and does an excellent job of developing, throughout the class, the philosophy of romanticism as it was manifest distinctly in each poet. I came away with a firm grasp of the strains of thought and ideals underlying the Romantic movement. It's probably important to remember that, in taking this class, you'll get a lot of this historical background and a sense for the evolving, broader themes of romanticism; you won't really cultivate close-reading skills of your own. I don't feel as though I generated my own close readings of poems, or understand any given poem in any particularly new or remarkable way. I still found the class quite valuable, especially because it provided information that I find English classes at Yale often leave out -- i.e., significant information about the circumstances of the production of a work -- and cannot really imagine what a lecture oriented at cultivating students' close-reading skills would look like. So, I would recommend it highly if you're looking for an English class that emphasizes historical context at the same level it emphasizes close-reading poetry.",
    "I would take it only if you have an extensive interest in poetry. As someone who had no previous experience with the subject material it was very difficult for me.",
    "I would cautiously recommend this class. It's a broad survey with a light workload; if that's what you're looking for, it may well be the class for you. If you want something with a bit more punch, this may not be it (yet). I'm hopeful that Professor Fry will keep improving ENGL 250 so as to retain its very good aspects -- it's a wonderful introduction to Romantic philosophy and literature -- while offering more of his own deeper insights to complement that breadth.",
    "If you want to be familiar with the great poems of this period, I highly recommend taking this class. You read some beautiful poetry. I really enjoyed the course, though it was difficult for me as a non-English major.",
    "This was a great class. Professor Fry's lectures were always strong and clear, and I got an introduction to a subject I never thought I would have enjoyed.",
    "This class was amazing. I went into this thinking that I could never enjoy reading Romantic Poetry, that it was just a bunch of dead old white guys talking about trees, and that I would suffer through it. Professor Fry, through the charisma and energy of his lectures, breathed life into the poems, made them see them like he sees them, with relevance and vitality, with complexity and mystery. He made me fall in love with Romantic Poetry. And that was such a cool and unexpected experience. If he ever teaches this class again, take it."
