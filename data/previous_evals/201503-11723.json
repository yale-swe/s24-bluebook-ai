    "CHNS 164 is a great class if you want to learn about contemporary China through the lens of literature. Su laoshi has great stories (if you haven't heard all of them before) and he knows many of the writers you study personally, which is super cool. The course itself can get a little dry if you aren't super engaged in the subject matter though (Su Laoshi does have the tendency to ramble), and the dictation tests are killer (tons and tons of vocab).",
    "Take this course. If you are good at Chinese and have an interest in post-1949 fiction, you will not find a better teacher than Su Wei.",
    "Chinese 164 is a great class. Su Laoshi is a wonderful teacher who cares very deeply for his students and their success. If you have not read any Chinese literature before (and even if you have), I would recommend this class. Su Laoshi has selected a wide range of contemporary works from a number of famous Chinese authors (most of whom he knows personally, and will tell stories about). In addition to weekly readings, there are four 1,000 character essays and two tests (midterm and final), plus some grammar work and character memorization. If you have taken a Chinese class before at Yale, this is honestly a bit less work than other courses.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course. Even if the readings don't seem to amount to much, Professor Su does an amazing job of contextualizing and enriching them through discussions on Chinese language, culture, and history.",
    "Su Laoshi is the best for so many reasons. Whatever this guy is being paid, he deserves a raise. Best teacher I've had at Yale",
    "Easy high-level Chinese class. Much easier than L5. Textbook is printed from Tyco and is designed by Suwei laoshi and the Yale Chinese department. In total we read 8 excerpts from different stories written by Chinese authors in the past 30-40 years or so. Each reading in the textbook is about 6-8 pages, and it is accompanied by a vocab list to aid you in reading. The class meets twice every week, you have a quick vocab quiz once every week. There are 4 essays where you have to write at least one full page of Chinese, so at least 800-1000 characters. A midterm and a final, the final is exactly the same format as the midterm with fill in the blank from a word bank, fill in the blank multiple choice, creating sentences from given vocabs\/grammar structures, and the essay section. Suwei is a dope professor and a super cool guy. He personally knows most of the authors of the stories you read in the class so he can tell some really interesting stories that make the authors seem more relatable and human. He is very relaxed with due dates, and if you hand your essay in a week late hes understanding. Same with the homework assignments from the textbook, I once turned mine in two weeks late and he didnt seem to mind. Definitely take this class if you want to practice your reading and writing. Take this class if you want to read real stories about crazy stuff that happened in China in the past 80 years or whatever. The class has a strong theme of womens role in society. The stories in the textbook are organized chronologically sort of, so you can see how the role of the female characters in the stories changes as time goes on.",
    "An excellent introduction to modern Chinese literature from the 70s-80s, structured as a language class. Even for those only interested in China for business, this class provides valuable cultural background. The clipped Chinese of newspapers is far from the flowing, evocative, sometimes crass Chinese of fiction, and I definitely recommend anyone planning to use Chinese to become familiar with both styles. Literature is where you learn the beauty in the language."
