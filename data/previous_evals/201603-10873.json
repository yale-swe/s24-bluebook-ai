   "comments": [
    "I developed better pronunciation and grammar.",
    "I significantly improved my French grammar and reading abilities. I was exposed to grammar that I was unaware of and I added to my vocabulary.",
    "I dramatically improved my French writing, speaking, and comprehension skills. We studied not only the language, but also Francophone history and culture. This allowed us to have a full, vibrant picture of the interplay between the French language and Francophone identity. French 140 with Mme Vysosias was an amazing course.",
    "I developed a mastery of grammar, improved my critical reading skills in French, and began to speak more fluidly. I learned much more about Francophone countries. The French Department has it figured out--the course pack is geared very much towards learning and retention.",
    "improved grammar and French conversation skills; increased fluency and proficiency in reading French literature.",
    "The most valuable part of this class was the focus on speaking, but it covered all bases pretty well (grammar, vocabulary, reading, etc.)",
    "I learned many new grammar concepts (le faire causatif, le temps littraire, le discours indirect, etc.) as well as a plethora of new vocabulary words that I can now incorporate in daily french conversations. Additionally, I learned to discuss and write about short stories and two novels, which I had never been asked to do in my past high school french classes. I also learned a lot about French culture, France during World War II, and the lives of people in exile.",
    "Much more practice with the French language and exposure to good French literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of the course was certainly the reading material. They were never too long or too short, had meaningful messages, and shared similar themes. I never dreaded doing the readings for this class. A weakness was work ethic of the other students. Many of them didn't take the class seriously, didn't complete assignments, and detracted from the general quality of the course.",
    "I had a minimal formal grammar foundation coming into the class, so that was my biggest weakness. My biggest strengths were writing and oral evaluations.",
    "Writing needs be a larger emphasis, as classes at the upper levels will require essays of good caliber in French.",
    "This course's small size (I think we had only 12 students), as well as the extraordinary skill of its instructor (in my case, Mme Vysosias), made it extremely conducive for deep, immersive French learning. I am so glad I took this course.",
    "The French Department has it figured out: No weaknesses. The course pack is better than any textbook and the online audio, while requiring 30 minutes each night, is super helpful. The teachers are instrumental and unmatched. The readings are varied and interesting, and require occasionally looking up words and events but certainly within L4 abilities.",
    "Structurally, I really enjoyed the format of the class; working in the course pack and then applying these technical and vocabulary lessons in class helped me to better articulate ideas in French and reinforced them through class conversation. The workload was manageable, and I really enjoyed the group projects and readings throughout the semester.",
    "Weaknesses: more feedback would be helpful, there's lots of work some of which seems unnecessary (audio tapes are unnecessarily long) Strengths: Testing system encourages students to gradually learn material and remember it as opposed to just studying for a midterm, the texts are interesting, lots of practice speaking",
    "This course is very immersive. It meets everyday, so you really get in a rhythm of speaking, writing, and listening in French. The texts, though often depressing, are very interesting and make for productive in-class discussions. There is a good balance of grammar, vocabulary, and discussion of texts, and the frequent evaluations ensure students have mastered the materials. My only complaint is that I wish the students had spoken more because often classes were more lecture-style.",
    "Things were very fast paced in the beginning and slowed down toward the end, so maybe arranging the work a bit more evenly throughout the semester?"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this to students who have difficulty reading in French as this course was reading-intensive and didn't seriously strengthen many of my other French skills.",
    "Yes, I think it is important for one's French competence.",
    "It's a lot of boring, rote work that you don't experience in other Yale classes. Not bad, but certainly not good.",
    "Without a doubt. Mme Vysosias is a phenomenal instructor, the class is small enough for intimate learning (while also allowing the students to get to know each other and the instructor on a deep level), we read fascinating French texts, and you will come away with a firmer grasp of the French language than you ever had before.",
    "Yes. It will require nightly work and a commitment five days a week, but you will emerge far better in French. Stay on top of your work, do the reading, definitely do the audio, and your grade will reflect what you put in. Tests are completely doable and the instructors will prepare you well, and the grading system is very much in favor of granting you the highest score.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student considering pursuing French at Yale; I felt that the course was not only valuable to gain proficiency in the language, but was also enjoyable and engaging.",
    "I would if you enjoy French. It's a lot of work but you learn a lot and no individual assignment is too hard to handle.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interesting in improving their language skills. I think I learned more about grammar\/vocab\/french texts, but I'm not sure I made much progress in my ability to speak the language.",
    "Good for those interested in French, for sure."
