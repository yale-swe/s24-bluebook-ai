   "comments": [
    "I knew that I wanted a 5-credit semester and this class was a last resort. Take that remark as you will. Even when I \"settled\" on this course, I didn't feel as great about it. Upon first glance, 30% participation seemed scary, especially since student comments from the first time it was offered complained about the difficulty some students had in equally getting the chance to participate. Because I knew I would never dominate the course, I took this Credit\/D and barely regret it. I could very possibly end up with an A- (for example) but I was never willing to take the risk because no one exactly knows how much participation is enough. Regardless, you have a noticeable amount of people who talk too much. The textbook is dense and annoying. Focus on the other assigned readings posted on the server and pay attention during lecture. Paul is an amazing TF (if he returns). I enjoyed section more than most lectures. (And section doesn't even meet every week, which is a godsend!) Carmen is an acquired taste. Those interactions are merely perceptions from class, but I could be misreading her unfairly. The two quizzes are very easy if you read regularly and review your lecture notes. I think the median on both quizzes were 100. Some struggled on the midterm, but I didn't. The exam was too long for a 50 minute period, regardless of how well you did. There was a modest \"curve\". The final was fun, probably because I took this Credit\/D. It was take-home, so I did this from the comfort of my own bedroom. It is also open-note, but one still needs to prepare. The fact pattern\/essay will require quite a bit of scrolling, so it isn't exactly a \"breeze\". In short, you're a very special person if you truly enjoy this course. I complained about it on a regular basis, and the saving grace is that I took it Credit\/D. It is definitely within one's normal ability to do well without Credit\/D, but so many times, I was concerned about the level of effort needed to succeed and no one was ever clear about it. The reason why I took this course was for a Credit\/D to apply as one of my two lecture courses in the Poli Sci major to be Credit\/D and take care of part of the IR sub-field.",
    "If you are considering Political Science as a major, you should deff take this class.",
    "If you have any interest in the legal system or international affairs, you will love this class",
    "I would never take International Law again. I read reviews of Professor Sanchez before shopping the class and didn't really believe them - however, believe me!! Professor Sanchez was an awful lecturer; she rarely stayed on topic, and I never knew what she wanted me to learn in the class. Furthermore, the textbook was completely useless, so I couldn't even use that to supplement the material. If you can't tell, I'm very disappointed that I wasted one of my credits on this course - don't make the same mistake that I did.",
    "Super duper course! Thania knows her shit and will spit mad fire lickedy-split, so pay the fuck attention cuz you about to get SCHOOLED on everything you thought you understood about international law but didn't cuz it's fidgety as heck. TAKE GOOD NOTES. Screwed if you don't. This course could be pretty dry and dull if you don't care about it, but if you make the conscious choice that you do, it's pretty dope. I definitely feel like I learned a lot, especially the mindset and details to have on hand when you see international law crop up in other courses and current events.",
    "This course is very engaging. It is a lot of reading, though the cases are really the only thing that need to be read, not the textbook.",
    "This course is a good survey course for those considering law school or international law study. The course midterm and final are designed similarly to law school exams. While the exams shouldn't be taken lightly- lots of studying and preparation is needed- they are helpful tools for determining whether or not law school might be a good future fit.",
    "This class is a wonderful introduction to international law for students who are interested. It is a small lecture course with a focus on participation. I would definitely recommend it to other students who are planning to pursue law or political science.",
    "Lot of stuff on the UN.",
    "Intro to Internation Law is a good class for anyone thinking about law. Professor Sanchez is passionate. The midterm and final are manageable and are substantive assessments of what you learn throughout the course.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in international law and the many principles that fall under it.",
    "This is the worst class I took at Yale. The material is interesting but if you're interested, just get the book but do not take this class with professor Sanchez.",
    "Overall I think this class gives a good introduction to international law and a law class in general.",
    "Very satisfied!",
    "This course is great for students who are interested in law. I would recommend this course to everyone.",
    "This class is a great overview of international law. If you are at all interested in the field of law, or international law specifically, I would highly recommend taking this course.",
    "It's interesting but not the best class I've ever taken. The midterm and final were surprisingly hard.",
    "Interesting material but didnt enjoy lecture itself."
