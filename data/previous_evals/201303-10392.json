   "comments": [
    "Great reading list. Professor Brunson is a great discussion leader. I didn't have a ton of \"wow\" moments during our class discussions, but overall they were still fairly interesting. The reading load is light at first but picks up (obviously) with Crime and Punishment and Anna Karenina. The workload is otherwise light (2 short papers, 1 midterm, 1 final paper). I enjoyed writing the final paper much more than the short papers because the themes for the short papers had to be chosen from a list. Overall, a great class.",
    "Take this class. You read a representative cross-section of golden age Russian literature while also delving pretty deeply into some of the great works--cream of the crop texts, and a good balance between breadth and depth. The class is very well paced, though the reading gets heavier with the big novels. The readings were always a pleasure; the discussions were a pleasure; this class will actually make you a happier person and you will look forward to it. And you will come away feeling you have a solid grasp of a great national literature--you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to understand themes and continuities, as well as the wonderful peculiarities of each author. Professor Brunson is a phenomenal instructor. She knows so much about her subject and she incorporates scholarship and criticism into the class discussions in a really organic way. She also fostered a healthy, low-stress enjoyable classroom dynamic, which can often make or break a lit seminar. So far as I know the other professors who have taught this course are also very well thought of. Take it to be taught by an expert, to have the good kinds of existential crises you get when reading great literature, to be happy!!",
    "Great! You read the classics, discuss them, and write 3 papers. Two are short and one is a long research paper. A lot of freedom with topics and thought. The professor is so accessible, so kind, guides discussion well without being overbearing, and grades fairly. If you want to read Tolstoy\/Dostoevsky\/Pushkin, do it.",
    "Take it! Professor Brunson is so, so knowledgeable, talented and hilarious. She makes the class so fun. The reading list might seem like a lot, but it's actually pretty manageable. The papers are very open-ended so they end up being fun to write (also there's only three of them). If you have any interest in some of the coolest books ever, take it!",
    "This is an overview of Russian lit pre 1900, and it is fantastic! Absolutely take this class if you have any interest in Russian, the humanities, pre-1900 culture, European culture, etc. Professor Brunson is a fantastic professor. I am going to try and take more classes from her in the future.",
    "I would totally recommend it!",
    "This was a great course to read many of the big novels of Russian Literature. Not the lecture course I expected when I first signed up, but a seminar style course that offered both insight from the professor and lively discussion. The reading can get a little intense, but Professor Brunson is amazing and totally makes every page worth it."
