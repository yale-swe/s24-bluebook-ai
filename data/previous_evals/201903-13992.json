    "Kate and Emma did a great job of facilitating student involvement, even if much of it was via email. Perhaps class feedback into who a guest speaker could be, would be helpful.",
    "The multiple rounds of editing involving not just the peer editors but writing coaches and group editing allows for a wide range of perspectives which is quite helpful. The pitch process helps practice a different form of communication. Also loved the guest lecture, would have liked more of those.",
    "Great system for editing",
    "Strengths were the organization and communicating expectations. Emma and Kate were really great and helpful with my writing and responsive to any questions or hesitations I had during the writing process. I think it would have been time consuming but maybe nice for editors to sit down with writers to go over pieces to discuss any confusing parts. It also might have been nice to have more guest speakers.",
    "The course was well organized and all tasks were clearly outlined in the beginning. Emma and Kate were incredible teaching fellows and were wonderful to work with",
    "Strengths - Great peer review mechanism, the writing tutors at FES are also very helpful Weaknesses - It may have been good to have the weekend to submit assignments, to allow more time to write and review independently"

    "For a one credit course, you definitely learn a lot and every assignment has a clear purpose. This course does not feel like busy work and is an effective tool to hone your writing skills",
    "Allocate enough time to revise your own writing, instead of waiting for feedback from the editors to make corrections."
