    "Definitely take the class, good class size, work load. Interesting topics as well. Taking the class also includes you in the informal Yale Yoruba \"family.\"",
    "It's a really good class. At the end of the year, you come to know your classmates very well.",
    "Yoruba 120 is the Level 2 beginners class. I'm so glad I took it. If you are searching for an interesting language credit, look no further! If you can, take the class!",
    "It is an easy language course. Very laid back and you form close connections with the professor and the students because no many people take the course.",
    "TAKE IT. The little class becomes a family, its a very relaxed environment. Love Professor Seye! One of my favorite teachers- approachable, understanding, and funny. At the end of the year all of his classes come together and have a Nigerian feast.Stay away from the Yoruba films though."
