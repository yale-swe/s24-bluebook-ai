    "Yes, I would recommend the class.Interesting material. Great professor.",

    "This course provides a useful overview of the chemical processes at play in natural aquatic systems. An understanding of many of these topics is important for understanding of many topics in environmental engineering. The class itself seemed to focus a bit too much on the arithmetic and calculations required to address these problems, but I would still recommend it."
