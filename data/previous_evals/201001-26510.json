    "An important summary of an interesting and lovely period of art, including work from France, Italy, and the Netherlands, and structured around instances of Baroque and Rococo painting and sculpture held in the Yale collections. Take this class if you are interested in the period. Do the readings if you'd like to really learn in detail. Do not take this class if you are looking for theory-based investigation, take it to become informed.",
    "This is definitely a class worth taking. The readings are fascinating, and this is an essential period of art to study. Professor Periti is excellent, and she promotes good group discussion and has wonderful comments in class. You'll appreciate spending each class in the art gallery and taking advantage of Yale's wonderful collection. Plus, the final paper is genuinely fun to write and research, and with class presentations, you get to learn about everyone else's projects, too.",
    "I would not recommend this class, simply because the art you will be looking at is not very stimulating. However, again, if you are interested in this period of art history you may disagree with me and enjoy the class. Any class where you can look at the art in the gallery is arguably more interesting than looking at slides.",
    "Teaches you have Baroque and Rococo art, mostly 2D works (prints, paintings, etc.). Uses a lot of the Yale collection (mostly not-on-view works), which is cool, but perhaps somewhat limiting as well.",
    "I would say that we learned a lot about the subject matter, had weekly responses and a very large final paper. It was not an overwhelming amount of work, but we did not get a lot of feedback, so maybe I should have been working more. I would recommend it because I learned a lot with not a lot of stress. The professor was also very attentive and nice to get to know.",
    "Given the many art historical issues and questions it raised, I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of whether they have a particular interest in the period or not.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student; I took it because I needed to fulfill the History of Art baroque\/renaissance requirement.",
    "Excellent"
