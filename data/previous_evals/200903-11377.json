   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT. But only with Prof. Angela Lee-Smith. She is amazing and you will not regret it. I promise.",
    "The course is intensive Korean language. It was a lot of fun and really helped me improve my Korean language speaking and writing skills.",
    "There is a rather significant gap between level 4 and level 5 Korean. Level 5 involves a lot more writing in a much more fluid way. The workload is somewhat large, but very manageable if the work is spaced out properly, which isn't too hard to do, since there is a regular work schedule: sentences for vocabulary preview of the next chapter and a vocabulary quiz from the previous week's chapter every Monday; chapter exercises every Wednesday; a short essay and\/or presentation and a hanja quiz every Friday. In addition to these weekly assignment, there were three lesson tests spaced over the semester, as well as presentations. As for Angela Lee-Smith, she was wonderful to work with, as always.",
    "Good class if you want a small group of people to get close to while learning a language. Some things aren't explicitly mentioned and you'll have to learn it yourself or ask the professor after class.",
    "This class improved my Korean tons and is giving me motivation to continue my study with the language. Some days it was the only reason why I got out of bed because it transcended just a simple classroom experience. It was a meeting spot for a classroom full of friends and sincere pseudo-mom-teacher who wanted to indulge in some Korean! (Also, Angela SSN calls you if you don't go to class. But out of love.)Of course I would recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it, particularly if a potential student's Korean isn't perfect. I think even if one is familiar with basic Korean, he or she could stand to gain by taking this class if the student has the motivation to do so. I also would recommend that a student take the course if he or she is interested yet intimidated by the level of his or her peers. I think Professor Lee-Smith is able to see that even students in the same class have varying degrees of familiarity with Koreanand is able to make the environment quite stress-free for pretty much everyone."
