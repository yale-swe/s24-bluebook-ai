    "It's required for econ majors, but don't be like me and take it as a non-econ major- and if Kortum teaches the class again- DON'T TAKE IT. Wait and take it with anyone else. Worst class I've taken, absolutely impossibly hard and I learned nothing. Super disorganized.",
    "If this is taught by Professor Kortum, do not take it. Seriously. He was well meaning but could not teach us for the life of him. He's very nice, will try to help in his office hours (which are extremely over crowded) but he had no feel for an intro class. I barely learned anything and that was only due to the amazing help of my TA Bonnie who left half way through the semester. This was the most unpleasant class. The slides were unintelligible and clearly not written by the professor. The labs while well meaning were frustrating. The final project was a joke. We're in college and yet being forced to produce a poster board that the professor will spend 5 minutes on. This class was the literal worst.",
    "Take it with Professor McKee. If Kortum is teaching it, wait--even if you think you'll fall behind in the econ major, it's worth it... Wait.",
    "If you have to take it, then you have no choice. If you don't have to take it, don't do it. It is boring and difficult.",
    "I know this is a required class and it is a super important topic to understanding the field at all, but the teaching is really frustrating. You should take an intro stats class first.",
    "AVOID KORTUM. He is BY FAR the worst professor that I have ever had in my four years Yale, and I've had some pretty bad professors. He is absolutely awful at teaching and in general at being a professor. I honestly pity the econ majors that have him as their DUS. The instruction was TERRIBLE. Quizzes, PSETS, etc. were posted late, there was minimal information about the group project (and what was given to us was given late). Solutions to PSETs and online quizzes weren't posted up until 4 days before the final. There are still things that aren't updated, and I'm writing this AFTER the final. That is absolutely unacceptable. And who are you supposed to complain to? The DUS? Well guess what the Kortum IS the DUS. Wow. I'm absolutely shocked that a REQUIRED econ class would be this poorly taught and this disorganized. He taught me absolutely nothing. Not a single person I've talked to in this class thinks he's a good professor or that this class was well taught If you have to take this class take it with someone else. The material is actually useful. I took it because a friend said the material is actually useful. Just do NOT take it with Kortum. I can say no good things about his teaching. This is coming from someone who usually doesn't write course evaluations. He was so bad that I feel like if I don't write one, I'm doing a horrible disservice to everyone who is shopping this class. If you can't tell I'm livid. I learned nothing from Kortum and I have no qualms blaming a bad grade on his horrible teaching. Kortum should NEVER teach this class and if this class is any reflection of his abilities to be a DUS he shouldn't be that either.",
    "Do not take it with Samuel Kortum. Take it with Douglas McKee.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to for the major.",
    "Definitely don't take this course with Kortum (worst teaching experience of my life), and only take this course in general if you absolutely have to. EPE majors have other options.",
    "Only take this class if you need it for the major. It is difficult if you have never taken stats before.",
    "You probably have to take it - definitely the most applicable out of the econ core, but it's a lot of material, especially for someone who hasn't seen stats before. Professor Kortum is not the most engaging lecturer and did not always keep up with administrative stuff (posting psets\/quizzes\/solutions, making us get clickers but never setting that up, etc.); however, as a first-time instructor of this class, he obviously did his homework and answered questions effectively, offering a blend of intuition, algebra, and visuals that definitely helped me understand the material. Not as painless as it could've been (like it apparently was with Doug McKee last semester) but not pulling teeth either if you have a decent math\/stats background.",
    "If you are an economics major, this class is a requirement. If not, but you are interested in learning multivariate regression\/STATA, I would also recommend this class since the last month of the course covers multivariate regression. The problem sets and exams were difficult, so make sure to form a study group and do the practice tests.",
    "DO NOT take this class with Kortum, he is as confused as you are.",
    "Good class overall and interesting material,, but some of the concepts were a bit rushed.",
    "ECON 131 spans the various topics of econometrics, starting with statistics and then moving into regression. The first half of the semester is tough but helpful as the second half builds on the skills and applies them to real-world, interesting situations. I would recommend this class to someone in the math or econ fields.",
    "Miserable class--especially with Kortum. You will learn little beyond intro stats\/AP stats. If you have to take it, good luck...",
    "I took this to help me with future research and overall found it less helpful than I was expecting. We covered a lot of complicated material and I wish there had been more focus on practical applications. That said, you can learn a lot and it seems like Professor Kortum taught it better than some past instructors.",
    "tough course but preq so you have to take it.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class with Professor Kortum. He is clearly a nice guy who likes the subject and really wants to help students, but this course just had too many administrative and organizational issues. Expectations for the final exam and final project were very vague. For the final, problem set answers were uploaded 2 days before the exam and information about the structure of the exam the day before. Quizzes were extremely hard because the questions were so poorly phrased (The Econ tutors I asked couldn't figure them out either). This course has the potential to be interesting, if it can be made more organized with clearer expectations.",
    "Only take it if you're an econ major, and only take it if it's not with professor kortum. Obviously it's a hard course, but make your life easier if you go to class, do the problem sets, and get a tutor.",
    "Metrics is a lot of work but I honestly enjoyed it. I took it because it's required for the Econ major but I'm glad I did. I have new appreciation for how difficult it is to ask, explore, and answer questions in a quantitative and\/or empirical setting, and I enjoyed finally getting a proper introduction to statistics (which I had not taken previously). Also, if you're at all interested in econ, it's a relief to take a more quantitative approach to the theories. It's very useful to know how to work Stata, so I'm glad we learned that, and it was satisfying to work through the labs. The psets were hard but surmountable and sections were necessary. Go to lecture even though it's boring so you don't have to go through the material on your own and so the quiz questions actually work haha.",
    "Don't take it with Kortum.",
    "Absolutely, positively, DO NOT take this class if Kortum teaches it again. Wait, and take it with McKee, or, honestly, ANYONE else. I am not an Econ major, but I took ECON 131 because I was interested in econometrics and heard good things about the class. But it was by far the worst one I have taken at Yale. Let me preface this review by emphasizing that I am not one of the people who did poorly in this class, in fact, I did extremely well (I learned 90% of the material from an unassigned textbook, even though I attended all but one lecture). Every time I think about this class, I want to scream. Here's the thing: Kortum is a talented teacher. He really knows how to explain things clearly. But he was so, so LAZY. It's baffling: he used professor McKee's slides, but didn't even bother to look at them before class. Often, he was puzzled by what was on them! During lectures, he wasted about a third of each class hemming and hawing over the material that he was ostensibly teaching. Oh, and don't expect any work to be handed back to you...If you want your exam, you have to go to his office hours and specifically request it...and many of the problem sets are simply thrown out after they're gradedno accountability at all! It's exceedingly clear that since Kortum is the DUS he thinks he can do whatever he wants. I hope this review gets the attention of a higher power (if one exists) who can ensure that no Yale student has to endure such execrable teaching ever again.",
    "If you will ever take Econ 131 please check the professor who's teaching it first.",
    "This course covers probability and statistics through the first half and then covers regressions (linear, logarithmic, multivariate, etc.) in the second half. I've heard that this course was wonderful when taught by Professor McKee. Beware of this course if it is taught by Professor Kortum. Most students did not bother coming to lecture. The course itself is not bad. The material is interesting and necessary for any Econ\/EP&E major and it's generally valuable to have a basic stats background. Many students come in with AP Stats or having taken a Statistics course. This class is composed of lectures, sections where you practice using Stata, weekly quizzes, problem sets every other week, a mid-term, a final, and a low-key final group presentation. In theory this would all be pretty manageable (maybe even enjoyable) if properly taught. The teaching, of course, was horrendous. Professor Kortum came to class without having reviewed Professor McKee's slides and would literally try to figure out what they said in lecture and then attempt to summarize them in a incomprehensible way. Honestly, just reading the slides was way more helpful than listening to what Kortum said about them. Take this class another semester if he is teaching it. It's really not worth your time unless you have to take it this semester and are totally comfortable self-studying. A few pointers: (1) You don't need the textbook. It's useless. Don't waste your money. (2) Get a partner for the quizzes because you get 2 tries, so you guys can work together and have more attempts at getting a higher score.",
    "Don't take unless you like stats or need it for a major.",
    "Average econ lecture. Not very interactive, long psets, if you have the choice, don't take it with Kortum. On a better note, the grade distribution is great, you have many opportunities to make up for bad grades, and the curve helps too. It's a challenging course, but not impossible.",
    "It's a course that shows you how to use some stat tools without much rigor or mathematical proof. If you care about the math side at all and aren't just taking it as a requirement you should consider taking 135 instead.",
    "Good introductory course. Be prepared for a lot of self-learning.",
    "Econ 131 is a very challenging class because there are not many resources available for you. Many students take it with a leg up having already taken AP stats, etc. My best advice would be to find a good study group to complete problem sets together and study for exams.",
    "Econ 131 was a summary of how to analyze and look at economic data, and by the end of the course I felt that I had a decent grip on these topics. However, that was not thanks at all to the professors or the teaching assistants of the course. Everything that I learned I had to teach myself, despite attending every single lecture and multiple office hours.",
    "Really hard course and it is really hard to self study. People who have experience with STATA have a clear advantage.",
    "Only if you are an ECON major.",
    "While the course, for an economics major, is one for which there's no choice but to take it, this course on the whole could have been stronger. The instructor, while well-meaning and definitely knowledgable and approachable, seemed rather disorganized, and spent a great deal of time doing derivations or Stata commands that were difficult to follow. It did not feel as if the lectures were particularly useful, and indeed, the lecture slides tended to be very informative, making attendance not particularly worthwhile. TA quality was rather inconsistent and usually not very good. The online quizzes for the course were quite difficult. Problem sets were not too unreasonable, but required you to make sure that you stayed current with material. Tests (midterm and final) were of moderate difficulty, but the curve does not appear as generous as other economics classes. Do make an attempt to go to lab with this class (I feel that Stata is probably the most important thing you'll get out of the course), if only to not have to do it for the pset (which often features questions from lab). TAs will be of varying help then, though. Also, do start the project early (it's not something that can be done last minute), but I would say that it's a rewarding aspect of the course.",
    "Solid intro to the course without being too difficult. The workload was varied and somewhat cumbersome (weekly quizzes and problem sets + two exams + final project). There's a bit of emphasis on theory\/broad concepts, so just knowing the math behind the theories isn't enough (especially for exams). Also, going to lab (instead of section each week, there's non-mandatory labs where you work with STATA) is helpful both for the second half of class in general and for the group project.",
    "This class is a cursory glance over basic statistics and probability. Don't take it if you want to understand statistics and probability, but do take it if all you want to know is how to do a regression statistical analysis for a thesis.",
    "Take it if you have to for econ or want a more advanced stats class. If you want a basic understanding just take stats. If you want a calm QR its not this one.",
    "Not an extremely interesting course, and varies a lot every semester. Definitely look out for who is teaching it.",
    "This class was not as difficult as Professor Kortum made it out to be. If there were a different instructor there is no reason why you should not do it well. However, do not take this if Prof. Kortum teaches it, you will be very frustrated and it will give you headaches.",
    "This course teaches useful tools for statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing and regression. It also teaches the statistical software Stata. I would recommend this course to any student interested in economics.",
    "The class is not as challenging as it needs to be, however, I would recommend taking a stat course or Applied Quanitative Analysis as the teaching style did not lend itself to comprehending the material fully.",
    "I would recommend it because Econometrics is very useful!",
    "This was by far one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. The class was poorly taught and was unstructured. Section did not cover any of the material from the class and focused on work on Stata which although prepared us for the final project did not help us solidify any of the pre-midterm material or offer us much help on the problem sets. The problem sets were extremely long and very difficult to solve. Take it only if you have to.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class with the other professor, frankly, any other professor than Kortum. He is a kind person and very knowledgable but in his own words, \"my son tells me that I am really bad at explaining information to him.\" This too applies to his econometrics lectures."
