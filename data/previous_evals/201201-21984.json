    "You start with lines, go on to cubes, circles , shapes, portraits and done:)",
    "I would not recommend this class if you don't have an existing passion for art. It may say basic, but the majority of students in the class have a background in drawing.",
    "Take this class! It's really not intense, you do most of the drawing in class, and it's a lot of fun (especially when you get to the end where you do a lot of different things with gesso and ink and portraits and markmaking).",
    "A solid class. It was a pretty small class, we used a lot of materials, and learned a lot of techniques. That said, it would have been more helpful to have some more demos. Will is a nice guy who will give you sound advice to improve your drawing when asked.",
    "If you want to improve your drawing skills, it's a good class to take. You practice a lot so you will definitely improve. If you already draw well, it may be a boring class because it's very technical and there is little room for originality and creativity. It's not a difficult class, grading is easy, but it does take some time.",
    "It's a great course! No matter your skill level, you're guaranteed to improve. The class is very structured and goes from very simple forms to drawing portraits at the end. There isn't a whole lot of room to get creative until the portraits come along, but you do have weekly sketchbook assignments, which can be drawings of whatever you'd like.",
    "This class deffinetely helped my drawing abilities. I really couldn't draw before, and while I'm still not great, I can",
    "I definitely recommend this to another student, whether or not you have a lot of drawing experience or not! You will improve no matter what and will enjoy it at as well!! It has the perfect amount of work too!",
    "I would recommend it. Everyone should take an art class at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in drawing. The class should be interesting or non-majors as well as majors."
