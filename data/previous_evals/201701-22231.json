    "I learned a lot about remote sensing, the physics of light and observation, and different techniques to study Earth from space.",
    "Acquired familiarity with ESRI geospatial software, and gained familiarity with the potential applications of remote sensing for data analysis about the environment.",
    "I learned a great deal about the physics and technological processes behind remote sensing. I found this component of the course very intellectually stimulating. Less exciting, but very useful, was learning to actually use remote sensing. To this end, labs were effective."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful teaching, complementary labs to lecture material!",
    "Excellent course that doesn't assume too much scientific background but gets into some fairly technical material quite quickly! Wasn't sure how necessary buying the textbook was.",
    "This course was well organized and well taught throughout, and interesting and engaging at least until the midterm. After that, the lectures on more specific techniques and applications of remote sensing did not cohere enough to engage someone like me, who is not particularly interested in pursuing remote sensing further. I recognize the value of these latter half lectures, and most of them certainly were interesting, but it could have been nice to delve more deeply into the concepts we had been learning about earlier."

    "A wonderful course with caring and generous teachers. Professor Lee is a really clear and smart professor, and lectures are really fascinating. You will never be bored! Larry, who runs the computer lab, is super knowledgable and very generous with his time. Remote sensing is a super cool tool that can be used to study all sorts of things, from urbanization to climate change to biodiversity. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",
    "Xuhui Lee is an enthusiastic and caring instructor, so I would recommend any class that he teaches! As a non-environmental studies major, I really enjoyed the chance to dive deeply into the questions and methods that can be used to analyze the world around us. The hands-on lab portion is challenging, but ultimately quite fun and really important for contributing to your ownership of the material (at least compared to other labs I've taken where the lab just felt like a necessary evil, I looked forward to each lab every week). Shoutout to Larry Bonneau (who manages the earth observation lab) for his invaluable assistance with labs + final projects + great sense of humor when helping people navigate the mysteries of ESRI software.",
    "I learned a lot about a field that has great impacts on our world. The lectures were engaging and well organized, and the labs were useful. Being someone who's not particularly interested in this field, I found it difficult to stay motivated during the second half of the course. But overall, it was an enjoyable, useful experience."
