    "I would recommend the course to a student who is willing to dedicate time to being in the studio.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you want to learn about painting more deeply than you have in the past, establish your individual practice and receive criticism from one of the most crucial voices in the art world right now. There is no better class in the art department that will prepare you for what it is truly like to be an artist, and no other professor that can give criticism like Storr does.",
    "Art 430 01 is a great class to break away from your normal schedule of work and focus on personal studio work. It's a great class to learn and experiment in. I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "This class is basically open studio time for you to craft your practice and hone in on what you want to say and how you want to say it. You put in as much work as a you want to, though the more work you put in, the better your art will be (probably)."
