    "The course provided great tools for approaching ancient texts from a sociological standpoint. I left the course with more questions for my continued studies.",
    "This course brought the text itself to the forefront. Both abstract frameworks and textual data were covered, but the fleshing out of individual passages helped remind me of the vitality of the text itself."
