   "comments": [
    "The class is not too much work, but it is very rewarding. If you are looking to expand your understanding of Christianity in a historical context, this is a great class. Prof. Martin is an engaging lecturer and the TAs were great.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone who wants to read the New Testament with an eye for the intentions of each book's author. You learn a great deal about the history of the Mediterranean around during and after the life of Christ and be able to put each writer's message in its literary, historical, and sociological context.",
    "highly recommend",
    "RLST 152 is fun and there is a great lecturer, but it is certainly not an easy A. I am not a procrastinator, so taking a class in which you are exposed to the material for your essay (due on Friday) during lecture on Monday and Wednesday of the same were was a little unnerving for me.If you work really hard and come up with original ideas you can get an A. I worked hard on one of my papers and got an A after getting a B on the first one that I didn't do so great on. Be aware that you'll have to put effort into the essays. Besides those, the course was low-key and very interesting. I'd take it again. Its a great Hu, credit too!",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend Introduction to New Testament History and Literature for any student - even those without a religious background (perhaps even especially non-Christian students). Most of the students that end up taking this course care about the topic and are very prepared, which leads to great discussion sections and more in-depth lectures. Prof. Martin is undoubtedly one of Yale's best professors, and students should not miss the opportunity to take one of his classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Don't be scared away from it if you haven't read the Bible. I hadn't, and I really gained a lot from the course. There are a myriad of personal reasons for taking this course; no matter what yours are, you won't be disappointed.",
    "It's a historical class, first of all. Everyone asks me if I'm religious, or if it gets tense because people are speaking about their religious views, or if it's a lit class: IT'S NOT. Professor Martin makes clear form the get-go that this class has nothing to do with his own views, and it shouldn't have to do with ours. It's a historical analysis of early Christianity, as understood through the Bible as a historical document.I would recommend it.",
    "I took it credit d and got a decent amount out of it",
    "If you want to see what the New Testament actually says, without reference to stereotypes or hearsay (except as a sociohistorical reference point), then take this class. It treats the New Testament as a document written by many authors and explores how those authors have interacted to create the document that exists and the one that might have, had other authors been chosen for inclusion. For devout Christians, do not expect us to consider this text sacred; for non-Christians like myself, try and read the textbook to get better background knowledge about the basics of the texts, because Prof Martin tends to delve into deep analysis without always giving succinct summaries. Prof Martin is high-energy, and he convinces you that this study is as fascinating and important as he finds it.",
    "Intro to the New Testament is a great class: the material is interesting, the workload is very manageable (maybe less then most Yale classes), and Prof. Martin and the TFs are great. Students just need to understand that the classes is a historical critic of the New Testament, and doesn't really go into theological discussions at all. That being said, Prof. Martin said he was thinking about overhauling the class, so I'm not sure what it will be like in the future. I'd definitely recommend it as a great fifth class.",
    "Having no prior knowledge of the New Testament, I really enjoyed this course. The NT is a really complicated work, and looking at it through a historical perspective helps clarify many aspects of the text. Professor Martin is good, it's only 3 papers (two 6 pagers and one 8 pager), the reading is moderate (but it's reading the NT! So if you are taking the course you should want to read it obviously) - so take it!",
    "Fun class with captivating lectures. Dale Martin is great. Workload wasn't too bad; take credit\/d if you want it to be even easier. Buy the textbook - it'll make paper-writing a breeze.",
    "Very informtive course, take it",
    "RLST 152 is definitely worth taking. The workload is not overwhelming: about 6 hours of reading a week (maximum) and three papers. The papers are graded fairly, although a lot is expected from you. But with all that said, as someone with zero background in the New Testament, it was an incredibly fascinating class, and I often found myself debating the texts with my Christian suitmates. My one word of advice is that this is a New Testament class, not a class on modern (or even circa 300 C.E.) Christianity. Although they may seem like the same thing, as this class will teach you, they are quite different.",
    "I'd definitely recommend Intro to the New Testament to really anyone at Yale. Professor Martin is not to be missed, and his lectures will get you thinking whether you are religious or not. He is a master in his field and an exceptional lecturer. Take this class!",
    "Strengths: This course guided me through reading the New Testament and made me see how rich it is. This course demonstrated the historical critical method. The workload was just right; the essay topics were engaging. The course answered many questions I had about Christianity. This course refined my understanding of what Christianity is. Professor Martin is an engaging lecturer and a kind teacher.Weaknesses: Without getting other perspectives on the material presented in the course, the course could disturb one's faith in a negative way. For me, I wouldn't say the course strengthened or diminished my faith: I think the course clarified it.",
    "I'm not a religion person at all, but this class was completely engaging and very accessible. It is an intro lecture, but the best intro lecture I've ever taken. Dale Martin is an amazing storyteller. Expect to approach the New Testament from a historical angle (as opposed to literary or theological)."
