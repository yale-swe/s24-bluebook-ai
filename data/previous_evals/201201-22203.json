    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "I would recommend 120 to someone who has already taken multivariable in high school, or just really enjoys learning math (find a good instructor! or it won't be worth it!)",
    "If you're reading this evaluation, then you probably need to take this course at some point. Take it as soon as you can would be my recommendation. It's slightly easier than 115, and if you get a good TA (Like Gennaro Di Brino), you may actually UNDERSTAND some of what calculus is about, which makes it a lot easier to do those surface integrals!",
    "Math 120 is a decent math class. It is not incredibly interesting, but fine if you like math. Don't take it if you aren't a math person.",
    "Math 120 is a good introduction to multivariable calculus. If you've taken AP BC Calculus in high school, and performed fairly well, this course is the next natural step. There are weekly problem sets, but 90% of the grade is comprised of the 2 midterms and the final exam, so like other math courses at Yale, your grade ultimately is decided by these few tests. Overall, I would recommend math 120 to anyone looking to progress beyond BC Calc- Math 120 was not overly demanding or impossible."
