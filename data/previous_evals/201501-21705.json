   "comments": [
    "Don't be afraid of organic chemistry and take the class (especially if Tim is the professor!). You will learn a lot but in a non-stressful environment.",
    "I would recommend the class I guess, for most it is a pre-req, I just would say be careful about the flipped classroom which made it difficult to learn such a difficult topic.",
    "Yes, definitely. Don't let this course intimidate you. Work hard and you will do well!",
    "I would tell a fellow student that if they are not pre-med and they are thinking of taking a science course that they should take the inverted ORGO 220 class with Tim. They will really enjoy it and they won't count it as a waste of time because they will learn a lot.",
    "The class moves quickly and expects you to develop a level of intuition concerning reactions and chemical concepts that you probably have not been asked to develop before. That process takes a lot of practice, but the end result of being able to make the pieces come together in practical application makes the work worthwhile.",
    "Very fair course. If the flipped classroom format works for you, take this one.",
    "CHEM 220 is a class where you really need to put in the work to get a good grade. Trying to skate by will not get you there. The course quickly dives into difficult material and ends on a particularly difficult note with organic synthesis, of which Tim is quite fond. This course was taught in the \"flip classroom\" style, which I hated. Much of the learning takes place outside of the classroom, there are practice problems due every class (sometimes quite a few) as well as p-sets due generally once a week. The tests are very difficult but usually fair. I'd recommend it, but realize that it's a big investment of your time.",
    "It's not easy and I don't think it helped that the professor was teaching undergrads for the first time. I'm sure it will be better next year though but if active learning is not your thing, don't try it.",
    "Chem 220 with Tim Newhouse was probably the best iteration of organic chemistry I could have taken. Tim is a great professor who genuinely wants his students to learn, understand, and enjoy organic chemistry even though orgo is not a class many people take out of pure enjoyment. He was understanding and willing to go above and beyond for his students, always staying after class to answer questions and leading several review sessions and study hall sessions before exams. He wanted people to forget about grades for a second and actually learn about organic chemistry, and he made it easier than many classes to try and forget about grades with plenty of opportunities for bonus and extra credit. Tim is a wonderful person and you will appreciate the heart he puts into teaching.",
    "Chances are, future CHEM 220s won't be taught in this active learning format. However, I really enjoyed the class. We actually learned more about synthesis than Freshman Orgo did first semester. The workload wasn't bad, but a lot of time had to be dedicated to practicing the material before exams.",
    "Hard but necessary for premed requirements.",
    "Good intro class to learn intro organic chemistry! Workload and material manageable.",
    "While Organic Chemistry isn't in itself an enjoyable class, the flipped classroom made the experience much more tolerable. If you have to take orgo, try to take it with Tim Newhouse in the flipped classroom. You have to stay on top of work with day to day assignments and readings, but it makes test preparation that much easier. Also, buy a model kit and actually use it--it helps more than you think it will.",
    "GREAT way to learn organic chemistry for the first time. Many people dread taking organic chemistry, but the flipped classroom with Tim was great. Learned a lot and it made a lecture style course much more personal with the table \"families\" you form with your classmates.",
    "10\/10 would recommend with Newhouse. It was really well taught and although it may seem like a lot of work, it is definitely manageable and actually helpful.",
    "Orgo is orgo, and no one can change the content. However, Tim Newhouse in the TEAL classroom did a phenomenal job of making it as painless as possible, and enjoyable to learn. I won't even try to lie here, organic chemistry is hard, and requires lots of study. Should one put in the work, seek lots of help, and really prepare thoroughly for examinations, the class is very manageable!",
    "Important and enjoyable material. It will make you think, and can be very rigorous. If you want to do a good job expect to put in a lot of time. I would not take this class if it is flipped -- you do all the learning on your own.",
    "You go to class and go over what you read then you take quizzes.",
    "Tim is not teaching the course next semester so I don't know how useful a review would be - it was interesting learning orgo in the TEAL environment and Tim definitely made it less scary and more approachable.",
    "Challenging class, but doable if you spend a lot of time reviewing the textbook on your own. Our class was taught in the flipped-classroom style, which I didn't like as much, but I still was able to learn most information. With this style, most of the learning is on your own, which is much more difficult.",
    "Chem 220 covered a lot of material, and there was a significant amount of homework for this class. However, I thought the subject of organic chemistry was interesting, and this class is definitely manageable if you are willing to put in the time and effort.",
    "Chem 220 was a great course. Our class was taught in an active learning style which, although it made it more work outside of the classroom, made me feel as though I truly learned the material. Tim was also an amazing professor. Overall, the learning environment was great and I feel as though I actually understand organic chemistry!",
    "YES. Do not be scared by orgo - you just need a positive mindset going in that you're going to learn how beautiful this world is through chemistry.",
    "Take this class only if it's for your major\/pre-med. If you can, take this class with Newhouse in TEAL. The interactive learning is actually helpful!",
    "Premed: do it. Bio or chem major: do it. For fun\/science credit?: Mayr if you really like organic chemistry",
    "Taking this class in the flipped version was amazing! Lecture was rarely boring, as we were doing problems most of the time. Tim is an amazing professor, and I totally recommend him!",
    "Would recommend if it is a requirement and if the subject genuinely interests you. The class is not worth it for somebody who may just want to take a random science class. It takes up a lot of time and is difficult. It's not for people who don't have a strong background in chemistry.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Make sure to take the lecture instead of the twisted, group work set up. The flipped set up makes it really hard to get the most from class. I think it also places students with not a particularly strong background in chem (besides college level gen chem) at a huge disadvantage (especially so for first generation students!). The class online assignments and preclasses were at times ridiculously difficult and took disproportionate amounts of time without necessary improving learning. Paper psets would have definitely helped reinforce the material much more.",
    "Taught in the flipped classroom, Chem 220 was sometimes extremely frustrating. Material was rarely covered in lecture in the beginning of the semester, though this got better as the course went on. The idea of doing problems in groups seems beneficial, but would probably have worked better with a nicer balance between teaching and practicing.",
    "Difficult class of course, but the flipped classroom environment and professor made it enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who do not like lecture-styled courses. I also think the material moves a bit fast for students but there are always resources available to get the extra help. The concepts are interesting, a bit difficult, and apply to the real world!",
    "Definitely a tremendous amount of work, and the material itself is not easy to understand. It is a serious commitment, though the professor and TF's work hard to help us through it.",
    "So much better than I thought it would be. I would take this class again in a heartbeat-- with Tim!",
    "This was a decent course. It was a very large time commitment though. There was a lot of work due for each class day. For a requirement, it was fine.",
    "I think orgo is a very rewarding class even though it's hard-I struggled a lot, but I can say that I also really liked it.",
    "CHEM 220 is a solid course, although the active learning format may not be for everyone. The active learning format may be off-putting because you mainly read the textbook and have to learn from there, while in class it is mostly practice. Furthermore, the online homework may be a bit jarring since the exams are handwritten. However, CHEM 220 does provide a reasonable basis for organic chemistry.",
    "The course was informative and well-taught. I would definitely recommend it to another student. It was nice to be exposed to difficult problems right when we were learning the material. I encourage other professors to try to do the same even if their courses are lecture based.",
    "It's not like any other science course, it's not about memorization, it's about understanding the larger trends of essential life chemistry and if you get bogged down in every single specific then the class is overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if he\/she can take it with Tim.",
    "Take it with the flipped class. Study hard. Take it with Tim. Only take it if you are pre-med. Read the text book.",
    "Chem 220 is a required course for many majors, but it is also a great class to take if interested in the overlap between biology and chemistry. I took the class even though it is not required for my major and I am not pre-med, but I felt like it provided a really solid base for the biological sciences which is helpful for almost any major. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Chem 220 was a good class that was ruined by inexperience and inadequate use of the flipped classroom aspect. Early classes would see you do one problem at the table by the time the class was over, and the material not covered in class had to be made up for on your own. As the semester went on, this pacing issue was alleviated but not completely fixed. However, there were some benefits to the technology, which included a program called Sapling that was very helpful for me to learn about concepts in the class. In addition, there were weekly resources that were available and quite extensive, and the professor, Tim, was quite lenient in grading, with 50% of your grade based on problem sets and pre classes that were relatively easy to do well on. Overall, I think that this class will improve, and I would recommend taking it to another student.",
    "CHEM 220 with the \"Flipped Classroom\" approach is an awesome way to learn organic chemistry if you actually want to learn it. I'm not sure how the experience compares to a traditional lecture course if you're only in it for the credit or to meet requirements, because it is very participatory and interactive. There are online homework assignments before almost every class, but many of them are graded just on completion, and the are good primers for the material you'll cover in class. There are three midterms and a final, but you get to drop one midterm (along with several homework assignments) so you can afford to have a bad day and not flunk the course. Overall I would recommend this course to another student for sure. It's collaborative and at the very least it's a great way to spend some of your hours in class actually working with other students while you learn.",
    "A challenging but intriguing course. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in chemistry.",
    "The course was taught in TEAL, using an interactive way of teaching. It involved a lot of problem solving in class. I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing or has to take Orgo 1.",
    "Learning new, bizarre chemical reactions. And then becoming so familiar with them that you know every little detail about their mechanics and can use the details you've learned to synthesize new products, in new derived reactions. Yes, I would recommend Organic Chemistry.",
    "This class was definitely not as difficult as I thought it would be because it was a new approach to the material. I actually enjoyed Chem 220 and would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend it if they are interested in studying chemistry further. I don't think organic chemistry is something that students would voluntarily take on a whim, but this class was pretty well taught.",
    "I took this class because I was interested in chemistry not because I would necessarily use it for my major (I know, weird). This is not a class for the light of heart and if you don't truly know you want to do something with it (or that requires it), it will be difficult for you to find the motivation to put the requisite work in.",
    "It's orgo. You probably have to take it. It could be worse."
