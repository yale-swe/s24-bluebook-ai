At times the course felt more like rehearsal than acting class, and I could focus less on students putting up scenes and more on developing the theory and technique behind acting that is grappled with early in the semester."

This class grapples less with acting technique than other courses I've taken and feels at times more like a rehearsal space than an acting class.",
