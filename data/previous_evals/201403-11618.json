   "comments": [
    "the topics are interseting but the lectures were slow and long, hard to pay attention. it would help a LOT if the slides were in front of us before class so we could take notes on them during class. it'd make it a lot harder to lose focus.",
    "Very useful class in terms of understanding how to conduct and write up a systematic review and meta-analysis. This was a lot of work, but very applicable for an academic career. I think it was a bit much to learn the Revman software at the same time as trying to conduct our search. Plenty of resources were provided, but I think it might have been helpful to have a lab to go over Revman visually together and trouble-shoot any problems.",
    "I hope the instructors can take some time to go through how to use RevMan in class, especially for the students who are not doing conventional intervention reviews.",
    "This course provides students with the opportunity to write a systematic review\/meta analysis of a topic of their choosing. Lectures are helpful in going over different study designs and challenges in evidence based health.",
    "Its a basic course and anyone who is intersted in evidence based medicine should take it.",
    "I learnt a lot from the course. The class size was way too much for one instructor to give feedback to each student. I liked all the course reserves and reference materials.",
    "Although using Revman and conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis was a good experience, I thought that the class could've spent more time on learning how to use Revman and how to address certain issues that may arise when conducting a systematic review. I felt a little lost when I was conducting my review. Instead, I would suggest having multiple deadlines throughout the semester for each section of the systematic review, so that it could be more of a step by step process. And we can also receive regular feedback for our review as the course progresses. I would also have liked to see presentations so that people have the opportunity to hear our peers' topics and their results. I also didn't view the discussions to be very useful.",
    "I felt that both the class and our Thursday sessions were not helpful and the time could've been used more efficiently towards working on our actual paper. Using the software was pretty much self taught since Dr.Bracken told us to use YouTube and send us the manual.",
    "Good. Can be better structured to guide students through the systematic review step by step.",
    "Great course, great instructor! I really liked the structure of the course; first we discussed the basics of why it is necessary to systematically review the evidence of a particular health or biomedical topic, then we discussed all the different types of studies and how to actually go about conducting a review and meta-analysis. I liked learning how to use and navigate the software RevMan, but I think it would have been helpful if we went over in class how to perform certain tasks in RevMan rather than have us learn on our own (or via YouTube).",
    "Area needing improvement: Since the core focus of the course is to teach students systematic reviews and meta-analysis, I think the course should be entirely designed around the acquisition of this skill.",
    "The main overall strength is that the course include special epidemiological techniques (meta-analysis); however, the two main weaknesses are that there was a lot of readings and that many of the lecture topics overlapped with several classes."

    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0very nice.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is very helpful in keeping up to date with students' progress on their systematic reviews. He is extremely knowledgeable about the topics covered in course, and was wonderful to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Wonderful charming and extremely intelligent professor. Sad to see him go, but hope he has an amazing retirement!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr Bracken was very responsive, and happy to answer questions in email, or make arrangements to meet in person.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Great teacher and mentor, v helpful",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0I liked all the lectures from him. The ways he was using audiovisual materials were wonderful. The weekly interactive discussions on different kinds of articles were one of the moments I was longing for every week. Great!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Very responsive to students when we have questions",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0His teaching style is interesting. Doesn't read drafts if it isn't the final assignment, however, will meet with you to try to help out.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Good!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is awesome. He is one of THE top experts on this topic, and it really shows in how he lectures. The lecture slides were very informative, and I'm sure I will be referring back to them in the future. He was such a pleasure to work with and I learned a great amount. I'm so lucky I got to take his class!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0I can easily speak to Professor Bracken's attentiveness to and responsiveness to students. In addition to class time, he was always willing to commit private hours to guide and mentor his students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0He is an excellent professor. He completely dominates the topic and was always willing to help and advise students."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would recommend this course for anyone going into academia or a research career; it is extremely valuable. The workload is very heavy, though, so be aware of that when deciding how your whole schedule will look.",
    "I would not recommend it if someone is not doing a conventional intervention review.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to others.",
    "This course is less about learning facts on review techniques and more about exploring the tools available to facilitate systematic reviews. Being familiar with the principles of a systematic review before taking this class is very helpful, as was the advice given to me -- start your final project early!!!",
    "I would recommend as it tecahes u the basics of doing a review",
    "The course is very important for students who would like to make research as their future career. The course can arm students with tool which can enable them to identify \"good\" Vs. \"bad\" articles. Reviewing different articles gets easier if students take this course. For clinicians, it can help them give critiques on different literatures and help them identify those who have relevance with their everyday medical practice.",
    "There wasn't very much weekly work, but the review itself required a lot of time towards the end of the semester. If you can, I would start early and try to receive feedback from the professor as soon as you can because a lot of issues can come up when you conduct your review and metaanalysis. I still thought that the experience of conducting a systematic review and using Revman was rewarding, and is something you can mention on your resume.",
    "This is a course with potential. The structure needs to revamped to better understand the skills were gaining. Also, only using the Cochrane Collaboration isn't really representing all of the systematic review formats and it's not a user friendly interface.",
    "Recommend it",
    "This is an excellent course that should be necessary for any public health student. Being able to read studies and reviews with a critical eye and assess the available evidence on a particular subject is a skill set that I am grateful to have acquired. Your grade is basically based upon the submitted protocol and review that you work on throughout the entire semester, so just make sure to stay on track and not wait until the last minute! The review is definitely a lot of work but it was such good experience and practice writing it.",
    "Summary: The course imbues students with a skeptical mind and this is all the more important given the flood of information in society today and the potential to get drowned in it. The course also teaches specific skills, namely systematic reviews and meta-analysis. I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "This course covers the majority of the epidemiology topics covered in other epidemiology courses and deepens special epidemiological techniques (meta-analysis). Its workload is very demanding."
