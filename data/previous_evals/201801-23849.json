   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: very helpful professor and TFs weaknesses: grading was very detail-oriented and picky",
    "Great course.",
    "I enjoyed the content of the course and the professor himself, but the grading scheme was quite confusing. I prefer a grading system where I don't have to have a conversation with my TF\/classmates\/professor to understand how well I actually did.",
    "Great! I liked how practical the class is. However, I don't think that the course needs to be 1 hr 50 min. Much of the material that we covered could have been reviewed at a faster pace.",
    "Strength - leave the coursework with proficiency in SAS coding",
    "I really learned SAS. Mayur is an excellent instructor.",
    "The course is strong in teaching SAS fundamentals and it overlaps nicely with Epi I\/II. The course could go even further and teach more advanced epi concepts. Some of the coding was already covered in Epi II, so the class was redundant at points.",
    "I think this class was overall a great way to learn SAS and basic analysis techniques. I feel like I will use a lot of what was covered in class in my future either with my thesis or other work. My suggestion would be to maybe structure the labs differently. I feel like I would come to lab to get the code and then have to go and teach myself afterwards. I don't really know how to improve upon this going forward. Maybe labs should be more independent work and the TF is there to help you as you go along with the problem? I feel like in the lab there would be one person who would take charge and move the code along but if you were slower or needed more time to think you would be left behind. If you could work independently with the TF there for help you could work more at your own pace and really grasp the work more.",
    "Great class. Learn a lot about coding in SAS and even clarified a lot of topics from EPI I that were not clearly taught. Only complaint is that TF teaching and grading is not consistent. Despite Mayur's expectations, some TFs gave their students the code (they consistently finished lab in 15-20 minutes) and were very lenient graders, while other TFs taught the whole 50 minutes and were harsh graders. In the future, this should be more standardized.",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot. It's required for most of us, but I'll be applying these skills not only within YSPH, but also throughout my future career as a data analyst. Weaknesses: Material can be tricky for students without a strong biostats background, but given the core curriculum at YSPH, this shouldn't be a problem.",
    "strength: very clear instruction",
    "strengths of the course is that the skillset is very useful in applying it to conduct research; a potential weakness is the length of the lectures making it hard to focus on the content",
    "You learn a lot in this course - I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of SAS now. The two hour lecture was long, especially in the afternoon - maybe there could have been a break in the middle?",
    "Too big size id biggest drawback, TA's very restrictive on what they can and cannot help, okay for exams, but such approach not okay for learning the lab and new command for first time, should be more flexible and discussion focused, it seemed with my lab that the TA was literally counting the number of words he\/she can utter during lab.",
    "We learned a lot about SAS programming on this class, which I think is useful for statistics work in the future.",
    "I think the method of grading should be explained more clearly to students at the beginning of the course. In fact, most of us are still confusing about how our marks in lab assignments will be converted to course grade...",
    "Hard to learn this topic in lecture format. Really should focus on the lab or a flipped classroom concept",
    "It's fine. You do end up learning a lot over the semester but class time is kind of a waste--learning coding from a lecture is just totally ineffective, and the learning only actually happens in the computer lab.",
    "The final and midterm really allowed me to think critically about how to perform analyses independently. I think making the labs a little more independent (i.e. don't simply give out the code in lab) I think it could allow students to learn and be better prepared for the exams.",
    "Very clear instruction. This course demystified SAS for me!",
    "This is a tough class for those without a proper background in SAS - attend TF Office Hours!",
    "very useful and practical analytical skills. this is the first coding module that makes sense to me.",
    "This is a good class for someone (like me) who did not know much about SAS beyond what was taught in Biostats and therefore not confident in my abilities. I can know say that I am comfortable with performing the basic and necessary tasks that are commonly used in epidemiological studies. My one suggestion would be to cut the lecture time by an hour and add an hour (or so) to lab time. I feel as though I learned the most during lab but labs were often rushed to get through all of the material. Given Mayur's propensity to ramble (see below) we would have made it though the same amount of information in lecture had an hour been deducted. SAS is a very hands-on learning experience, so more time actually playing around and asking questions of the TA with it would be beneficial.",
    "Very informative, hard practical skills with plenty of time to practice them. 2 hours is a long time, definitely hard to stay focused sometimes.",
    "This course was the most helpful and practically applicable that I have ever taken. All of the material was clearly presented such that I could immediately go home and apply what I had learned to my own research. The lectures and labs were very complimentary and provided ample opportunity to clarify concepts and apply what we learned. I thoroughly enjoyed this course.",
    "I think Mayur is a good teacher and is a great help when you ask for it. I think the slides could include a little more information in regards to what is being discussed since the class moves quickly and it can be hard to keep up with notes.",
    "Learned a lot of practical skills through this course.",
    "Course was pretty good. I actually learned SAS unlike in biostats. Good professor. Lectures were long and TAs needed to teach labs better.",
    "The labs for this class were great and where much of the learning occurred. Dr. Desai was very entertaining and he was easy to pay attention to despite listening to lectures on SAS code an output, but the slides themselves were difficult to follow. During class, Dr. Desai would ask what certain output met, referring to a specific number, but it would often be difficult to find the number he was referring to by \"this number\" with his pointer while trying to take notes on what he was saying at the same time. I often missed the number he was pointing to, and then didn't have solid notes. The class could be improved by adding a slide explaining key points of the output, which some lectures lacked. I understand the importance of attending class to take notes on what isn't on the slides, but trying to quickly locate numbers in output that you do not yet understand while taking notes can be difficult and could be improved. I did not get much out of the lecture portion of the class for this reason. Although that aspect of the class could be improved, I learned so much from the labs. If you want to learn SAS, definitely take this class to set a good foundation.",
    "Strength: Taught the basics of running statistical analyses on SAS Weakness: The grading on labs was oftentimes very difficult, I didn't really even know what we were being evaluated on in the responses because something would always be wrong, even after correcting the mistakes from previous labs. The midterm\/final had several portions that were a bit unclear, but asking questions was not technically discouraged by the professor but I felt that it was. Cheating on the midterm was also rampant, which caused the grading distribution to become incredibly harsh (i.e. one mistake would cause you to miss out on honors). I was aware of several incidents where students would talk about the take home exam even though it was explicitly banned, yet the only deterrent was a strongly worded email. I believe that choosing to condone this behavior undermines the very ethics that are taught in this school and think that in the future more should be done to prevent a situation where you are put at a disadvantage for being honest.",
    "Really useful for learning SAS, will be instrumental in writing my thesis next year",
    "Strengths: - This course really honed my command over SAS. - Applying SAS to data analysis complemented the other YSPH courses well, and became invaluable to me for the work I conducted on my thesis. - Professor was engaging. - Labs were interactive and helped a lot in applying what was learned in lecture. Weaknesses: - While I felt I had internalized a lot of the concepts\/codes used to find unadjusted analyses, I wish there had been more time spent on linear and logistic regression lectures, which did feel a little rushed to me. Otherwise, there weren't any notable weaknesses.",
    "I actually feel confident in my SAS abilities after taking this course, which has been a clear upgrade over the core Biostatistics course. The course covers a comprehensive list of material, multivariate modeling being the most important in my opinion. The lab structure encourages you to think about the assignment logically and step-by-step rather than copying code from a set of slides. Additionally, there are many helpful TFs who help you through your mistakes and provide good feedback for your assignments. Admittedly, the lecture is boring at times since we go over code for nearly 2 hours. There is not much to do regarding this weakness, but small group discussions may \"liven\" up the lectures more. Overall, I learned a lot and feel like I can apply my acquired data analysis skill set to my research projects.",
    "Strengths: - Hands on learning of SAS - Mayur Desai is the best - utilized a real data set - Overall: felt like I was actually learning a valuable hard skill that I will use in the future Weaknesses: - Size of the course not as conducive to learning concepts - Extremely lecture based, and sometimes hard to see the \"big picture\" instead of just learning the coding procedures we need to finish the labs",
    "great",
    "Overall, the course was very helpful. I know a lot more about SAS now than I did before. My main recommendation is that, if feasible, the course be switched to where we spend 2 hours in lab every week and 1 hour in class. I learned so much more in lab that I did in class, and rarely drew upon my notes from class when doing the labs and tests.",
    "It was a great, great class. Honestly, I wish we had more opportunities to practice all of the PROCs we learned in class, since we only covered a small sample of it on the exam and labs.",
    "The course is excellent to let you know how to use SAS to analyze data in Epi study, it combines the conceptual knowledge and the real analysis.",
    "Good practical class through which to learn how to use SAS independently",
    "the lectures were dull at times and VERY long- might be better if the classes were shorted and 2 times a week",
    "Strengths: -The lecture and labs are complementary and aid in learning the coding -Lot of leeway for how individuals like to code Weakness: -While there is a lot to cover, it seems that some details (such as why we do things) aren't fully explained",
    "Very practical course for data analysis; focus could have been less on small details and more on overarching principles--I think we would have covered more topics this way",
    "Very useful. It is really hard to get full marks in every assignment.",
    "Useful",
    "VERY GOOD",
    "The strength is the topic of the course. Weakness is the usefulness of SAS. YSPH needs to understand the demands for other software such as R and python to help their students be competitive in the job market.",
    "The class was a really great crash course in the ins and outs and analytic basics of SAS. The only major weakness was the extreme strictness (and sometimes stylistic rather than content-focused aspects) of the grading rubric. It also would've been nice to have a set cutoff for grades on the midterm and final rather than a curve, because getting a -1 this year meant a HP whereas in previous years you could've gotten -1 and earned an H.",
    "hard to focus during long lectures, labs were good practice",
    "I learned a lot, but the lectures were definitively not helpful, and the workload was very very heavy. I was disappointed by the exams (especially the final) -- I really felt that they compromised work I had to do for other classes. I am happy to spend that amount of time working through the code, but it's really hard to do that during an exam week -- it's cannibalizing.",
    "Really helpful course in learning SAS and becoming more competent in it. Material is presented well in an organized concise manner.",
    "I found myself frustrated by SAS more often than not - it's not an intuitive platform but it appears to be pretty widely used among epidemiologists so I suppose getting the exposure was valuable. That said, I hope to never see it again.",
    "A great class to take for sure; really helped me know SAS and do basic modelings with it; helped me understand the interpret the results generated by SAS as well",
    "Overall, this class brought me from being SAS-phobic to actually knowing what I was doing in SAS. I LOVED how applied the course was; even though I am usually very diligent with course readings, this course didn't require that work and that was a relief because the labs were enough. The lectures may have been difficult for students who are not auditory learners but I didn't mind them and even appreciated how there was no break in the 2 hour course. There was a lot of subject matter to cover and I appreciated how Dr. Desai just charged through it.",
    "This is an amazing class. I learned so much and was able to use SAS in my own individual studies. I would recommend maybe changing the format to twice a week, and hour and 50 minutes is a long time.",
    "This course was useful and I learned how to use SAS. The labs were the most useful part, the lectures were not useful and very boring and could have been delivered online or by simply posting the PDFs for students to review on their own time. The helpful part of this course was actually coding and using SAS, and I think the lectures would have been much more engaging and useful if we had gone through coding examples in class with students actually coding along on their laptops instead of looking at endless slides that did not always make sense out of context (i.e. taken out of the context of the full SAS code and situation).",
    "I enjoyed the class. I found the labs to be very helpful although lectures can sometimes be dry. The heavy weighting of the final did worry me.",
    "The course is SAS-based, but we show up for a two-hour lecture to be shown PowerPoint slides documenting different codes. Professor doesn't provide enough background into why we are using what we do, nor does he take the time to go over meaningful interpretations. Seems silly to just show up and pay attention and watch him flip through slides of printed code (but I did each class - and took diligent notes). It was difficult to pay attention - a short, five-minute break would have made a ton of difference - or finding a way to have students code with the professor during class. Final was not at all fair based on what we learned and what was covered during lab sections. Similarly, it is frustrating when you abide by the honor code and work on the midterm and final solo but later learn that many other people did not - please find a way to better police other students - disappointing to find out others were not apprehended for their dishonest conduct.",
    "This course is well designed and covered all the important knowledge and skills related to epidemiology studies.",
    "This is a fantastic course for any student who plans to use SAS in the future. I wish I had taken this course sooner as so many other biostatistics courses assume a basic proficiency in SAS. I also found that this course was more helpful in clarifying key concepts in epidemiology, more so than the epi II course. I really appreciated the practical examples and found the pacing to be manageable, especially with a full course load. Finally, I really appreciated the guidance and support that both the instructor and the TA offered throughout the semester. The one weakness of this course is the grading rubric feels very extreme and opaque. Making even a single mistake seems to carry such a heavy penalty. Moreover, making the final project worth 50% of the grade created unnecessary stress. I do agree, however, that this forced me to pay more attention to my final product.",
    "Strengths: students learn a hard skill that is useful and will serve them well in the future for either their thesis or work beyond YSPH. Weakness: feedback methods for labs isn't super clear, especially with data interpretations. It was unclear what was good and what wasn't. There's a need for more examples for good interpretations of data. Another weakness was the amount of overall grade points were contributed to the midterm and final. The final was worth 50% of the entire grade for the course, which seemed too imbalanced and not necessary an accurate reflection of how students had done in the course overall.",
    "The lectures were very long, with no break in between. I would recommend structuring the lecture to have a 10 minute break at the end of the first hour. The examples given may be better off if we could go through the lecture using SAS rather than reading print out throughout the lecture. The content in the lectures were often repetitive, and could be condensed. In fact, there were 3 powerpoints during the last lecture meeting that were breezed through. The slides themselves were very dense for every lecture, and hard to focus on. There was very little engagement with the students during the lecture. Most of my understanding came from the lab sections, which were very rushed. If there was a way to cut the lecture to just an hour, with fewer examples, and have the lab sections be an hour and a half each, this would be a better way to grasp the material.",
    "Great structure and excellent instruction! A smaller class size might have made it a bit more interactive",
    "the lab helps us a lot on understanding what we leant in class and practice to use it for real situations.",
    "The class is unrealistic in its approach to teaching SAS. SAS is a language that should be taught through trial and error, not through labs where the grading is very strict and exams. This is not a productive way of teaching a class of 150 students. Improve the grading structure of this class so students don't feel like they are on the cusp of failing every time they get a lab grade back.",
    "Great intro into SAS-- I feel well-equipped going into data analysis for internship projects and more. However, I was not a fan of the grading system-- different TA's had different ideas about what \"mistakes\" deserved points to be docked off. The grading as a whole felt a bit unfair.",
    "Strengths - You really get a feel of SAS by the end! Weaknesses - I wish we had even more time with SAS!",
    "I learned a lot about SAS through this course and thought the lab sections were valuable. I did not learn much during the lecture sessions, as the teaching style used is not very interactive and often devolves into jokes or anecdotes. It was difficult to pay attention in the lecture because there was limited class involvement in a large lecture hall.",
    "Great and very useful",
    "This course is extremely helpful in analyzing data sets using SAS. A strength of the course is how we are taught in class about the code and then get to apply that in lab. A weakness of the course is how hard tests and assignments are graded. On the midterm, I missed one point due to a silly mistake and this led me to get a High Pass. I think grading could be changed a little.",
    "I had never coded before taking this class. I was nervous about the material, but Dr. Mayur and the TFs were always available to help students who needed the extra help. I would recommend this class to all YSPH students because it helps teach you how to think about managing large data sets. The skills taught in this class are invaluable to any future public health professional. This class should be taken at the same time as (or after) Epidemiology 2 in order to maximize mastery of concepts.",
    "The course is good, not obvious weakness found.",
    "AAMIE is a great course, the skills I acquired in this course have been very applicable to other courses and work.",
    "Mayur is very entertaining in class, and explains all concepts thoroughly. However, I feel that the class is somewhat lacking in organization and clarity in expectations. The lab reports are graded out of 3 points and comprise a significant portion of the final grade. However, the reports are only given full credit if flawless, so any small mistake automatically drops you down to 66%. We are not given any rubrics for lab reports or exams, so when I was deducted a full point for a stylistic choice (reporting an odds ratio in parenthesis at the end of one sentence in a summary instead of stating it in the body of a sentence), I felt that the rest of my (seemingly correct) work had essentially amounted to nothing. Speaking with other students, I feel that this perpetuates an sense that we either have to be perfect or we'll fail. At many points in the semester, I felt discouraged to put effort into the assignments because it was inevitable that my hard work would go unrecognized.",
    "Strengths: -very hands on, which is best when learning and getting used to SAS software -instructor good at explaining information, including tips and background information when using SAS -course covered basic SAS techniques useful for data analysis Weaknesses: -long class period, difficult to keep attention sometimes The long class period is difficult to improve, and I understand why the class would need to be once a week (since labs start on Tuesday, and all info needs to be presented before the lab)",
    "This course will be the most helpful to me during my summer internship. The material is very useful.",
    "-I learned how to do multiple useful operations in SAS. However, the professor encouraged a \"cookbook\" approach to SAS (his words), rather than encouraging thinking, reasoning, logic, deduction, etc. Anyone can learn to type the same series of commands repeatedly into a computer program, but actually learning how to reason your way through problems using a statistical software would be a more valuable skill. What I learned in this class will be directly useful in the near term future, but I dont think I gained long term problem-solving skills and I don't think I really needed a course to show me how to type things into SAS.",
    "The course does a great job at explaining the major concepts involved in using SAS but I would love it if the lectures were also taught in a computer lab so that students can practice code as the professor speaks like we do during lab section. It's hard to grasp concepts sometimes when you're just starting at code on a powerpoint slide."

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was fantastic because of how clear and methodical he was in his approach - never left out any details, and made sure to explain a concept in multiple ways so that everyone can digest it.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai is a very thorough and compassionate instructor. Although I didn't feel very comfortable asking questions in such a large class, I felt comfortable approaching him if I needed clarification. This was usually not necessary since he covers the material so well during lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Fantastic. Always eager to help. Supportive and goes out of his way to ensure his students do well.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0very powerful and attractive speaking skills. explain things clearly and easy to understand. address some of the student-raised questions before each class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was a good professor and willing to meet with students outside of class to smooth over any issues they had. However, my one criticism is that he spent an inordinate amount of time talking about basic housekeeping things, such as how to interact with the TA's and how cheating is bad. We were pushed a week behind schedule mid-semester because he would spend the first 30-45 minutes of class (for multiple class sections) talking about how we shouldn't talk about the midterm among ourselves when it was released. This I believe was a huge waste of everyone's time; the class could have met once a week for an hour and a half and we still would have gotten through the same amount of material.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is hilarious, understandable, approachable, and knows his stuff backwards and forwards. He made the class fun",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur made a 2 hour lecture on statistics and coding enjoyable and engaging, which is no small feat. Lectures were clearly organized and concepts set up in a consistent framework to facilitate learning throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai plans things in quite detail. I soon realized that the approach really helped me and other students. Thank you, Prof. Mayur.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He did really well. I like Mayur.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was a great lecturer. The topic of SAS code and output can be boring, but his lectures were never dry. He is pretty funny and easy to listen to. He can be a little intimidating when talking about the honor code and his expectations, but overall, you can tell he cares about the students.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0If anyone can make SAS printouts interesting, it's Mayur Desai. He is a great lecturer and makes sure to explain nuanced concepts in a practical and useful way.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths: - He really made SAS accessible. Research-driven analyses helped me relate the work from this course to what I was doing outside of it. - Lectures were engaging for me and were complemented effectively by labs. - He is very clear about expectations for the labs, midterms, and finals, which was immensely helpful for me going into these assignments. Weaknesses: - Not really a weakness of the professor, but the lab assignments included questions embedded throughout that made it difficult to keep track of what it was that we were supposed to answer. Having these bolded or separated out in some way would be really helpful for future courses.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Given that the class is rather large, there is not much room for engaging class discussion. Mayur, however, explains every detail of the slides carefully and answers questions during lecture in an effective manner. At times, I think he spends too much time explaining a concept. Explaining too much is still better than explaining too little, though. Additionally, Mayur has a good sense of humor that makes up for when the lectures seem a bit slow. He is incredibly helpful if you seek his help 1 on 1, and he encourages every student to reach out to him. His timings are flexible and he's willing to go through your code step-by-step and give you pointers on how to approach similar tasks in the future. Overall, great professor. Definitely a bright mind, and I learned a lot from him.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths: - Hilarious! - Very understanding of students' needs - Definitely knows what he's talking about, but also meets the students where they're at Weaknesses: - Can improve on increasing class participation",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0detail oriented would be better if 2 classes per week",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur overall was engaging. However, perhaps too much time was spent over-explaining parts of the actual lecture, where other important topics in lecture were gone over too quickly (such as when we were first introduced to the proc GLM statement).",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0SAS(S)MASTER",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is excellent in explaining the contents really clearly.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Overall, very clear and knowledgeable and a strong presenter. Sometimes did belabor points about grading and logistics which felt tedious. Slides could have also benefitted from more description for study purposes.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0thumbs up!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths: -Very passionate about the class",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great professor and strong lecturer; very clear and classes were always well-structured. I would suggest maybe speeding up the examples next year--classes often tended to drag on a bit.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is patient and he really cares about his students.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very good",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The professor is knowledgeable and nice but he runs this course is a police state. How are students supposed to learn if the answers are not provided? Also, why can't there be half points for the homework grading schemes?",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The professor is obviously very knowledgeable and does a great job distilling some key concepts into applied teachings each week in lecture. The only weakness is that he could be hard to reach by email, but this is minute and quite common at Yale among more senior\/tenured faculty.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dedicated and clearly explains the content",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I think the lectures should be re-formatted. I'm not sure how, but they were not helpful or especially engaging (in terms of the material). The grading of this class also should be changed: I understand the need for perfection, but I feel that the very hard work I put into labs was negated every single time because of the tiniest things. It was demoralizing. A regular 1-100 or 1-10 scale would be a much better feedback mechanism.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very knowledgeable and presents material well.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is terrific, his handle on the material is superb and he is enjoyable to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr Mayur made this class so fun to take; his lectures were always very clear and well-organized and he was always willing to answer any questions",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is at times a bit unapproachable, even though he is a very friendly and humorous person. I write that because there were several times I thought about emailing him but ultimately just went directly to my TF instead. Maybe that was just a personal preference of mine. Dr. Desai is extremely realistic in his approach to the subject matter and I very much appreciated how focused he was on teaching us actual, practical skills for the workforce. I think perhaps the first \"intro to SAS\" lectures could be condensed into one and perhaps there could be an extra session for students who desired to learn more because in reality we did not use most of the material in those lectures - even though they are\/ will be very helpful for the future.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0needs better powerpoint slides",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was a great professor. He did a great job explaining things, and helping to prepare us for labs.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur attempted to be an engaging professor, but the 2 hour class always seemed to drag on and I think his teaching and humor would have been more appreciated if he had incorporated breaks and activities into his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai was very helpful in consulting about the class but could sometimes be hard to get a hold of.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very smart and approachable, which is appreciated, but there's got to be a better way to teach the course than just reading slide after slide of computer code. Did not provide meaningful examples of interpretations, but somehow just expected us to know them off-hand for assignments. Final exam felt unfair - length-wise and material-wise.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Mayur is very responsible, responsive and knowledgeable. He is very nice to us, gave us very interesting lectures. We all had a good time taking this class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor was engaging during class and I appreciate how he made himself available to talk one-on-one after class. I found my individual sessions with him to be pleasant and helpful in clearing up misconceptions. I also appreciate how thoughtful Dr. Desai was in his responses to questions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was a great instructor! Made the material, which was often dry, entertaining and memorable. Very straightforward with students.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai was efficient and witty, but sometimes went on long rambles, making it hard to understand where his material on the slides linked back to the material he was talking about. The examples he gave were somewhat surface level.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent at explaining topics and keeping the class interesting. He provides real-world and often relatable examples to teach from. Hes very willing to help and meet with students when needed.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Mayur is a good teacher with good sense of humor. His illustrations are clear and he made use of every minutes in class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Draconian with his grading methods. Wants absolute perfection on every piece of work that is handed in for grading (one mistake and you lose a significant percentage in points). This does not create a good SAS coder and interpreter. It just makes people afraid and nit picky of their work without having gained any real skill. He makes it sound as if he is very relaxed about grades but he is actually a stickler about mistakes and punishes them harshly. Students should be allowed to go back into their past labs and fix their mistakes so they could learn, but he doesn't allow this. The course needs to be revamped with a more realistic approach to learning code rather than learning from lecture slides. Also, the students are treated like children with unnecessary rules, which is offensive and rude. We are all adults.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was great-- humorous, engaging, and knowledgeable, particularly considering how dry the content can get.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai made lecture very entertaining and was thorough in his explanations!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0This instructor seems knowledgeable about SAS and was approachable. He offered good advice and feedback about methods of analysis. However, the teaching format of the lecture sessions could be revamped to improve learning. A more hands-on approach with class interaction and less stories would have been helpful for my learning style.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent. Very humorous and interesting",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a great lecturer. He makes lectures entertaining and explains even the simplest material so that students will not be confused. A weakness is just his grading style.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Although the class was large, Dr. Mayur did a terrific job at engaging all students. During lecture he created breakout opportunities to discuss concepts aloud and he was always receptive towards questions during class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is nice and patient.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a great instructor for the AMMIE, I really enjoyed his teaching style this semester. The course might benefit from a five-minute break in the middle.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Entertaining, tries to engage students in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was a very capable instructor and his lessons were enjoyable and his tangents amusing, even despite the long class periods. He provided necessary information and reminded the class to seek clarification in order to complete the weekly labs. The labs were effective for practicing and the midterms and finals were great for practicing doing a run through of all the techniques and concepts that were covered. His notes are very helpful and I can definitely see why people still use them during their careers post-graduate school.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor's mastery of the subject content made his lectures thorough, though they were sometimes hard to engage with due to their density and quick pace. He was very approachable and helpful outside of the classroom about class material, assignments, and exams.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Not only is Dr. Desai very knowledgeable on the subject he is teaching, everytime I am about to doze off, he tells a joke and has my attention again. That is a gift. My only critique is that the slides should be more organized and have more understandable descriptions rather than just SAS output.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai was extremely organized and interested in student learning",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent instructor who is very open to meeting with students and providing them with additional support when they're having trouble understanding a lecture concept. He's very welcoming and happy to help out."

   "comments": [
    "interesting course, would recommend",
    "Great.",
    "It's a primer course on SAS with some refreshers on biostatistics. It's helpful in understanding how to make a table for publication.",
    "Yes, recommend. From what I heard about the BIS 505b course, CDE 534 is much more informative.",
    "Good skill set for people who are interested in pursuing research. Less helpful for students who do not plan to do public health research in their careers, but are required to take it regardless.",
    "Take it. It's the only course where you will actually learn SAS.",
    "The course is a really good introduction to SAS. I definitely recommend this course to introduce oneself to SAS and applied epi methods. A more advanced course must be taken to get fully comfortable with SAS and methods.",
    "If you put in the time, you will be a great SAS coder. Mayur is amazing and will give you everything you need to succeed.",
    "If you want to learn how to use SAS (especially if your thesis is quantitative), pay attention in AAMIE.",
    "definitely take! so helpful with learning SAS",
    "this is a useful course to learn how to use SAS and comes in handy for a potential thesis.",
    "I would recommend it because you build important skills - even for someone like me, who hadn't taken biostats and had no coding background. The two exams are take-home and not overly difficult, and the weekly labs are manageable (sometimes you even finish them in class).",
    "If you are interested in SAS programming which is applied in epidemiology analysis, you can learn a lot in this class. But if you simply want to learn statistics and programming on SAS, perhaps it is not a very good choice for using it.",
    "recommended, the course is not difficult, but you cannot make one careless mistake in your lab assignments, mid term and final",
    "Intermediate level stats course that focuses on SAS. Gets into the weeds of SAS and less on the stats. Wish that was flipped.",
    "It's ok. You do learn a lot but class time is a bust.",
    "Absolutely one of the most valuable courses at YSPH in terms of refining your analytical skills. This course will be one of the most transferable to a workplace in terms of SAS skills acquired.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all public health students that plan to do any data analysis. Even after 2 semesters of biostatistics with SAS instruction, this class helped me understand the program much better.",
    "A great class. Just be sure to attend office hours or you'll fall behind.",
    "this is really helpful if there is any chance that you are required to perform data analysis in the future.",
    "Good if you want to learn more about SAS but honestly you can just save yourself the time and skip lecture and learn the most through labs.",
    "This course will give you a very solid foundation to SAS; I feel confident enough to now say that I'm proficient. The slides will be useful resources to hold on to. Mayur makes it interesting and fun while still making sure you understand.",
    "This course is an introduction to the nuts and bolts of how you actually do analysis - from cleaning data through compiling tables and interpreting results. It was incredibly helpful and also enjoyable.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course to whoever wants to learn how to apply SAS for analytics.",
    "Super useful class. Actually learned what was advertised. I would take this class. Hey SBS'ers, this is the class you take. Don't take epi 2 or biostats 2, take this one.",
    "If you are interested in learning SAS, take this course! The midterm and final are labor intensive, but very fair. I had no background in SAS coming into this course, but Dr. Desai starts with the basics and moves to more complex topics that will allow you to feel confident with basic aspects of SAS.",
    "Take this course if you want to be able to actually do anything ever with SAS",
    "Highly recommend students to take this course. Skills I gained in data analysis were incredibly valuable while I was simultaneously writing up my thesis. Even though SAS can be a little daunting, Professor Desai and the teaching fellows make it so accessible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to become more competent in SAS. SAS is quite tricky, and you are unlikely to grasp it fully in the intro Biostatistics class (assuming you have no prior exposure). The midterm and final are take-home, and they cover everything you learned throughout the course. It's as close to a real-life scenario as you can get, as you are given a raw dataset and asked to perform certain analysis. You can code something any way you want, provided you arrive at the correct values. SAS remains the gold standard software package for data analysis, and the structure of this course gives you a wide knowledge of the different tools it utilizes.",
    "AAMIE will teach you how to use SAS in public health. I think it can feel like you're not learning much or that there's so much you still don't know, but by the end of the semester, if you do your own work, you'll realize how valuable this course is. Would highly recommend, especially because Mayur is so amazing and funny!",
    "I would recommend this course. My confidence in SAS has grown immensely this semester.",
    "One of the most practical things to have in your tool kit. And not a boring lecture class at all. I'm honestly impressed that Mayur was able to engage the entire class in such a funky classroom setting",
    "I would strongly recommend this course because it is really helpful to let you know how to analyze data in real Epidemiology world.",
    "A great course through which to really learn how to approach and deal with real coding scenarios in SAS. The lab portion was by far the most valuable for me. Would recommend to someone looking to learn SAS.",
    "Great class to learn the coding and application of SAS.",
    "Great course! Extremely practical....only downside is that the class was very detail-oriented. Would recommend over biostats",
    "highly recommended",
    "The Epi portion is definitely necessary and I appreciated the learning opportunity. But the emphasis on SAS and the teaching style especially the harsh grading schemes and not letting students know about the answers seem unnecessary.",
    "If you are looking to learn SAS (which is a valued skill in public health academia, consulting, and beyond), you absolutely should take -- or at least audit -- this course! You will learn the basics as well as some neat tricks forcoding analyses of various kinds: methods for generating dummy variables, linear and logistic regression types, survival analysis. The lab code you build each week is a seamless progression from the previous one, so you are unlikely to feel lost or confused. If you have questions, the TFs have many office hours each week and you can attend another section to fortify your comprehension. The programming and analytic skills you'll acquire will apply to other languages beyond SAS as well.",
    "Can be demanding, but rewarding at the end",
    "VERY useful skill, but a painful experience through and through -- just know what you're getting into. Would recommend.",
    "Great way to learn SAS, I would recommend it.",
    "The lecture content is hard to sit through - this is a much more application-based course and I didn't find that the lectures added nearly as much as the labs. This class would be far more effective if we switched the times allocated to the Lab and Lectures. It would be nice if there was an opt-out for students that are on a track or trajectory that will not have them in a position that ever requires SAS, I will likely never use this again and there were other classes I could have taken that would have been far more applicable.",
    "Definitely YES if interested in learning how to manage big datasets and to conduct basic epi analysis!!!",
    "This course is a very realistic approach to SAS and will be very beneficial to any student who desires to do research (thesis or otherwise) and\/or understand\/interpret research. It is the most useful skill I've gained thus far at YSPH and I highly recommend it.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. It's much harder than biostats 2, but I think it's worth it and teaches you so much valuable information that can be used in other classes, for your thesis and in the real world.",
    "This course will teach you how to code with SAS, and while it is time intensive and can be very frustrating it is also very useful (employers love to see SAS on a resume! And SAS is also helpful to know how to use for other courses and future life activities).",
    "This class greatly helped me with improving my skill in SAS.",
    "Required, so you've got to take it. Good skills - but you learn them during the lab sections (and not during the course itself, even though we pay enough money where not showing up would be a mistake). Wish the lectures felt more useful, wish my TA wasn't as condescending and was more approachable.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. This course helps you summarize and reinforce all the important knowledges and skills related to epidemiology studies.",
    "This is definitely a good course to take if you want to learn SAS and the time commitment is reasonable to balance with other classes. Just be careful with the strict grading system and make sure you pay attention to your final products for homework assignments as well as midterm and final projects.",
    "This course is basically a \"how to run SAS, but only in a very specific way\" course. As Professor Desai described, there are many ways to do things. If you want to know all about SAS and go into the specifics, then you may as well read a SAS manual. This course doesn't really teach stats theory either, so you may end up knowing how to run a certain test on SAS, but not when or why. However, it was an efficient way to learn specific procedures and to get comfortable enough that you can put it on your resume, or run analyses for your thesis.",
    "Great course! You will learn a hard skillet, learning how to use SAS. Its a lot of work to keep up with but can become enjoyable if you allow yourself to be open to learning and excited about learning a new skill",
    "I would recommend the class to fellow students because it is a good course to get a deeper understanding of SAS using.",
    "Overall, it's an okay course that needs a lot of work on improvement. SAS should not have to be taught so harshly with the current grading structure. Allow students to go back into their past labs and correct them to get better grades and not feel like failures throughout the course. The current way it is structured discourages students from enjoying the process of learning SAS and statistical analysis. There's no need to instill this type of fear. Take an R course instead. The industry does not use SAS as much so I don't know why it is emphasized within this program. R is more ubiquitous and versatile and a necessary skill for wherever you go (industry, academia, etc).",
    "Yes-- you'll feel much more equipped in handling SAS.",
    "Basically you will learn SAS in AAMIE. If you really get into the idea of data and coding, the midterms and finals actually end up being fun! A pretty chill way to pick up SAS, I'd say!",
    "Difficult class that takes a lot of time. The take-home exams are a substantial amount of work and take over 10 hours to complete. This class is valuable if you want to learn more about SAS but you should be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class working on labs and assignments. If you don't need this training, I would recommend not taking the course.",
    "Yes. It's a very useful class",
    "AAMIE is an excellent course. It really helps students learn SAS and analyze health data sets. I would strongly recommend this course for any public health students regardless of their concentration.",
    "Take this class! Even if you are not confident in your abilities to \"code,\" you should 100% push yourself to master these concepts. This is an introductory class and is meant for all levels of students. Also, understanding how to manage large data sets is such a valuable skill!",
    "Very useful",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might want to use SAS in their work and\/or thesis.",
    "I would recommend people to take a class in R instead",
    "This course focused on using SAS to conduct data input, management, and analysis and summarizing table results. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, especially if they were looking to become more proficient in a data analysis tool, such as SAS, in their future career. Dr. Desai's notes are very useful and informative.",
    "This course is relatively difficult based on the nuances of SAS and the functions that are being covered in class. It is very easy to go wrong in the assignments and exams, which makes these assignments and the class pretty stressful and time-consuming. I would recommend it to other students who would like to gain a mastery of quantitative data analysis through SAS, but would caution them to allot significant time to the class and its assignments (avoiding piling on other time-consuming and difficult classes).",
    "Take it! SAS is actually fun.",
    "Highly recommended!"
