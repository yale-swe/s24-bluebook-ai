   "comments": [
    "It was very manageable, and if you need it don't put it off.",
    "it was useful to see applications of orgo II.",
    "It's a lab class based on orgo 2; you might have a better time of it if you take chem125 (since it apparently sticks closer to that more standard orgo syllabus) than chem 223. Generally, if you're taking this, you have to. It's worth taking with Orgo 2, though.",
    "You're probably not looking to take this for fun but it is really not a bad class. The timegoes relatively quickly (this coming from a Friday student) and it's pretty low stress. Get in and start as soon as possible because most need to be heated for some duration and it's best if this overlaps with the TF lecture and the setting up of other materials\/TLCs\/solvents\/etc. The final is very much like the first semester final (down to the question about what to do if you spill acid on yourself). There is only one lab report and it's towards the end of the semester but if you have your format from last semester, it goes quickly.",
    "Yes. This is one of the best labs at Yale. Dr. DiMeglio is amazing and the labs are very well organized and usually do not take the full time. Try to take it with Liam S. if you can -- he's amazing!",
    "it's a good intro orgo lab if you need one. teaches you general techniques and lab safety but not a mind-blowingly interesting course.",
    "Although most people take this class because it's required for pre-med\/major requirements, I particularly enjoyed this lab and I think it was the best lab class I've taken!",
    "CHEM 223L, like CHEM 222L, is one of the better labs at Yale. It is more work than CHEM 222L as most labs have post labs, but overall, the workload is extremely manageable and since you know the schedule of assignments ahead of time, you canplan accordingly. The overall atmosphere of the lab depends on your TA. My TA assigned extra TLCs and extra assignments throughout the lab for extra credit. While these were optional, the grades on our PLs were so low that people spent a lot more time than people in the other sections working on assignments. Overall, the class is great and you learn a lot from the experiments. It's hard to mess up, so you always get product in the end!",
    "After CHEM222L, this was a fairly straightforward and interesting course - most of the labs are continuations of techniques used in 222L. Liam was a very helpful and nice TA. A fine lab class!",
    "It is an extension of the first semester of lab, and covers more organic topics than that taught in 230. It provides a basic overview of important chemistry techniques such as NMR and IR. I would recommend it because it teaches many quintessential reactions in organic chemistry and has a reasonable amount of workload.",
    "Organic chemistry is a pretty relaxed course as far as science labs goes - Prof. DiMeglio is very supportive and outlines what she expects in the course manual. As long as you follow the reports like a recipe-book the procedures are not difficult and can be finished before the allotted time. She also plays music. Reports are pretty chill as long as you get advice from a friend. Take it if you need the lab cred - its not that stressful.",
    "Weekly lab& EP assignments. No post lab required for each lab, but almost every other week. The post lab assignments aren't too taxing, and neither are the EPs, but they take a considerable amount of time to do well.",
    "Worthwhile lab course. Dr. DiMeglio is great, and most of the experiments are actually pretty cool (and not too long or tedious!). Experimental plans and post-labs are similar to Chem 222L. If you happen to get Liam as your TA, you are in luck - he's fantastic.",
    "It was a good course but obviously don't take it unless you need it.",
    "Pretty much the same as Chem222L, with a lot of overlap of techniques.",
    "This lab is good. It is interesting but more tedious than 222L because you are more familiar with the methods. The labs usually end early though and the reports aren't bad, so definitely take it if you need to. Dr. DiMeglio and the TAs are great!",
    "Take it if you have to. Don't take the assignments or final lightly, or it will hurt your grade.",
    "typical lab class, similar to lab 1",
    "I would recommend CHEM 223L. As labs go, it's pretty chill with a reasonable amount of work, and some of the products are really cool-looking. If you're taking this lab, you probably have to take it for some requirement, but it's not a hardship at all."
