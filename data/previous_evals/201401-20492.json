   "comments": [
    "If you have no interest in or connection to Los Angeles, this class would not be the best to take. However, for those that live there, or are familiar with the city, this class is good. Lectures can get tedious, but they are only one day a week. The work is very manageable, probably a half hour to an hour of reading a week. The final paper (15 pages) can be written about any aspect of LA.",
    "This course is extremely interesting, especially for those from California. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in California history or the effects of US migration.",
    "Awesome class, whether or not you're already familiar with LA. You learn a lot about our country as a whole just from learning about different streams of migration. The work is manageable and the readings tend to be interesting (though there are a lot of them). I'd recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Los Angeles is such an interesting place and this course opens your eyes beyond the common conceptions of the city. The course perfectly captures the beauty and turmoil of LA. The readings were interesting and not as long compared to some other seminars--they are a mixture of fiction and academic articles. There are two \"midterm\" essays based on class readings and one final (15 page) paper about a topic of our choice. The last assignment was so much fun and Professor Barraclough makes herself available to help at all moments. She's a wonderful, prepared professor who knows how to keep the discussion going. The best part of the course was having other students who were deeply interested in the subject; that made it easy for the small class size to work."
