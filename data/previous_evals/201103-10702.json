    "Yes, for its usefulness in research and qualifying exam.",
    "great course and a necessity for any empirical social science work",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to continue with the quantitative sequence and begin to become familiar with maximum likelihood estimates and causal inference.",
    "I would not recommend it. The class made the material more confusing and difficult to learn than it actually is.",
    "Good class to understand empirical techniques for empirical work",
    "I believe this is an important course to take for anyone who wants to quantitative empirical work in political science. The specific techniques taught are valuable to pick up, and the course will prepare a student to do numerous things in addition to the standard linear regression material."

   "comments": [
    "I know better about the methodologies political scientists use and become more confident with the qualifying exam.",
    "the course did an excellent job of solidifying past material that was introduced in prior courses and then exposed me to a swathe of new material in a relatively short amount of time",
    "It did not.",
    "After taking Metrics 2 in the Econ dept, this course validated and helped me really understand key empirical concepts. In addition it gave me some excellent programming experience",
    "I feel this course helped me better understand both a greater variety of methods and the statistical bases for using them in political science. I cannot say at this point how much it contributed to my dissertation or research, but I believe it will have a great impact on any quantitative work I do in the future."
