   "comments": [
    "Take it as a fun class. Cool guest speakers. Super nice teacher.",
    "It's a cool seminar that looks into the inner workings of the 2012 campaign, and grounds that campaign's relations with the media in background of many past campaigns. Professor Shapiro is a wonderful professor to have; he clearly cares about the students in the class and works hard to provide unique learning experiences over the course of the seminar. I would highly recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The Professor tells lots of anecdotes, is very smart and has lots of personal experiences with the course material and people we learn about. Also, he brings in very interesting guest speakers",
    "Yes, take it. Shapiro's insights are great and the class is not too difficult if you do the work. If you don't know who Shapiro is already, you should.",
    "I loved this class. Professor Shapiro is engaging, and leads discussion well while incorporating his own perspective. The only weakness is that the material sometimes became repetitive. But the reading list was great and the topics of discussion generally interesting. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, even if you're not a politics nerd it's a great introduction!",
    "This is a must-take class for anyone interested in journalism, media or politics. You go through political campaigns since the 1960s, reading books on the candidates, the reporters and the media environment. Once you get to 2012, you go a lot more in depth. Class discussions are very interesting and incredibly well run by Professor Shapiro, one of the kindest and most interesting professors at Yale. There is nothing bad I can say about this class and it was easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Easy class for those who want to talk about politics once a week.",
    "This is an excellent course, especially if you have an interest in journalism or politics, but even if you do not. The readings are great and I feel like I learned so much about the way campaign journalism has evolved and the way campaigns are run. Professor Shapiro is great - he has had a lot of experience covering campaigns and has a lot of great stories to tell. If you have the chance, you should absolutely take this course."
