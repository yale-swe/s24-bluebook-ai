   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student as long as he\/she understands that the course is a lot of work. It definitely is a great way to learn the language. I learned more this semester in Chinese than my four years of French in high school. The system of the four rotating teachers is also very helpful because it allows you to adjust to hearing multiple accents and people speak.",
    "Yes, I would recommend CHNS 110. Chinese is so unlike Western languages, and it's really worth learningsomething completely different. Hanzi (characters) are so beautiful and complex and pack so much; so different from phonetic langauges. Tones are tricky but make you more conscious about the way you speak English. Totally cool language to learn, and this is a fantastic way to learn it.",
    "It is a lot of work. If you want an easy good grade, don't take it. If you want a rewarding class, take it.",
    "Chinese 110 is a very intensive yet effective introductory to Mandarin course. Given that it's only been a semester, I am somewhat amazed at how much Mandarin we have learned in that period of time (from vocabulary to grammar to characters). The daily homework is definitely a lot, but is needed to really drive the language into your mind. If you're interested in studying Mandarin (which is definitely an incredibly useful ability in today's world), this course is great at introducing you to and immersing you in the language.",
    "I think that this course is the result of a magnificent department for Chinese language study. The only weakness being that it is not for those who do not have a desire and propensity for learning language.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS - IT IS THE BEST DECISION YOU WILL EVER MAKE!Yale is the place to be learning Chinese - Yale's Chinese Department developed the first \"pro to-pinyin\" and were the forerunners to modern pin yin standard to all Chinese textbooks. The curriculum is rigorous and very well planned. All the L1 professors are phenomenal teachers who really help develop your language abilities. The workload was the largest of all the classes I've taken at Yale and was stressful at times, but I enjoyed it and I know that in retrospect, I would not be at the level I am now without the 2 hours of daily Chinese homework and studying throughout the semester.You can't go wrong studying Chinese, especially at Yale. It was one of the best decisions of my Yale career!I placed into advanced L5 French freshman year and was allowed to go straight to 300 level French literature courses. I was going to do that to get rid of my Language requirement within one term (which is what many people will do and tell you to do), but it would have been a mistake for me. Learning Chinese was the best decision ever and very empowering experience!",
    "I would highly recommend L1 Chinese at Yale. I guarantee you will not find better teachers anywhere else than here that are more willing to help you learn. Also, they are the nicest professors I've had by far. If you want to learn Chinese, take it at Yale, or at least try it. While there's a lot of homework, it really does help in your understanding and preparation for tests and quizzes. Learning the characters was the hardest part for me, but the more you practice, the easier they get to remember.",
    "Chinese 110 is an introduction of Chinese written and spoken language. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it was incredibly rewarding and because Chinese is a very useful language to know.",
    "Absolutely, but only if you are willing to work hard. You can make a lot of progress in a short period of time, and Chinese is a really fascinating language.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a language course. The workload is fairly high, but you feel like you learn from everything, and none of it really feels like busy-work. There is always extra help available for those who need it, and, as far as language courses go, the way this one is formatted is really great and seems to work really well.",
    "Yes. it is a great course. It is very demanding but you learn so much.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to all. The teachers are phenomenal, the class is interesting, and the balance of culture and language learning is perfect. With so much speaking practice in class, your skills quickly improve, and you are left thirsting for more. Hands down my favorite class this semester. Yale has created an amazing program."
