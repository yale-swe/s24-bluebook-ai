    "Great course! You learn so much but be warned that it is a 2 credit course with 3 credit worth of work so make you plan your schedule accordingly.",
    "ABSOLUTELY; Take it with Prof. Safille. You will not regret it.",
    "On one of the first days of class, Professor Safille basically slid across the table to demonstrate some vocabulary word. Later, to represent esconderse, she jumped underneath the table. It might sound silly, but this was just a first taste of Safille's teaching style, sense of humor, and dedication to her students' learning. I will be honest with you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 taking SPAN 145 was the best academic decision I have made at Yale so far. You learn so much, and L3 and L4 are so similar that you literally might as well get it all done in one go and have a nice time while you are at it. Class meets for a long time every morning, and there's lots of homework to be done but totally manageable. If you have the time, take this class, ESPECIALLY if Safille is teaching. You will not regret this.",
    "Professor Safille is the BEST professor I've had at my time at Yale so far. Not only is she energetic and full of life, but she also has a way of explaining difficult grammar particulars with ease. The course is pretty demanding, but you will get a whole lot out of it. Take this class! Seriously. I don't know why all of the language depts don't combine L3 and L4 together. The only thing that I'd change is that there isn't all that much writing in spanish. Most of the hwk and quizes and tests are just grammar sentences with vocab.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is not worth taking L3 and L4 at once.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is willing to work hard. It is not overly challenging as long as you keep up with the work and maintain a good class attendance record, so that you don't miss grammar explanations, oral practice, and review of literature material.",
    "Two semesters of Spanish put into one, so get ready for the long class. But it's definitely worth it if you are with Professor Safille.",
    "Yes! A great experience, and my Spanish improved by leaps and bounds. Prof. Safille can be frustrating (slow to return graded work, at times seeming to pick favorites), but she is a fantastic teacher and a caring, interesting, funny person.",
    "Take it, absolutely. It isn't difficult, it just doesn't go at glacial pace like single level courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve there spanish!",
    "Definitely"
