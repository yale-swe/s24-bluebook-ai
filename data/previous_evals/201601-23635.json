   "comments": [
    "I like the subject of industrial ecology and was excited to take this introductory course. However, I was very disappointed with the structure of the projects. The project was not clear from the start, the identified clients fell through mid-way, and we were not able to start substantial work until the last month. We did not receive much guidance even though we asked. Everything else about the course was great but the project was very very disappointing.",
    "The course content needs to be revised, updated and made relevant to the present world and expectations of the student. The IE course was too theoretical when IE is not theoretical at all. It would have been great if we would have discussed how to apply IE to different industrial sectors through each week of the course instead of just going over the theory repeatedly again and again throughout the course. The course was a literal waste of time. I have come out learning almost nothing from this course.",
    "I was very disappointed in this course. I did not feel that the lectures formed a coherent course and did not tie in very theoretical concepts to practical applications. The final projects were poorly structured and the contacts and teaching staff assigned did not offer much to enable the students to produce meaningful work.",
    "I only gave Question 14 a rating of 2 because I'm an auditor. I am certain that with the group project and more assignments I could attest to this course being a 1. This rating assumes we are to look at the rating scale in absolute terms.",
    "Question 1: Some of the readings were very interesting conceptually and theoretically. It would have been nice to spend a little more time in class discussing some of these concepts\/theories before jumping into examples of direct application.",
    "Pace of class was too slow. No reinforcement of readings, eliminating any motivation to do them (besides personal interest).",
    "I don't think the final project proposals were developed enough. Our client clearly had ideas that directly conflicted with the professor's ideas. As a result, our grade and understanding of the material seriously suffered.",
    "Question 2: I felt that there were way too many different assignments in this class. Rather than having debates, weekly readings, reading responses, client projects, problem sets, and a midterm, the course would have felt less chaotic by choosing only a few types of assignments and having multiple iterations of them (i.e. having only problem sets instead of reading responses or having another debate instead of the midterm). Because the assignments were so different, they were not very deep and I didn't feel like I got very much out of them. The assignments also had Question 3: I did not feel like the readings were integrated well into class at all. It didn't seem necessary to even do the readings in most lectures. Perhaps the readings could be made optional to help adjust the focus of the workload.",
    "Tom is an expert in the space and it was great to have exposure to him and the high level concepts of industrial ecology. However, I recommend that this class is co-taught between two people with different focus areas in the future. Tom's focus is metals which became very central to the course, but did not match most students' (including my own's) expectations for what the course would be about and what industrial ecology is. The guest lectures were a helpful way to get additional perspectives on the topic, but I think having Marian Chertow or Reid Lifset (or both) coteach the class in the future would provide a much broader picture of what industrial ecology is and how it can be applicable to different topics. The topics were very interesting, but became somewhat repetitive and didn't match the readings\/semester projects very well.",
    "Industrial Ecology is an extremely interesting and important subject. However the instructor made it monotonous by focusing merely on metals and metals cycle during the whole semester and made it extremely boring - to say the least. Majority of people in the class were on their phones or doing other things while in class because the material presented was either repeated over and over or boring. The instructor should have strived for variety and applicability to different sectors and industries. It is known that the instructor's expertise is metals, however the course was not entitled \"industrial ecology of metals\". Yale is renown for the field of industrial ecology but yet it fails greatly when it comes to teaching this and other subjects. It's about time that Yale starts train professors... and teach them how to teach !!!"

    "Both the teaching and course content need significant improvement. The teaching style this year was very old-school, with straight lecturing and some meager attempts at discussion that mainly resulted in cold-calling. The content was very repetitive, unorganized, and research-heavy. Instead of talking about real-world applications, it was mostly graphs from various research papers. Overall, it just wasn't engaging or informative!",
    "i wish the class were broader and covered more topics other than mining and MFAs.",
    "The course content needs to be revised, updated and made relevant to the present world and expectations of the student. The IE course was too theoretical when IE is not theoretical at all.

The course was a literal waste of time. I have come out learning almost nothing from this course.",
    "Lectures, final project.",
    "Too broad of a topic. Unfortunately I didn't take away anything from the course, accept a great team experience. Perhaps my professional experience overlapped too much. This course is great for someone with little or no background in the topics covered in class.",
    "Felt a bit rushed at times and I really didn't appreciate not having as much time for my exam as we should have.",
    "The assignment structure felt a bit disorganized with too many moving pieces. The critical reviews and Part B of the MFA assignment did not contribute to my learning. Similarly, the midterm felt unnecessary. Instead, it would have been nice to spend more time preparing for the final project, learning new skills, delving deeper into some of the course materials, etc.",
    "Making classes more engaging. Sometimes it was easy to stop listening",
    "Pace of class needs to increase two-fold. Readings should be discussed in class.",
    "Lectures weren't very engaging.",
    "The midterm did not advance my knowledge of the subject material at all and I did not feel like it served a very effective purpose in the course. Some of the material on the midterm was not very useful from a practical standpoint, like the first question on the product flow. I also felt that since the material we covered in the course was so broad, it would make more sense for there to have been multiple questions and for students to choose a selection of those questions to answer. We all come from very different backgrounds and have different IE interests, so I think it would be more useful if we could write\/answer the things we are most engaged with. Since we had a final project, it just didn't make much sense to me to have a tests. In addition, we were only tested on material from half of the semester since there was no final exam, so the material in the last half of the course was not focused on as much. I thought that the prompts for the debates were not very open-ended and in many cases the readings for that week primarily displayed only one side of an argument. The material focused very heavily on metals although I know that IE is much broader than that. I liked the guest lectures a lot and I think more of them would have been very beneficial to expanding the breadth of the course.",
    "I think that the lectures themselves and the HW assignments could use some improvement- lectures became extremely repetitive and somewhat boring after some time, and the homework assignments (particularly the critical reviews) seemed more like busy work than actual work that was helping us learn more about industrial ecology."

They were more like something a PhD student might work on for several years, not a group project for several weeks. It was very difficult to get data, and we ended up extrapolating results from basically three data points. Commitment to the group work varied considerably- half of our team was pretty uninterested in the work and in doing their fair share. Overall, a lot of work, not sure what I learned, and I don't feel like it could have been properly accomplished in the amount of time that we had. Also- the spring break deadline was very inappropriate!",
