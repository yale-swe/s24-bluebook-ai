    "This is a great course and one of the most interesting economics course I have taken here. You should definitely take it, although there is a heavy reading load. The workload besides reading though is not very heavy. Fascinating topics and good lectures.",
    "ECON331 could be an outstanding class, but it really falls short of being great.The problem is that Professor Nordhaus tries to do too much in too little time. There is a limit on the material that can be covered in a semester, and this class really pushes it.Nordhaus is a brilliant professor, incredibly accomplished economist, a certified genius, and the leader in the field of climate change economics. However, he too often fails to realize that his students aren't as smart as he is and don't know nearly enough about mathematics.",
    "If you can get in the class, take it. But mind you it is a difficult and demanding advanced econ seminar, which means interesting but hard computational econ psets, reading actual economic papers, writing an original and insightful final paper and a midterm and final exams that are really interesting but also challenging.If you are interested in environmental economics this is a class you should definitely take. Prof. Nordhaus is one of the most eminent scholars in this field and a great teacher.",
    "The lectures and course structure are really good -- as long as you don't worry about not understanding some of the econ theory stuff, you learn a lot of interesting stuff about oil, energy policy, climate change damages, behavioral econ, discounting, etc. There are six problem sets where you basically build a model in Excel that projects economic damages from climate change and lets you solve for the optimal emissions reduction policy. (Problem sets were the highlight of the course for me. Challenging\/confusing at times, but very rewarding and cool.) However, I might start this course credit\/D\/F, since the midterm (and probably final exam) grading is pretty weird. (I thought I got a 100 but ended up with a B+.)",
    "Definitely take it even if you have no interest in climate change... helps you see things from a different perspective",
    "Good course that covers a wide range of topics in Econ. The cool thing is that most of the stuff you learn can be applied to things other than energy\/environment.",
    "This is a wonderful class. You will learn a lot about energy and climate change econ. The readings are extremely interesting and relevant. You also build your own climate model which makes you see how real economists work. It's a lot of work, but definitely worth it."
