   "comments": [
    "I liked this class a lot. I loved listening to Professor Kennedy and hearing his perspective on the events that led up to the war. If you can get into this class, take it! The only grade you get is the grade for your term paper at the end of the semester and one or two in-class presentations. You learn a lot and the reading is very interesting. It really is the best material on this topic.",
    "The course was disappointing for me because there was really no student discussion involved. Looking at the Munich Documents and the first meeting were the highlights. Beyond that, I did not feel much of a compulsion to do the vast amounts of assigned reading on my own and so did not get a ton out of the course.",
    "This class was a great class on the whole. I only wish less emphasis had been placed on the student presentations than on class discussion. There could've been a better overall thrust to the larger themes and historiography at work that might've actually given a better picture of the \"grand strategies\" at play. At times, the presentations seemed mundane and a little fruitless. Having the face time with Prof. Kennedy, however, was unparalleled; I only wish it was more of a conversation together with and the class on the larger ideas and themes of the readings, rather than a mere clarification on the prof.'s part of the nitty-gritty details expounded upon, sometimes rather dryly, in the student presentations. All in all, though, still a wonderful experience that I certainly by no means regret taking.",
    "not an interesting class, but fun way to get to know Professor Kennedy, and no work except for one paper at the end",
    "Yes. Prof Kennedy is very supportive, obviously brilliant, and very generous with his time. Only downside is that people don't do the reading and Professor Kennedy has a tendency to monologue the whole time, so there isn't much discussion.",
    "Yes - Paul Kennedy is spectacular. Great mentor, great guy.",
    "The course matches the description. Aside from most of the class time being occupied by student presentations, I think the course is enjoyable. Prof. Kennedy is a superstar scholar, and it was great to have a class with him.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. A must take for history majors with an interest for the interwar crises of the 1930s and origins of WW2.",
    "HIST 220J is a great class that looks at the causes and origins of WWII from 1931 through 1939. The class proceeds chronologically, but \"stops time\" at three points to look at civil\/military relations, economics and national security, and military balances of power. Two weeks towards the end of the course are spent on examining primary documents relating to the Munich Crisis of September\/October 1938. Each week, there are three presentations by students on specific countries (usually drawn from: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, United States, USSR) fitting with the context of the week's theme."
