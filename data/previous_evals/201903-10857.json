   "comments": [
    "I learned the key economic model relating interest rates, exchange rates, money demand and money supply. This course covered concepts including monetary policy, crises in developing countries (balance of payments, sovereign debt, and banking crises), exchange rate regime history (gold standard to Bretton woods to floating), the Eurozone, the global financial crisis, and others.",
    "I learned how finances move on an international level and the ways in which exchange rates move.",
    "This course forms a robust model of international finance, applicable to both fixed and floating exchange rates, and developed and developing countries. The course applies the model to crises of international character, associations of countries (EU), and foreign direct investment. The course has special contemporary import in the difficulty of developing countries to borrow in their own currency, and the consistent lower level of prices in those countries, as well. This course was a great partner of International Economics.",
    "Theoretical knowledge of international finance, exchange rate, and financial history; being able to make sense of international economic developments",
    "I was more easily able to think through how US and world policy will affect the global macro world and through what mechanisms these effects occur. Additionally, a quick history of world finance is a useful knowledge base to have.",
    "I think Prof. Fieler is really great. If she devoted a bit more thought to the structure of this course (namely less stylized facts in the second half) I think I would have gotten a bit more out of it. That said, she is an angel.",
    "International finance is a great course. You learn about the how global financial systems and interconnected and the effects economies have on one another (in terms of economic stability, labor market, bank systems, etc) as national and international systems change. A majority of the course touched on the impact changes of exchange rates on the finances of small and large countries through streams like trading, investments and banking systems. Overall the course does a great job of touching on the key aspects of international trade, it's history, different financial systems\/regulations that exist and changes to the global financial market.",
    "A few different models with respect to international finance and some cool concepts related to trade\/exchange rates."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths of course: tests are straightforward, Prof Fieler is not trying to trick you! If you study, you will do well. Problem sets are graded on completion. Lectures mainly cover what is in the textbook, but are helpful for further understanding why changes occur in the model. Weakness: we spent a lot of time at the end of the course on concepts that weren't necessarily tested on, for instance the history of exchange rates and the Eurozone. I liked learning about this but I think it could perhaps be condensed to be more engaging",
    "I think this class does a great job of teaching us the appropriate information needed to understand international finance. The homework sets students up to actively engage and learn the material.",
    "Ana Fieler is a terrific lecturer--she is an expert in her field, an effective lecturer, and incredibly good-natured. She is a testament to the Economics Department. I enjoyed that her curriculum followed no one set guidelines but included material from different textbooks, as well as cutting edge information on new mathematical models. The course does not require many prerequisites, and the interesting material will likely sustain your engagement over the course of the semester. If you're an early-riser, this class has no weaknesses!",
    "The lecture was small which was helpful to understand the material",
    "I would have preferred higher engagement with the history portion of the course. Once we made it through all the models, it seemed as though we had completed the course and the history was as much to finish out the semester as it was to teach us about the history of international finance. More case studies might have helped? Alternatively more examination of the world today and how history has affected it, or any other ideas to drive engagement with the last third of the course. The guest lecture was a good example! (though I'm taking a class on that topic currently)",
    "Low Professor preparation.",
    "Strengths - the professor is incredible, the topic is interesting, you learn a lot from homework assignments but they're still very manageable, homework assignments aren't graded, you are tested on what you learn (no curve balls) Weaknesses - None!",
    "the exams are a fair representation of the homework\/practice exams."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to an economics major looking for a senior elective that is not too hard, but is also engaging",
    "Yes, this class is great for anyone interested in international affairs. It shows just how integrated the world is and also gives great insights on history after learning how the world works. It is very applicable.",
    "This course is terrific. The workload is not burdensome--10 or so problem sets, a midterm and a final. Be aware that the final is 55% of your grade. That being said, towards the content of the course, this class is exceptional. Professor Fieler is a Yale gem--an economic expert, an effective lecturer, and incredibly good-natured. The material is very applicable and interesting, and you'll find yourself engaged for the entirety of the semester.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes a great senior seminar",
    "Yes, this is a great class. Very interesting",
    "Yes, it was a good senior elective and was interesting to learn about the world economy.",
    "Yes, overall it was a solid course that I enjoyed and I would recommend that another student take it.",
    "Yes if improved. As a concept its a good class, but it fails in execution",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Take it if you want a chill class where you still learn a lot of insightful and useful topics!",
    "As far as an Econ 400 level class goes, this one is pretty great!"
