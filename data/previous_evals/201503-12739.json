    "This is a good continuation of the arabic, and there is a very noticeable difference moving from beginner to intermediate. If you're interested in arabic, i recommend.",
    "Arabic 130 is a great class. In the course my writing improved so much due to the weekly writing assignments. Prepare to work really hard on your writing and sentence structure, and to improve greatly. In class, Sarab emphasizes speaking in exercises. It is crucial that you take these seriously because there aren't that many other opportunities to improve your speaking, given that the homework is mostly vocab\/listening\/reading\/writing. 130 deals with the first 5 lessons of Al-Kitaab and focuses a lot on culture and social issues in the Arab world (especially marriage). Overall, my Arabic has improved a lot in the course. If you have the chance to take 130 with Sarab, don't hesitate!",
    "Great course with a lot of work! If you are willing to put in the work, take it- but make sure its with Sarab! She's a great, well organized, and incredibly clear teacher and without her, the class would not be manageable.",
    "I love Arabic and would recommend it to anyone interested in studying language.",
    "I would definitely recommend ARBC 130, especially with Sarab. The class is not necessarily EASY -- if you're already at L3 level, you probably know by now that Arabic is a difficult language. But the workload for the class was actually really manageable, and you can do well in the class as long as you keep up with the material and study. Sarab is a really great teacher -- if I could take Arabic with anybody I'm glad it was her!! She explains concepts clearly and gives great advice, she really knows a lot about effective language-learning. And she really truly cares about you learning the material well."
