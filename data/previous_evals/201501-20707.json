    "A lecture based class about how cell membranes work in the human body. Starting from the fundamental equations that govern transport of solutes\/proteins\/water across a barrier, to how different kinds of membranes operate differently in the human body and the various functions that they perform. If you haven't taken any biology in a while, it's good to skim over a basic human bio book just to not be completely lost when professors casually refer to things about how the human body works.",
    "Yes I will. It's a great opportunity to learn about ion channels.",
    "Molecular machines in human disease was a good survey of diseases associated with molecular machines like ion channels. I feel however that the course likely only scratches the surface of what we know about this field. Additionally covered in the course is some thermodynamics, structural biology, physiology and neuroscience. It was a fast-paced course, but I would recommend it to those interested in the topic."

    "This course deepened my knowledge of the discipline by providing me a good survey of physiology and molecular machines. I don't know whether the course will directly contribute to my dissertation research, but at least indirectly it will through new knowledge gained."
