    "Take it if you are looking for a good EVST course",
    "The class is a must if you're interested in ocean policy (I am). I learned a tremendous amount and the material is all extremely applicable, deepening your knowledge of the oceans in a manner that will allow you to better understand ocean-related science reporting, fishery management politics, climate change science, etc. Workload is reasonable and Mary Beth and Jodan were both in my estimation quite good.",
    "I would definitely recommend. This class is so so great and interesting. Really, really rewarding. YES. The tests are hard--that is all I would caution, but don't let the workload drive you away!!",
    "I took it Credit D and was happy I did, the exams turned out to be graded pretty rough. But it's a really interesting course, gives a great breadth of information about ocean processes and how they impact the biology. The writing assignment and presentation are really simple and enjoyable. Glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in this subject and willing to do some studying. The paper assignment wasn't too hard and the exams weren't too bad either. The final wasn't really cumulative, so that was nice. Realize though, that a lot of the class is physical oceanography (currents, el nino, weather patterns, etc.) so if you're only in it for the whales and dolphins you might be bored.",
    "It's a good overview of marine biology and oceanography if one knows nothing about the subject. The climatic oscillations were probably the only thing I actually learned, being a science major and having an amateur's interest in marine biology. I don't think it should be a 400 level course. I would recommend it to non-science majors interested in the ocean.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in marine biology or oceanography. The more interested you have for the subject the more enjoyable it will be. If you are someone that is just trying to take it for a Sc credit, don't. You won't be getting as much out of it."
