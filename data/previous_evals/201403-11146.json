    "Strongly recommend. It's helpful but not absolutely necessary to have background in metaethics. At least one should have done some coursework in moral philosophy broadly speaking. One imagines that the course will change from year to year, contingent on what counts as 'recent.' But from the perspective of Fall 2014, the readings are engaging and some of the arguments are right on the forefront of contemporary trends in ethical theory.",
    "You'll need to have at least a rudimentary understanding of metaethics in order to keep up in class, or else be prepared to do lots of background reading on your own!"

    "Formally, my training is in religious, rather than philosophical ethics. Nonetheless, I try to do coursework in philosophy to help give me a different kind of perspective\/set of approaches for my motivating questions. This class was very helpful in shaping the questions I am asking of religious ethicists to the end of engaging a research project down the road."
