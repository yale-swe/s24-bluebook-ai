   "comments": [
    "The cases get very repetitive. You do the same thing every single week with a different case. It seemed like a great class for the first 5 weeks and then it became tedious.",
    "GREAT COURSE with VERY useful content matter. I liked how the classes were structured (discussion+lecture).",
    "This was the best course I took my first term at YSPH. It is case based with other modules thrown in. The course is much more interactive with both the instructor and other students than any other course and I looked forward to the subject matter.I felt that the theory aspects of each session were rather rushed and I did not quite know how they fit into the larger scheme of the class. We used them in our paper but I felt as though I did not have a firm grip on the theory outside of my given paper topic.",
    "This was a great overview course on leadership and organizational concepts.",
    "This was a great course and I would definitely recommend it to other students! The topics covered were extremely relevant to health management students. However, I would have enjoyed spending more time on performance improvement issues and a little less on organizational behavior.",
    "the course got repetitive toward the end and it felt very theoretical. It would have been better to have more direct insight into the exact changes that were taking place within the organizations that we studied. At times it felt like a class on keywords.",
    "Strengths: lays a great foundation for any transformational leadership studyWeaknesses: class was too large",
    "This class presented a different way of thinking and made you really analyze a problem and present recommendations.",
    "Strengths: very engaging, interesting cases and topics, great professorWeakness: a lot of work",
    "Great course. Content and case studies are very relevant to current health care issues.",
    "The course was great. I learned a lot about healthcare and leadership. I was equipped with tools that I have already been able to apply and use to help those that I lead. The cases studies were interesting and brought up a plethora of different issues and problems to consider. I constantly found myself really engaged with the material. Professor Nembhard did a great job helping students learn through the whole process.",
    "Ingrid is already considering changing some of the case studies that weren't as effective as others, so that will be helpful. I enjoyed working with a group for the final presentation, though I wish each group had a little more time to present. I also thought the in-class exercise where we tested the different decision-making methods (devil's advocate v. consensus) was pretty rushed. It was also difficult to do the day we turned in our first case analysis because I think many people had spent much of their time that week doing the case write-up and had not read the case assigned for class discussion. Conducting the small group decision-making exercises was awkward when only one or two people in each small group had actually read the case that we had to analyze. I assume that more participation would be possible if this exercise were done another day in the syllabus. The overall structure of case analysis in the class worked well, and Ingrid did a terrific job of facilitating class discussion and raising the major points of the cases (though at times, class discussion could have been cut a little shorter to ensure we had sufficient time to review Ingrid's power point slides at the end of class).",
    "Overall I enjoyed the class. I felt that the professor kept a dynamic conversation going in the classroom. The case studies and readings were interesting. The diverse class make-up of individuals from all different programs also kept me engaged.I have some suggestions for minor improvements to the course. It would be better if the articles could be better incorporated in the classroom discussions. We often focused just on the case studies, and I felt that some of the articles did not get the attention that they deserved. This would also encourage students to read the articles in addition to the case studies. I think it would also be helpful to the students to have Professor Nembhard grade the case studies as opposed to having the TA grade them. Professor Nembhard is clearly extremely familiar with the literature on the subject-matter, and I felt that her feedback would have been more helpful\/useful than the TA's. It also would have been interesting to study leadership, org. behavior, and improvements at health care foundations and non-profits for individuals whose interests are in those areas.",
    "Very reading intensiveThis is one of those courses that you really get out of it what you put into it. The more reading you did, the better you could appreciate (and therefore participate in) the discussion.Cases were all interesting in relevant.Really helped me critically analyze issues.We were graded on economic aspects in our papers but many of us have never taken a formal accounting-type course.",
    "Strengths:1.) I liked having to read cases instead of using a textbook. It kept me interested in the course content; they were also all real cases, so they were practical.2.) The professor was lively during class.Weaknesses:1.) Our grades are based highly on participation - I prefer to listen in class, so it wasn't my type of class.2.) The class discussions were pretty whimsical; they followed a loose outline, but they were directed by student input. Again, I prefer a bit more structure to classes.3.) The class had a lot of supplemental material - not only were there too many readings, but we never had enough time to go through the slides thoroughly at the end of class.",
    "Very strong course. I learned a lot and the way the class works really enhances the learning (projects, papers, class discussions).",
    "I wish that Ingrid would've spent a little more time lecturing us and sharing her slides with us. She had a lot of insight to share, but it was usually squeezed into a short amount of time at the end of class.Overall, great class. Very practical, useful and interesting material.",
    "Good range of topics. The online activity however, was entirely useless. It is the only detractor of the course.",
    "Great courseStrengths: very practical and relevant material for future public health professionals. Clear and concise lectures by the instructor. Engaging and challenging case studies.Weaknesses: with so many people, it became somewhat nauseating to hear relatively obtuse comments or answers to rhetorical questions by the end of the class. Also it was slightly bothersome how much the economy and institutional profitability will determine my health one day.Way to improve: more lectures from Ingrid",
    "The course was extremely thought-provoking and provided a nice intro to many of the relevant issues within the areas of leadership\/quality improvement\/organization behavior. I thought the layout of the class was great - dissecting case studies for the majority of the class and then concluding with a summary presentation. As a discussion-based class, I thought the class size was too big (although the instructor managed the room well).",
    "The course is dynamite. Anyone who pays attention and performs the readings will learn enormously. The only weaknesses are some of the readings, which Professor N. already asked us to evaluate.",
    "This is by far one of the best, if not the best class I have taken at the school of public health. This course forced me not only to fully evaluate problems, but begin to think of practical and solutions. (A requirement I have not found in many other courses). This course uses the case study method, which is 100% better than the typical lecture style. You are forced to read the cases, or else class would not be meaningful. I loved this class, and I would recommend it to any and every student at YSPH. The professor was wonderful as an added bonus!",
    "There is a lot of reading required for the class. You don't get a lot of guidance in terms of what is expected for the paper.",
    "The course provided a great foundation for a number of managerial issues. It was definitely a survey course, and I would like to see another course built on top of this one in the future to help with more of the specific operational issues the cases we learned about had to overcome.",
    "This was a fantastic course, one of my favorites by far. I loved the case study format and I enjoyed the vast levels of psychological security. :-) I really learned a lot from this class. It was also a very empowering class, perhaps because in each case one person made such a difference. This was the only class I took last semester in which people, rather than the government, was tasked with improving the world- a refreshing change. Engaging material, engaging format.Weaknesses: I thought the 3 hours going over the Paul Levy CD was a bit much. It would have been more, but I started skimming the emails and news articles. The case study was much better. It was a bit hospital heavy... perhaps you could throw in a public health department or community-based health initiative case study?",
    "strength: very specific about the management case on health institutionsweakness: as class progresses, the focus gets distracted, and it became more general on topics.",
    "This was one course that I actually enjoyed going to every week. Ingrid is an amazing, charismatic professor, and as a non-management student, this was a fairly good intro to some key concepts with interesting, applicable cases. A great courser if you're looking for something different. The assignments could probably have a little more direction in terms of structure, though. I feel like we were expected to use management theories, terms, analyses, etc. and we never really talked about them in class. It was intutive, but I still don't think i walked away with any great skill set.",
    "Overall, an interesting course that explored topics seemingly unlike any other course in the YSPH curriculum. It gave students an opportunity to discuss ideas based on cases that provided a good foundation for each class, and Professor Nembhard tied the material together in a way that was both interesting and informative. An improvement for the class might be to provide slightly more direction for case write-ups, as the TA session dedicated to this did not provide much guidance and students with no previous knowledge of how to do so were penalized for not knowing to include certain types of things in the write-up. Additionally, some of the discussions became a bit boring and repetitive at times, as it seems like people were overly motivated to participate since the TA was marking down each time someone spoke. The result was that oftentimes, people were just talking for the sake of talking, and this doesn't really benefit the class. Perhaps a different measure of participation would be better and encourage people to be more reflective.",
    "Absolutely wonderful course. Strengths are the instructor and diversity of concepts discussed. I learned how to deconstruct a case and arrive at solutions to problems.",
    "Very good course. Learning from the cases is great. Ideally, it would have been nicer if the class was smaller but Ingrid did a great job of making the large class size work.",
    "Great course. I learned quite a lot.",
    "Spotty, with some great parts and some terrible ones. Good sessions: Children's, Levy, J+J, Reading Intermountain. Benton session was terrible, Everest was kind of silly (OK, it's a taste of SOM exercises, but kind of hokey), and the session in which we broke off into groups (Bridges, I think) was way too much to do in way too short an amount of time."

She does a great job in the back and forth between students and students really feel like this is their class. The papers were interesting and the group presentation was really fun. Professor Nembhard is in the running for the best teacher I've ever had at any level.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is great. Her strengths are that she's very personable, open to feedback, and a good manager of class discussions. I guess the weaknesses relate to the fact that this was her first time teaching this class so some of the materials weren't as valuable as others. But as a professor, I think she is wonderful and truly takes an interests in students.",

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor N is fantastic. The course blends intellectually demanding HBS cases, our ideas, and the results of her research presented on PowerPoint, which is where the real gold is at. She is witty,and tactfully challenges people's point of view, and moves discussion in an artful manner.I noticed a couple weakness in class. Sometimes we would have a discussion on a particular aspect of the case that would drag on for too long. Also, in our written reviews of the business cases, the TA conducted the evaluations of the first case, and I think the professor should write the reviews. We are here to learn from her expertise, not someone who is only a couple years older (or younger) than myself.",

    "Enav was atrocious. She visibly displayed attitude to the class, answering questions curtly. She was very unhelpful with explaining how to do case analyses for the non-management students.Also, quite a few members of the class are friends with her. As she grades our assignments and assesses our participation, there is clearly a conflict of interest. Second-year MPH students should not be grading their friends' work.",
    "Einav was a good TA, but not particularly flexible and helpful with questions.",
    "Einav just graded papers, we had no other interaction with her.",

    "Einav was great.",
    "Our TA was not very good. She was not approachable and very difficult to get a hold of with questions.",
    "Our TA was Einav Ornan. She did not regularly teach but did lead a session about how to write a case analysis, which was very helpful. Otherwise, I'm not sure why she was required to attend every class session.",
    "I felt that Einav did a good job as the TA and she met the responsibilities required.",
    "Einav - we didn't really have any interactionwith her. She sat in class, but we didn't have any necessity to meet with her.",
    "The TA was helpful. She held a review session to go over writing a case analysis - although it would have been really helpful if more examples were provided. A lot of the class had experience writing case analyses, but as someone new to the process I struggled in the beginning trying to figure out what exactly was wanted.",
    "I didn't have any contact with her.",
    "The TA, Einav, was very responsive and definitely had a lot of work on her hands with assisting in grading essays. Although I did not come to her with questions about the course, I'd imagine she was very informative based on her past experiences.",
    "We didn't have a lot of interaction, but she did a good presentation on how to write a case study.",
    "I never had any contact withe her.",
    "Einav did not have much of a teaching role in this course, except for the session sh led on case writ-eups. This was honestly not very helpful, as it only included obvious information and did not incorporate the kind of expectations she had when grading. She penalized students for particular aspects of writing or content that she did not inform students of needing to include in case write-up format, and further, her point reductions often seemed somewhat arbitrary and she provided little feedback for future improvement or understanding of the grading. Additionally, it seemed that she was simply marking down every time people raised their hand and spoke for participation points, regardless of what they said, but sometimes did not mark anything down for a few minutes at a stretch when she wasn't paying attention. This lack of consistency is unfair and further fueled excessive participation from a solid number of people who may not necessarily have had much substance to contribute, but did so simply because they wanted to make sure she noted their names.",
    "Did not have too much in-class contact with Einav.",
    "Aenov was one of the worst TA's I have ever had. When she didn't know how to answer a question, she'd just say \"figure it out yourself\". She was very rude numerous times. She doesn't need to be a TA."

    "I would highly recommend this course to another student interested in management type activities. It's a great first exposure to grad school and a specific practice area, it is not your typical survey course like epi or biostats.",
    "A case-based approach to analyzing organizational and systematic issues that managers of health care firms and institutions face. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone that wants to be a leader\/manager in the health care industry.",

    "Save all the readings and articles from class...great things to reference for the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a great way to understand about health care and go through Harvard Business School cases. The class discussion was great and the cases were fascinating. The professor does a great job helping you learn and think critically. This is one of the best classes I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in thinking about case studies of hospital management. It probably would be more useful if the class were a little smaller in size, but as mentioned, Ingrid did a great job of managing class discussion. Some of the in-class exercises were not overly helpful, but in general, spending time considering the HBS studies is valuable (ex. Veterans Admin hospitals, Intermountain, and some other big names in health care). Ingrid also provides you with important articles from the field that might be beneficial to us in the future. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to fellow students.",
    "yes I would...it was a great course andI learned a lot about healthcare and management during it.",

    "You can really learn a lot of current management issues. No previous experience in management necessary and this course is HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in leadership, org. behavior or performance improvement.",
    "Great course, you will learn many interesting and valuable lessons in health management and also personal professional development. Take it",
    "The course was terrific! I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would give this course the highest possible recommendation. The only class that was a major disappointment was the simulation of climbing Mount Everest. However, the management message at the end was that people on a team often do not share important information. This is a very simple, yet highly valuable lesson.",

    "recommendable course for a student who is interested in hospital related studies or career.",
    "Good course. Great intro to some management concepts. Good cases, and a great professor.",
