    "You have to take it because It's a core course, but honestly does a better job of going over the theories than some of the PLSC courses I've taken. That said, it was the first year and there were some issues, which should get resolved over time. Some people thought the class was too easy, but I found it to be just the right level. Often lecture is a repetition of the readings which does not at all provide an incentive to go to class, so that could be changed.",
    "Dear god this class was awful. Sanchez is the worst lecturer I've ever taken a class with. The driest lectures with completely redundant powerpoint slides read verbatum at 9 AM. Really random midterm with dubious grading that focused on a pretty small subset of the material. I stopped going to lecture pretty early on and only came for the quizzes and exams. Definitely needs some work. I liked the reading though, but there's a lot. As of now we have no idea what the final is going to be like. If you're development and haven't read any of this stuff before, nut up and start reading because you'll be at a disadvantage compared to the security kids who have most likely encountered some of these authors before.",
    "Approaches to International Security is the worst class I've taken at Yale. Though Prof. Sanchez is incredibly nice, she is the worst lecturer I've ever had. Her lecturing style makes it seem like she's talking to children. The lectures were a poorly organized and verbatim repetition of the readings. And nearly ever slide had a typo or a missing words. Does she really not care enough to check her slides before class? Yale can do better.This class was an absolute waste of time. I almost regret being a Global Affairs major because of this class.",
    "Yes, it gives you a foundation on international security that you will draw on later.",
    "I would not recommend the course. If it were not required, I would not have taken it, as there are a number of courses that cover similar material yet are more engaging and intellectually stimulating. Professor Sanchez was very nice and personable, but she is not a fantastic lecturer (tells unrelated anecdotes, has consistent typos in her powerpoint presentations, etc.), and the reading for the class was neither interesting nor incredibly pertinent to the contemporary world (very steeped in Cold-War-esque theory).",
    "Expect major improvements next year. As it currently stands, a very poor course.",
    "Yes (if you have a choice?).If you've taken some IR theory courses before (such as International Security, Balance of Power, etc.), some portions of this class will be review for you -- especially the pre-mideterm. However, the post-midterm topics (terrorism, civilian victimization, international law\/institutions, etc.) were extremely interesting, and not necessarily something that you would touch upon in other IR classes. The workload is not too great; two lectures, section, two quizzes, midterm, final. The midterm and the final are challenging but interesting; they are case studies, where you have to apply the theories to real life.",
    "You need to take it if you're doing Global Affairs. I hope they improve it. They probably will given all of the (largely negative) feedback.",
    "This class will expose you to some of the broad international security theories that are definitely relevant when thinking through current issues. If you already have a strong background in these issues the class isn't for you, but if you have very little exposure it will definitely increase your capacity for appreciation of these issues.",
    "Good introduction to Security\/War Studies. Reading load is manageable. Class lectures are helpful in understanding the readings. Sections facilitate good discussion. Exams reward strong analysis so test internalization and application of theories covered in class.",
    "Do not take. Absolutely not. Worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "There are better into international security courses at Yale. I have hope for this one to improve, but it is currently very much sub-par.",
    "As GLBL 275 is a core class for Global Affairs, there is not much choice involved in taking it if you are in the major. That said, the subjects covered are quite interesting, as are the readings (which will hopefully be trimmed down from what we had this year). Professor Sanchez is a new professor teaching a brand new course, so we did experience some difficulties now and then. Given that the class is mostly based on theory, it may be a bit of a boring 9 am lecture - but not too bad, given that you are interested in international security and do not have much background in IR theory.",
    "Hopefully someone other than Professor Sanchez will teach this course. If so, it could be a cool course. If Prof. Sanchez teaches it, only take it if you have to for Global Affairs. It's not that bad, really. I mean, it's painful, but if you just do the reading you can probably get an A.",
    "GLBL 275 was a pretty dry and uninteresting course. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "A class that really, really needs a lot of work. Why am I taking an intro course for my major second semester junior year? Why am I relearning material I've literally taken three times? (this is not a unique problem -- many of the readings are universal to every security class at Yale). Attempts to summarize international security and ends up being wayyyy too much of a survey.",
    "This class was kind of a mess for it's first year. It's weird to take an intro class like this junior year. You'll have to take it, so we'll see how it changes.",
    "If you are GA, you probably have to take it. Having said that, I came into it being pretty skeptical but I actually really enjoyed it and liked what I learned. The workload is not too bad either. So don't be discouraged.",
    "This class was kind of a mess. Only take it if the global affairs people force you to.",
    "As a GA major in the development track I would say that other development track students will find the material dry and also more difficult than the security track students find it.",
    "Not the most exciting class, but it is at least informative. Lectures are just reading off powerpoints, but you will learn about security.",
    "Well, you have to take it, right? If you've taken a ton of security-related classes before you'll breeze through it because you'll have encountered a lot of the readings already. If not, it's an effective way to fill in everything you ought to know. Try to resist the temptation to sleep through lecture, especially if you don't keep up with readings.",
    "I am sure it will change for next year. It needs to change. I would not recommend what I just took to anyone.",
    "This is a solid class that gives a good overview of the subject of international security. The readings and topics are well-chosen. Lecture could be better in two respects:1. It is often just a restatement\/summary of the readings, and can be redundant for students who have completed them.2. It is overly-dependent on test scores (midterm and final), and the grading practices for the exams are not always clear. I did the readings, attended lecture and participated in section - all of which led me to believe that I had understood the material - but I still did poorly on the exams.My section experience was terrific, but that depends on the TF.",
    "Only take this class if you are a global affairs major and have to. It will give you a good background in IR theory if you don't have it. Hopefully it will be better taught in the future.",
    "Hopefully the structure of GLBL 275 will be much different in future years. GLBL 275 is an introduction to some of the important theories and writings in the field of International Security. This past year the course was a lecture course revolving around a midterm and final exam. Unfortunately it had a vibe of \"here are some important writings you need to be aware of and memorize for an exam.\" The lectures were often dry point by point summarizes of the readings. Moreover, for many security students the class was very repetitive, covering the same works and ideas in almost any other international relations class (realism v. liberalism v. structuralism). With so much time devoted to these basic theories, the course strangely failed to even cover the topics of the security capstones (economic sanctions, small arms, and cyberwarfare). Unless the class is radically restructured I cannot recommend GLBL 275."
