    "Take this class if you can! Be prepared to discuss Shakespeare's later works at a higher level.",
    "Enjoying Bloom's Shakespeare course is a matter of approach. You should not come expecting it to be your introduction to these works. Take the survey lectures for that. You should not come to it expecting a genuine seminar experience, because Bloom's class is a strange amalgamation of lecture and seminar, in which your comments do not create discussion so much as they inspire him to take another one of his many flights of fancy. You should take this class because you want to experience Harold Bloom's brilliant and highly idiosyncratic views on Shakespeare's plays. I cannot stress brilliant and highly idiosyncratic. His interpretations are astounding in breadth and depth of knowledge and thought they demonstrate, but are also, at times, incredibly strange and difficult to believe. If you are willing to treat this class as a special Yale experience, I urge you to take it. If your looking for a normal Shakespeare class, keep looking.",
    "If you're so lucky as to be accepted into this course, take it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Professor Bloom's class is a look at some of the world's richest texts through his keen and unique critical eye. Discussions and workload are pleasant, not taxing, but I still found that I engaged with the texts more than in other English seminars and enjoyed that interaction. This class is a wonderful experience. I recommend it."
