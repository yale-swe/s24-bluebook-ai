    "I would recommend the course to any social science student doing applied statistical research.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, which is a whirlwind tour of leading quantitative research methods in political science. But be prepared to spend 20-30 hours per week in order to complete the problem sets and keep up with the readings. The class exposes you to a wide range of statistical techniques (including for categorical data and time series) and their application in political science; however, the class is structured more for exposure than mastery so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you do not yet know how to program in Stata and R, try to learn before taking this class (e.g., through the StatLab).",
    "Learn to hate one of statistical computer software packages, but it will break down the intimidation factor for when you actually have to use it later."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course contributed significantly to preparing me for my dissertation. It provided foundational knowledge of a range of research designs and statistical techniques that I could study in more depth for use in my dissertation or future research. It also gave an overview of trends in political science research and the pros and cons of different research designs.",
    "I will certainly use everything from the course. I have saved all the slides and lecture notes. It will all come into practice."
