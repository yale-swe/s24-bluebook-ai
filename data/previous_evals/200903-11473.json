    "If you are looking into taking this class, then you probably have to. It is not too bad now that the lab reports have been switched to short-forms. Having taken the Phys 205 lab before taking this one really came in handy. Iknow others who had taken Phys 160&161 labs were at a loss for how some of the instruments worked, but if this is you, I wouldn't worry too much about it. The TAs were real helpful in explaining everything.",
    "the only people who take it are BME majors and we dont have a choice, so you're going to take it anyway",
    "BME 355L is a good class, but don't take it unless you are a BME major. There are plenty of more interesting Bio labs that you can take if you are interested in taking a lab",
    "I would recommend it. Well you have to take it anyways if you are BME major. Do your work though. And don't start the lab writeup late, so you can ask questions when something is unclear.",
    "I would summarize BENG 351 as a valuable course for a BME major. It is not too difficult (6 labs with writeups and a final), and for the first time in my lab career, it actually doesn't make youdo more than a half credit's worth of work. The professors and TAs are good.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are a BME major, because it is a required course."
