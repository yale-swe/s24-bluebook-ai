   "comments": [
    "I learned about different language learning styles and how to incorporate\/accommodate them in the classroom and how to teach language effectively and interestingly. Also remedied some preconceptions about language learning and teaching including what students should be expected to do and how best the human mind can retain information.",
    "I felt that my knowledge of current approaches to second language pedagogy was greatly enhanced by this course. I am better equipped to implement task-based activities in my classroom, as well as to consider a wide variety of factors in my pedagogical practice, including the language-content divide, individual learner differences, etc.",
    "This course is extremely helpful in designing a teaching portfolio in languages. All the assignments are targeted toward working on and adding documents needed for the dossier.",
    "This course gave a good overview of the important ideas in second language acquisition and pedagogy, without losing site of how to put these ideas into practice. The class observations were especially helpful in seeing how the concepts we covered in class can be implemented. It was also beneficial to be in a classroom with people from many different languages, because they all were able to contribute unique perspectives.",
    "This course provided a comprehensive overview of different approaches to the theory and practice of second language teaching\/acquisition. We covered a variety of topics, ranging from the importance of grammar to use of technology in the classroom. I came away from the course with a fairly firm grasp on subjects that were relatively unknown to me before this semester. We were also encouraged to test out certain theories in our classrooms, which helped make them less abstract."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Class meetings were organized logically by topic. Overall useful but repetitive at times. For example the session on tasks\/activities took up a lot of time. There was also a heavy emphasis on communicative language teaching, which I know is preferable nowadays, and has many merits, but I would have liked to hear about any non-CLT grammar teaching methods that aren't boring. I liked how we filled the 2 hours with different activities involving teacher presentation, partner work, group work, and looking at handouts. Some of the readings should be adjusted. On many weeks, two or more of the readings said essentially the same thing. It was hard to keep on top of the readings and feel motivated when this happened.",
    "I think the course provides an excellent overview of the major questions currently facing teachers of second languages. The practical component of the course (e.g., designing and implementing tasks, assessments, etc.) is very useful, although occasionally difficult due to the constraints of department syllabi. I would have preferred less in-class pair\/group work, except in the case of exchanging ideas for lessons and activities.",
    "No weakness. It's an excellent course and a really valuable resource for language teachers.",
    "I thought the class was well-structured, and I liked the balance between reflections, tasks, and observations. I think it would have been interesting to have a few more readings about multiliteracies and multicultural language education, especially since these ideas were the ones that got the class talking the most. Overall a really rewarding class!",
    "I was not teaching language this semester, which made certain assignments feel slightly less applicable, and thus slightly harder to engage with. That said, the syllabus was accommodating and well structured, although it could have benefitted from a brief final overview, given the range of material we covered over the course of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in SLA pedagogy. Although I had previously taken a course in my department on L2 teaching methodologies, I appreciated the chance to learn about the most current research and to expand my repertoire of skills.",
    "Yes, this course will provide you with tons of practical experience, as well as theoretical knowledge on the field of second language acquisition. Some of the readings can be a bit dry and may seem repetitive, just do as much of reading as you think necessary.",
    "Yes, especially if that student is from a language department. This course really helped me know much more about language teaching pedagogy and how to build a teaching portfolio.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to important theories in second language acquisition and pedagogy for people who plan to be language teachers. It never loses sight of practice, and the assignments ask students who are currently teaching language classes to implement the ideas we learned about in their own teaching. Even though I was not teaching, I still got a lot out of the course, especially from observing language classrooms and imagining how I would design my own lessons.",
    "I came away from this course with a much better understanding of the theories that inform language teaching. I would recommend the course to graduate students in foreign language departments. While it may not necessarily have an immediate impact on their teaching, it provides a solid foundation in the field of second language acquisition that will surely prove useful as they enter the job market."
