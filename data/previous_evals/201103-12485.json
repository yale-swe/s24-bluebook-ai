   "comments": [
    "Great class if you're not planning on majoring in math or the hard sciences. Problem sets are easy to keep up with. Professor Havlickova is awesome and so funny! A lot more linear algebra than multivariable calculus (which is not how the course description makes it sound). This is actually a total blessing, though be prepared to leave this course not knowing anything about how these concepts are actually applicable to economics (which is supposed to be the point of the course...). Oh well. Attend every class and you'll easily get at least a B+ without doing much studying beyond that.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to Econ major or other social science major. It is relatively much easier than MATH120, but the materials are equally helpful.",
    "I enjoyed this class. The work load was manageable, Miki was a great professor (super clear, well organized, and approachable), and the tests were pretty straight forward. If you're a real math personthat wants a class with theories and proofs... definitely not for you. But if you want something clear and doable, I would recommend it.",
    "Take this course if you are not mad about math, but want a good foundation. Prof Miki is very clear in her explanations and understanding.",
    "I would definitely recommend math 118 to a student who couldn't do 120 but wanted to major in Econ.",
    "This is a perfect class if you just want to take one math in your time at Yale. It's a nice introduction to linear algebra and multivariable calc that lets you get a flavor for each of these two disciplines while skipping over the really hard bits. It all integrates and comes together really well at the end, the homeworks are always manageable, the exams really fair. Also, Miki makes her self very available so it's so easy to get help on anything. And her reviews before exams are a lifesaver.",
    "A good course, especially if you want to be an econ-major. A doable workload, just always do the problem-sets in a way so that you revise the stuff you learned that week.Prof. Havlickova is a great professor, really helpful and nice!",
    "It's a really good class. I would recommend it to another student who is willing to put in a fair amount of effort.",
    "Miki is amazing! If you are considering Math 118 and she is teaching it, don't hesitate!",
    "Intro math courses at Yale are generally terrible (from what I've heard), but Miki was WONDERFUL. She's probably one of the best math lecturers at Yale and really really cares about her students (she always holds office hours every day for a week leading up to a test). I definitely feel like I've learned so much from her this semester and have a much more solid foundation in linear algebra and calculus. Take the class if you want more math and took Calc BC in high school, and absolutely take it with Miki",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. At first glance the material seems a bit difficult, but once you get into the swing of things it's fairly doable and simple. The class isn't too much work and it is entertaining. Miki is a great teacher, and if you ever need help she has plenty of office hours and review sessions. It's only about 10-12 problems a week and the midterms and finals have very good review sessions, so they're not too bad. I enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes; helpful combination of Linear and Multi-Variable for social sciences. Havlickova is organized in her presentation and is available to help.",
    "I would recommend this course - don't let the name scare you. Professor Havlickova is a great teacher and she holds a lot of office hours. Her review sessions are especially helpful. If you don't want to go too deep into multivariable calculus but still want to learn how to do it, take this course. It's very straightforward.",
    "Very good math course that is easily learnt by attending class as professor is very thorough in the practice of the math and teaches an easy way to go through the problems. Final is somewhat harder than most of the coursework though.",
    "Great class for those who like math but are not the best at calculus.",
    "Loved this course. Marketa cleared away the crap and taught us the concepts. She spoke very well in class, going from beginning to end at a fast but understandable pace, and gave students plenty of oppurtunity to meet with her and clarify confusing material better. Her tests were extremely well written- she managed to cover all the conepts covered in class without necessitating the usage of calculators \/ etc by making questions that had nice numbers to calculate. The course itself covered 2\/3rds of linear algebra and 1\/2 of multivariable calculus. Though designed for econ majors, it had no link to the field of economics- it taught the math as if it was another other math class, and it taught it well. If you're considering taking it next semester,",
    "This was a great class, only with Miki as the professor though. Many students in other years have complained about the bad teaching. That was the opposite this year. Miki was new to the class and she did an incredible job. The course work is not bad at all and the pace was perfect or even slow . I felt like I learned a lot (unlike math 115).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students. It is neither hard nor easy, the perfect happy medium.",
    "If you're like me and took a bunch of calculus in high school but remember nearly nothing, 118 was perfect. It takes you through the introductions of both linear algebra and multivariable, stopping before either subject really gets hard. Miki is a great professor, really clear, example problems in class were always relevant to pset problems, etc. I felt like I really conceptually understood the material.",
    "Yes. Solid math class.",
    "Not bad. I took it to fulfill the Econ math requirement and it was worth it.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this class to others. I found it quite interesting and a good level of difficulty, challenging but not overwhelming."
