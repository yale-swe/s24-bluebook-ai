    "Yes take it.",
    "Study of Civil Wars from the Micro and Macro perspectives via a case study on individual civil wars and rebellions of the last century. I would definitely recommend this--my favorite, and most enlightening political science class at Yale (I'm a junior).",
    "The class provides a fascinating introduction to general theories about civil wars whilst also compelling you to develop a close, focussed understanding of a particular conflict. The weekly memos are a good way of gaining this focus and learning to write in an engaging and effective manner. The midterm was quite unlike any test I've taken at Yale and even though it was extremely challenging it provoked me to think in a way that tests rarely do. The final report is also a stellar assignment as it gives you a chance to improve your ability to conduct comparative analysis and extrapolate on the basis of your study. I enjoyed the fact that professor Kalyvas started each class with questions and comments about contemporary conflicts. Most importantly, Professor Kalyvas is brilliant, engaging, funny and thought-provoking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class for someone willing to work hard who is really interested in the material. Definitely one of the most rewarding and interesting classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this class! If you can take more than one class with Prof. Kalyvas. He is brilliant and has such a love of teaching and his students.",
    "It's a lot of work -- a memo a week with research on the side -- but definitely shop it and take it!",
    "I think this class is great if you want to gain a deep understanding on a specific conflict. Every week a two page memo is due (you will have to write two pages single spaced to put in all the information you need to), so that was always my Sunday night of work. Professor Kalyvas is great, but be warned he is intense. He has no qualms about cold-calling on you in class and asking you questions about your specific civil war: questions you may or may not have answers to. Overall, amazing class and great experience!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! It was my favorite class this semester and probably one of the best I have taken at Yale as a whole! This being said, I did struggle with the format of the course (actually, the professor said he plans to change it). I devoted a lot of time and effort and I still felt as if it was not enough.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. Violence and Civil Strife was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale by far. The lectures were filled with a lot of great information and the structure of the class was really interesting. The independence of not having assigned reading but needing to do research on your chosen conflict took some adjusting to, but in the end I feel like I took so much away from this course. You have to be on top of your stuff though, your assigned conflict, current events in the news, etc. but if you are able to keep up this class is definitely worth it; be prepared though to not be too sure what your grade is throughout the course.",
    "Conflict studies takes a different turn in this class. You learn just how vast the field is, and end up leaving with an amazing amount of knowledge, yet knowing, too, that this is only the beggining of the mess that conflicts represent. It is a very interesting course, I would absolutely recommend it if not just because of the great professor Dr. Kalyvas is, then because if you are interested in peace resolution, history, political science, or causal mechanisms, you will find this class very interesting."
