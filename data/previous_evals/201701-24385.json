   "comments": [
    "I learnt a lot about financial assets, bond pricing, international trade, international finance and foreign exchange. The concepts covered were highly relevant and applicable to understanding current financial and economic issues.",
    "I took this course following undergraduate level intermediate macroeconomics and this was a really great way to revisit and better understand the information I learned in that course. It really helped situate abstract theories in concrete policies, issues, and government decisions.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of finance on both the domestic and international stage. I learned a lot about banking systems, trade deals and other very important parts of the economy that I did not understand before. This class was a great way to apply macroeconomic trends that I had learned in econ.",
    "The course is very helpful to get a holistic understanding of various issues in international economics ranging from trade models and financial flows to multinational organizations and global financial regulation systems. The problem sets were helpful in learning to access websites for financial or trade data, interpreting the same and using them for application to classroom material.",
    "I learned a wide range of necessary information in the field of international finance and economics.",
    "Financial skills, obtained a better knowledge in finance",
    "An understanding of international finance and international trade, and central bank actions.",
    "I deepened my understanding on international trade and finance theories through the course. After taking the course, I became able to explain the influence of free trade on domestic economies, the relation between policy changes and exchange rate, the mechanism of financial crises in emerging countries, and so on."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The pace of the lessons was often too fast for me and I struggled a lot trying to keep up with the content during the lesson. More practice questions could have been discussed in class for students to reinforce concepts covered and to assess our grasp of the material before moving on to new topics.",
    "I really appreciated how Sigga put all the content into the context of real world interactions and policies, and directly related it to global affairs, including through news articles and reports. I also liked the combination of quantitive work and more theory. The open office hour sessions and weekly problem sets were enormously helpful. Sigga was always very patient with us and happy to help figure out ways to make concepts make more sense to us when we didn't understand. Sigga's anecdotes about her personal experience in this field also helped ground the materials (and were fun to hear!) The textbook was also a key resource. Sometimes Sigga spoke so fast it was hard to keep up. She would ask if we had questions but I was still trying to process all the information and notes and couldn't yet figure out my questions.",
    "This course is very strong in its ability to touch up a large variety of subjects. I would have enjoyed learning more things in the field of international finance. I enjoyed learning bond pricing and using excel for psets, and would have enjoyed more of that. I think we could have spent less time on different models of trade, and more time on how international banks function.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is its broad applicability and the exposure it provides to multiple issues. For future semesters, I would hope to see more engagement between students and the instructor. There is a lot of room for this given that people from different parts of the world may have very different and insightful opinions on matters of trade or finance.",
    "I feel that the international trade component of this course could have been shorter. I also think it could be more interactive, in other words work through more problems together as a class. Otherwise I think the instruction and material of the course was very strong.",
    "I felt like the course could have been improved if analysis of current events were interwoven with the material so that we would be able to relate the models more directly to events and actions.",
    "Strength: The professor was energetic to enhance students' understandings. Her slides and explanation were well-organized and clear. Weakness: The speed of the course was a little too fast to follow."

   "comments": [
    "The course is rather fast paced and requires much time spent outside of lessons in order to understand the material thoroughly, however the content is wide in breadth and depth and useful for a student seeking financial knowledge.",
    "yes definitely. I think it works for both lay-people who aren't whizes at finance or econ but want to be able to understand this material as it impacts the real work, as well as people who specifically study these topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was fun, interesting and well taught.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course because of the experience of the instructor, which can be drawn upon to understand complex global issues in an easy way. The course also provides room for independent thinking, and to any one interested in International Econ, many avenues for research and discussion are presented.",
    "Yes, for any student interested in international economics it is an essential course. Very interesting and helpful.",
    "Dependent upon their interests.",
    "Yes I would. The course covers all the contents of Krugman-Obstfeld-Melitz, an authoritative textbook of international trade and finance theories."
