    "take it for sure. great very interesting class. just midterm and final.",
    "absolutely! this class made my interested in majoring in political science!",
    "The grade is composed entirely of two tests, so its pretty important to stay up on the readings, which are manageable but not super short. Nuno is a baller professor. He's hilarious and he rarely put me to sleep. Overall, a solid poli sci seminar, for majors and non-majors alike.",
    "Yes! This course is excellent for political science majors and those interested in international politics. Also, it is a good \"gut-course\" if you take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "This is a great poly sci class to take and Monteiro is an amazing teacher. You will have a good time in this class and learn a lot. The only downside is there is quite a bit of reading, but most of it is relevant to the subject.",
    "If you are interested in grand strategy or the modern conduct of warfare, you must take Balance of Power! If you are interested in the structure of power among states in the modern world you should take Balance of Power. If you are interested in military history, especially during the first and second World Wars then take the course! There is a lot of worthwhile reading and you should do it!",
    "This class is fantastic! The material is great-you look at the history of the past century in an entirely new light. We also got into current issues, and it was really interesting, and I definitely have a better understanding of international issues and US's relation to the world. Professor is great! Engaging lecturer, funny, and genuine. There is a lot of reading (about 160 pages per week), but it's worth reading if you have the time. You can also skim if you need. Definitely recommend it!",
    "This is a fun and different class. Professor Monteiro is very entertaining. You will learn about military history and strategy. The theoretical underpinnings of the class (naemly the theories about the balance of power) seemed pretty weak to me, but it didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the course.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Professor is awesome, I really think he is one of the best I've had. Workload is fairly light, and tests are manageable.",
    "Nuno is wonderful! He's the best professor I've had at Yale in terms of lectures, in spite of the fact that the readings he chooses aren't necessarily the most interesting or accessible - they're mainly very dense political science papers. I would definitely take the class if you're at all interested in political science, or even if you're just thinking about being interested - I took the class in the hopes of figuring out whether or not poli sci would be a good major for me, and even though I decided against it I was very glad I took BOP - I felt that I got more out of this class than most others I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Best course I have ever taken. hands down.",
    "Best course I've taken at Yale. The professor is hilarious, the material is really interesting. It's all about wars\/things like that.",
    "Definitely recommend this class, if you are interested in political science, history, international studies, or just want a great lecture course dealing with diplomatic and military conflicts.",
    "Tons of reading, you can get away with not doing them. Great class regardless. If you're interest in Poli Sci it's a must take.",
    "Great class for those new to the PoliSci department. Nuno's the man, and it's necessary to experience a professor like him at least once in your college career. History and foreign policy make sense with this professor and through this class; it's certainly a opportunity to be taken advantage of.",
    "history of conflict from ww1 to the present",
    "I recommend Balance of Power for anyone with an interest in the military\/political\/material factors in international relations and for anyone who wants to learn about military history from WWI to the present. This is very much course grounded in history and less so in the abstract theories we discuss only a minority of the time. Please be aware that because the course is only two exams and no section but has a good deal of reading, it is not a lot of work on average weeks but preparing for exams depends on personal initiative. Don't be one of those who skipped many lectures. I had a good time with the exams, but there's a lot of writing in a short amount of time.",
    "Strongly recommend for anyone interested in military or strategic issues.",
    "Good class. Take it.More in depth answer: this class is, in all honesty, not quite the gut I was expecting it to be (you needed to take good notes in the two weekly lectures, and - if you wanted to actually do the reading - it was very difficult to cram it all in the days before the midterm and final). This is one of those college classes that only has two grades (midterm and final) so most of the year no one is checking to see if you are paying attention, there, or learning anything. But Nuno is a fantastic teacher who makes fun of the Russians, Freud, the French, the Portuguese (even though he is one) and the Iraqi National Army ('ding-dongs with sticks'). You also come out of the class with a LOT of know-how regarding one of the basic theories in political science and security studies, and with the ability to have some pretty technical-sounding conversations about the role of air power in regime change and whether the Afghan Model is a broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum tool for US intervention policy.So yeah, take it.",
    "Just take this class. It focuses on political theories in such a great way. The only other class that comes close to using similar concepts is International Security, but having taken both, I can say they go hand-in-hand, and Balance of Power has expounded upon political theories in a way that now makes any political science course easier to approach.",
    "It is a class that is almost more of a military history class and a class of strategy. If you like watching the history and military channels this is a great class. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "The lectures were usually pretty interesting and entertaining; Monteiro is really funny. There was basically no work in the class, aside from the midterm and the final which is worth 65% of your grade and in that sense is quite stressful. Some of the readings are really dry. I think the class gave me a good overview of WWI, WWII, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It would probably be a good class to take credit\/d.",
    "This is a good class for learning about some IR theory and a lot of military history. It's also not hard (just a midterm and final - reading is not really covered on either). I would take it if it sounds good to you.",
    "Yes, take it, great professor",
    "Take it, the class is amazing, it taught me more than any other class has.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an introduction to International Relations.",
    "favorite political science class, feel like i really learned a lot with practical appications for understanding international politics",
    "This class is pretty heavy on military history and international relations theory, so it might not be for everyone, but it was a rather interesting look at the way the politics of war has been carried out since WWI. The last few lectures provide interesting perspectives on future competition with China and other states that I now want to learn more about. I'd recommend.",
    "It is an interesting course that if you like history and political science, or war and theories, you would love. It's a great class.",
    "The best class at Yale. You have to take it. The subject matter (guns and bombs and when to use them\/why they were used) is interesting and Prof. Monteiro is an up-and-coming all-star in the academic world. Gem.",
    "Yes. This course is not hard, the reading is not important (so don't be intimidated by it), and the material is fantastic. Professor Monterio is GREAT and his lectures are clear.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for an overview basically of the last 60 years of US and world military interactions. Also good theory. I'm not a political science major and I thoroughly loved it. Also not much work and fairly graded.",
    "This is a good choice as a introduction to international relations if you are comfortable with the amount of reading.",
    "Take this class. It's really awesome. Not too difficult, but you will learn an absolute ton. Really great!",
    "take it if you like military history. if you don't, think long and hard before hand."
