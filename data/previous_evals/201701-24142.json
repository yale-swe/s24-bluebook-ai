   "comments": [
    "I did not know much about militarization and securitization before taking this course. This course opened up a whole new area of study for me.",
    "I gained valuable insight on the vast social, political, and economic consequences of US militarization abroad and domestic. I learned how to connect various ideas together in the classic WGSS method and furthermore how to maintain a critical eye on everyday life.",
    "I learned so much about militarism at home and abroad, but in particular how it affects sociality, life, and identity at home. Fantastic course!",
    "This course offered a way to delve in to feminist theory through the lens of today's politics surrounding militarization. Before taking this class I would not have been able to tell you what the gendered aspects of militarization and policing were, so I am really grateful to have taken this class as it opened my mind up to a totally new way of viewing militarization domestically and abroad. Writing reading responses every week was a helpful (if daunting) practice in synthesizing what I had gleaned from the readings and making my own argument briefly.",
    "This class is a lot of work but it is a very unique class. Perhaps the people who are drawn to interesting interdisciplinary courses like this are very thoughtful, but both the readings and the people are amazing. The professors are both very understanding, and they work you very hard (one reading response a week, a presentation), but its all very engaging so it doesn't feel like you are working.The class is a bit weird, a lot of it is focused on surveillance, but you come out of it more aware of the broader structures of American imperialism and how everything is affected.",
    "The course was wonderful in its exploration of the complex interactions between capitalism, the military industrial complex, and various issues of race, class, and gender. The dialog was always lively, the professors kept everything running smoothly, and we never ran out of new ideas. The readings provided an excellent window into the vast topic of the militarization of identity.",
    "The intersection between militarism, securitization, gender, race, colonialism and imperialism. It was especially great to examine and learn about the less obviously militaristic aspects of contemporary culture, such as gated communities, security technologies, etc., and how much of that is intimately bound up with race and racism, sex and sexism, and other forms of power and oppression."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Everything. This course was perfect. It deftly moved from theory to praxis and class discussions were always engaging and exciting. Everyone was happy to be there and seemed genuinely upset that it was ending. Weakness: Only once a week :( Also if anything I would've preferred maybe more formal writing assignments and fewer reading responses because I felt like I rushed through the latter and would've taken more time with the former.",
    "I felt like sometimes the readings are hard to connect to that week's discussion topic. The class has a very strong group of students who self-select into it--the community is the best!",
    "I thought the readings in this course were incredible and the assignments enabled me to really engage with the material and with insights gained in our class discussions. As for weaknesses, I wish we had talked more about the notion of alternative geographies mentioned in the syllabus.",
    "The strengths of this course were in its wonderfully engaged professors, the engaging readings, and our wonderful classmates. The only weaknesses but I can think of might be in the organization of the course. There were a few times when I thought one week's readings felt redundant (to the previous week) or completely random given the previous week's readings.",
    "It was perfect!",
    "The amount of reading was, for me, completely impossible to get through. As a result there was typically one reading a week I didn't even get to or only skimmed. I think I would have been more engaged with the material if there was less of it -- 2 instead of 3 articles a week, maybe -- so that I would have had the time and space to truly unpack it. Also, I actually think this course would have benefitted by meeting twice a week for a shorter period of time than once a week for two hours. I think by the end of the two-hour block, brains would be fried and our discussion would suffer. Meeting more regularly would also force students to stay on top of the reading.",
    "I don't think there are many weaknesses of this course. I think some of the readings are a bit strange and hard to talk about (like the balloon perspective reading for example), but the course is extremely well designed especially for a graduate student who is teaching a seminar for the first time.",
    "The class always moved along at a quick pace, running through an ambitious syllabus admirably. Even so, the class never felt rushed, and we always had the time we needed to discuss whatever ideas came from the reading.",
    "I think the breadth of issues this course examined was great, but sometimes felt like we were missing the underlying political grounding and frameworks to develop coherent critiques of imperialism and militarism. For e.g., we spent some time examining the contradictions of liberal \/ imperialist feminisim re the security state, but it'd also have been nice to explore in depth what kind of politics we could articulate in response if liberalism and neoliberalism aren't the answer."

   "comments": [
    "Take it. Both Gavriel and Inderpal are genius sweethearts. This is an amazing course for WGSS majors eager to break out of the realm of just theory and actually presents political science concepts in an exciting, rigorous way. I felt like I learned so much about global politics that I didn't know before as well.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this course. It's very accessible for students both within and outside the major--your background doesn't matter even though this is a higher level seminar. Some of the best discussions I've ever had in a class!",
    "I definitely recommend Militarizing Gender & Sexuality! Prof. Grewal and Gavriel are incredible instructors. I rarely find myself in classes where most of the material is completely new to me. This course really opened my eyes and I highly recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another Yale student. Professors Gavriel and Inderpal are wonderful seminar facilitators in their encouraging and challenging questions. The material of this course is fantastic and I believe what you learn in this course will change your perspective profoundly in that you will always consider things with a critical eye that has been sharpened by this course. You may become an anarchist or a socialist by the end of this class, to the dismay of the average Yalie, but don't fear!",
    "Definitely recommended! Really excellent!",
    "I would recommend this class with the caveat that it is a lot of work and a lot of very high-level theory readings. But it is incredibly enlightening and I genuinely enjoyed the work for this class. I wish I had reached out to Gavriel and Prof. Grewal more throughout the course of the class, especially as this was my first WGSS seminar and I sometimes felt lost or intimidated -- but overall, I'm really glad I took this class, the discussions are really exciting, and the readings gave me new perspectives and connections I would never have otherwise made.",
    "Definitely take this class if it is offered again! I took it first because I was interested in international studies and heard Inderpal Grewal was a good professor. This class made me declare a WGSS major and I gained so many friends out of it. The entire class is extremely supportive and the conversations are always extremely thoughtful.",
    "Absolutely! It's an amazing class taught by two amazing professors, with great readings, and a structure that encourages the exploration of how critical theory can be applied to current goings-on.",
    "Take this if you're at all interested in the intersection between militarism, securitization, gender, race, colonialism and imperialism. It was especially great to examine and learn about the less obviously militaristic aspects of contemporary culture, such as gated communities, security technologies, etc., and how much of that is intimately bound up with race and racism, sex and sexism, and other forms of power and oppression."
