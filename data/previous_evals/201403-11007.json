    "- a course that offers a broad and inclusive sweep of western models for approaching art history; beneficial for those especially studying western art history - I would recommend for its provision of tools and theoretical frameworks for study of art",

   "comments": [
    "Yes, my background is not in European painting and it was very helpful to gain a greater familiarity with the methods pertaining therein. Beyond this, I do think that even in the work that I do outside of that area I was pushed to think more critically about what it means to study the history of art and have begun reflecting on my own work in a new way. I still feel I have a lot of \"methods\" work to do in my own discipline and would have appreciated if the course had covered some of that terrain, but I think my discipline in particular can benefit from some of the critical approaches we covered in class so I appreciate the opportunity to become more familiar with them.",
    "I mostly focus on visual culture, and thankfully there were weeks that surprisingly and delightfully addressed this!",
    "It's an excellent introductory seminar.",
    "This course offered a strong overview of major methodologies in the history of art and helped me sharpen my understanding of my interests and approaches."
