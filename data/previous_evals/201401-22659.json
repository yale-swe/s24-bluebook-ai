    "A comprehensive overview over microeconomics. As equal time is spend on each topic some harder topics are very hard and easier topics are even easier.",
    "Yes. I would recommend Econ 501 to another student.",
    "A good class but required lots of work.",
    "It is a very theoretical course that builds strong basis for future economic research. If you feel that your quantitative skills are not really strong then I would discourage you to attend the course.However, if you're looking for a challenge and you're interested in economic research, then this is the perfect fit for you.",
    "very interesting material, very well taught, the material covered is very important in economics in general",
    "You have to take it. It makes a person like me who wasn't going to do any micro thinking about it.",
    "Very interesting, if interested in theory. But heavy workload.",
    "It's necessary for an econ PhD student.",
    "NA-a compulsory course",
    "Yes as a department requirement for Econ or Finance.",
    "Sure! Definitely necessary for econ PhDs.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend the course to other Economics Phd students but not to other students, since the things that are taught are mainly of relevance to economics modelling and only partially relevant for other things",
    "Rquired course of 1st year econ students."
