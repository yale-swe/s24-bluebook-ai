    "This semester I wanted to research a few issues in the art of construction and building. I set a few goals in the beginning of the semester and was very happy that John Patkau worked with me actively to help me achieve a satisfactory understanding of the issues I was interested in. He is a great builder and has immense knowledge to resolve problems of many natures in the context of the built world. It was a pleasure to work with him in this regard.",
    "Exploring my interest on architectural design through form finding process was my expectation. Since I was able to concentrate on development the architecture space from initial idea, my expectation was met very well.",
    "I expected to develop a highly tectonic, resolved building engaging questions of materiality, structure and systems. While this was not necessarily the case, I still believe the studio experience to be valuable. The studio became a more focused, individual process-oriented exploration.",
    "Refreshingly absent from the studio was a formal or process agenda--rather, the requirement was simply that each project be interesting, constructed from our own interpretations of the site and a brief brief on the program. As this was my last studio, I expected to take advantage of the studio's supportive, open-minded environment to solidify my stance towards architecture and my own dormant interests. I believe, with John and Tim's guidance, I was able to accomplish exactly that.",
    "The expectation to further develop an idea so it informs the techtonics of the building was met by the studio.",
    "I expected to be pushed and encouraged by my critic(s) to pursue a project that was of interest to me. Not only was this expectation met, my critics were my advocates every step of the way, helping me find value in some of my early studies and sketches. John and Tim consistently asked the right questions and gently pushed us up in scale and level of development. The result was a project I\u0092m very proud of, both because I know it was truly my own vision but also one I had much support and encouragement in the refinement of."

   "comments": [
    "As always, I think it is nice to meet with the critic every other week, rather than on a weekly basis. This has allowed me during my advanced education here to focus with more time on the work and produce more substantial material for review. John came only a few times this semester, but when he was here, he was very present, engaged and actively dedicated to the discussion of student work.That said, I think that the choice of the in-house critics must be more rigorous. The full time critics that the school chooses to attend our studio on Monday and Thursday should not only perform a housekeeping duty. We are aware that there are organizational issues and challenges that must be overcome, but much can be done by the students alone - I don't think the school should hire a critic to act on this account. The critic, instead, should be someone who can play the role of an instructor with a deep intellectual, creative and engaging architectural character. Much was lacking in this respect this past semester.",
    "The most valuable aspect was desk-crits becauseinstructors effectively helped to construct individual ideas from each initial concept. If we had more pin-ups, discussion between students would have been more active and been helpful for developing projects.",
    "I believe the range of projects in the studio is a credit to the instructors. There was a clear imperative for creativity and process. However, the path to resolution could have been a bit more structured. Intermediate critiques focusing on translating the abstract concept into a proposed architecture could have aided in more resolution in the instance of several projects. This has more to do with my individual expectations, but I believe that the instructors are gifted in this area of design, and would have appreciated spending more time discussing building means and methods in order to execute the idea.",
    "It would have been helpful if John was personally available more often for comment and critique, although I understand he was limited by his professional responsibilities. However, when he was present in New Haven he usually made himself available both Thursday and Friday, which was productive.",
    "I think it would be beneficial to the students to have at least a few pin-ups over the course of the semester inorder to practice articulating the project to a group before the final review.",
    "There was a good balance of pin-ups, desk-crits, group discussions, reviews with outside experts etc. We received just enough outside input at the right moments in the semester for it to be valuable and constructive to our process. John was extremely dedicated during his visits to meeting with us one-on-one at least once if not twice in one visit. He was very involved in everyone\u0092s progress, as was Tim. The one area I wished we had a little room for was small-group pin-ups or group desk-crits. The crits with John proved so productive that often times we would sneak in to eaves-drop on a classmate\u0092s crit, or vice-versa. I would have loved to have seen the process of my classmates\u0092 projects and benefit from their input in a small-group setting. However, given how much we were able to accomplish during this semester given John\u0092s strict schedule, if small-group pin-ups had to give way to more energy spent on personal desk-crits then I truly have no complaints. To achieve eleven diverse projects that reflect each students\u0092 different interests and talents to the level of development that was reached, is no small feat for any advanced studio. I hope for the sake of future classes that John Patkau continues to return to teach as a critic here at Yale for many years to come."
