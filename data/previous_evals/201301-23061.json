    "DO NOT TAKE. NO STOP. JUST DON'T.",
    "If you have to take any research methods class, take this one. It's interesting, the professor is really nice, and the work is manageable.",
    "PSYC260 is an interesting course if you are interested in mental disorders. As a research methods course, it is very confusing and has the effect of discouraging going into research because the statistical methods are overwhelming and not fun. I would recommend the class on the basis of the lectures because they were fascinating. I would warn that the homework and projects are extremely difficult to carry out, however.",
    "This class was very reasonable terms of workload \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only after you learned how to use obscure programscalled SAS and Mx. There were only a few homework assignments, a midterm, a final, and term paper. However, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I can say I actually learned any research methods from this class. Already taking genetics was very helpful; many of the chapters for reading were review. This class will fulfill your research methods requirement, but no guarantee it will actually help you with future psych research projects.",
    "That was a bit of a rough class! Hard to stay focused because of the time (9:25-11:15 Friday mornings) and because of the dry content. Didn't help that lectures were basically read from the slides. Gets the research methods requirement out of the way though. Be prepared to find a stat lab in order to do the weekly problem set. Not to bad if you've taken intro stats, but I would have been lost without it.",
    "Take stats before taking this class. Problem sets were programming based that required quantitative reasoning skills to answer. Final and Midterm were both harder than I expected, but thankfully are not weighted heavily. Final paper was important and carried the most weight, as it should since it was a final display of all that we learned. For a research methods class, this was totally fair. Meeting once a week was nice but unfortunately it was early Friday mornings."
