    "Take it if you have to. It's not a difficult class -- basically the first half of high school AP calc, but sometimes the problems chosen for the exams and psets are technically difficult even if the concepts are very simple. You'll be bored but it won't kill you.",
    "Great course. Take if you want refresh of AP Calc AB.",
    "If you're looking for an easy QR this is it",
    "You're only taking this if you have to. C'mon.",
    "This class was very difficult. Even with a precursor of AB calc in high school I still found the material new and difficult to grasp. I recommend getting a tutor right away and scheduling meetings for every week if you think you might need it.",
    "I would summarize this course at a great review of the fundamentals of calculus, with some new material that is not covered in AP Calculus AB thrown in. I would recommend this course because it is a great refresher and builds a solid foundation for the higher level math classes.",
    "If you need it then obviously take it otherwise I don't know why you would consider it",
    "It is a good refreshening for math.",
    "Maybe. Depending on whether they are interested in math or not.",
    "I was profoundly disappointed in this course. I took Calculus in High School and while not naturally gifted in it, I worked hard and excelled in the class. Math 112 class was supposed to be a repeat of that same material (from High school) but made relatively simple concepts confusing and frustrating. I am not going to be a math major, but if explained well, I have no problem understanding and learning mathematical concepts. But in this class I felt like if I asked questions, I was treated as if I were an idiot for not immediately understanding the material, which was discouraging to say the least. After the negative experience of this class, I will never take another math class at Yale. THe teaching was abysmal, the problems were straight out of the textbook and I got nothing more from class than I could have from reading the lesson at the beginning of each chapter. Yale might be better off hiring high-school calculus teachers who actually know how to teach, even if they won't someday have graduate degrees in the subject. The teacher never involved the class in what was happening on the blackboard and rarely checked in to see if we were following. I was also frustrated with the material covered in the course. Students taking math 112 are probably not the sort who are interested in the history of mathematical concepts\/proofs and yet we spent entire weeks on Newton's method (learning how a calculator works). THe textbook goes on many tangents, exploring subtopics or random little variations and the course seemed to blindly follow those tangents. All I wanted was a basic calculus course where I learned the foundational concepts of the subject and had a decent level of teaching. If you are trying to take a substantial, non-gut QR class, don't take this one, you will probably learn more and have a much more enjoyable time in a gut QR. I expected so much more from the Yale math department.",
    "Very boring and poorly taught. Take it only if you must for a requirement.",
    "It's an essential math class that will help you to understand calculus and derivatives. Great introductory course.",
    "Take if if you need a math credit.",
    "Intro to calculus that assumes you already have covered everything in calculus."
