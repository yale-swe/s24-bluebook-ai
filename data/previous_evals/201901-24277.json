    "Strengths: Clear-outlined training on developing a social-focused venture. Throughout the semester, many social entrepreneurs have been invited to the class to share their experiences. This has been super helpful to give students a better sense of entrepreneurship. Weaknesses: It is challenging to change ideas in the middle of the semester. Homework or assignments sometimes feel overwhelming and do not necessarily help with the idea generation and development.",
    "Strengths: excellent frameworks for designing and launching a startup. Weaknesses: not enough feedback from and direct engagement with instructor on the venture early enough to make important and necessary adjustments to fully maximize the venture."
