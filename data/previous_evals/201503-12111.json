    "The class is sort of a survey of a bunch of different German poets and that's pretty interesting. There is a lot of discussion about how poetry and music intersect as well. If you don't have any interest in music then maybe this class isn't for you. I didn't know the class had a musical component and I was mostly ok with it, but if you hate music then this probably isn't your thing. Also, if you don't like doing out of class readings then don't bother with this class. If you don't read the poems this isn't the kind of discussion where you can still be really involved.",
    "I recommend this course because it proceeds at a very manageable pace, the poetry is interesting, and Elisa and the other students bring helpful contextual information and experience with the poems. The essays, weekly forum posts and vocabulary quizzes and end-of-term poetry recitation are all quite rewarding.",
    "I would highly recommend GMAN 173 01 to a fellow student. It is a rigorous language course that allows many opportunities to practice speaking, writing and reading while exposing students to an important and fascinating literary tradition.",
    "This is a nicely-paced, engaging class that walks you through the canon of German poetry from Klopstock, Goethe, and Schiller to Benn, Brecht, and Morgenstern. It's a great syllabus, an enjoyable class, and a great way to improve your language skills. The assignments are challenging in a fun way and not overwhelming. Presentation assignments and recitations help with your speaking and pronunciation skills."
