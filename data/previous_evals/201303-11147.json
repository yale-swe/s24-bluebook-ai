    "If you want to learn German...",
    "I would not recommend it. The language is not very fun to learn and the random assignment of gender makes things frustrating. Really, if you just want to take a language to fulfill a distributional requirement, take Spanish, its a much more straightforward and fun language to learn.",
    "Rapid pace to quickly pick up the basics of German. Yes, I would definitely recommend.",
    "If you can stomach it, take the intensive course, especially if you'reinterested in the linguistics behind the language. If not---or if, asin my case, your schedule doesn't permit it---this is a more-relaxedalternative.",
    "German 110 was very well structured and took up little time at the beginning of the year. Around reading week the course-load gets a little heavy, but that's to be expected. I would definitely recommend German 110 to another student, it's a really fun atmosphere and I thoroughly enjoyed taking the class!",
    "This is a great German I section and since the professor is a native speaker and also not a TF, you really can't do better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "A language class that is a little less demanding compared to other language courses at Yale, but that does not mean you do not learn a lot of German, or watch a lot of German movies, and know a lot more about German culture and people.",
    "If you are looking for a new language to learn, German is there for you. The class is fun and welcoming to those with zero experience in language. Marion Gehlker is an excellent instructor."
