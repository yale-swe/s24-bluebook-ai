   "comments": [
    "This class offers a look at specific artists\/architects\/movements\/designers in Italian art since the end of the second World War. The topics we cover are really diverse, and the seminar brought in students from a wide range of academic backgrounds, which made for really interesting discussions. The diversity of topics that Prof. Ricchi brings into the seminar is one of the major strengths of this class. The opportunity to lead a seminar session is also really rewarding, if daunting.",
    "This course offers a good summary and background of postwar Italian aesthetic and design and offers a more well-balanced seminar-style class than most I've taken at Yale. The workload is never too demanding and it is easy to contribute to the conversation if you do the readings.",
    "The course is based upon a series of readings chosen by the instructor which are then discussed thoroughly in class. This is a true seminar style course where students have the ability to engage deeply with chosen material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I love the class atmosphere, the presentation-oriented teaching style and the freedom that we had in tailoring in our essays. The only improvement, as we discussed in class, could be to convey more factual information in the beginning of the class, which could pave the way for more structured discussions.",
    "The first half of the class is fairly straightforward, but the topics covered in the second half are pretty difficult. Things like radical architecture, Italian postmodernism, and the Italian garment economy aren't purely artistic or architectural, and demand that students weave in knowledge from a diversity of fields. This is rewarding, but difficult to do at first (and we aren't offered too much guidance on how to do this).",
    "The strengths of this course depend on the engagement of the students, as much of it is driven by presentations and student discussion. A weakness might be that it does not cover the period from 1945-present minutely, but rather in broad sweeps, focusing on particular architects or designs.",
    "Meeting twice a week for less time would probably be more fit."

    "I suggest Yalies to take any course that has \"Italian\" it.",
    "Yes! This is a great class, and it's really fun to interact with Prof. Ricchi and the other students in the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is both well-structured and delivers engaging material\/",
    "Highly recommended to history of art majors and lovers of Italian culture. Extremely eye opening in terms of immersing students in Italian Art Arch and Design, which was helped by the instructor, who is Italian herself.",
    "Interesting course. The readings are good and the class discussion lively."
