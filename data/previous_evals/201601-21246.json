   "comments": [
    "More demanding than Econ 115 (pop quizes, problem-solving sessions, no curve), but worth the work if you need a strong foundation to continue studying economics Katerina Simons gives fast-paced lectures but is always attentive and checks students are understanding the material. She is responsive and caring.",
    "This was a great class. I would recommend it to people. Everyone should have a basic understanding of the economy.",
    "The difference between this class and the the lecture is that you'll probably learn more in this class but like the grading is harder cause there no curve.",
    "Good intro to economics, would recommend taking the seminar I learned a lot, although the tests are hard"
