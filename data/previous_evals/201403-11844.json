   "comments": [
    "I really liked it! I thought the syllabus was really great, especially Both Hands Tied, The New Jim Crow and Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies. We talked about a lot of really important issues in American society that other classes definitely cover, but not always through the specific lens of structural inequality. Really interesting stuff. Manageable workload, although reading responses every week got kind of annoying. Highly recommend!",
    "Absolutely take it!! Really important things are addressed in this class, and everyone should learn about them in order to be well versed in the kinds of things that are going on around us every day.",
    "This class is a challenging reading load, but really great as an overview of the systemic inequalities in the United States today. The reading list is awesome and the class is engaging. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Amazing readings, gives you a great range of topics to read about in regards to inequality. The conversations will be dependent on who's in the class but the readings themselves and Prof. Taft direction did lead to some really interesting conversations. Take it if the topics interest you, its a reasonable amount of work and a great way to explore the complex issues covered.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Yes, definitely take it if you're interested in having a deeper understanding of the big instances of inequality that you know of but don't know THAT much about. The readings are great, but the class discussions can sometimes be a bunch of liberal AM STUD\/ ANTHRO kids jumping over each other to agree on the same point. The paper assignments aren't super hard, but be sure to check in with Prof. Taft before the first one to get a sense of what she's looking for, she's very helpful with directing you.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about socioeconomic and racial inequality in America. The readings are absolutely stellar, and the discussion is usually pretty good. Some of the themes and ideas get repetitive, but that's expected with a class like this.",
    "Absolutely take this course. This is one of the most interesting, powerful and important courses I've taken. The workload is very manageable, the readings are interesting and the material and class discussions will shock you, inspire you and embolden you.",
    "This course was great because it presented a more broad perspective of poverty in the US than is usually depicted. It went beyond the prevalent cases of minority poverty and showed cases of rural poverty and gambling, for example, without neglecting minority poverty - such as the racialized mass incarceration phenomenon. Class discussions were very interesting.",
    "I liked this class because, as someone with a background in journalism, it allowed me to think about these issues from a variety of different angles\/methodologies. I was worried that I would have a hard time because I don't have any formal anthro training, but it was fine. There is about a book or a book and a half a week, but the reading isn't terribly difficult, and the reading responses are manageable (500 words) and allow you to think about some aspect of the topic you find particularly interesting. The papers have pretty open-ended topics, which some people find frustrating and some people really like. I also really enjoyed writing the final paper because it was fun to apply the course materials\/concepts to a particular event\/issue that I was interested in.",
    "I personally really enjoyed this class, having not really known much about American inequality going into it, and feel like I walked away with more information about a lot of different aspects of societal inequality I previously was unaware of. I will say this class (obviously) had a very liberal tint to it based on both the material and the student makeup of the class, and would have benefited from more conservative perspectives, so take that as you will."
