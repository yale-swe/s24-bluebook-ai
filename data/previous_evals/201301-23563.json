What I was mainly looking to get was an understanding of the geostatistical background that underlies the operations in ArcGIS and I definitely feel like I learned this. It would be great if Dana could get involved with this course to make it more ArcGIS focused as well.",

    "Q3: This course does not have much assigned work throughout the term, which allows you to apply the material to you term project dataset. For me, this was an optimal model that provided more than enough to do, as well as assignments that were functionally more useful and interesting than they might otherwise have been.Q12: For anyone interested in GIS, remote sensing, or geospatial analysis, this course is a must. Spatial statistics are absolutely fascinating, and lend themselves well to other geospatial analysis."

    "This course is amazing - one of the best I took in my two years as an FES student. It is a perfect compliment to Dana Tomlin's GIS courses and provides many conceptually fascinating tools with which to analyze data. Tim and Jonathan play a nice tag team, and between the two you get great exposure to a variety of techniques and excellent in-class discussion. Both are humble in acknowledging that spatial statistics are complicated, and that neither of them know them as well as some of the other more traditional branches of statistics. This is great, and helps the students put their struggles of the concepts in perspective. I would take this course again if I could."
