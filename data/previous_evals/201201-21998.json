    "I'd recommend this to any history major looking to get possibly the easily credit for the major out there.",
    "Yep - if you need a history credit or an easy class",
    "Interesting and not difficult.",
    "A relatively easy and relatively interesting course that can work well as a ROW\/Pre-Ind all in one punch for a History major in a pinch.",
    "Take it",
    "Take this course if you are very interested in the subject or if you have to rake it to fulfill some sort of requirement in the history major, otherwise you can find another course to take twice a week that is better I'm sure.",
    "A good rest-of-world credit for history majors, yes, but also a good course in itself. The fact that there are no sections makes it one of the easiest history courses you can take here. Just make sure you go to every lecture.",
    "If you need a ROW gut, this will suffice. But be warned, the lectures are long and hard to follow, and you need to attend them religiously in order the keep up with the wealth of material Marcus throws at you. That having been said, the midterms are straightforward and easy, and the lowest of your three grades (two midterms and a paper, equally weighted) gets automatically raised by a full letter. Think long and hard about whether the light workload is worth the dull subject matter and confusing lectures.",
    "i would recommend this to any one who needs other world credit. its hard to follow sometimes if you have no background in the subject but it is a good course",
    "It's a good class, but you really do have to come to lectures and take good notes. My biggest regret was not speaking with Prof. Marcus more, he's a wonderful and very understanding, very interested instructor.",
    "Definitely recommended. Workload isn't terribly stressful and is a good way to fulfill requirements.",
    "This is a really easy rest of the world credit. Marcus is one of the easiest graders I've ever had here, and you don't really have to do the reading. The lectures can get long-winded and disorganized; sitting through an hour and fifteen minute lectures can be hard when you aren't entirely sure what the lecture is about. A good summary of Jews and Muslims, but be warned that it won't be the most interesting class you'll ever take.",
    "If you plan to pay attention to the lectures and do the readings carefully, you will probably get a lot out of this course. If you do not, it turns out to be an easy history row credit that is graded very easily. Either way, probably a win.",
    "Survey course concerning the lives of Jews in Muslim lands in the Middle East and Parts of Europe from around 500-1500.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. A great ROW and pre-industrial.",
    "Go for it. You will learn about a fascinating topic that is actually really relevant today, you won't break your back from work, and you will get to listen to an awesome lecturer twice a week.",
    "Only if you're very interested in the material, or looking for a very easy most-of-the-world credit.",
    "I would not recommend it because even though it sounds like an interesting subject that is important to both Jewish and Muslim history it does not cover enough to be worth the time commitment. If the class were more efficient I would probably recommend it.",
    "Do it. Gut."
