   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was structured so that even people with a basic knowledge of statistics could grasp it, yet it wasn't so basic that people with a more advanced knowledge would find it useless. Great class and very fair.",
    "I would recommend this class to somebody with a minimal or basic knowledge of stats.",
    "Yes, because it is required and gives you a good foundation for conducting statistical analyses for your research.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material covered is very useful for research in Psychology. Also, the course gives us hands-on experience with made-up and real data, so we get good practice applying the concepts and also working with SPSS.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, it was very helpful and useful to me as a researcher",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to another student, either one well-versed in stats (because of the emphasis on using equations in our actual research) or someone who desires a refresher course. I felt that it provided a great synopsis of the equations needed to build a good foundation for work in the field.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend the class to another student. If I wanted to take a statistics class, it would be because I wanted to know how to analyze my research data more effectively, and I felt I spent most of the time in this class doing analyses I can already do in SPSS by hand, which unfortunately is not knowledge I'll likely use in the future."

   "comments": [
    "It improved my knowledge of how to write a results section and how to interpret results sections. Very useful.",
    "The take-home assignments helped me understand how I might actually analyze my real data in the future. Also, I can now better understand other authors' results as I'm reading them, allowing me to be more critical of their work instead of too trusting.",
    "Of all the several statistics courses I've taken, this has been the most useful for the research that I may be doing. It really helps that Dr. Dovidio used examples from Psychology, so that we could see how the methods were applied to research in this field. Also the final project was to analyze our own data, so that really made the course relevant to our work.",
    "It was very helpful to my research",
    "This class provided excellent foundational tools for better understanding research in psychology and it was useful to get exposure to different techniques I could use going forward in my own work."
