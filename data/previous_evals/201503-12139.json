    "Take it if you need a writing credit and a light workload. Engaging material if you're willing to take the time to delve into it. I'd say it's definitely worth doing. This is one of those courses where you get out exactly what you put in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if human rights interests you! Work hard and you'll take a lot from this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a survey of human rights law with considerable freedom in terms of topics for open-ended writing assignments.",
    "I would say that this course is a seminar that provides a strong overview of international human rights issues. The latter half of the course was mainly peer research presentations with a specific country focus, which I really enjoyed. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in human rights through a real-life application or policy lens.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it is very interesting. You get to focus on one human right violation specifically for your final project whichIi thought was very cool. However, Professor Sanchez talks a lot. In other seminars I have been in, the talking has been left to the students, however that was not the case with this course.",
    "I would recommend Human Rights to anyone who wants an overview of existing human rights tools and an idea of current problems in human rights and their potential future.",
    "take it for a solid introduction to the theory of human rights, but note you will not be studying law."
