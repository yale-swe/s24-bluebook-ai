   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. You learn about the most pressing issues of the day from an incredibly accomplished ambassador. But you also learn a lot of important life\/career lessons.",
    "Take it if you can get in! You will not regret taking a class with Ambassador Negroponte.",
    "This course operates like an extended Master's Tea (which is a format that I enjoy). Each class, students review a theme based on a region (i.e. China) or a topic (i.e. weapons of mass destruction). Professor Negroponte provides students with stories to illustrate the concepts that we learn in class. I highly recommend this course to someone who (1) wants an overview of current events around the globe and (2) desires to learn from an amazing diplomat.",
    "Great class to get familiar with what is going on in the world, from someone who knows what theyre talking about",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It is a great overview of some of the key international topics that everyone (regardless of major) should have some familiarity with. Ambassador Negroponte is an amazing professor and is always willing to sit down with students and discuss career goals or assist with course assignments!",
    "A must take course, it will enrich your knowledge and round your vision",
    "If you are lucky enough to get into this class, you MUST absolutely take it! Be prepared for a whirlwind tour of all relevant issues in global security and be prepared for a lot of reading which will help you make sense of the world. This class will change the way you look at current affairs!"

    "This course helped prepare me for a career in international relations by giving me deeper knowledge about contemporary global issues and allowing me to learn from an incredibly accomplished practitioner.",
    "This course taught me about some of the on-the-ground realities that I would encounter if I were to become a diplomat. It also demonstrated to me the huge range of ways to become involved in international affairs professionally.",
    "Very much",
    "Introduced me to issues I was completely unaware of previously and allowed me to dive deeper into issues and understand how decisions are made at the highest echelons of power"
