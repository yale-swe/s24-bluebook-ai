   "comments": [
    "Further developed Spanish grammar and vocabulary. Also developed Spanish reading and writing skills as well. Good development of Spanish speaking skills with oral presentations and daily class discussions and activities.",
    "I learned so much in this class, due to its heavy weight on both speaking and writing. My writing definitely improved, but my speaking ability made gigantic leaps. Learning interjections and more transitions made conversations more natural, and advanced uses of the subjunctive allowed more for more complex expressions.",
    "My ability to understand, speak and write Spanish improved.",
    "My writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills all really improved.",
    "I believe my spanish improved.",
    "I learned how to connect literature, history, and art together in Spanish. Grammar structures, culture.",
    "Greatly improved all skills in Spanish",
    "My listening skills and speaking skills have improved by a lot. I have also learned much about the Spanish culture and history.",
    "I improved in my speaking, listening, and writing skills in the Spanish language. Daily greetings and verbal activities trained my speech and communication. What started as intermittent phrases developed into more complete thoughts and the time taken to translate my English visualizations decreased during the course of the semester. With assignments from the \"Cuaderno,\" reading stories such as \"Nosotros, no\" and \"Una buena inversion\" as well as those in the textbook such as \"El bobo del mvil,\" I felt thoroughly exposed to the philosophical and societal thoughts of hispanic writers. These thoughts varied, and they provided an array of discussion and writing prompts during our exams and class activities. SPAN 140 led me to understand some the social, political, and philosophical constructs of many cultures. I took up the insights of the time during dictatorial Chile, realizing what unity and invigoration of personal thought and ideas meant to the \"No\" campaign. I learned about the Venezuelan crisis, bringing facts about economic turmoil and the presidencies of Hugo Chvez and Nicols Maduro together to present in front of the class. During other activities, I was exposed to powerful metafiction, social perceptions on the use of technology, science, literature, politics, and many other truly engaging and relatable topics.",
    "This is a great course to take to advance your Spanish skills. At times it can be a bit heavy on work, given class does meet everyday, but it's definitely manageable. Take if you have a very solid understanding of grammar and are capable of writing 2 page compositions. It's also helpful to have very advanced speaking skills as much of the class is involves oral exercises as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course was developing Spanish speaking skills. More of a focus on developing Spanish vocabulary may improve it.",
    "This class met every day, which was both a strength and weakness. I wouldn't've furthered my skills as much if the class did not meet daily, but sometimes, a break would've been appreciated. There are no big stakes assignments in this class, which is great if you mess up the first few (like I did), but there are constant assessments that makes this course very tiring. There is definitely a lot of work involved in the course, although the capstone assignments made the progress evident.",
    "There was a LOT of busy work that felt overwhelming at times. I also wish we got feedback faster (return tests\/compositions\/etc faster) because there were constant assessments but not as constant feedback so it was hard to improve.",
    "Strengths: synthesizes different cultural aspects for more comprehensive class; gallery visits help integrate art and interpretation; novel teaches a bit of analysis in Spanish Weaknesses: oral exam at the end of the course I think should be different if you want to really evaluate speaking ability. I think it would be better if we read and analyzed the articles, and the questions asked during the exam couldn't be prepared beforehand.",
    "This course engaged the class frequently with discussion, reading, and writing in Spanish. In addition, the continuous practice with daily readings and assignments helped me facilitate a good development and comfort for the language. One of the most amazing things I find about the Yale Spanish sequence is its immersion into Spanish culture. SPAN 140 is no exception to the sequence and in fact, 140 may have facilitated the greatest growth in my knowledge about the language and culture. The weaknesses in this course are few to none, I cannot think of any that enter my mind.",
    "Course was conducted well, as long as you studied your notes and used the book for extra assistance when needed, you'll be good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is a great course to improve your Spanish reading, writing, and speaking skills. If you can take it with Ame Cividanes, I would highly recommend it - she's a great teacher, very engaged, and cares about her students succeeding. While there are a lot of assignments for this course, it's not much of a workload if you do a little work everyday.",
    "I would recommend this course with Cividanes in a heartbeat! SPAN 140 does certainly have 1.5 credits of work, but it's 100% worth it... Cividanes makes the class feel incredibly gratifying.",
    "Yes. As interesting as a grammar focused Spanish class can be.",
    "Yes. Definitely helps improve your Spanish. However, if your language requirements are already done I don't know if I would because it is definitely not an easy A",
    "Yes, if you would like to improve your spanish, take this course.",
    "Yes--it teaches you to analyze material in Spanish, which really improves your Spanish level. I enjoyed looking at history, art, society, and culture, which are major themes in this course.",
    "Yes. If one puts in the effort he or she will greatly improve",
    "Yes. This was a great course if you are looking to speak on a daily basis, hear and learn new vocabulary and idioms, analyze Spanish literature, and overall have a great time being immersed in a Spanish-speaking environment for less than an hour a day.",
    "I highly recommend this course to others. SPAN 140 tops the Spanish course sequence with a great emphasis on verbalization and composition in Spanish. One can learn the basic review of grammar starting with the subjunctive and ending with an introduction to prepositions and possessive pronouns, and concluding the class with the first Spanish novel for many of us to read. The professor(s) walks the class through the daily lessons to ensure we enjoy our time learning and communicating, which I also feel is a hallmark to every Spanish course I have taken so far here at Yale. Yes, the emphasis is on being able to communicate, as shown by the numerous in-class activities, projects and presentations, but the cultural awe and grammatical simplicity of the course make it most enjoyable and most conducive to one's learning of Spanish and hispanic cultures.",
