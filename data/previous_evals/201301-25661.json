    "I would absolutely recommend this course to fellow students. The course is, as it purports to be, a survey of the history of literary theory. It is all but necessary for students interested in literary studies as it presents various modes of thinking about texts. Furthermore, it presents a sort of critical lexicon which, even if not helpful for your writing, say if you subscribe to a different critical framework, certainly makes one's reading more beneficial as it allows you to gain access to a wide array of critical scholarship.",
