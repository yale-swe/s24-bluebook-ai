   "comments": [
    "Awesome course! Take this if you want to learn more about how to look at the world from an anthropological perspective and have any sort of interest in Southeast Asia. Most students had personal experience with the region (from there, parents from there, had traveled there), but I had no background in the area and still loved it. This definitely isn't a history course and you don't really end up with a comprehensive picture of what's going on in Southeast Asia, but you learn about a lot of really interesting topics and issues.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class to both people who have knowledge of the region, and also for those completely unfamiliar with SE Asia. This year, we had a lot of people from the countries we studied, which made it really interesting to hear their opinions and feedback. The class covers a variety of topics, and the workload is not overwhelming. A short midterm essay and a longer paper, but both are open-ended and interesting to write. Professor Harms is a really great professor who really engages students with the reading, and he incorporates cool media elements and even a blog with the class.",
    "Pros: Wide range of topics, in-depth knowledge of all countries in SE Asia, exposure to culture, history, politics of SE Asia, fun movies, good writing workshops,Cons: Too much reading, format of class is a bit scattered, random discussions that go off tangent, would have been better with one day of lecture and one day of seminarAlthough no prior knowledge of SEasia is required, it seemed like many students coming in had some, and probably gained more out of it because they could relate it to personal experience. Overall, reasonable amount of assignments: 4 reading response, one mid-term paper, one final paper.",
    "One of the few classes at Yale that provides a great overview of Southeast Asia. You learn a lot about many different themes (culture, religion, politics, history, art). Usually during each class you focus on one topic and one or two countries. Professor Harms is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject. The workload is not too bad - readings every week and two manageable papers. I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning more about Southeast Asia and like anthropology.",
    "This course is a great first exposure to Southeast Asian culture, politics, and demographics. It provides a survey of key challenges and issues in the region, and istaught in a fun, engaging lecture\/seminar format. I would highly recommend it if you are interested in the region, or are simply seeking to take an exciting, different kind of anthropology course.",
    "great survey of modern southeast asia. readings and films are fascinating. highly recommend",
    "Definitely take this class. It is the best introduction to a region that is not often studied at Yale. If you are not from Southeast Asia, you come away from the class learning so much and realizing the incredible diversity of the region. If you are from Southeast Asia, you would still appreciate the lively discussions in class (which challenge you to think about things you had never thought about before) and learning from a professor who's passionate about his work!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! You will learn a lot about a region of the world that is usually not talked about much, but is nonetheless full of richness and diversity, and is becoming increasingly important in the world both economically and politically. ANTH 244 covers the cultures, ethnolinguistic groups, religions, political structures, and economic development of the countries of Southeast Asia, and the challenges that have been brought about by modernity: colonialism, forming unique national identities, the influence of Chinese immigrants, the Cambodian genocide, etc. Professor Harms is awesome - I learned a lot from him and from the other students taking this course. Even if you've never taken anthropology before, you'll love this class!",
    "YES - this is a fascinating course that deals with various aspects of modern southeast asia. knew nothing about the region coming in, so no previous experience is necessary. assignments include a map quiz, short midterm paper, final paper (8-10 pages) - all on topics of your own choice which made it really fun. also 5 short reading responses throughout the semester. professor harms is very dynamic and engaging - you use all different types of media in this class to learn. watched a few movies, listened to music, posted blogs online..DEFINITELY take this class if you want to learn more about the region in a fun, interactive way",
    "Yes. This is a good introduction to the region. Don't expect to know everything at the end of it, because Southeast Asia is very complex. Even if you don't know anything about the region, take it anyway, just because the reading materials are so fascinating, and you will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you really want to understand Southeast Asia, you'll find few classes better than this one."
