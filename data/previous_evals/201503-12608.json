   "comments": [
    "A class about identity and the self, (what it means to be 'authentic'), looked at through many different lenses (mostly philosophy, but also gender studies, literature, sociology, politics, etc.). I would recommend it if you are interested in thinking about these questions and discussing them intensely with other freshmen. It can be a very rewarding experience if the entire class is very engaged, and Professor Khawaja makes it easy with her awesomeness (and knowledge, and engaging nature, interest in the material, etc.). My whole class LOVED the course and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Great professor and wonderful environment. WARNING: this class is a lot of philosophy, so if you are more into reading literature, I think you should reconsider taking this. I had a hard time reading a lot of these philosophical texts and then writing papers about them, but I ended up still having fun -- our discussions were great and I made a great group of friends in the class. The professor also hosts movies and brings food and those are awesome and lots of fun!",
    "This class is great for freshmen because it teaches you how to read and then discuss complex texts which you will have to do for the rest of your academic life and truly sharpens your critical thinking skills",
    "Yes! One of the best courses for freshman in philosophy and exestentialist thought. Must more application and reflection of the real world rather than other philosophy courses which focus on regurgitating the thoughts of past thinkers.",
    "Authenticity is a class that will push your thinking. You'll only be fully engaged in the class if you have completed the reading, so that is crucial. But the selections are quite enjoyable if you spend enough time with them.",
    "Authenticity was a fantastic seminar-- specifically, a great first semester freshman year seminar. As a result of the nature of the conversation & the movie screenings, we all became quite close as a class. The content is gripping and relevant, and Prof. Khawaja is exceptional. The workload is what you make of it. The reading can be difficult but is generally not too long. You get out of the class what you put in; you could definitely get by without doing much of the reading if you'd like. But where's the fun in that? If you're at all interested in ideas of authenticity, identity, or just philosophy in general, take this class.",
    "Professor Khawaja was great. To be completely honest if I were to write an essay outlining the Nature (*wink wink*) of the perfect teacher I would be thinking largely about Professor Khawaja. I felt motivated to give each reading a good effort and to catch up if I was behind because the seminars she led were too precious to miss. She managed to lead a free class discussion while also covering points the she had outlined before hand. Furthermore I felt like I got to know her at an intimate level at times and yet when I was in class it was clear that she was a Professor, which in my mind is an ideal. This course can either take up 6 hours a week or 14. But the more work you put in, the more you'll get out of it. In all honesty, there were a few readings I couldn't get through because I just wasn't into them, but even for those readings the class discussion inspires you to go back and see what you were missing. This class is a lot about the Nature of the Self (What is Me? How do we form our self-image? What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be alone? Are we always performing for others?) Take it if you want a great introduction to a lot of big-name philosophers and a lot I had never heard of, but remember that some readings will be tedious.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. I would tell new students that you will experience some challenges in understanding the material but with the help of Professor Khawaja and your classmates, you will eventually understand it and come to appreciate it. After taking this class, I definitely think differently about what it means to be authentic.",
    "An excellent class in which you will become very close with the other students. Reading material is pretty difficult, but it is worth sticking it out for the sake of the insight you will have gained by the end of the course."
