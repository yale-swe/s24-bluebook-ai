   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend The Ethics of War because it is a really powerful class for someone in any major, and it really is not too much work.",
    "It is a class that focuses on the interpretations and applications of Just War Theory, using case studies of modern and ancient wars. Lots of philosophy and historical reports reading. A lot of reading but generally interesting.",
    "It's a great, thought-provoking class. There's a load of reading, but it's not as bad as DS. Yes, you should definitely try and take it.",
    "Take it! But be prepared to study the readings every week and make quick, committed decisions about hypothetical situations in class.",
    "I would say that someone should take it if they really are interested in the subject matter, political science, or history. Otherwise, it is a lot of work, and definitely shouldn't be used as a gut course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested at all in political science or history.",
    "Really fantastic course; definitely take it if you can! The readings can be boring (particularly if they're straight factual accounts), but some are great. The course load is manageable, they professor is awesome. If you can get it, definitely stick with it!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in political science, philosophy, or law. The readings are brush upon all of those topics and give one a feel of what each is about. It is also just a wonderfully engaging class that requires constant attentiveness.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Overall, this was a good course that forced me to form and defend my own opinions on very interesting subject matter. Class discussions were intimidating, but they challenged me to form and defend my own opinions. Professor Carter came in to every class with a randomly-generated list of student names, and he proceeded to cold call the students. Essay topics were very difficult, but paper lengths were reasonable. Readings were not too long, but I needed to read very closely, take notes, and think about the material to feel prepared for class. I would have liked a little more feedback on my writing, but I appreciated that we could submit revisions of the grade-optional first essay.Professor Carter came down from the law school to teach this course, so it presented me with not only a great challenge but also a professor who could steer discussions exceptionally well.",
    "The most reading in a class of any I've ever had. Professor Carter will hold you responsible for the reading when he cold calls. But, it was my favorite class freshman year and learning from a man as distinguished as Professor Carter makes the class invaluable.",
    "If this class is offered again and you can get in, TAKE IT! It really was a rare experience taking a 20 person seminar with one of the top professors at Yale Law school about very interesting material. There are three papers in the class and you must do the reading because the professor marks participation, but the workload is not that bad. The papers are not graded too easily, but they are graded pretty fairly. The course readings are interesting and rarely get repetitive. If you do not get into the class originally, but are still interested, talk to the professor and continue going to the class; you may get in. Definitely take!",
    "I'd definitely recommend Ethics of War to another student as an intensive survey of just war thinking, and a really excellent discussion seminar.",
    "Everyone who can should take this course. I was never once bored in class and looked forward to the seminar each time. Let's hope Prof. Carter can offer this course more generally--as the classroom was packed with around 75 freshmen on the first day. The course should be even more popular after its initial success.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in looking at current and past military engagements through the analysis of the great thinkers and christian philosophers."
