    "A broad yet in-depth overview of English poetry from the second generation of Romantics to the first generation of Modernists. The course constantly taught me how to be a better reader of very complex and challenging poems.",
    "Possibly my favorite class at Yale so far. I feel like I have a much better idea of the \"course\" of poetry between the 19th-20th century. Discussions were always interesting and I learned a great deal about each poet on the syllabuseven those I thought I knew well.",
    "Close reading, essay writing, etc."

    "The course is well-structured and well-taught. Little to improve.",
    "The course had a very strong selection of poets and poems, and the workload was very manageable. Prof. Bromwich was always incredibly incisive and impressive in his commentaries. We need more seminars like this in the English Department.",
    "The syllabus is fantastic -- I don't think there's any other course at Yale that offers this kind of overview of such a rich century of English poetry."

    "Yes. It's a fantastic survey of some of our most important poetry taught.",
    "Absolutely yes! If you love reading poems and are interested in learning more about the trajectory of English poetry from the early-19th to the early-20th century, then this is the course for you. Prof. Bromwich will constantly astound you with his critical acumen and analytical rigor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested. Everyone in the class made insightful comments and every class was fascinating and well-paced. Though the class didn't assume a great amount of prior knowledgejust having engaged with poetry before in some formit felt as though everyone in the class was very well prepared, and that was a little intimidating at first. But Professor Bromwich really took the time to consider each of our contributions, which, if you're a student who is hesitant to share in class, is incredibly encouraging.",
    "Yes. Not a ton of work, a brilliant professor, and an incredible syllabus.",
    "I'm not sure if this class will be offered in the future, but if you do get a chance to take a poetry class with bromwich, I would do it. He is a brilliant reader and has great taste. The syllabus for this class was fantastic, and I feel like I have a good grasp on all the poets we read thanks to his guidance."
