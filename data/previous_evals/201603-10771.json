    "Massive amount of in-depth exposure to great poetry.",
    "The class was a great introduction to some of the major English poets since 1950. I learned how to read verse and think critically about what's happening in a poem. I learned about strategies and styles poets adopt in writing poetry.",
    "I really liked this class. I learned a ton about poetry and poetic analysis. I had very little prior knowledge, so it was really neat to learn so much.",
    "close reading, critical analysis, writing skills",
    "I get so much more out of reading poetry now--it was really great to read so many poems and learn to articulate what I liked and what I didn't. A really great class!"

   "comments": [
    "DOPE COURSE with a lot of focus on autobiography, but generally thorough and interesting readings and lectures.",
    "Strengths--broad overview of poetry since 1950, really knowledgeable professor, good mix of close reading and background in lecture, great supplementary activities (i.e., poetry readings, Merrill house visit, access to Reddy's manuscript). Weaknesses: lectures sometimes felt meandering, section could be hit or miss in terms of quality of discussion, some busy work-type assignments in sectoin, and I wish we hadn't had both a final exam and a final paper.",
    "I think we had a nice mix of different styles of poets, and I felt like I learned a lot that I will be able to take into my own learning process outside of the classroom.",
    "strengths= the material and the readings discussed in lecture and section weakness= i would have liked to have more direct contact with professor hammer"

    "It's such an inspiring and lovely class. Really great readings and lectures.",
    "Great introduction to many of the major poets writing in English since 1950. Each week, the focus is on a different poet; you'll inevitably enjoy some more than others, but overall the reading is fantastic. Professor Hammer is as knowledgeable as anyone in the world about these poets and does a great job blending background and close reading in his lectures, although his style of lecturing can be a little meandering. There was a manageable though not insignificant amount of work (two papers, 4-5pg and 8-10pg, and midterm and final exams), and the readings week-to-week are very doable since for the most part the poems read quickly. Even though it's a lecture, Professor Hammer cares a lot about his students and that really helps make the class engaging and enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely. I think it is an incredible opportunity to learn a lot about poetry from a terrific, kind professor. It opens your world up to exploring more poetry in the future.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "i would recommend this class to any student looking to read some of the best poetry in the american canon. i think you definitely have to have some interest in english to fully enjoy this class and get the most out of it as possible",
    "Yes! This class is suited for students looking to expand their knowledge of poets, poetic form, and literary history.",
    "Great way to learn how to read poetry and engage it across a period of time",
    "Yes!! The reading is really short (relative to other English classes) and I always enjoyed it. And I loved the open-endedness of the second paper--this class gives you the space to get what you want from poetry, which is really great."
