    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students interested in art. Not only do you improve in your technique, but you also develop your own sense of style. The teachers are very encouraging and only want to help you become a better artist. Especially if youre looking for a seminar-type setting, this class is will be for you.",
    "Intro this semester has been pretty chill in comparison to previous years because of the sudden staff change. I loved Torkwase but wish that we could pick up the slack a little and made more work. But painting in general will teach you so much about looking and approaching visual creations. I don't know who's teaching it next year but I would recommend painting to anyone.",
    "Generally a good class I think, but was pretty disorganized this term. TA was amazing."
