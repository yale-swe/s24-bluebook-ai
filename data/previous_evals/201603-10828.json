   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed a better understanding of the history of various Asian diasporas and experiences unique to diasporic communities.",
    "Learned about Asian migration, socio-cultural issues, politics and much more. The discussions drew from our readings and personal experiences.",
    "I learned how to understand the categories of \"Asian\" and \"diaspora\" as very unstable categories and how to extend the idea of conventional diaspora to think more broadly about the movement of people in general",
    "I've never taken an ER&M class before, so perhaps some of what I got out of this course was related to the fact that it was listed in that department. That said, I learned so much about how to analyze history and culture from this class. We read academic articles, creative writing, and textbooks and watched documentaries, from which I developed a clear sense of how multifaceted the topic of \"Asian diasporas\" is, how indefinite the labels \"Asian\" and \"diasporic\" are, how much work there is left to be done -- and how exciting that work will be. We grappled with huge questions about belonging, citizenship, agency, and authenticity, among other topics. Overall, the class was a lot of fun, and I think I gained not only the vocabulary but also the confidence to begin discussing issues like what it means to be Asian (American).",
    "I gained a good vocabulary for talking about the diasporic experience. I also think I learned some really valuable lessons in terms of understanding the complexities of identity and race. This class was a great blend between historical background and analytical discussion. I also learned a lot about myself and my family's history in the process of taking this course.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the construction of Asian diasporas and an appreciation for an academic approach to learning about nationalities and belonging. This course also allowed me to think critically about the formation of my own identity and the factors that have shaped it.",
    "different theoretical frameworks for looking at history, strategy for social movements, \"Asian\" as a concept",
    "A survey understanding of Asian migration within and without Asian countries. Questioned race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, and class as constructs. Practiced historical analysis.",
    "This course really makes students aware of the power dynamics that have shaped the world we live in today. I learned how to think about how ideas shape the world and how our conceptualization of different topics can have real world consequences. This course really touches on the topics that they skip over in history classes in high school. This course really taught me how to think critically and to question everything, in a constructive way.",
    "The course begins with a very broad, fast (because it has to be), and somewhat superficial history of Asian diasporas. It is a necessary tool to aid in talking about modern day issues for Asian diaspora. Although the course it titled so, it is made clear that the class is more than one focusing on Asians: it explores greater themes of race, family, culture, and is applicable to many modern day issues. The second course focuses more on modern day themes, and things like modern migrations, families, etc. are studied. Some example topics include: Filipino nurses in America, Asian fusion food, Japanese in Brazil, mass migrations in Asia."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It would be helpful to have more feedback and instruction on what students should aim for in writing their weekly reading responses. Professor Tran is a super knowledgeable and caring professor and that is the major strength of this course.",
    "Really fun and engaging class! Would take it again. Prof Tran is awesome.",
    "I loved how this course brought in so many different ways of examining Asian diasporas, rather than taking a solely historical or solely artistic or solely cultural analysis route. I think I developed a much better sense of what it means to be part of an Asian diaspora from that interdisciplinarity. I think the main part I had trouble with in this course was accessibility -- there were points when I felt like I was lost in readings or in discussion, and some of the crucial connections weren't drawn for me until the very last few readings. While I see the value of placing them at the end, I wonder if somehow beginning to more explicitly state the ideas of heterogeneity and flexible definitions throughout the course might have helped prime me for how it tied together at the end.",
    "I think this course does an excellent job surveying various Asian diasporic groups in historical context. However, although we looked at different case studies for our readings and wrote about a diverse range of topics for our weekly reading responses, our discussions during class ended up being very similar to the point where they became repetitive by the end of the semester. I think that requiring students to draw upon their reading responses more during class as well as a personal writing assignment before the final project would be valuable to improving the course.",
    "Strengths: Well-designed components; history, themes, etc. final project allowed students to ink together the themes. I liked that it was a free-choice topic and format. Weaknesses: It would have been nice to have more of a summary\/reflection on the term in the last class (or to have more time to digest after presentations).",
    "This course was engaging, interesting, and valuable. I think the one thing that would improve this course is perhaps having an overview at the end of what we learned and how everything is connected.",
    "Strengths: Very important material to learn, seminar style class, a very wise and likable teacher Weaknesses: Discussions sometimes tended to lose steam and lacked direction\/focus. Could very well be a product of the students in the class, however.",
    "The course provided a good foundation of Asian migration history and asked thought provoking questions about shifting notions of identity and culture. The readings were very interesting but I found it difficult to respond to them. What should I draw from these readings? At times, it was difficult to engage in the class. Every student wanted to contribute a different theme, leading to a less fluid discussion. Despite these aspects, the class drove me to think more critically about race and culture. I was able to connect these concepts to my daily life and ask more questions about my position as an Asian American in the United States."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Would most definitely recommend this eye-opening and IMPORTANT course. Read the wide range of material!!",
    "Take this class if you're interested about migration and movement in general. Some of the class is a little dry when it's reading that's purely historical, but the seminar discussion is usually fairly good.",
    "It's wonderful. You think really deeply about streams of migration and how history has shaped them, but also about individual narratives. The course gives a lot of dignity to individual lives in history and tries to reclaim narratives of victims and turn those into stories of agency. Professor Tran is great. She will challenge you deeply, but is also fair, kind, and understanding. I will never forget how the day after the election, we spent time processing and she gave us the space to grieve. But then she asked us what the worst possible outcomes would be under a Trump presidency, and we spent time thinking about how we could respond to those outcomes. It was therapeutic and empowering - and I think that sums up Professor Tran's aim of the course well: to push us to think hard and deep about history and our own lives, but to leave not overwhelmed or despairing but humbled and equipped to move forward and act.",
    "This is a great class to stretch your brain -- whether you come into it feeling comfortable in history, literature, cultural analysis, or none of the above, you'll have to do at least some work in the other areas. As a result, you'll end up with a rich, uniquely multifaceted sense of what Asian diasporas are. Prof. Tran makes herself very open to students with office hours, and she's super flexible about the final project, even creative (non-academic paper) ones.",
    "Yes I'd absolutely recommend this course! Professor Tran is incredible and so receptive to open discussion. I learned so much after engaging with the materials in this course. Asian diasporic studies is overall such a fascinating and unexplored topic, but a lot of what we learned can be applied to the overall immigrant experience. Take it, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in Asian American history and identity formation, especially if the student is Asian American him\/herself. The course goes beyond the culture and history of the diasporic groups and challenges you to think critically about how you yourself fit into the big picture. Overall, the class was very thought-provoking, inspiring, and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would. The course was my first foray into post-modern social theory, and it helped a lot with my self-discovery and identity formation. It is also a good introduction to Asian history through a critical lens.",
    "Yes, you'll get a really interesting look at what diaspora is and the various ways it manifests itself",
    "Absolutely, I think every Yale student should take this course. It really teaches you how to think critically about history and about how historical narratives are constructed. For every history that is told there are millions left untold. To truly understand history, the untold narratives should be fleshed out and the accepted narratives should be questioned. This course teaches students how to do that.",
    "Yes, definitely a worthwhile class to take at Yale. The material is dynamic and relevant, and Professor Tran is amazing!"
