    "A wonderful course that anyone interested in politics should absolutely take. Professor Shapiro is amazing and I learned a ton from his funny and insightful anecdotes from the campaign trail. I would strongly recommend this class to everyone, as it has been one of my favorites at Yale. Take it and you won't regret it.",
    "It is a course about the development of the american presidential campaign and its relationship to media.",
    "This course is amazing, especially so because the Spring 2016 class got lucky and got to examine the media's role in real-time in the 2016 presidential elections. You can bet scrutinizing the media's coverage of Trump, Cruz, and Hillary were really fascinating. There were also several guest lecturers straight from the journalist and pollster fields, so that was a really nice, up-close touch. Professor Shapiro is also the sweetest and incredibly knowledgeable (he covered the last 10 presidential elections!). Take it if you can get in!",
    "Take this class!! It was incredible studying elections (especially during an election year) and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "The syllabus for this course is incredible, and the journalists and political strategists who Professor Shapiro brought in were all really interesting, but seminar discussion wasn't well facilitated. It often turned into people making disparate points without any connection to previous points that had been made. It would have been nice if Professor Shapiro had pushed us to comment on other people's points (i.e. staying on the same subject). Discussion also tended to veer from the readings at hand. We would often talk about what was in the past week's news instead of speaking more specifically about the text. The final paper was a really fun opportunity to pick a topic you wanted to delve into more fully, and get to know everything about it. Shapiro is an encyclopedia of knowledge about politics and presidential campaigns, and can talk at length about almost anything on from the ten presidential campaigns he's covered. He's also very honest about what he doesn't know, which is rare. He'll talk about how he never saw certain political developments coming, how he made terrible predictions, and how he still doesn't understand certain political realities. That said, he often goes off topic in seminar, and it can be hard to get back to the text, or whatever the student's original point or question was. He could be a better facilitator if turned students' disparate points into some sort of discussion and back-and-forth. He's an incredibly kind person, and is always willing to help you out with a paper topic or advice whenever you need it.",
    "This class is a fairly easy, straightforward polisci seminar. If you are looking for a class with not a ton of work or harsh grading, but one that is still at times interesting , and if you want an amazing, really nice professor, take this class."
