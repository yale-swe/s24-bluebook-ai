   "comments": [
    "Thinking about the way that conservatism fits into broader American narratives. Fuller context of American political and social history.",
    "I learned to read strategically because there were two readings pero week due with a response. It taught be to think in terms of main argument and how a scholar presents it. The course also taught me how to think about books in relation to each other. The final assignment, an undergraduate lecture, was an excellent exercise and I learned much about teaching and organization.",
    "The course was fantastic in developing an awareness of the historiography around American Conservatism.",
    "A broad and in-depth understanding of the history of conservatism in the United States in the 20th century, and the scholarship and prominent discussions\/questions\/issues in the field. Learned to effectively read, summarize, and think critically about the scholarship in this area.",
    "This course served as a helpful introduction to the growing field of the history of American conservatism. I ended the semester feeling like I had a good grasp of the dimensions of that field and of the strengths and weaknesses of using conservatism as a framework for considering twentieth-century America. I appreciated the opportunity to prepare and deliver a mock undergraduate lecture and now have a better sense of my own lecturing style and how I can improve my teaching skills."

   "comments": [
    "Great course. Excellent assignments. Might be better to spread out lecture presentations over the course of the semester.",
    "The main strength was my colleagues; I learned from their discussions and insights. Professor Gage also fosters a very healthy seminar environment where we build from each other's ideas. The course felt like teamwork. The main weakness was related to the reflections we had to post on Canvas. They were due at noon on Sunday and this made me rush through some readings.",
    "Strengths: Large variety and amount of material and topics covered, online responses led to interesting and high-level discussions during class, final lecture was great opportunity to become very familiar with a topic, and learn about lecturing and teaching. It was also great to have the opportunity to listen to and hear lectures from all the members of the class. Overall the classroom environment felt quite friendly, open, and supportive, while being academically rigorous. Weaknesses: Online responses were really important for synthesizing and thinking critically about the readings, but the timing of the response on Sunday at noon was sometimes difficult to deliver.",
    "Strengths: Good reading list with a wide variety of books, many written by women. Consistently high-quality discussion. Effective final assignment (preparing and delivering a mock undergraduate lecture). Great discussion facilitation by Professor Gage. Weaknesses: Very heavy reading load. Weekly Canvas responses were due on Sundays at noon, essentially requiring weekend work."

    "Yes, great course for thinking about history of conservatism and its relationship to liberalism, as well as the historical roots of present political conditions.",
    "I would recommend this course for any Americanist. The subject is engaging and teaches students to think critically about historical scholarship.",
    "Yes, this course was really valuable for reinforcing my knowledge of political history, the history (and historiography) of conservatism, and the history of the 20th century in general. It also taught me how to read more critically and effectively, and I feel like I know have a broad base of knowledge about the scholarship and main questions in the field.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Gage is a great facilitator and the books on the syllabus are important reads for anyone interested in twentieth-century American history."
