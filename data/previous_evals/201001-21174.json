    "The material for this class is very relevant towards my future research and this class met my expectations of what I wanted to learn.",
    "Not particularly. I think I would have done just as well on the final at the beginning of the course.",

    "i learned some basic stat mech, though some of the more advanced stuff escaped me.",
    "Now, I have more deep understanding for classical statistical mechanics and comfortable about relationship between each ensemble, and I would like to know more about this subject in future.",
    "I learned something in this course, but I expected more. Thanks anyway",
    "I think it will be helpful, but again more problems would have been helpful."
