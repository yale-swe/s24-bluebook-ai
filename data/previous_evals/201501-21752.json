   "comments": [
    "I'd highly recommend this course! It's a good introduction to perceptual methods if you're a social psychologist. Brian Scholl's teaching style is very engaging, if slightly intimidating.",
    "Weekly seminar with 3-6 papers of required reading, and a short reading response. 15-20 page final paper. Final paper's tough but the readings aren't much work.",
    "This seminar exposes you to many interesting areas of research, but you won't have too much chance to discuss each topic. The weekly assignments are manageable, and the final assignment can be either a long paper or an actual experiment you've run during the semester based on class topics.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student who's a psychology major and hasn't had the chance to take a course taught by Professor Scholl.",
    "Scholl is great, and every week of this class focused on a new and fascinating topic that I hadn't really considered before. Would absolutely recommend, as long as you don't mind reading several experimental papers every week.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, the amount of interesting things you will learn and great discussions you'll have is amazing. I'm a lazy senior writing this but this class is so amazing, take it!",
    "A very engaging seminar on really interesting topics. While Brian Scholl was not always the warmest or most relatable of teachers, his class really challenged me to think about cognitive science research differently. As junior cogsci major, having taken many classes in the field and having worked in a Yale psych lab, I had a lot of experience reading published articles, but I've never considered research as critically as I was pushed to in this class. It's a really valuable experience, and if you have the opportunity to take this class, I would encourage you to. Note that the work for this class consists of weekly readings, reading responses, participation in class discussion (!!), and a final paper.",
    "I would recommend the class to students who enjoy discussion-based classes. I wouldn't take it if you haven't taken a more basic CogSci class first though-- you would get a lot more out of it and probably do a lot better. The other thing I would recommend-- start your final paper early!! The whole class depends on that grade and it's kind of crazy if you think about it."
