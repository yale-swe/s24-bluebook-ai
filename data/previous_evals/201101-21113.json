    "It is a seminar wherein you will be stimulated to think critically about good and evil from many different angles. Classroom discourse will be engaging and worthwhile. It is a wonderful class. Everyone should be required to learn about their capacity for good and evil to better understand themselves and society.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, but only if they were willing to fight to participate. For those of us who were a little less loud, it was hard to get a word in edge wise."
