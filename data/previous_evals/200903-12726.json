   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The times when crossovers of material between courses was most evident was in the environmental workshops, which were, for the most part, valuable. The particular focus on daylighting in the workshops - an apparent change from past years - seemed like a good idea, although the timing for building the enormous models was not ideal. It was nice to have Michelle Addington and Naomi Darling on some of the final reviews, and they did more than playing their parts as consultants, actually critiquing the work on architectural terms.In my opinion disappointingly, while a good amount of overlap with the environmental course was clear, I find very little overlap with the theory. Yale studios seem to display a bizarre and confusing hubris, which appears to express that in doing projects we fabricate our own theories, without any acknowledgment of a history of ideas. Rather than conflating theory and practice, as seems to be the school's goal, it reinforces a separation between building and thinking. I find this both problematic and frustrating or my own work and in looking at that of other students.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The crossover with Michelle Addington's course was excellent and became a focal point of this semester. The crossover with any other course - required or a seminar or simply our own interests - was pretty weak, as I described below.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Cross over with evvironment was forced and should have been optional",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The attempted crossover between studio and environmental design was only effective in the large scale lighting models that we did with MJ Long.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Having three electives this semester, studio had a less officially structured overlap but some great parallels. I was not in the Environmental Design course but appreciated the integration of environmental effects which the program was very well suited. I did take two electives that touched on sustainability, both its theories and implementation, and feel that environmental ideas, other than sunlight, could be worked into the process and encouraged more. Processes and effects such as water and mechanical strategies were mentioned but not considered beyond a surface level. Regardless, these two electives did help challenge my studio project. It is a ripe semester to dive deeper into integrating sustainable technologies and could benefit from a greater array of passive and active strategies.My third elective was the drawing and architectural form course which I believe was also an effective parallel. The course involved representation of our studio projects for two assignments just after the midpoint of the course. The full-semester project allows for this questioning of representation. In the end, none of us in the seminar used our drawings toward a studio purpose. I believe that alternate ways of representation and drawing exploration, much deeper and more involved than pure plotting, should be encouraged.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I enjoy having sites in New Haven because it minimizes travel time and it helps us learn more about the city's urban history (a topic relevant to many other classes). I think it was silly to travel to NYC first year - it takes so much time out of our studies and we don't gain enough in return. Having a site in New Haven lets us visit throughout the semester and gain intimate knowledge of the site's surrounding context.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I appreciated the considerable crossover between Environmental Design with Addington and this studio, and I wish I had had more of that in the first year (it seems the new curriculum with Organschi and John-Alder teaching Building Project may help with that).",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I was pleased by the amount of crossover this semester between studio and the other classes. In particular, the lessons covered in environmental design pertained to many issues we addressed in our projects. It was nice to design a comprehensive building that required us to exercise all the skills we have acquired at YSOA.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Given the nature of a comprehensive studio, there was a great deal of crossover between the studio and the other classes, especially the Environmental Design course. Principles concerning climate and passive design were considered during the siting and massing of the studio projects. Elements of daylighting, ventilation and acoustic design were considered throughout the process, and were reinforced by the workshops offered in conjunction with this semester.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0This year it the environmental design workshops were much better integrated into the studio with more appropriate and prudent work loads in respect to the rest of the studio workload - The Enviro Design course was equally better integrated by the studio critics",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I found this course very sucessful in allowing me to use relative information for a comprehensive understanding of a building. Some of the sustainablity items were relative towards other courses.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The studio meshes well with the environmental course that is taken simultaneously and the environmental workshops. Besides the environmental course there is not much direct connection between the other courses and studio though.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The focus on environmental issues became too overbearing and slowed down the design process. Although the workshops were beneficial in learning about 'how' things work, they were not very integral in the overall design and slowed down the process of exploration and developing architectural ideas in a more thoughtful manner.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0There was a fair ammount of crossover between Environmental design and the studio, however little with other courses. This is not the fault of the instructors, rather simply how the core course load has been distributed",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0I was very happy with the amount of cross-over encouraged, although the demanding pace and format of studio does not allow in practice.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0There was very little - although I believe this so far to be the case in all of my studio's at yale.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Crossover between studio and environmental design (Michelle Addington) was fairly good; could have been better if the studio critics had a better idea about what we were learning about in that course.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The crossover between studio and environmental design seemed at times cursory, but that is probably appropriate given the demands and scope of the studio program. The focus on one issue--daylighting--was beneficial and the workshops were enlightening.There was no crossover between theory and studio, as was the case in the previous year between studio and those core courses in the history\/theory stream. This continues to disappoint me, as it seems to me that the two are inseparable and that greater presence of theory in studio would only serve to strengthen the arguments students attempt to make for their projects (which are often weak) and in turn the projects themselves. The clear separation of practice and criticism is misguided, as they can only strengthen one another. The students are left blind to a way of working--that is working conscious of the position of their work within the history of the discipline--that remains not only valid, but essential to any academic pursuit.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The day lighting studio was interesting and very helpful, although it did not influence the design tremendously, rules taken from it did contribute. The environmental workshop was the best crossover, Thomas Auer was a fantastic lecturer and consultant for the project.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0The studio seemed well coordinated with the environmental design class in terms of the lighting explorations. but the intent for a stronger overlap between the two course is unrealistic.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0i believe the early explorations (precedent study and site analysis) should be more calibrated to the project as a whole and not just a warm-up for a building. the early precedent study and the site analysis became more disconnected from the process as the whole semester proceeds in such a linear fashion that previous work has a hard time to reappear in the final project.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0The crossover between Environmental Design was strong -- MJ Long's workshop was quite successful and interesting, and it was nice to focus on daylighting after the intensity of the midterm. I wish that other classes, such as Emmanuel's theory class, could be incorporated more carefully. I would have enjoyed spending more time on the precedent analyses, especially because the program we were assigned -- an archive -- is so pregnant for thought. I think we rushed too quickly into trying to figure out the building instead of trying to position the problem of an archive for the twenty-first century. There was too much emphasis on production and not enough emphasis on thinking.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I think this semester tried too hard to connect environmental systems with studio. Its great to look at our projects in terms of our systems, but I didn't find it productive to force system integration into projects that are not conceptually developed around systems.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The crossover between studio, environmental design and theory was well integrated this semester. The emphasis on environmental concerns as an important tool for design strategies was strong and effective. I truly learned a lot about the sun, systems, and what to avoid. The underlying knowledge of these principles will clearly make me a better and more attuned architect.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The crossover was better this semester than in previous semesters. There was too much doubled work, i.e. the crossover was not used as a way to consolidate work, only to make more work. This could be easily remedied by making more of the environmental design homework studio based.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0There was not much crossover between classes.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The environmental workshops were a great way to engage in others' studio projects from a different angle. It was interesting to see the large scale mock-ups of the interior spaces for the daylighting study because it made students more familiar with the strategies to be deployed and the multitude of ways of execution. The pin-ups were a great way to see the diverse angles of research and exploration between the different students, which ultimately became a collective body of knowledge."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0At a certain point in the semester (possibly beginning after Mid Review), it started to feel as though we had a review every week. This was crippling for my process, considering that what I worked on was the development of presentation drawings rather than of my project. Therefore the least valuable aspect of the studio was definitely the immense amount of work that we were asked to do that diverted attention from the rest of the project. The daylighting exercise fits into this category as well; it involved a lot of time and money leading up to a three-minute review at exactly the time in the semester when many of us wanted simply to respond to the comments from the Mid Review.The most valuable aspects of the studio for me, on the other hand, were the day-to-day desk crits and more informal pin-ups, during which we not only had opportunities to discuss our projects but we got feedback from several sources including, at best, the other students in the class.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The time with our consultants was invaluable. They were all outstanding resources and should certainly be brought back next year.Here is another suggestion: at my final review, the very best criticism came from Makram, and it kills me to think that he was teaching 15 feet from my desk all semester. I don't want to be sneaky and ask for a private desk crit behind my instructor's back, so why not do a critic swap for a day (or two or three)? Have another critic give you your desk crit. I can literally see no negatives to this. They give you feedback, you take it or leave it, but at least it's a second opinion sometime before the final review.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The outside experts, including Laura Tatum and the environmental teams, were exciting and engaging - it was nice not having to commit a lot of extra time to the environmental workshops and instead using the visitors as consultants instead of critics.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The most valuable aspects of the studio were the outside experts and field trips investigating the building type. The outside experts brought a wonderful richness to the project and possibilities for deeper investigation. I believe that these were not fully utilized or carried on. A follow-up talk with our section critic to digest these concepts and to critique their integration would be useful so that they can live on within the projects. For me, the field trips around campus and to New York were pivotal in the design process and helped me formulate a compelling idea to react to through the length of the semester. I believe greater analysis of these visits should be encouraged.It is hard to pick the least valuable aspects because all parts were vital and each deserves some minor adjustments, such as integration of the outside experts. Particularly for our section, we had frequent pin-ups for the entire studio which were useful in pushing our work along and presenting in rapid succession. Sometimes it was too quick in succession and could have been structured as smaller group discussions which would engender more comments from one another and ultimately more productive in terms of time and level of feedback.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The most valuable aspect was the mid-review with outside critics. The lease valuable aspect was the Ecotect seminar. I contrast the mid-review with the final review because our final review felt more \"in house\" than the mid-review (the main commentators for many people's final reviews being Mark Gage and Keith Krumwiede). This was less helpful because the same comments were repeated over and over. At the mid-review, however, we were able to escape the YSOA school of thought and hear what outside opinions had to say.The Ecotect seminar was not helpful because all in all sustainability is taught half-ass at Yale. Sure, we are shown very basic tools, but sustainable innovation is not emphasized as part of any design problem. Additionally, not many of the critics are prepared to address advanced ideas of sustainability (or basic ideas for that matter).",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Most valuable would be the emphasis on a well-rounded project, strong in idea but also tectonic resolution. Though this is a comprehensive building studio, I did not feel hindered in any way to explore through my initial concepts (no doubt I have Makram to thank for this freedom). My project was stronger in the end because of this.I think the daylighting workshop with MJ was certainly valuable, and it helped my project to have built a large-scale model; however, it may have been even more helpful for me to have spent the kind of resources (time and money) on learning to better use rendering programs. This emphasis on technology (raytracing to understand daylight, crossover into ecotect, then generating materially convincing renderings) would have improved my education in terms of daylighting for certain.Least valuable were the weeks after mid-review where we had desk crit after desk crit. Makram should have gathered us into smaller groups for pin-ups and facilitated a discussion among students that could have generated additional feedback.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0While the desk-crits were very useful, I was disappointing by the amount of interaction between studio sections. While I was very fond of my critic, I would have loved to receive feedback from other critics at times other than the mid-term. My studio did not do any pin-ups, and I wish we had done a few (no necessarily the entire group, but perhaps two or three at a time)",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0As a comprehensive studio, the course conveyed a great deal of information about the process of taking an architectural idea and turning it into a functioning building. Learning how to handle this process is incredibly valuable before entering the profession outside of school. As someone who has had prior work experience, this studio felt very similar to a project one would work on at an outside firm. While this is beneficial for the reasons stated above, it can also present difficulties for rationalizing the early conceptual ideas for the project without compromising for the sake of a functional building. While this is probably the nature of the studio in general, it seems as though the majority of the students either achieved great conceptual success without the tectonic rigor that may be expected, or they achieved a functional building that was lacking in rich conceptual expression. Given the specificity of the program, it was extremely difficult to achieve the demands of the project and to carry throughout a dominant conceptual idea.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The studio is an obviously valuable and important part of the curriculm - personally, I would like to see the course taken thus far in the program more integrated into this studio - specifically the structures and theory courses - This is the first opportunity we as students have to try our technical and theoretical learns into pragmatic products of design - It would benefit us to have more encouragement and guidance in these areas as we are grappling with how to fit in another fire stair or toilet.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0the least valuable aspects of the studio were the daylighting models, found them to be very expensive and could have performed same measures with 3d application and renderings.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I think the studio could have benefitted from pin-ups with other section critics-- not a formal review, just simply a desk-crit\/pin-up with the other critics. As you only get advice from one critic throughout the semester it would be good to get feedback from another point of view, especially if you design ideas\/styles clashes with that of you personal studio critic.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The first three weeks of the semester were not very helpful in pushing design investigations. The midreview, proved to be extremely helpful while weekly desk were always helpful in advancing ideas.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The emphasis on representation and the help from Cody Davis were INVALUABLE. Cody bent over backwards for us to make sure we were keeping up and to help us out with the questions we had. The juries were largely useless, but the pin-ups and one-on one sessions with mark were AMAZING",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The most valuable aspect was working with Mark. He is an absolutely superb professor capable of directing each students strengths and will truly engage your project on your own terms. I have learned more from him this semester than any professor every before. I enjoyed the structure of primarily group pin-ups early in the semester to more hands off individual crits at the end of the semester.The least valuable component was the precedent study at the beginning of the semester. I never understand why studio's feel that have to start with precedent studies when if fact they rarely transfer over. I probably would have taken a closer look programming instead, not in the macro-scale sense but perhaps begun with analysis\/design of how furniture or smaller spaces within the archive center might have worked.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0the daylighting workshop was absolutely one of the most valuable aspects of the studio; I gained a significant amount of knowledge about lighting and was able to integrate it into the project. The environmental workshops could have been more useful if there had been more effort on the part of the studio critics to integrate it into the project. There could have been more pin-ups throughout the semester, but especially in the second half.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The least valuable aspect of the studio was the initial suite of short assignments. The precedent analysis--in which no archives were studied--was in a retrospect a baffling missed opportunity to address the project either through program (by looking at archives) or form (by looking at corner buildings or Yale buildings, for instance). The role of the diagram in the core studios remains underdeveloped. A much clearer agenda for the diagram, as well as instruction as to what actually constitutes a diagram, should be a part of any diagramming assignment. The final short assignment, however, did produce some important initial models that remained salient throughout the design process.The attention in our studio on rendering was misplaced. We would have been better served by focusing on, and finishing, the design process earlier, and then moving on to learning and producing representation through work on the finished project.The split between group pin-ups\/discussions pre-midterm and inidividual desk crits post-midterm was frustrating. Both serve a purpose and both should have been mixed throughout. The group pin-ups in particular served to foster a collaborative atmosphere and a sense of momentum in the project--with an emphasis on producing something to show one's peers--that waned, to the detriment of the design process, as the studio progressed.Desk crits were often unproductive, though it is of course necessary that the critic develop a familiarity with the individual projects and students through one-on-one discussion. In general, a series of specifically elaborated deadlines would have helped to realize the full potential of each of these supposedly comprehensive design projects.The outside experts--particularly MJ Long and Thomas Auer--were extremely helpful and enlightening.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0As I said previously, the most valuable aspect to studio were the outside experts, not so that they could bind the project formally, but so they could add more productive constraints. The least valuable aspect was the group pin-ups. Although our studio rarely participated in these, I personally feel like the time from 2-5 should be spent meeting with a critic to discuss a project with more attention rather than crowding a review with off-hand comments from other students. By second year most have developed a tight group of friends whose opinions the value that make comments about each others work anyway.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0different forms of criticism were helpful at different times. group pin-ups were especially valuable earlier in the semester when we were still exploring larger ideas. pin-ups in pairs were helpful at times as well. desk crits were often the most productive as a chance to have a direct discussion with the critic. these were most valuable later in the semester, when we were already focused on developing our own projects.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Desk crits are most valuable, in my personal design process. However a variety of critque are useful -- it was great to pin up in small groups to be able to see other students work in a concentrated , collaborative way (without dilluting the exercise by sitting through 4+ hrs of listening to everyone's projects).",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0the most valuable part of the studio was wrestling with a whole project for a semester. the least valuable was the attempt to inform a building with just a taste of outside expertise...by flirting with these issues for less than three days automatically parodies their real value.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Pin-ups in sudio were always helpful -- most helpful when there was discussion among all members of the studio and not just between Martin and the student presenting.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The precedent study portion of the studio was interesting and helpful. As a team exercise, we were able to come up with great graphic representation. I would have liked to work with my peers on the site and program analysis. I think the output would have been more productive. In addition, I think the placement of the lighting study was not appropriate. It would have been more productive to be able to reconsider the conceptual aspects of our ideas after midterm before focusing in depth on something so technical. Overall, time was over allotted to design. By the end of the semester I would have liked to have a more developed concept then the well organized plans and sections that the semester seems to focus on. Also, all the outside experts that were brought in were well chosen. They all had exceptional knowledge of their respective fields.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I personally believe that the outside experts are the most valuable aspects of the course. That is not to say that I don't appreciate the in-house critics, but it is nice to see your project as it is judge by an source outside of the world in which we sometimes feel stuck in.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The most valuable part of the semester was the length of the studio project. A full semester long investigation is necessary for a in-depth investigation into the subject.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The most valuable aspect would be desk-crits and small class pin-ups. I think that we should have had more frequent QUICK pin-ups through the studio after midterm so that we do not get too caught up in our own projects and get a chance to see what is going on in the studio across the board. I think it would have been interesting to have desk crits from other studio professors as well.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Some of the early pin-up initiatives were actually less helpful then intended. Often it felt like we were simply having pin-ups as a mere formality as opposed to them being a means of effectively conveying information to fellow colleagues. The outside critics are always a valuable experience because of the diverse ways of \"entering\" the project, or angle of critique. It was also great to have outside experts come for the environmental workshops. I feel that the comprehensive aspect of this studio definitely resonated with all of the various initiatives to make the project more robust and substantial."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0There is absolutely no question in my mind that everyone in the studio who applied him or herself to the project learned an enormous amount this semester. The program was very good for forcing students to express their architectural ambitions, although certainly challenging for a number of reasons. I would simply say here that I wish that the studio instructors could have moved around more, so that each section was not quite so insular. Along similar lines, I think that the coordinator of the studio - although I think he did a fantastic job - could have acknowledged his duties to the entire class a bit more, instead of remaining in the corner that was his particular section.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0For reasons I described below, I feel that Mark Gage's lists of programmatic and deliverable requirements for our projects was a real problem. I think it established an atmosphere of homogeneity among the studios, with a project that required an incredible amount of independent, unconventional thinking. The number of look-alike projects in some sections was staggering.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The studio would have benefited from a stronger and more clear presentation of the assignement so that students understood exactly waht was being asked of them.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The list of requirements for reviews is unnecessary and encourages students to produce more useless drawings to show competency instead of exploring and developing the quality of drawings. At this point it should be assumed that we are competent. The drawing styles for the entire class seem far too uniform - students are afraid to do something different because of the fear of the checklist.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I was pleased with the structure of this semester and its placement within the curriculum. It is a great follow-up to the building project testing these ideas of development toward a larger and more complex building. I appreciated the checkpoints and the ability to develop these projects to a full extent.For timing within the semester I would suggest postponing the daylighting workshop one studio session later in the semester. The exercise was wonderful but would be better served by testing new ideas exposed during midterm reviews. One sessionwith our studio critic or at least one correspondence could be useful to direct this study and make the large model a means for critical investigation instead of representing ideas that have already passed in the midterm. This timing made it hard to digest the criticism and move forward in adjusting my strategy.The end of the semester was well timed and allowed for full production to the final review. I appreciated the focus on representation and critiquing storyboard posters for a clear final presentation. I think that the handout was a great idea that was not encouraged past the checklist and could help refine the presentation further.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0At Yale, a slick digitally mastered final poster is emphasized more than a quality project.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I found this studio to be very productive and valuable as part of my education at YSOA. I would consider myself to be more of a pragmatist in comparison to my peers, so I really appreciated the emphasis on producing a fully resolved building. Coming from a non-architecture background, I was pleased to finally deal with many of the practical architectural issues that are often overlooked and under-appreciatedby architecture students.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0As a pedagogical tool, the studio is beneficial in that presents a very real problem set for the students to solve in order to achieve a functioning building, and thus preparing the students for real work practice. The danger of the studio is that it allows some students (especially those who have worked previously) to fall into conventional solutions for the problems presented. The studio critics, therefore, need to be aware of this possibility and push back against the students so that a balance between conceptual clarity and functionality are achieved.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0There is a lot of discussion at YSOA around Pedagogy. As a whole, I find a general lack of formal pedagogy on the part of the program and faculty. While individual critics have developed and articulated their own personal set of approaches and architectural linguistics, after three semesters, a clear and concise \"YSOA\" brand of pedagogical leanings has yet to be made evident - what is left for us as students are desperate parts of a program and studio that continues to deal more with taste, style, and personal subjective opinion of our critics. Therefore, the idea of the studio functioning as a pedagogical tool is very difficult to discuss - I think the program, student body and the school in general would greatly benefit from school wide symposium to address this glaring issue.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0main strengths of the studio were the hands on style of the professors and their availability wished there could have been more group pinups toward the end as there was in the beginning. This seems like the most critical time to have group pinups",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0There is no overarching agenda among all the critics, so the work and criticism varied widely. As I said earlier, the juries were largely useless, partly, I bevieve, because it was so hard for them to get their heads around such a diversity of projects. If there was a more consistent agenda and set of requirements, that would probably have been helpful, but perhaps less fun.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0It was all scheduled very well - although it was surprising to see the increase in required production from last years studio - which of course our class handled excellently.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The lack of any explicit critical agenda on the part of the critics continues to undermine the design process--as it has throughout the core studios. Poorly concealed agendas frustrate students who cannot draw critics into a meaningful discussion of what it is that the critics are clearly interested in. Critics should be encouraged to bring their own agendas to the studio, and students should be encouraged to engage with those agenda. Instead, students are not encouraged to establish clear critical positions for themselves, and are left free to follow their whims, provided those whims can be post-rationalized. Intuition is a valid working method, but it must be self-conscious and understood as such. In general, the lack of the critical or self-conscious in projects results in an often glaring incoherence and a lack of truly provocative insight.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The studio sequence was very well organized and thought through. All workshops were insightful and helped enormously the completion of a well rounded project.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0what was the pedagogy? As far as I can tell it was a free for all in our studio.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0I found the studio exercises well timed and beneficial to the comprehensive studio. The environmental workshops were really disruptive to the project development without any beneficial outcome. They need to be rethought and reduced.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0This second year studio was planned extremely well compared to first year. The sequence of the initial projects\/ assignments was particularly relevant and gave us a solid basis to proceed forward in developing our own project. The precedent project, the content and context research, and the 4 study models were extremely well planned and timed projects. Mid review is also a helpful time in that it forced us solidify many of our ideas and at least put forward one iteration of our project at an early stage.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0The beginning exercises of the studio did not lead effectively enough into the design portion. We should have been charged with more specific angles on site and program analysis, which would have led more smoothly to design.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I would like there to be a more cohesive connection between architectural concept and technical design skills.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0-Incredibly important part of the studio sequence because of the ability to focus on a single project for the entire semester.-The daylighting study with MJ Long was particularly helpful",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Obviously the studio component is an integral part of the learning process. I believe that the only real weaknesses are the problems that we are given. I am rather tired of the idea that architects, in education, can poetically solve the all encompassing project. An archive\/library\/performance hall\/class room\/...? I long for a project like a gas station or a clinic, instead of these proscriptive malls that we have to tackle.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The studio didn't have enough crossover between section groups. I didn't feel like i got broad range of criticism. My project was outside of my critics comfort zone and i think he kind of shutdown. He was supportive but not challenging. The juries were also not good enough. There was way to much personal opinion rather than someone who can understand what you are trying to do and then helping you or challenging that objective.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I think the program given to the students was too extensive and oftentimes overwhelming to work with. I think it forced the students to think too technically, and was perhaps too restricting. It was difficult to push conceptual ideas while battling with all the programmatic issues. It was also clear that even the person who wrote the program did not understand it, as many preconceived notions about lighting in the gallery, and controls for the reading room had to be re-evaluated at midterm, very late in the process for many people. The daylighting and environmental workshops were not as helpful as they could have been. I think it is helpful they happened after midterm, but they were so rushed and not really taken into consideration. But I definitely do not think it was a good idea to have the daylighting immediately following midterm, before we were able to recover or rethink our projects.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I feel that the inevitable list of deliverables required for reviews actually stifles creativity and experimentation in representation. As opposed to letting the individual student to evaluate the required material necessary to convey the project, the deliverables often just become something to be checked off a list. I feel it would be far more productive if students spent more time exploring various modes of representation that way there isnt' a set way of conveying projects, it allows projects to be conveyed in their own regard -- not be an imposed set of requirements. Production is definitely the biggest issue because it often has the greatest effect on our other course which are quite frequently after thoughts and attended to at the last minute.I feel that the schedule is fine. There just seems to be far less experimentation than I thought would be taking place and I feel that it's because of the constant pressure to produce that is the culprit."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0My expectations for this studio were essentially just to work on a single project and develop it through the entire semester. Those expectations were met perfectly well.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I feel very shortchanged with this semester, in the sense that I feel like we abandoned all other aspects and interests of architecture for the sake of the studio's comprehensiveness and integration with our consultants' inputs. In particular, I am extremely frustrated by how little we were encouraged (or, in some cases, even allowed) to really challenge the very provocative and excellent conundrum of an archive library in the 21st century. The first 3-4 weeks were so promising! We were really engaging the issues of preserving old and new technologies, and their social and educational impacts. It felt like a really advanced level of discourse. Fast-forward 13 weeks of design development, and the results, albeit beautiful buildings, were incredibly disappointing to me in how little they fundamentally challenged the question of an archive. Everyone had the same types of programs and very similar concepts. I don't think a single person honestly invented something new for an archive, which is one of the most challenging programmatic buildings there is. I certainly understand that it's a semester where we need to get really serious about the technical realization of our projects, but if that means throwing away all the analytical\/theoretical work done in the first few weeks then it's a really sad forecast for our profession and school.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I expected to put together a complete functional building that also met the artistic design side of the profession. Instead I came up with an elegant sculpture which did not function very well.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I expected this studio to be more of a comprehensive studio in that I would produce a building that is figured out structurally and with some attention to systems. I don't know if I learned anything about putting a building together this semester - instead I learned more about how to put a presentation together.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0My expectations were to develop a building in further detail, using environmental strategies to shape the final outcome. In comparison to other studios, I believe that we completed more iterations along the way which was effective to extend investigation through the semester. I learned to not settle on ideas too soon but to keep cultivating the project and carry on the secondary strategies and details between each draft. I do not think the detailed wall sections should be mandatory but the final should be judged on its effectiveness in combining environmental and material strategies specified.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0My expectations were well met. My line drawings got better and I ended up with a well developed project where wall sections and materiality were not an afterthought.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I expected to learn how to design a building through from start to finish and to have a reasonably well-resolved product in the end. I also expected to be somewhat hindered in my exploration of initial design concepts for the sake of architectural resolution. However, owing to the length of the semester and an open-minded critic (Makram) I was surprised to have enough freedom that I felt I learned conceptually too.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0My expectation for this studio was to use all of the skills I have gained as an architecture student (from the technical to the theoretical) in order to produce a fully worked out building, and this expectation was met.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0My expectations for the studio were to introduce the fundamental aspects of designing a real, functional building and to make the students consider aspects of environmental design and passive strategies. The archive program of the studio was very challenging and enjoyable, and presented elements for consideration that we likely will not see again in the curriculum. The uniqueness of a project like this keeps the studio interesting and challenging throughout a long semester.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0My expectations were very low and very negative about this studio - over the semester, however, my attitude toward the semester was changed to one of cautious optimism. The reason and major influence to cause this change was Makram el Kadi. Makram is a jewel among the faculty. He is dedicated, creative, passionate, intelligent, possesses a high level of expertise and does it all with respect for the student and there work while maintaining a wonderful since of humor. The YSOA should do all they can to keep Makram a part of the faculty and to expose as many students to him and his approach to teaching and to architectural practice. It was an honor and a pleasure to have studied under him for this semester. If give the opportunity, I would happily do it again.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0i found my expectations for developing a comprehensive building were met. I found the studio to be very helpful",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0I was a little bit unsure what to expect - I have heard many good and bad things about both this studio and Mark Gage. In that regard, I didn't enter the studio with any expectations or agenda and just decided to see what would happen. It all turned out wonderfully in the end.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Though I did gain a lot of design experience in the studio, my expectations for it as a comprehensive design studio were not very well met because there was no sort of instruction or interest in detail or building systems or construction at all.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0after first semester of the first year, my expectations were extremely low, but i thought the studio was run extremely well and gave us a chance to grow. for me the challenge this semester was to make myself produce a realistic building and show some restraint and this semester gave me the chance to do that.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Martin Finio did a great job meeting my expectations for the studio -- I expected to hone my design process and learn more concrete technoic architecural methods for resolving my ideas. Both these expectations were well met.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0I expected the studio to be intense, comprehensive, and practically oriented. These expectations were met.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I would like every studio to emphasize my ability to be self critical of my ideas. Because this semester over focused on the technical side of building, I did not get the feed back on conceptual ideas that I look for from each semester I am here.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Expectations were high and they were met (apart from the weakness listed above).",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0My expectation were not met. My studio critic was not able to critique my project in a helpful way. The critics need to be more closely paired with like minded students. This would make the students more enthusiastic and the critiques more able to critical the projects within their studio. I think this could be remedied by simply restoring student choice through the lottery.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I expected to have semester where I could really focus on ideas that interested me, and to explore them in depth through a project that would reach a high level of resolution. In these terms, my expectations have been met.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0For the most part my expectations were met. Peter was a great critic and was always flexible and willing to entertain diverse interests and modes of inquiry. He isn't a critic that is too prescriptive and I think the majority of students really appreciated that they had the freedom to progress and explore in a variety of ways and at their own pace."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of your Section Critic.",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I would like to begin answering this question by stating simply that I learned an enormous amount from having Joel Sanders as a critic; I am confident that I probably would not have learned nearly as much from any of the other critics teaching this semester. His concern for his students goes well beyond almost any other critic I have encountered at Yale. That said, however, I often found Joel's ways of expressing himself and critiquing projects to be extremely frustrating. He often made certain types of comparisons that were unhelpful or uncritical, and he would get visibly frustrated with students when they did not do exactly what he had in mind. He often yelled at students and cursed during conversations, making himself seem less accessible for advice than judgment. Desk crits therefore often felt more like reviews than they probably should have to be helpful for us. However, to conclude, Joel's intense desire for us to communicate our ideas in the most lucid ways possible was clearly educational across our entire section and in every project.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Joel's strength was that always pushed for conceptual clarity which brought strength to people projects because there was always an idea imbedded in it.Joel's weakness is that his criticism comes from his vision of a student's project and not from a response to the student's vision. Desk critsalways felt like one was butting heads with ones own agenda against Joel's agenda. It should always be the student's agenda",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Joel was an incredibly helpful critic, but especially in the weeks leading up to mid-review. He showed us how to communicate a concept like, in his words, \"BAM! There is it!\" and how to best graphically express our work so that it always reinforced our concept. Frankly, I feel like our sections blew away all the others at midreview. Unlike other sections, we could clearly articulate (verbally and graphically) a strong concept that wasn't something thoughtless like \"my concept is program,\" etc.After mid-review, I think Joel should have been a little more engaged with the technical resolution of our building, especially with looking at plans and sections...I think many people in our section felt a bit panicked when we we looked at the other sections and saw incredibly detailed wall sections, plans, etc. and we were not there yet technically.I mentioned this above, and I will reiterate, even though I did feel that my section's concepts were far more varied and compelling than most other sections: I think that Joel might have pushed us too hard into a \"building concept\" that was all about the building itself and not necessarily about our own interests in architecture. I do recognize that we need to seal the deal and come up with a \"real\" building, but I felt that at the end of the day, a lot of our buildings could have been just as interesting as a science lab, media center, classroom building, etc. I think he was perhaps overly anxious for us to come up with strong \"building\" ideas that we sacrificed all of our \"other\" ideas that we developed in the first weeks of the semester.Joel has a tremendous amount of passion as an instructor. Granted, he is out of his right mind, but he knows that, and it's a good thing. One time, when he was giving a desk crit, he was circling my drawings with a black Sharpie with such intensity that it slipped and he hit my grey cashmere sweater and didn't realize it. I never told him he ruined it, because I realize he did it accidentally because he was so engaged with what he was doing at that moment. If I cannot say anything else about him, I can say that he very much wanted us to have amazing projects. He cared so much for his students, and we appreciate that. I sincerely enjoyed my time with him as a critic.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Joel's greatest strength was that he always had strong opnions about the work that you presented and always had ideas about what they could be come. This is absolutely invaluable and I was very happy to have this as I felt from talking with other students that this was not the case acorss the board from critics and was in fact unusal. Joel's greatest wekaness is that he does not listen to what students have to say about what they \"intended\" to do and simply reacts to what he sees. This is positive in the sense that a student understands when something he or she has produced is unclear. But it is not helpful in terms of determining what would make it more clear.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Joel was able to push everyone in our section to their limits and would not settle for less. By the end I think we produced very interesting projects which stood out from the rest of the other sections.It was hard to communicate with him because it seemed like he knew what he wanted each project to be and would not let us stray from that original idea to a fault.There was no gray zone with his reactions- he either loved it or hated it. Either very positive feedback or very negative feedback and that lack of one positive thing each studio made it hard for me to keep going sometimes because i felt i had done nothing right.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Joel was an effective critic because he was very critical. I feel like I had to enter his world and fully understand where he was coming from before we could be productive together. Though often quite negative and fixated on the overall concept execution, Joel directed the studio as an exercise in clarity. Joel was also smart to bring in outside critics to keep the momentum going. I feel like at the end of the day we in the studio had cohesive and clear buildings, but sometimes could have benefited from more editing. The deskcrit and pinup format was often frustrating due to timing, in that other students received more attention. I think the studio size is too large and really should be reduced to 8-9 students max. It was also difficult knowing that our studio was going in a different direction than the rest of the studios - this gets back to the 'list of requirements' issue.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I was very pleased with the amount of energy and engagement that Joel poured into this studio. He was a constant driving force in pushing us along, trying to clarify our ideas and formulate a strong concept keeping a main idea at the core. His main strength was this engagement and forming an open structure for us to work within. I especially commend his post-midterm efforts to bring in guests, allowing for many practice rounds in presenting our projects succinctly.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Strength - Makram wanted us to reach a level of completeness in our design that other studio critics did not mandate (wall sections, feasibility). I think those things are important to an architectural education, especially for a project that lasts 13 weeks.Weakness - By the end of the semester, many of our studio projects had similar attributes that were \"greatly suggested\" by Makram (similar massing, roofs, structural solutions, facade patterning). Overall, I think our studio lacked the originality of other studios.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Makram is a solid critic, a likeable person, always prompt, never missed a day of studio, offered good criticism at times. My only complaint would be that in fact he was not consistent in his demand for rigor. I wish that he would have offered more specific and harsher criticism at times. My desk crits often went \u0093well\u0094 but I wouldn\u0092t come away with a clear idea of how to proceed. Perhaps he should be more demanding.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Makram is an excellent critic whom I would eagerly accept again if I were to take the studio over. Makram has am amazing ability to get behind and support each of his student's ideas in order to help push them to their maximum potential. Makram is incredibly friendly and personable, and this helps him relate to each of his students. Furthermore, Makram's accomplishments as a practitioner help him to understand the full range of issues present in a comprehensive building project. His ability to help us push abstract ideas into building form throughout the semester makes him a truly great critic.I highly recommend Makram as a critic for this studio and it was an incredibly productive and fun experience to work with him this semester.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Makram was an excellent critic. His knowledge and expertise encompass the entire spectrum of the studio, from conceptual ideas to technical refinement. He conveyed a passion for his students, and was both encouraging and demanding. Personally, I wish that he had been harder on me in the second half of the semester and pushed me to develop the conceptual aspects of my project as I refined the technical ones. Overall, the balanced approach be brings to his criticism is well suited for this studio, and is indicative of the duality of abstraction and refinement achieved collectively by his section as a whole.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0As I said above - Makram is one of the gems of this faculty - he is fantastic - he should be given the opportunity to advance, compensation, acknowledgment and anything else YSOA can do to keep him and expose as many students as possible to him and what he has to offer in studio. He is an articulate and care teacher who truly has the student's education as his priority. In short, he may be \"THE\" critic to study with at YSOA.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The main strenghts were his ability to work with a students ideas and progress them in the students design strenghts. I found makram to be very good and one of the best critics i have had in school.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I was very satisfied with Makram as a section critic, one of the best I have had at the school. He is very attentive and has a keen ability to help students develop THEIR ideas and not impose his personal design aesthetics onto the students.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Makram was a great third semester studio instructor. He had an encouraging positive approach to teaching, that at times could have been less positive and more critical (towards the end of the semester). All and all he pushed the students to complete comprehensive projects that materialized themselves architecturally, but also continuously reinforced larger conceptual ideas.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark is an excellent instructor who is willing to go to whatever lengths to help his students; even if it means meeting him inhis office in NYC or him coming in really late at night. His emphasis was on design, which caused issues like HVAC and structure to fall aside a bit, but that stuff is best learned in an office anyways. As we like to say, this is a design school, not a technical school.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark is the best studio critic I have ever had the opportunity to work with. He understands how to push you on your own strengths and how to improve your weaknesses. He never brings his own agenda to the table and is instead more interested in what each student is developing. When working with a student, he is able to bring a wealth of knowledge, precedents, technical skills, and a great eye for design in such a manner that (at least for myself) you both learn to trust his judgment but also how to evaluate his criticisms based on your own preference as to whether or not you want to follow them. I truly feel confident saying that following this studio, I am a better architecture student.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0I enjoyed and benefited from this studio very much, and overall I felt that Mark was a supportive and helpful critic. He is good at referencing precedent and he pushes his students to think about their projects materially and formally. My only major criticism is that in the second half of the semester desk crits became focused exclusively on subjective formal or cosmetic qualities of a project. I wish he had been interested in talking about drawings (which I took to be an important part of the studio). Mark also gives pretty short desk crits, which can be good sometimes but also gave us the impression that he was often in a hurry to leave.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The critic was perhaps guiltier than most of surreptitiously injecting his architectural agenda into the studio, prodding students to develop their projects in certain directions and to focus their energy on form-making, without ever taking responsibility for teaching or discussing the critical basis for such a design method. Form is a valid pursuit, and aesthetics can be taught. That should be admitted and embraced from the beginning, and it should be left to the students to work with or against that premise.The bifurcation of program and form--make it work, and then design it--produced projects that failed to take full advantage of their potential in either regard. A more synthetic approach, in which form is considered from the beginning (in tension with program) and is understood as constituting an essential function of architecture would have given students more time to develop satisfactory formal solutions to the given problem. Instead they were left to improvise and apply form to programs that had already been set. The process, already subject to numerous constraints, was further constrained in this way.The critic displayed an exceptional knowledge of and interest in architectural design, and encouraged formal (though not programmatic) exploration. However this encouragement did not translate into truly exploratory projects, as nearly all ended up dialled back to mediocrity (in formal terms) in the end due to varying combinations of lack of time, will, and ability.In all, the critic was--by virtue of his intelligence and devotion to the discipline architecture--excellent.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark has been an excellent professor. He is open, sensitive, skillful, thoughtful, understanding and receptive.He was able to immediately identify my weaknesses and consequently set goals that would push me to improve throughout the semester, in order to overcome them. In addition, he would focus on my strengths and coordinate the work so as to get to a point where I could showcase them.He has very high standards and asks for the best work, but at the same time, he is gracious and knows when to create expectations and when to reward those who did a good job. As a consequence, the general studio environment was very positive. We were all put in a position where we could learn from each other and competition was healthy, instead of disruptive.All criticism was constructive. Mark would come in every Monday and Thursday, sit down and offer an external point of view which could help improve my project. When I was feeling strongly about certain ideas, he would work with them, instead of imposing new ones. He would always try to understand my train of thoughts and complement it with his advice, instead of just deleting what I had been thinking of.He is also a very knowledgeable and inventive architect, who could give insightful and meaningful suggestions, based upon the work that his student is producing. His ideas were always to the point, never outside the logic frame of the project.He feels strongly about representation and how the project should be shown. Although sometimes I did not fully agree, I always trusted his advice, followed his indications and then found out that I was very pleased with what I had produced. I think that this is an important part of a learning process. It is good to be exposed to new and different ways of seeing things and learn from them in a constructive way.He also understands that in order to produce good work, the student has to be put in a position where he can learn. That is why the choice of Cody as his TA was so well received from all in the studio. Cody was always available to teach us new technical skills and gave us important advice on representation. He would transmit to us all the software knowledge that is necessary to meet the required school standards; his contribution was invaluable. I felt that the main objective was that of giving me the opportunity to best develop and represent my ideas, which is the main reason why I came to school.As Mark stated in one of his latest emails, right before finals, he would stand behind our projects, but then also would want us to be happy with them. He is a good professor because he is able to enforce the standards of the university while allowing the students to develop and express theirown ideas. He believes in personal freedom, but in a strong way he is able to show you where your project needs work. Thus, this studio was a successful learning experience for me, both in architectural and personal terms.Through hard work and following Mark\u0092s instructions and advice, I was able to gain my confidence back, and for this I will always be grateful to him.Great professor, great class, great experience.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0The strength was to push for more experimentation, the weakness was in being unable to teach the basics that were required in the brief. El Croquis is teaching us how to draw.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Martin was very supportive and helped us keep moving in a longer design process. He is the best critic I have had at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Martin is an expert in this studio. He knows when to apply the pressure and when to be more hands off in a productive way. He assigned us a few exercises of his own that were extremely productive and prepared us for the future deadlines to come. He knew when to push us into production mode in way that we can all carry with us into the semesters to come.He was sometimes hard to read in his feedback.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0i think martin finio is a great architect, but great architects don't always make the best teachers. i think martin looks to the end too often and doesn't allow for a students process to emerge. this maybe do to the model of the total building studio which looks for production over process.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Martin is a great motivator and knows his way around the schedule of events. Manages the section very well. Less vocal with conceptual aspects but in the end brings out the unique\/idiosyncratic in each individual.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Martin is a uniquely encouraging and caring critic. From the beginning I was impressed with his kind a positive attitude, which he balances with a great intensity and desire to push his students. He understands the pace of the semester well, and prepared us all for the various requirements. My only concern is that he pushed us too quickly to stop exploring and to settle on a design. A few weeks before Thanksgiving, I felt he was choosing not to comment any more on deeper design issues in order to ensure that we would all have finished products in the end. While practical, I feel that this was a bit stifling to creativity.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I was not pushed hard enough by my studio critic to clarify my ideas. Peter is best at technical drawings, and although the studio emphasizes the technical parts of architecture, that is not what I needed help with, therefor I do not feel like I got the most out of the semester. Even when I would approach Peter with conceptual issues, he would revert back to the technical parts of my design.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0-More critical comments during desk crits might spur some students to explore more ideas-Occasional group pin-ups would have been helpful-Very supportive teacher-Flexible in his allowing his students to explore any ideas they wished without being overly prescriptive",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I personally believe that PDB is a great guy that knows a lot about architecture. He was very helpful and positive throughout the semester, and I think that he should always be part of the YSOA community. That said, I believe that (as opposed to the other critics here) he can be extremely laid back an easy on his students, causing the entire studio to become extremely behind and critically lost.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter is a really nice guy and genuinely supportive. His weakness is his inabilityto critique outside of his comfort zone. With my project he seemed to not really be able to understand what i was trying to do and therefore shut down. He was too nice, I think because he felt like he could not offer any helpful criticism. He seems to value innovation, which is good, but can't figure out how to offer any helpful criticism.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter is clearly very knowledgeable and understands when a project is good or not. But he never pushed my project as much as I needed. I knew this semester would be a lot about self-motivation, and I appreciate Peter gave me the freedom to explore my own ideas, but I also needed him to be more critical at times. It was as if he was unable to see my project with fresh eyes, and provide a critical critique of my concept. I had to make the concept on my own, which was an important exercise for me, but, in the end, I am in school to learn and I would like to have professors who can open my eyes to solutions that I would not be able to come up with myself.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I really enjoyed having Peter as a critic. He has a ton of knowledge and is constantly provoking aspects of the project that are often overlooked or forgotten. I really appreciated that he allowed students a great deal of freedom to explore their own interests and was not pre-disposed to a particular way of working, etc. He allowed the students to work at their own pace but would often balance this against periodic pin-ups witha specific deliverable to allow the students to see what each other were doing and how they were progressing. Peter was always very keen to make sure that the building functioned leading to an investment in looking at the plan an continually making revisions which was always welcomed. I feel that Peter definitely responds better to models and a majority of his helpful criticism came from me working in model."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for core studio improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I think the largest area of improvement for the studio could be in the scheduling, particularly pertaining to reviews. I think for this studio there could be two different mid reviews, a concept review and a review for the development of the project, the first about two weeks before when we had our Mid Review and the second about two weeks after. The concept review would address issues of how the idea for the project manifests the idea in terms of site, programmatic organization, massing, urbanism, etc., and the development review would deal with more practical issues such as environmental and structural resolution. This would force students to think about these things before the final and would encourage developmentof the projects throughout the semester rather than in intense spurts of production.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0The course has all the right intentions to be a platform from which you learn how to put together a building, consider environment and systems. However I think what would significantly improve it is a change in the schedule. The precedent studies should be truncated and not a laborious project in of itself. Midreview should happen sooner so that students can get feedback on their ideas sooner and develop them from those criticisms. Then they can start to talk to consultants about a project that they are interested in developing further. I say this because, my midreview was helpful in comments but jumping to pragmatic issues of systems while I was in the midst of clarifying the schematic design was not helpful.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0I don't think there is room for Mark Gage and his ego in the same studio...I would recommend he not coordinate next year and simply teach a section instead. I really don't understand why it's so difficult to find competent coordinators. We are 0 for 3 in my book.Here's a suggestion: why not have a more theory-based coordinator? Could you imagine it \u0096 being stuck between Emmanuel writing our project and the HVAC experts helping us realize it? What a concept! That is what Yale can and should be all about.",
    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0In future years my primary suggestion would be to push interpretations of program. This semester allows for full development and testing the realistic manifestation of complex and challenging ideas. I do not think that largely the studio achieved this radical reinterpretation of program in a cohesive way.I would also suggest greater feedback from the client. I think that comments from a constituent would complicate the program in a good way. For instance, this year Laura Tatum could have been an active part of interim pinups and encourage interpretations of the program to give them more vitality.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Don't make anyone be held back a year because of portfolio review. I think you will find this suggestion unanimous amongst the entire student body.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0A restructuring of the daylighting portion to emphasize a technological set of tools (Maxwell or similar rendering program, ecotect) rather than a traditional large-model one. Gage's studio learned to render through their TA Cody Davis; I wish I had gained the same educationin one way or another. Yet another semester has passed and I still feel behind in terms of rendering because I have not had the time and help to master this.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0I would suggest more interaction between the studio sections.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The studio is incredibly valuable to the students in conveying the fundamentals of how an architectural idea comes to life. As a whole, however, there seems to be a disjunction between those students who have a conceptual idea that lacks tectonic aptitude, and those who produce working buildings without the abstract framework. The studio critics must work collectively to achieve an evenness to the final products. The students would benefit from more interaction between studio sections, and perhaps occasional desk crits from other studio critics to expose the students to a variety of ideas and approaches.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0The studio was much more responsive to the students this year - I think it is more balanced then in past semesters.",
    "Instructor: Makram el Kadi \u00a0Less environmental.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Keep Mark around and don't let the other critics run wild with absurd interpretations of the program which in fact are quite boring.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0I think that the participation of a skillful TA is key to the success of the studio. I think that each critic should incorporate in the class a TA who is able to provide the necessary support in terms of software knowledge and representation skills, and who is available every week.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0cut out the ecotect",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0make known the goals of the class more. ie. is it a precursor to systems? is it to wrangle with complex programs? what is it? even if the direction of such objectives weren't entirely enforced, they would help focus the efforts of students.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0There should be far less emphasis on 'selling' our projects (flashy renderings, etc.) and more emphasis on developing our own unique approaches to design and processes of thinking through architecture.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Needs to be a 2 track system for the M.Arch degree. Yale does a decent job of catching up the non background students in terms of design capacity and creative thinking, but simply will never cover the gap in terms of skillset and exposure, and therefore the ability to create a comprehensive project.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I would have liked Mark Gage to not be so negligent to the studio as a whole. He frequently sent information that was relevant to the whole studio to his studio section in advanced. Also, due to the way that the studios are split up for reviews, I was unable to get feed-back from him at either my midterm or my final. I would like to see more care put into the organization of the class.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Change the problem every year!!!",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I would structure the skills workshops more abstractly. I felt like once i had done all the work in the workshop that i had to keep the major tenants of the design just to be able to keep up. The abstracts for the workshop don't have to be actually rooms or projects but could look more generally at the site and the program.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Reduce the program so the students can have more freedom to explore concepts. Although the final level of production was fairly impressive across the board, I was not impressed by my colleagues abilities to constructs interesting concepts.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The core works well, forces students to juggle many things at once. If anything it would be helpful to fold in some of the content covered by Phil Bernstein's class during 1st year. In the vein of the \"comprehensive\" approach, it may benefit the student to generate a tentative construction schedule and budget for each project."
