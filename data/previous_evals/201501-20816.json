   "comments": [
    "The course is a great introduction to Borges and authors related to him. The professor's analysis is one of this class's strengths. It might be improved by having student presentations during the first half of the seminar, so they can inform discussion in the second half. Additionally, I felt some of the non-Borges readings were not discussed at length. The balance between Borges and the other texts seems a little off. It would be interesting to make it exclusively Borges, or, on the other hand, pare down the Borges and make it more Comp Lit oriented.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class -- the reading list is amazing, and Professor Gonzalez Echevarria chose a good list of other authors to read in addition to Borges. If you've ever read a Borges short story and enjoyed it, or if you like magical realism, you'll enjoy this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in literature (Latin American or otherwise). Not only is Borges one of the most significant and influential writers of the 20th century, but his writings directly and indirectly address a number of theoretical issues related to the nature of language, literature, identity, time, and tradition which would be of interest to any serious student of literary criticism.",
    "Great class on Borges. Great instructor in RGE. Take this course if you would like to learn--not just about literature, but about why literature is still important and relevant.",
    "Take it if you've never read Borges. Take it if you've already read Borges."

   "comments": [
    "The course contributed a lot of great ideas that I think will be helpful when writing my dissertation. In terms of knowledge, it gave me a good sense of 20th-century literature in Latin America and how some of the pieces of the puzzle fit together.",
    "I have a respect for the scope of Latin American literature that I didn't before and that not many people at Yale University can claim to genuinely have.",
    "This was my first academic exposure to Borges. I'd read some of his stories before, but this class exposed me to his work in a more rigorous way, and in tandem with other authors whose works I was not as familiar with.",
    "This course directly contributed to my overall knowledge of the Latin American literature field by acquainting me more closely with one of its most canonical writers and the influence his writing exercised on others. Though not directly related to my research interests, this course certainly sharpened my skills in literary analysis and has allowed me to work toward my goal of becoming well-versed in Hispanic literature in general.",
    "This course on Borges is crucial to the field of Spanish literature. It will certainly contribute to my future research in numerous ways.",
    "He made me a better reader. Thanks!"
