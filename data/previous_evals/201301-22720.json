   "comments": [
    "Yes, good and easy L5 Spanish class",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about diseases and has some Spanish experience. The class would probably be kind of boring if you were really fluent in Spanish, but is perfect for someone who has reached L5 but still needs some practice. The class was interesting every day and I learned a lot about diseases while getting to practice my Spanish!",
    "Take it if you're interested in medical Spanish at all, want an extra credit, and want to meet a really nice professor.",
    "Medical Spanish is a great L5 Spanish class to take. It may be difficult to get into the class, but it is certainly worth it. There is consistent homework from class to class but it is very manageable. If you placed into L5 I would definitely recommend this class even if you are skeptical about the topic.",
    "I would recommend this class to undergrad and graduate students who would like to learn a new culture and medicine along with having the opportunity to speak Spanish. The professor is very cordial and knows the topic very well.",
    "Super easy, minimum level of work. Just go, do the homework, and walk away. I lost a lot of enthusiasm when I realized we were not learning about emergency medicine at all. If you want to work in a Spanish geriatrics ward, this class would be great for you. Otherwise, just take it for an easy L5.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is very interesting and a fun class. The course material\/ packet is great to read and the Professor gives fair assessments. This is a great course for someone who wants to continue spanish after L4, but does not necessarily want to major in spanish or take other upper level courses.",
    "Take it! If you really want to learn about medicine\/biology in Spanish, this is definitely a worthwhile course. Plus, there isn't too much work involved.",
    "YES TAKE IT. Amazing class.",
    "It's a great course to take after L4. It's not quite a seminar, but it is a very small lecture course of about 30 people. You learn about diseases in Spanish, practice doctor-patient skits, write a short final paper, take a midterm, make a presentation, and do 2 homework assignments weekly.",
    "Yep! if you are interested in medicine and already speak some spanish this would be really useful. Consistent workload too",
    "I would strongly recommend this class! It is a fun and enjoyable class, and you will have the chance to improve your Spanish skills, improve your medical vocabulary, as well as learn important basic concepts in terms of physiology and pathology, which will be useful later in medical school.",
    "If you really want to improve your spanish ability, this is not the best class to take. If you want to have an easy Spanish class where you'll learn some interesting things and practice your reading, writing, and speaking a bit, this is a good class for you.",
    "Definitely take this class. So much fun, so much information, great speaking practice, and Mercedes is AMAZING.",
    "Spanish for Medical Professions is amazing!!!! You must take this course, and Profesora Carreras is such a joy to have that I did not mind the 9am class. This course is very interesting and the work load is manageable.",
    "Take it! Even if you're not considering a medical profession, this class is very interesting and you learn a lot about medicine!",
    "Mercedes is the best professor ever! Seriously take this class, it's so fun and very valuable. Workload is not too bad but the payoff is amazing.",
    "Great course. Take it, and you won't regret it. I have little to no interest in actually becoming a doctor, but I still found the material interesting and relevant to daily life. I was able to maintain my Spanish listening and writing skills very well. While there were certainly ample opportunities for speaking in group exercises, this class will probably not improve your conversational abilities in any measurable way, so look elsewhere if that is your goal.",
    "It is an excellent course. I would highly recommend it to another student. For other students in the medical professions there could be a more detailed course.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a pretty relaxed class and I learned a lot.",
    "Spanish for Medical Professions is a great opportunity to learn Spanish by studying a real-world topic, without really focusing on the mechanics of Spanish itself. Your Spanish will improve, but it will be mostly through acquiring vocabulary, and becoming accustomed to and emulating the grammatical structures used in medical literature. Your listening skills will also improve, due to listening to Professor Carreras' rapid-fire Castilian accent and watching medical videos. I would very much recommend the class, even if one is not planning to enter a medical profession. But if so, it is extremely helpful in that regard.",
    "Great course and expertly taught in a stress free environment. Especially useful class as well",
    "I like to call this class \"Med School but in Spanish\". You do cover a variety of topics in medicine in depth and you do learn a bunch of medical jargon both in Spanish and English, depending on your familiarity with medicine. Prof. Carreras is always prepared and very understanding. Having this class at 9 AM is rough especially when the end of the semester rolls around with midterms and final assignments roll around.",
    "The only Spanish class I've taken in my life and it was incredible. You learn so much new vocabulary, which just expands the range of topics you can cover in your conversations en espa\u00c3\u00b1ol. The workload is pretty manageable; even though there's usually a homework assignment due at almost every lecture, it's usually very short and straightforward. She gave everyone an A on our oral presentations, she told us what to expect on the in-class midterm, and our final essays were 5 pages on any topic of our choosing. Awesome class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in medicine or just wanting to get back into a Spanish class. It is super laid back. Thera are two reading responses a week, a midterm, a 10 minute presentation, and a 5 page paper. Professor Carreras is super fun and laid back. The material is very medically relevant and you can learn a lot from the readings."
