While working in the computer lab, I felt that the TA sometimes rushed through explanations and I felt a bit uncomfortable asking my very basic questions. Perhaps this is because she had so many students asking her questions at the same time.It wasn't always easy to follow along during the lecture, but things made more sense when working on the assignments in a more hands-on manner.",

I don't plan to be a GIS wizard - I just wanted to familiarize myself with the software and gain a basic toolset for work that I will need to tackle in the future. I was also hoping to gain a sense for how GIS would be used in other ways by people in my field. With the arbitrary homework assignments, I really didn't get exposure to other viable projects that might be done by my colleagues. It also made it very difficult to invest myself in the work. I understand that the instructor gave the option to come up with my own homework assignment, but unless I have a problem on my mind and ready to go, that can be a lot of work. And I already don't have enough time as it is."

    "This class challenges students to think about spatial analysis and use of technology in a way that hasn't been offered in my other classes. Students are encouraged to work together, be creative, and think through a problem as they learn new tools - which is highly applicable to our professional work. The instructor is responsive to student questions and encourages discussion.",
    "The class teaches applicable, real-life concepts that are very helpful for job search; amazing instructor",

    "Dana is a great Professor. Class was generally engaging.",
    "Professor Tomlin somehow finds a way to explain the technical tools with real-life stories and situations, in a context we can understand. Behind having technical mastery of the concepts, he also is simply a good teacher, a combination which is rare at this school.",
    "Overall, I thought that this course was excellent. I get the sense that I learned much more in this class than one would typically learn in an introductory raster GIS class. Dana Tomlin is clearly a GIS expert and also clearly invests a lot of time and thought into communicating the material in a way that maximizes student learning. He is also extremely responsive to student inquiries. He is a knowledgeable and devoted teacher.",
    "Dana's effective and refined teaching style& enthusiasm for subject. It is probably the best course I have ever taken.",

Instead of looking for clowns in cities, it would have been helpful to find suitable areas for forest growth, corn production, or a wild life reserve.Also: The course was about understanding how to \"think GIS\" instead of how to successfully present something in GIS. Practical things like how to import a map into ArcGIS were left out.We mostly focused on a few tools and many tools were not addressed at all.",

Also, it was sometimes a bit disheartening to really get stuck on an assignment and to not be able to move forward at all without help from peers or the TA (some of whom were able to figure it out on their own). It was also a little disappointing for the final assignment of the class to be so difficult! I would have liked to end on a high note...",

I realize this is necessary for such a technical class, but just making the statement so that the search can continue for anything to lessen the workload.It should be noted that when students complained near the end of the semester, Professor Tomlin changed the final project to be less work.",
    "Although the pace was fast and the workload was quite heavy, I did not find it to be problematic until the end of the semester, when the group work increased and the challenges became primarily logistical, as opposed to conceptual. The lastcouple of assignments didn't seem to be as well thought out or deliberate as all the others. In future years, I would suggest introducing model builder earlier, so that students get more practice with it throughout the semester.",
    "None. I liked the brain teasers.",
    "I found it hard, at the end of the semester, to know what to focus on. We tailored our presentation to something that would appeal to the class, as we were told that it would be graded by our classmates; we then found out that there would be no grading by the class (and no extra points for a good presentation, even though Dana mentioned there was the possibility of such).The assignments themselves were also sometimes tricky to figure out exactly what the end goal was- I do not mean in terms of how to solve the assignments, but sometimes it felt like we had to do it the particular way that Dana wanted us to do it.I'd also have liked a focus on using external data that one might look for and find in a real-world project setting (e.g., searching for datasets online instead of being provided them, then figuring out how to use them).",

    "Be aware that this course is a lot of work, so I would make sure you plan to have enough time in your schedule to really be able to spend time on this class. Definitely work with a partner when permitted. Dana is great about responding to questions over email, so don't hesitate to write to him with problems you encounter.",
    "This is one of the best courses that I've taken so far! The work load is heavy but it is also a crucial part of learning GIS, so students should make sure that they are able to devote the time every week that is needed to succeed.",
    "Be aware that weekly assignments take a significant amount of time and can get extremely frustrating, but I definitely felt like it was time well spent.",
    "Take it! The work and hours are totally worth it!",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it!",
    "Be aware that it's a *lot* of work.",
    "Be ready for a lot of time, but it is totally worth it. This is one of the best classes at this school and will make you a better student.",
    "You will get out of this course what you put in. If you are willing and able to devote 10-to-15 hours a week to this course, you will progress quite quickly. If, on the other hand, you have many other commitments and are taking other courses with heavy workloads, you will probably struggle to keep up and will not get as much out of the course as you could.If you do take the course, take advantage of Dana's offers to communicate via email and in person. These conversations will help you understand the assignments and grasp the course concepts.",
    "Definitely take the course, it will prove useful.",

    "DON'T TAKE ANY OTHER DIFFICULT CLASSES. THIS CLASS WILL TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE.",
    "Limit the amount of time you give to each assignment and always look for opportunities to improve your grade; re-doing the assignment helps to understand the program more clearly."
