    "I really liked the class overall. The modeling assignments were really helpful for me since I didn't have much background in modeling in excel.There needs to be a course like this for students at FES. I thought the pace of the class was a bit slow, but I also have a strong background in much of the course material (beyond the modeling pieces).",
    "I thought the most valuable part of the course was the beginning, when we focused on the equations and techniques used in financially modeling investments in timberland. After that, the material became concrete.I think the course would have been better had we started with the equations and techniques (as we did) and then taken up (sequentially) one, two, or three of Professor Spalding's actual deals that she was involved with. This would have grounded the material much more in the real world and would have made it much more applied. As it was taught, it was often hard to get a feel for the relevance of some of the concepts. It seemed like we spent an inordinate amount of time talking about various types of risks without really fitting an appreciation for those risks into a decision-making framework. I think it would have been better to go step by step through a few investments, through Professor Spalding's eyes, to really get a sense for why decisions were made the way they were.I also want to comment that John Loevner, the TA, made himself very available and was very helpful.",
    "Absolutely excellent course, good materials, and well taught.",
    "1. The course readings were targeted and well-structured. The best part of this course was the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to draw on personal experience and guide class discussion.",
    "Re: Question 4The \"pace\" of the course was not too slow and in fact quite a bit of material was covered and the instructor did an excellent job communicating the information.However, I do feel that more assignments would have helped students absorb the material and apply lectures to the assignments. More intensity would have helped dive home essential concepts.",
    "5) Would have been neat to take a field trip to see some of the work in action.",
    "In reference to question #2: I found the usefulness of assignments varied greatly. Assignments 1, 2, 3, and the final assignment were very practical and I taught me a lot. Assignments 4 and 5 were less useful because they required a much less in depth\/precise analysis."

    "The homework assignments and final assignment. Some of the class discussions were great, too, and Deborah was very willing to bring in her perspectives from her own work it the ecosystem markets sector.",

    "The breadth of covering many parts of ecosystem and forest finance.",
    "Insights from the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional experience provided a great point of discussion for framing conclusions from the course readings.",
    "Examples from the instructor's own work experience in forest finance field was very very eye-opening. Some of the assignments allows one to work with real world data in forest finance. Learning how to build a model was one of the best aspects of this course.",
    "The instructor applied knowledge from her work experience, as well as shared documentation from business deals. this was a great insight.",
    "Practice with financial concepts",
    "Learning about basic finance skills through forestry and ecosystem services.",
    "Lectures and discussions were engaging and interesting",
    "Deborah. She brought not just experience, but a realistic perspective on her experiences, which helped me to understand the lay of the land. She was also an extremely engaging lecturer with organized topical lectures and anecdotes each week.",
    "The pragmatic and realistic approach taken by the professor and use of real world cases to explain how things actually operate in the real world.",
    "Since I am an international student and very interested in mechanisms of payments for ecosystem services, the best aspects of this course was to understand the mechanisms existent in the US.I really liked the lecture and texts related to it.",
    "The real world experience Deborah brought to class, the clear examples she shared from the work, etc."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the material was often very abstract and disconnected from application.Perhaps using a handful of actual land deals or property data to work through all of the various components would be better? It's very hard to internalize what some of the components really mean until they are connected to some real transaction or situation. In sum I think a case based class would work very well here.",
    "Things became a bit repetitive at the end; I think it would have been more helpful to walk through 2 deals from start to finish. Some of the discussions about risk were so vague it was hard to think about how you would apply in context\/bake them into a model.",
    "It's almost too broad, it would be much better to have two classes to cover more material in more depth.",
    "I would have liked to have a more extensive tutorial on how to build a pro forma and work in excel. The TA was a great resource, but it would have been helpful to have a structured class session.",
    "More assignments\/rigor\/math\/excel",
    "Integrating excel with lectures",
    "None",
    "I felt like there was a sudden jump in the complexity of materials expected in the homework assignments with the last few (eg a huge spreadsheet to analyze and the final project), where the practical material learned in the class didn't necessarily help in understanding how to utilize and implement such tools. (Did not make it to office hours which probably would have helped however). A more gradual build-up or some sort of \"how-to\" on these would have really helped.",
    "Maybe an additional or substitute assignment that taught another finance skill (in addition to the NPV and LEV calculations we learned early on).",
    "None",
    "It should be given more time to topics related to international forestry.Maybe assignments related to international forestry as well.",
    "I occasionally had difficulty integrating specific market details that were common to lectures (e.g. wetland credits) into a larger understanding of how the economy works\/is driven. I think a few slides connecting the micro to the macro in each lecture would be very helpful."

It also introduced me to issues I wasn't aware of. In the end, the course added, for me, another tool and way of thinking about how to conserve land.",
