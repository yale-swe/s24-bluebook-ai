   "comments": [
    "Bogdan is the man.",
    "Challenging, but rewarding. I'd recommend this course because multivariable calculus overlaps into so many other fields and is required\/recommended for many majors. However, I would like to emphasize the fact that it was challenging. Don't take it if you don't have to or don't have a strange obsession with math.",
    "It starts of deceptively easy then gets quite difficult after the second midterm.",
    "It is a very hard class, but it is worth taking.",
    "yes, but only because it's a requirement. if you really enjoy math, go ahead.",
    "It's a challenging course, particularly for a first-year math student, but if you like math it's not that bad. Definitely take it if you have any interest in mathematics and\/or you're going into engineering.",
    "Math 120 is basically just multivariable calc at its finest. Overall, the material is not that difficult. The course definitely got a lot tougher at the end, but I would recommend this course to anyone that's willing to work hard and put in the extra time to learn the material.",
    "It's hard. But I've always liked a challenge. I would take it Bogdan.",
    "Setting up integrals and interpreting physical realities of math.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is extremely helpful, not overly complicated, not too much work, and very interesting.",
    "Would recommend to a student who has a decently strong background in calculus.",
    "Math 120 was a good introduction to calculus in three dimensions, which will certainly provide a strong background for physics and other pursuits. All of the concepts are readily applicable and can be grasped, though the concepts increase in difficulty towards the end of the semester. I would most definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It's a nice course if you have a solid background in Calculus. Bogdan is amazing- very helpful and dedicated. Take it only if you have a 5 on the AP Calc! Or else the material can be difficult. Also, do the homework. It really helps for the exams. Exams are very fair as well.",
    "Math120 helps you visualize problems in 3D, but it doesn't have too many applications. If you want to learn how to use Stokes in real life or physics, maybe ENAS will be better.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who wants to take a calc course because he or she likes math. I would not recommend this course for someone who needs to find a CR course. I would absolutely recommend taking this course with Bogdan Vioreanu."
