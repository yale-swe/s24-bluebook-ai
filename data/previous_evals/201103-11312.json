    "The workload of the class was much heavier than any other classes I have taken at FES. The project was extremely time intensive and was comparable to the project based courses that focus the entire semester on the single project. However we had a midterm and a problem set to accompany the project.",
    "not very well organized, the concept is great, could have been better as a seminar-style class.",
    "The material (mostly readings) is very valuable but could be better presented in class. Also, this course could almost be 6 credits since it has a project PLUS regular course materials (which themselves include a lot of readings). Lastly, the problem set was fine, but the midterm was a bit out of the blue considering there wasn't much clarity on what was being tested, etc.",
    "Overall it is difficult to assess this course b\/c it was taught my guest lecturers. Some guest lecturers were very good while some were not. Generally the conceptual material on methods and their application was well taught. Some of the other material, such as TEEB for policy, was not as well done.",
    "Course lacked structure. We should have started projects earlier in the semester. Groups should have been larger, and it would have been helpful to have a discussion section to work on the final project in a more structured environment.",
    "it is difficult to evaluate the professor or pace specifically due to the number of guest lecturers.",
    "This course must be of great interest for people that want to have an approach to accurate and nowadays policy making programs, such as TEEB.",
    "For a course that offered so much, it delivered so little.I was really disappointed with the course.The main issue was that it was, for the most part, a seminar series with speakers talking about their work, but very very rarely (with the exception of Mike Christie and Reg Howarth) was there any actual teaching involved of how to learn core TEEB skills.It would have been much better if we'd had the course in a smaller room (so we could talk to the lecturers more easily) but Pavan refused to entertain this idea.",
    "The way that the class was organized was more appropriate for a lecture series than a class. The abundance of guest lectures made the course feel disjointed. Lecturers often repeated information that other lecturers covered, and it made the course feel more like a sales pitch for TEEB than a robust theoretical analysis of the material, or an opportunity to develop practical skills. I think that it would have been helpful to have more problem sets or other deliverables early on in the class.The group projects were difficult to complete due to reliance on unreachable outside points of contact.",
    "Question 1: Readings were useful, but we would have benefited from more critical readings."

    "The opportunity to meet the invited speakers, who were bringing",
    "The project and ability to get in depth on a TEEB project.",
    "speakers were impressive",
    "The project. It's very intensive and takes a lot of time but it's totally worth it. A lot of other project classes have you doing grunt work or research for someone else, but this one actually had us designing something. Our particular project (REDD+) didn't actually relate too much to class concepts, but they were a factor.",
    "The general concept of the course - taking the UN TEEB study and bringing it to Yale - was great because it was unique and provided students with the opportunity to discuss these issues with practitioners.",
    "It gave a good fundamental knowledge of environmental economics, and it got me to use this in a class paper, which I feel came our pretty good.",
    "Getting the opportunity to hear from a variety of people working on the subject and getting to learn about issues on the forefront of thinking for conservation and environmental stewardship.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Flow of the lessons:A tighter structure is needed to guide students through the content of the course and its goals. Invted speakers may have overlapping topics, but often times they were talking about different issues. Although this very much in line with the spirit of learning through interdisciplinarity, having more structure would help students get more out of the class without having to work overtime to understand the connections.That being said, the workload for this class was definitely over a 3 credit course.",
    "coordination with the presenters. Often they repeated sections, especially describing what TEEB is.",
    "had to create an atmosphere that allowed more interaction with speakers",
    "Lectures need to be better organized. The material is very useful and valuable but the lectures were often dry and identical to the slides - and didn't communicate much that wasn't in the books. Also, guest lecturers made the lecture quality vary far too much.",
    "More class discussion was needed. While the instructors provided opportunities for the students to meet and talk with the lecturers, a more structured discussion period during class would be better at promoting discussion.",
    "The course suffered somewhat from being a first time offering. There were some kinks which got ironed out along the way. Although some of the speakers were facinating, some werenot as exciting. Getting a roster of a dozen plus speakers from around the world sounds good, but some of them did not add much to the class. After the midterm, there was little insentive to do the readings and follow the material closely. Perhaps weekly requried responses from students would have kept everyone on their toes. Also, the atmosphere of the cavernous Burke gave the class a less than cozy feel.",
    "Group projects were challenging because often the clients were not responsive.",
    "More directed guidance for the final paper would be useful, especially in terms of setting expectations and helping to arrange meetings with data sources.",
    "Alerting the guest speakers to the material already covered in class, as it was very repetitive.",
    "it would have helped to assign the group project earlier in the semester, as that gave structure\/purpose to the course.",
    "Less repetition among lecturers because it makes people lose interest.",
    "The class size was small and the room too large. There was not much time for discussion during the class time, and I think it would have been more useful to have actual discussion sessions, rather than informal mingling and conversation after class. I was often not able to attend these outside sessions due to my class schedule, and didn't feel challenged to participate during the lectures. A smaller classroom size and a scheduled discussion section would be more conducive to the learning process.The design of the class projects and deliverables.",
    "1. The class needed to be taught in a smaller room. This seems like a small logistical detail, but it made a huge difference in terms of the student experience. It was extremely difficult to engage in the lecture when there were 15 people in a room meant for 125. A smaller seminar room would have kept students engaged, and would have allowed for more optimal learning.2. There needed to be a discussion section. There was never an opportunity to critically discuss the course material or the readings. There are some controversial aspects to the ideas put forward in the class, but it seemed inappropriate or disrespectful to question or challenge the guest lecturers on those points, especially since lectures were being recorded. And even during 'happy hours,' there wasn't an opportunity to discuss the ideas or readings in critical detail. One guest lecture and one discussion section a week (or a similar arrangement) would have allowed the students to synthesize the material. Without this synthesis, many students I spoke with felt that they got a lot less out of the course than they could have.3. Many lectures were simplistic or repetitive. It didn't seem like some guest lecturers understood the other lectures that had been presented, or the caliber of students they were addressing. This meant that valuable time was spent presenting repetitive information. While some ofthe concepts were essential to the overall understanding of TEEB, it should've been assumed that we understood these basic concepts after the first few lectures. This would have allowed more time for lectures and course material to go in depth on the topics being presented.4. The problem set was really difficult to make sense of. I worked on the assignment with other students, and also sought help from students with relevant professional experience at FES and SOM. However, the instructions and expectations were extremely unclear. For example, it was never mentioned that only one or two students would get credit for answering the extra credit question, and the first question should've explained that the answer needed to include a discussion of cost curves.",
    "It needs to have more excercises and \"lab work\" to enhance the required skills in valuation and CBA analysis."

    "Group work was very useful for synthesizing course materials and also doing the kind of work that will be demanded of students in the professional world. Also, the instructor has lots of useful connections to practitioners in the subject area and many fruitful collaborations were possible. The one suggestion I would have is to give the students their teams and projects earlier in the semester, as this would allow them to develop a deeper connection to clients, especially if those clients are in the developing world and not on a Western business and time scale.",
    "Advantages:We were able to gather more information and divide tasks.Disadvantages: Group dynamics were difficult for a coiple of reasons: Directions about the goal of the project were not too clear. We had one lesson on this issue and were expected to begin working from there. Having a group slowed the learning curve.The expectations for the project were high for the amount of time observed in other 3 credit classes,",
    "Advantages - Allowed us to dig deeper into a subject and write a robust report.Disadvantages - Figuring out how to deal with group dynamics and partners that are not adequately prepared or knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "group project was a great idea, wish there was more guideline of what was being expected.",
    "Advantage: We bonded over our frustrations. Also, an endless supply of clementines.Disadvantage: The frustrations!",
    "Group work is good because a) group work is a major part of the \"real\" world and b) because you can learn from your fellow students. However a large portion of the grade is based on the group paper, which I do not think is effective because my evaluation is (for better or worse) based on the work of my peers. Free-riding is a problem.",
    "My work group was just one other student. It was good in that we divided up the work equally, and were both involved in the project. Often when groups are 4 or 5, managing the group becomes harder than the project.",
    "The clients were challenging. We were able to cover more material than I would have alone. We had all the standard challenges with group work.",
    "The advantages were that I was able to learn from my team mates. The disadvantages were that sometimes progress was a little slow when you had to wait for your team mates to complete certain tasks.",
    "confusion led to delay and frustration, group members interpreted advice differently.",
    "The advantages are that if the team gets along well, a lot of feedback can be he outcome and great ideas from all the teammates can come out of this. Also, I believe that having interdisciplinary teams also helps people to focus more on the work and not on who knows more, it is cooperation instead of competition.Society and environmental issues are done nowadays in group and big teams, so working as a group must be a quality to develop and a requirement for environmental managers.",
    "Advantages: bringing together people with different interests and experience levels.Disadvantages: Conflicting schedules, experiences levels, and writing styles. It is especially problematic to have group members leave the country for another class in the midst of the group project (after encountering other roadblocks) and to have to bear a group project work load alone.",
    "The group work allowed for an application of some of the concepts discussed in the course. I found this exercise valuable.",
