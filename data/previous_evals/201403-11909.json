   "comments": [
    "A great senior fall studio in which you think very hard about materials and how joints meet (which are often overlooked in the junior studios). I felt like the dominant void was a tad abstract, but it was a good exercise in thinking at-real-scale. Also, the quarry and the music haven projects forced me to think about human experiences beyond architecture in the conventional sense. Turner and Adam are also amazing critics who have such a sense of space.",
    "If you've made it through sophomore spring, junior fall and junior spring, first- congratulations! You survived! Now it's time for the good stuff (if any of my professors from sophomore and\/or junior year are reading this, sorry, but you know those years were meant to be tough). Adam and Turner are amazing. Their style of teaching lets you guide your own learning process a lot more than you've been allowed in the past. That is both easier and harder in a lot of ways: despite its strenuous workload, your studios in junior year were very strictly guided, whereas senior year, it's sort of up to you to put in the effort and direction. It is admittedly hard to push yourself that way, but when you do, the results will be so much richer than anything you've ever produced before.",
    "You are given a lot more independence this semester which can be both intimidating and awesome- on the one hand you can try any type of crazy idea you have but on the other hand its sometimes difficult to maintain the same level of production without hard deadlines. Adam and Turner are really nice and helpful and its nice that they seem equally enthusiastic about everyone's projects.",
    "This studio is a real treat. My favorite class at Yale by far.",
    "I would recommend this",
    "A wonderful change of pace from junior spring. You've earned it, but you need to maintain some momentum and do work.",
    "The antithesis of Joyce's studio. It's a completely different dynamic. Turner and Adam are incredibly encouraging and the studio is both really interesting and enjoyable. Still, there's very little structure and the strength of your projects ends up depending on you and only you. Time to learn some time management!",
    "This will be much better than junior year. Turner is so wonderful, and so encouraging. He'll appreciate wacko, fun things and you'll have a lot of freedom to do what you want to do. There's a lot less discipline and it'll be important to pace yourself and stay inspired.",
    "Enjoy every second. Talk to Adam and Turner as much as you can, soak up their enthusiasm for your work and for their own, and make time for studio even when it feels like it's not totally necessary to. Make the most of every second."
