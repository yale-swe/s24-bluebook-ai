    "Most painful class ive ever taken at Yale. dont do it. just dont.Sid Cahn and Oliver Baker were cool people though.",
    "This course is a pretty fair way to deal with introductory physics lab. It's not too much work nor too much fun. It is what it is, although the TA that you get is vital to your experience. Get Alex Cerjan if he's teaching the class again.",
    "Everyone swore to me that this was the most tedious, annoying, horrible lab they have ever taken. Whoever told me this must have never taken a lab other than the first semester of this class. Honestly, it's not that bad. The addenda aren't that much work once you figure out how to write them. Some of the labs are confusing but a good T.A. helps a lot (d'oh).If I were to kill one thing in the entire lab, it would be the potentiometer. We are not friends. I am friends with the oscilloscope and you should be too.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn the basics of circuits, etc. but it's not really worth it if you don't have to take it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It's needed for course requirements and it helps to illustrate the physics that you learn in the classroom.",
    "A general overview of of basic physics laboratory concepts. The experiments, while not extremely interesting, were thorough and instructive.",
    "It's a general physics lab, convering all the main points with a bit of an emphasis on circuitry. I'm sure that if you're going to take it, you probably have to.",
    "Yes. It helped me better understand topics taught in lecture.",
    "If you're taking it, your stuck with it for whatever reason.",
    "NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. IF YOU'RE NOT PREMED, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "No. Take it if you need it for a requirement. Don't if you can help it.",
    "If you have to take a lab foryour major, this is definitely a good one to take - you get to play with all kinds of circuits, lenses, etc. and there isn't too much work outside of the lab time.",
    "I learned more in this lab than I did in the lecture. The stuff is dull if it's not what you're interested in, but it's rewarding if you put the time in.",
    "This is a lab report that is supposed to supplement the course, PHYS 151, but I actually ended up learning more from the lab because it was so far ahead. But I learned the stuff better because I got to manipulate things.",
    "The best way to succeed in Physics 166L is to do the lab report the same day that you do the lab. This is how I survived. I would look at the lab reports that I had done a week prior and not remember anything the day I needed to hand them in. I found that I did my best and most efficient work when it was fresh in my head. After that I had a week of no worries about physics lab! I had a really good time in lab, too. I think your TA really makes the difference in your experience.",
    "You learn to set up circuits and use an oscilloscope. Only take this class if you absolutely have to.",
    "only take it if you have to for major or premed.",
    "take it only if you need to.",
    "Only take this course if you are pre-med and have to.",
    "Terrible lab course. The work outside of lab is manageable, but you can't get a good grade in it (Professor Casten's way of grading is bad). The lab experiments are just boring and useless, I don't think I have taken anything away from the course. The final is brutal. If there was more of an emphasis in teaching us the concepts and explaining what the results actually meant, that would've helped.",
    "It's a pre-med requirement. Enough said. If you're taking this, chances are you have to, so it doesn't matter that its a boring, monotonous course.",
    "A challenging but rewarding basic physics lab. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "It's not particularly exciting to take unless you need it for pre-med or as a prerequisite for science\/engineering. Not difficult though. Much more relaxed than chem and bio labs.",
    "It's good but could be better.",
    "Take it if you have to; these three hours are the longest hours of the week by far.",
    "Hard lab - lots of time needed for lab evaluations. Lab much more enjoyable with a good TA.",
    "I would only take it if it's required, which it is for premeds (as I am).",
    "Physics lab was characterized by the range of abilities of students in handling the concepts assigned. Depending on your ability level, 166 could be anything from a very stressful class to an enjoyable exploration of physics. I very much enjoyed some of the labs (most of the oscilloscope work, for example), but at the same time found a large portion of the labs tedious and unhelpful (e.g. the estimation lab). Of the labs I have taken at Yale, however, I feel this lab was the best.",
    "Yes, much easier\/ more interesting than the first semester but the final practical was a killer",
    "do NOT take this unless you absolutely need to",
    "I would never ever ever suggest taking this class unless u ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. I basically left wanting to die every time.",
    "You're taking this class, because you have to most likely. It's rough, no one really likes it, but you just have to suck it up and do it. It's painful but there's relief at the end.",
    "Not a bad lab at all. The weekly lab summaries were definitely manageable, and didn't take too much time. Also, pre-lab preparation didn't take up too much time. Overall, if you need to take this lab, it will not be horrible.",
    "This is the worst lab by far that I have taken at Yale. The labs aren't even conducted in conjunction with the lectures and they test you on little details about circuits that will never be applicable in your life later. The medical applications they do at the end of labs are pretty cool, but they stopped doing them halfway through the semester. Expect to be in this lab for all three hours, it will suck.",
    "You're probably taking it as a prerequisite. You're probably going to hate it. It's annoying, time consuming, and protocols can get really confusing. Get a good TA and make sure you have friends in your section.",
    "Harder than the first semester lab because of weird grading standards and just more complicated labs overall. Prepare to be graded as \"average\" for the lab reports even though you meet all the expectations that the lab handouts state. Lab practical was difficult--no real way to prepare for it.",
    "No, way too much work for half credit. Take it if you have to.",
    "A painful (unless you have a good TF) experience necessary to get into med school.",
    "Overall, this lab is fine. But the practical is cruel and unusual punishment.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This class does not teach you anything about physics and is useless even if you are premed.",
    "only if you have to. maybe learn the material ahead of time, like the year before in 151 or 181.",
    "please, PLEASE take 206L instead. you do much cooler experiments AND there's no lab final, trust me, lab finals are horrible as you probably already know. I took 205L and thought it was the most horrendous thing ever so I switched to 166L thinking it might be better. turns out, i picked the worst two combos i could have with physics labs. don't do it. just don't. one thing is though, the lab reports for this class are pretty easy so no worries about those, i could get them done in maybe 2-3 hours time.",
    "If you like physics, go for it. If you need it to fulfill a pre-med requirement, guess you'll have to bear through it like the rest of us.",
    "Lots of circuits, some other stuff. Not worth taking if you don't need it for something.",
    "You're taking this class because you are either premed and\/or a masochist. If there's any way you could avoid taking this class, do so. Otherwise, you're stuck. It's going to suck. Understand that it will make you miserable.",
    "Not unless you have to, it is time consuming and the final is no walk in the park...the concepts can be kind of difficult to grasp due to problems in the presentation of the directions...",
    "Only if you have to take it or love physics",
    "Physics 166 is hard in that the weeks of lab do not line up completely well with the concepts taught in class (will need to do a lab before learning the chapter in class). This semester is much harder than last semester, in my opinion, because it deals with concepts that many of us haven't worked with before. The TAs and professors are helpful and supportive, helping us to get through the class. Overall, the experience had its benefits-applying concepts in lab, but was generally unenjoyable. Most likely if you're taking this class, it's a requirement, so you'll get through it. It could be worse.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if it is a requirement. If you are really interested in physics, take a more complicated physics lab. This is a good overview but not terribly captivating.",
    "Take this course if you have to. Not so bad, but not a lot of fun either.",
    "I would not recommend this course at all. Not very enlightening. The demonstrations were cool, but they sort of died out by the end. Some labs took forever and the grading was unnecessarily harsh.",
    "This is a fine choice for a lab to accompany an intro physics course. Expect to devote a few hours to the lab outside of class, but the workload is not generally too onerous.",
    "Straightforward, user-friendly lab course. Weekly quizzes, weekly 1-page lab reports. The least labor-intensive lab I've taken at Yale. If your TA isn't stellar, the instructors are always walking around and are infinitely helpful. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Horrible class. I needed it for pre-med requirements though... dont take it, too much busywork, no good experiment.",
    "It was terrible. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I thought the material covered the basic concepts of physics fairly well. However, I thought the way it was done was very unfair to the students from 151. We covered the material in lab way before we did in the course, and most of the time the labs handouts did not explain the material very well. We would spend hours on each lab report just trying to figure out what was going on so that we could answer the questions. Also, by making the average grade an 85, that meant that we would spend hours to get a simple 85 because we could barely understand the lab, whereas those that had already covered the material could answer the questions quickly and spend their time doing the extra material to get a higher grade. There was also a large discrepancy between the TAs where some often gave 95s, and some never gave above an 90. It made lab very frustrating and more focused on grades than just learning. Last semester seemed much more like learning than the grades. They also said that the students' grade was basically just based on the lab final - which is only supposed to be 30% of the grade and is only on one day.",
    "It's one of labs you have to take, I guess. Some handouts are poorly written and since you haven't learned the material inh lecture yet either, you get confused. Ask your TA to explain things that are unclear before you start if he\/she does not already.",
    "Take this only if you have to.",
    "I felt like I didn't learn very much and was frequently tested on information I was unfamiliar with. The lab notes often weren't sufficient to understand what was going on and there wasn't time to ask for clarification before the quizzes. I found the labs very tedious and time consuming without being particularly enlightening. Make sure you take it with a friend it's much more enjoyable if you're going through it together.",
    "It's a good physics lab - DEFINITELY harder than Phys 165 L in terms of material and grading. If you're looking for a lab to do as a non-science major, do 165.",
    "if you have to",
    "Yes, not a bad course. I liked that they tried to show medical applications because the course is mostly pre-meds. I thought it followed the 181 material well, can't speak for 151.",
    "You do a lot of experiments with circuits, oscilloscopes, and then random physics concepts (radioactivity, spectometry, and diffraction). It's not too much work outside of lab if you write down a lot during the actual lab. A lot of times, I didn't write down much and would get stuck writing a lot down outside of lab, which took forever. The addendum are simple enough. A lot of the lab manuals are a little vague, so make sure you read carefully and ask questions. If you're taking this class, you probably have to, so just gut it through. The practical this year was a BEAST, so also keep your eye our for that. Another thing was that I took Physics during the summer, so i was really rusty on 2nd semester physics topics (not gone over well in the summer), anyone in this position might want to consider doing it all at once over the summer if they can.",
    "Only take it if you have to... which you do if you're pre-med. Not fun, but you do learn some physics along the way.",
    "No... would not recommend this class unless it is totally necessary because there's a lot of pointless busywork. Since most of the labs did not work out well, it made concepts that we learned in class more unclear. Because the lab also doesn't correlate with the class, you basically just have to know concepts. I learned nothing from this lab and it made me more confused about a few things that I was sure I understood. Get a good TA because a bad one makes the lab all the more painful and boring.",
    "This is an awful course. The final is notoriously terrible. But there's no reason to read reviews, because you have to take it.If you want to take this course for fun, don't. There is no fun. Only pain and suffering. Run away, FAR AWAY",
    "I would only take this course if it is necessary for a requirement. It is definitely manageable, but lab will most likely be the worst part of your week. Some TFs are better than others, and it definitely makes a big difference. Lab is often a frustrating time.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "It incorporates pretty difficult physics concepts but it is doable.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class for fun",
    "Difficult course, only take if necessary for pre-med requirements, but you do learn the tangible side to physics. Easy if you understand physics beyond the quantitative measures.",
    "The second semester physics lab is slightly better than the fist, since the experiments are more interesting, and there are less tedious repetitive calculations. But it's still too much work for half a credit, just like all other lab courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the introductory physics and its applications.",
    "Probably not really, but if you're taking it, you probably don't have much of a say in the matter. It was moderately fun to do hands-on physics and to observe the circuits and magnets and other instruments in action, but the experimental manuals were often so poorly written\/proofread that the actual procedures and conceptual explanations were obfuscated. The experiments took a long time, the quiz questions were often very arbitrary, the class is graded peculiarly, and the practical is something awful--draining and nerve-wracking, with no reasonable way to really prepare for itoffered by the course instructors. I suppose you pick up a little more experimental and problem-solving skill in the process of doing everything, but a lot of it is really tedious.",
    "If you have to take this - it's not so bad. Study hard for the quizzes, they were pretty hard. Also, study circuit setup for the practical, and pretty much everything else. It's a challenge.",
    "Take only if you need the credit.",
    "take it only if you must.",
    "Unless you're premed or a physics\/science major and you have to take this, you probably wont. Your TA and lab partner have a huge effect on the experience. Alex Cerjan is by far the best TA. Lab reports aren't too bad and the bi-weekly quizzes are easy if you've read the lab. The practical isn't easy, but they grade generously.",
    "Only take this lab if it is absolutely necessary. You often leave feeling like you had just wasted three hours of your life. It is nice that you only have to write a one page addendum each week, though the final practical is almost impossible. My advice is to just get through it.",
    "Physics 166 is a hard course if you're enrolled in the regular physics stream. The class kept pace with the 200 level course, which is technically supposed to meet up with the 205L course, not this one -- so for those of you in 150\/80, reading the lab handouts ahead of time is crucial. As for the class itself, if you go into the class with some understanding, it can really help understanding the concepts in class, which in my experience wasn't the case with chem and physics labs.",
    "The quizzes were easier than in 165. Spent less time in lab and about the same outside of lab writing up the one-page summaries, finishing calculations. Apparently the class didn't follow Physics 151. However, I took Physics 201 and the lab basically followed our lectures exactly so it was an excellent way to reinforce the concepts without all the math.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Lab course - take it if you have to and don't want the long lab reports\/repetitive experiments of 201L."
