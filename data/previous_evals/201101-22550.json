   "comments": [
    "Great class, Neuman is awesome, the texts are spectacular and you won't read them like this in anyo ther class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in primary source research and really delving into something surprising\/interesting\/unexpected -- this is a class in which you can write that term paper that really excites you, and hopefully excites others around you. The topic seems very specific, but the variety of texts included in the syllabus makes it an interesting class regardless.",
    "Best class I've had at Yale. Neuman is a god. Will change the way you think about literature and the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to examine literature outside of the stuffy, decontextualized manner in which it's normally analyzed.",
    "Find the nexus of literary and political narratives across awesome texts. Definitely worth taking for all majors, if you have the guts for it.",
    "When I read the syllabus for this course, I was both intrigued and pessimistic. It combined a healthy dose of interdisciplinary learning with a broader look at our petrol-based global culture and an emphasis on literary works at its foundation. Prof. Neuman is easily one of the most brilliant professors I've ever had, and if anyone was capable of bringing together such seemingly disparate works and ideas, it's him. He'll be on leave crafting the next great petrol work of our time, but if you get the chance to take something like this with him, you should. It brought together one of the smartest cohorts of students I've ever seen in a class at Yale, and it really opened my eyes to the power of interdisciplinary inquiry (as an EP&E) major.",
    "If you're at all interested in global affairs and\/or literature, this is definitely the class to take. It's a book a week (roughly) with secondary sources. The final paper is a lot of work, but a lot of it is guided by the abstract and summary you write before-hand. But the discussion and texts are amazing, and it's absolutely worth it!",
    "Absolutely. Fantastic interdisciplinary look at a wonderful reading list. The methodology I learned here will certainly prove fruitful long into the future. Great professor.",
    "A wide-ranging course on the reflections of globalization in literature. Recommended if you have an interest in English.",
    "Yes, possibly the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Worth every minute of secondary reading. Professor Neuman is hilarious, engaging, enthusiastic about the subject matter and adventurous in his teaching strategies. The books are by and large a pleasure to read: most of them are unusual and not very difficult. One of the big points of the class is to fuse literary hermeneutics with social, historical, political, economic approaches etc., which pays off really well in class discussions--students are intended to have a range of backgrounds, and as a result the conversations are lively and unexpected. It's really a fantastic course--I'd take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "Despite its name, Global Fictions and Social Systems had a dual focus: on globalization as portrayed and embodied in literary sources, and narratives and cultural phenomena associated with the international oil industry. Both areas of inquiry were absolutely fascinating, and Prof. Neuman is a brilliant and dynamic seminar leader. The range of material, as well as the range of methods used in analyzing it, could be disorienting at times. But if you are willing to bring one disciplinary approach to bear on the materials of another discipline and you are interested in the interplay between narrative, energy, and geopolitics, I strongly recommend the class."
