   "comments": [
    "Don't let one lukewarm review of one professor steer you away from DS! Taking DS was the best decision I made my freshman year, and despite the iffy days in philosophy, I'm still so glad I did it.",
    "Yes it is a great way to start thinking and learning \"philosophically.\"",
    "Professor March is intimidating, but he knows his stuff really well. He makes the texts come to life and helped make understanding more complete. If you get him as your professor you're lucky!",
    "Definitely choose it!",
    "Depends. I enjoyed it, but the reading was very very fast and more for facts than enjoyment. If you want to appreciate philosophy in depth, this might not be the class for you. There's a lot of reading. But if you're taking DS you probably already knew that.",
    "Directed Studies philosophy is an intense survey course of philosophy. I would recommend it if you are looking for breadth of knowledge in early philosophical writings. The lectures are almost always helpful, but the section meetings are very dependent on the individual professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I would describe it as a fast paced class, not only because of the number of philosophers we cover but also because our conversations were fast paced and interesting.",
    "Do the reading. Come into class expecting to discuss the big ideas as well as your concerns with the text. Expect to move quickly. March has a sense of urgency in his style that demands your focus and participation. I would recommend the class to another student. March ensures you understand the most important topics\/arguments from the philosophical texts you read and does so with a style and energy that is compelling and exciting. If you have a problem with the idea of the \"Western Canon\"or the \"West\" or you seem to think that these texts are made irrelevant by their being written by \"dead white men\" then you should take this course. Taking the course will either change your mind or affirm your beliefs, but don't make a judgement until after you've taken the course. I think you'll emerge with an appreciation of the value of these texts as well as an understanding that the cultures and authors that contributed to the \"Western Canon\" were quite diverse. These aren't just the ramblings of \"dead white men.\" These texts all attempt to understand reality and our position in it. Please do not disregard DS Philosophy. It's actually really dope.",
    "Plato to Alfarabi with a pit stop in The Garden. I would recommend this class.",
    "As someone who had never studied philosophy formally before, I was most apprehensive going into DS Philosphy. Some of that was justified - discussion and analysis of philosophy, and the philosophy essay style, took a while to adjust to. However, it's also an extremely interesting and engaging class and definitely a great part of the DS program. Professor March is extremely energetic, funny, and encouraging - and extremely knowledgable about a wide range of subjects within philosophy. Overall, definitely recommend, despite the difficulty of some of the texts you read.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "Very intense class that can be a little tough to work through, but definitely worth it"
