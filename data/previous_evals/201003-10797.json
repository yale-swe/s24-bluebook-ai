   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to another student. I think I learned a lot from the course, and will be able to integrate many of the concepts into my own work.",
    "Perfect for new graduate students who would like a more in depth look at fundamental principles in cell biology or graduate students who are very interested in cell biology and would like a course to remind them of some of the things they learned as undergrads.",
    "It's a lot of information all at once. I would recommend it to those who have taken a cell biology class during undergrad.",
    "I would summarize the course as a broad overview of important cell bio topics - very similar to a seminar course.I would most likely recommend this course to someone who wants to learn about cell bio topics in more detail, but who has had some prior classes on\/experience with relevant experiments since they are not covered and yet are tested on for the midterm.",
    "602 provides a good overview of cell biology but will not necessarily thoroughly deepen a student's understanding of terminology. I would recommend it, but more so because it is required for the track.",
    "yes, I would surely recommend this course to other people. It is very helpful.",
    "I will recommend this course to fellow students because it is really good chance to learn overall concepts of cell biology and to summarize basic concepts what we learned in undergraduate school.",
    "It depends on a person's background in cell and molecular biology in undergrad. If it's strong, I'm not sure if it's a particularly helpful course. However, cell seminar 603 is excellent and they make a good combination when paired together.",
    "I will recommend the course."

    "It helps you see the big picture, and where biophysics and biochemistry have been really useful in discovery the big picture results.",
    "Not really. I felt like I did not retain any information. I would like to say that it did serve as a good refresher on what I learned in Cell bio in my undergrad.",
