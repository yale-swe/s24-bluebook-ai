    "Definitely helped me understand underlying concepts very significant to my interests in nutrition and medicine. I could have done without all the evolutionary assumptions, given that's only one narrative of creation that I don't agree with, nor do I think actually attests to the beautify and intricacy that biochemistry reveals. But alas, it takes eyes to see that. Certainly encouraged me to continue learning more about biochemistry."
