    "Kind of a hodge-podge of various topics by different lecturers. Presentation and facilitation styles between faculty differs a lot. Some class sessions are great and others are a bit boring.",
    "I would recommend it in the sense that you get as much out of it as you put the effort in for this class, and it provides the opportunity to self explore new areas you might not be familiar with. But then, I don't think it is a class where your are learning much from the actual instructors.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It serves to broaden the students knowledge past what is learned in the introductory course."
