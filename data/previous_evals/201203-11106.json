I do think about some of these pathways on a daily basis, but knowing something about the others helps give me perspective on new things to think about. I don't think this course will contribute a whole ton to my research, but it might contribute to the papers I choose to read or my understanding of them, which is certainly useful.",
    "It great enhances my background in cell signaling, as well as bring together important insights from great experts in their fields."
