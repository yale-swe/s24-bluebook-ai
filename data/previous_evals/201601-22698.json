    "I would recommend this class mainly to divinity school students. The course complimented Hebrew Bible courses.",
    "Introduction to Judaism in the Ancient World is an examination of the historical and literary framework of the Israelite religion from the biblical traditions through into the rabbinic period. I would recommend it to a student looking to study anything in the area of Scripture. Historical and literary framework is essential to biblical studies (though I may be a bit 'old school' in my thinking there).",
    "If one was interested in the content, yes. I found the class an interesting and helpful intro to judaism in antiquity."

    "I have a greater understanding of the relationship between early Christianity and Ancient Judaism. I also have more of a context for the rise of early Christianity and for how Judaism developed in the first millennium CE",
    "This course was more of a foundation course than anything. It likely will not directly contribute to any research I will be doing in the future, but has been crucial to my understanding of the time period and religion as a whole.",
    "It did so because it taught what the class intended to teach."
