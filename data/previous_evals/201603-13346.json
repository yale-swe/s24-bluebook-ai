    "While I found the content of this course fascinating and very relevant to my degree, I did not think that class time was particularly well managed. In weeks where we had presentations there was a real imbalance in how much time was spent on each presentation (especially discussion) and we often ran over. Weeks without presentations often felt like inefficient classes and class exercises. The lectures did not seem very focused or useful. That said, Professor Wargo was pretty responsive to student comments and swapped out the third round of group presentations for individual presentations on our research projects.",
    "Really enjoyed the content of the course. I was looking for something that talked a little about a lot. John is a great professor and moreso, an admirable advocate. Although the course covered a lot of ground, the heavy focus was on the problem, and less the solutions. Perhaps that's intentional and up to the students to consider, but I would have loved to hear more from others about how they managed these complex challenges, how the professor did, or what the literature says, aside from a thorough analysis of all the externalities. I liked the format of allowing time for student presentations at the end of the course. The 3 hour class is long. Nice when it could be split between lecture and presentation, but still feel like it was difficult to hold intensity for that period. Classroom setup seems like it would be better as a seminar\/circle. Would recommend it to others. Diversity of the student body was great.",
    "My only complaint was that our discussions sometimes felt disjointed. We would get rolling on a topic and then the professor or a classmate would pose a new topic and we would drop the original query. If the discussions were slightly more facilitated, this perhaps could have led to some deeper discussion of specific issues. Perhaps even a formalized debate would have been interesting.",
    "This class broadened my horizons and gave me a new appreciation for the importance of regulatory affairs and consumer understanding of food issues.",
    "John was a fabulous source of knowledge and an extremely supportive teacher. At times, the class material felt like it was repeating itself and I wish we had explored more responses to problems related to pesticides\/plastics\/nuclear residues outside of the student presentations. However, I got a lot out of the student presentations overall and felt impressed by the work of all my classmates.",
    "John was a very kind and dedicated professor. By far the most engaged of all my professors this semester. I appreciate how much freedom he gave us with the group projects and final research paper."

   "comments": [
    "We talked about a lot of topics--learned a lot in one semester!",
    "I found the backgrounds and insights of my classmates very useful and enjoyed hearing about their work. I appreciated the case study structure of the class (first week on a topic was more of a lecture and the second week was group presentations).",
    "The lectures were fabulous; I wish there had been more of them.",
    "The students were on fire! Fascinating perspectives and interests-- I wish we had been set up more as a round room\/discussion style class then a classroom.",
    "Student presentations are amazing!! The course format is great for eliciting students engagement in learning the topics.",
    "Professor Wargo was a really impressive source of information and was highly supportive.",
    "Although it was a lot of work, I appreciated the structure of the course. John's lectures were very interesting and I learnt a lot. But I was also surprised at how I learnt just as much from my peers. So giving the students a platform to share their knowledge and experiences was doubly beneficial to the overall outcome of the course. I came into the class with a fairly strong background in food issues, and yet I continued to learn a lot throughout.",
    "John is a phenomenal instructor. He fostered a great environment for open discussion, challenged us, and demonstrated great care for us as students.",
    "Lectures on contamination and adulteration. The times we focused on global issues rather than just U.S. policy or regulation."

   "comments": [
    "This class is a lot of work for 3 credits. Presentations take a long time to plan and our papers were a large commitment.",
    "Better management of class time and more engaging lectures\/better discussion leadership in the non-presentation weeks.",
    "The trouble with presentations around the same thing is that they felt repetitive. Different topics\/themes for each group would have covered more ground in terms of knowledge sharing.",
    "The ratio of lecture to discussion-- should have leaned more to discussion.",
    "Some of the class sessions really stretched on way too long. It didn't help that the class was post lunch.",
    "I do wish there was a bit more structure with regards to holding teams accountable for the length of presentations. It felt unfair to students who had spent just as much time preparing their work to rush to finish at the end or stay after class to finish and not have the rest of the class present to listen.",
    "The lectures are not really lectures, and rely too much on asking students questions that we don't have the answers to, or have very limited answers.",
    "I believe this class could be even better with further emphasis on discussing the socioeconomic disparities that present challenges for individuals to be active in controlling their environmental exposures. The discussion in the course was largely privileged and left out many populations that do not have the financial and social capital to influence structural change to protect themselves and their families. I also would have liked to see more case studies highlighting specific issues throughout the semester, with an increased focus on individuals. Finally, we did not receive very specific feedback (both numeric and written) throughout the semester and this made it challenging for me to maintain an idea of my progress.",
    "More discussion.",
    "Professor Wargo's lectures were interesting and informative. I would recommend that instead of pure class discussion on some topics; it would be more conducive to dedicate half the time on a lecture from Professor Wargo, and the other half with discussions on class readings. I found that in some classes, focusing purely on student discussions did not allow us to explore the topic in depth. Also, it would be great to incorporate global perspectives in this course. There seems to be a prioritization of legal and \"business\" perspectives in the class - it would have been interesting to see some topics explored from a ethical, historical, philosophical and\/or anthropological perspectives. Aside from the first few classes (which were taught via lectures by Professor Wargo), we mostly ended up discussing problems devoid of much historical and global context, and I think this is a hindrance to truly understanding and working towards resolving the issues facing our food systems. I believe that Professor Wargo can bring in this perspective through his lectures (and he did so in the beginning), but it got lost half-way through the class."
