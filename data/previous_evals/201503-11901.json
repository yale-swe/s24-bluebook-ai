   "comments": [
    "A great summary course of the major histories and tragedies, good for students who love Shakespeare and for those who have never really read him before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I took it because I wanted to read more Shakespeare before I graduated, and it ended up being a lot more enjoyable than I expected. It was interesting and the papers were fun to write.",
    "Yes, definitely. Good for English majors, but also people who want to try something totally new and just want samples of lots of works",
    "An awesome class on the histories and tragedies of Shakespeare. You will learn so much about Shakespeare's writing and the history of the Elizabethan Era. Take it!",
    "A really insightful, solid, and fun introduction to some of the greatest works in English. The structure is simple--a play a week, repeat. Professor Walsh does a really good job of raising new concepts and connecting previous ones in an accessible, humorous, down-to-earth manner. I always enjoyed going to lecture and hearing his take on the week's play. While sometimes the lectures could have used some tightening-up, overall the assignments were fair and the work was manageable (two short papers, a final, a performance review, and reading the best of the best of Shakespeare). Very accessible to non-majors.",
    "English 201 is definitely one of the courses you should take while at Yale, English major or not.",
    "A good survey of the histories and tragedies. Lectures are medium interesting. Papers are relatively quick and painless. I had a great TF, so section was a positive experience. Reading requires a little diligence but isn't overwhelming--about one play per week. Take it if you want to read a lot of Shakespeare (you probably do, or at least will be happy you did) and especially if you need a pre-1800 for the major.",
    "English 201 is great! Fun lectures, only a couple of essays and a final plus mild participation assignments for section. Grading is very forgiving, and Prof Walsh is fantastic (though I think the teacher for this course changes every year?). Take it as an English major or for a distributional requirement.",
    "Yes!! I was reluctant to take a lecture course in the English department, but Walsh is a gem, and his lectures on Shakespeare's histories and tragedies should not be missed.",
    "Yes! Thought-provoking lectures and a formidable reading list. But bear in mind that while reading a play each week might initially look like a manageable workload, it actually takes a lot of time (that is, if you want to do justice to the plays).",
    "English 201 is a decent amount of work because you're reading a Shakespeare play a week, which can be a lot to take in, but its a good way to learn more about Shakespeare and his writing style and how each of the plays relate to each other.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Take it paired with comedies and romances to get a good sense of Shakespeare.",
    "English 201 is a great course for those who love Shakespeare--and even those who don't will likely find they have developed a much greater appreciation for the Bard before the end of the semester. It's the course to force you to read all those plays that you always said you wanted to read one day, but probably wouldn't get around to. The course focuses only on Shakespeare's history and tragedy plays, as its title suggests, and this is both a benefit and a drawback. The benefit is that one is better able to discern the subtle similarities in structure or another element within the plays; the drawback is that there is also the threat of feeling a somewhat repetitive nature to the course. The quick pacing--one play a week--leaves little room to fully digest or delve too deeply into the plays. And yet Walsh's clear, witty lectures, combined with strong sections, often offer more profound exploration of each play than one might expect. I would overall recommend English 201 to another student with the caveat that it is very important--not merely from an academic performance standpoint--to complete the reading of the play before each week's set of lectures. It is impossible to fully enjoy and reap benefits from the course without actively appreciating what Professor Walsh presents each week, and Shakespeare absorbed through a lecture before the actual text of the play itself just diminishes the profound effect the writing can have on its audiences.",
    "Yes, definitely. Great, straightforward introduction to Shakespeare. Good even for non-English majors.",
    "ENGL 201 is a survey of Shakespeare's history and tragedy plays that focuses on literary analysis of the plays as well as contextual details about Shakespeare's life and the historical contexts of the plays. Lectures provide background, analysis and questions about and generated by the plays, and discussion sections focus on further exploring those questions. Grading is determined by section participation, three written assignments and a final. The workload demands a substantial volume of reading, but the assignments are fair and manageable. I would recommend this course to any student who likes English or Shakespeare. Shakespeare is entertaining and important for any foundation in literature, and this course is accessible to people with any academic background. Professor Walsh is wonderful, and taking his course is worthwhile for anybody.",
    "If you like Shakespeare at all, take this course!! As a comp sci major who had mostly only read the comedies, I learned a lot from this class. Brian Walsh is an **excellent** lecturer, and he had the class in stitches pretty often, as well. Also, if you can, try to get into Annie Killian's section - she's great at getting students to draw out deeper analysis of the texts, and very helpful and available for extra one-on-one time to discuss papers or just talk about the plays. (Plus she's really nice!) I took this class Cr\/D, but still did all of the reading, which I would recommend for anyone taking the class - hard to analyze Shakespeare's work without out having read it all. This was my favorite class this semester, and my favorite literature class at Yale, period. Seriously, take it if you can!",
    "If you're looking for an English lecture that's not hard but is really interesting, then take this class. Professor Walsh gives a smart, literary reading of Shakespeare, and he's approachable and friendly.",
    "Yes. I am not a non-humanities major and took the class for a humanities credit. It was a good class, lot of reading but not too much work, and I came away from it feeling like I had a solid grasp of about half of Shakespeare's cannon. It seems like one of those courses that you should really take at Yale.",
    "Walsh is so funny and begins every class with a joke\/story that he then relates back to the play. If you like Shakespeare, take it! The TAs each handle their sections very differently, though (e.g. some assign reading responses, some let you send in questions about your essay before the final), so make sure you get one you like.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course if you feel like you can read a play per week and actually, truly read them. It's a fantastic lecture course (with Professor Walsh, at least), but without reading it would be hard. The assignments (an early ungraded 2 page paper, two 5-7 page papers, a super easy 3-5 page review of a play or movie) are straightforward and graded by your TA, so choose Annie.",
    "Absolutely yes. Especially if Professor Walsh is teaching this course--he is a gem.",
    "If you've ever been interested in becoming more familiar with Shakespeare, I highly recommend that you take this class. Though you move quickly, by the end of the semester you will have become much less culturally ignorant with respect to his plays if you keep up. Professor Walsh is awesome: lecture will allow you to understand the plays in a much deeper way, but Professor Walsh will make you laugh and think hard while it happens. If you love Shakespeare and don't mind reading many of your favorite plays again, then you should also take this class. It's entertaining and might give you new insight to the material, and if nothing else it will give you an excuse to read something you really enjoy. Overall very interesting.",
    "Yes!! This class was amazing and really memorable in my academic career at Yale. The plays weren't too long and the lectures were really fun. Prof. Walsh is a really great lecturer. He was really funny, kind, and knowledgeable. He made Shakespeare enjoyable, interesting and relevant. I was always excited to come to class to hear his lectures, which were well thought-through, easy to follow and forged an interesting analysis. Scarlet Luk was an amazing TA, definitely take a section with her if you can!!",
    "I would summarize this as a survey course in a good number of Shakespeare's historical and tragic plays. You will get to read the \"masterpieces\" as well as some of the lesser-known plays. I would recommend ENGL 201 to another student who was really interested in literature or Shakespeare; other than that, it's way too much work. This is NOT a gut Hu credit. As an English major, I found this class really interesting at best and tolerable at worst.",
    "If you're looking for an overview of many of Shakespeare's most famous and interesting works, definitely take ENGL 201 with Brian Walsh. You'll read over a dozen works and by the end, will feel much more comfortable sitting through a work based on, reacting to, or re-imagining Shakespeare (which, let's be honest, is like 50% of things you'll see!) This is essential knowledge, and Brian does an incredible job making things accessible and exciting to students of all backgrounds--I personally had read very little Shakespeare prior to taking this class and am not an English major, and it was completely engaging and manageable. The coursework is light (one ungraded paper, 2 papers, a final, sometimes weekly responses but my section didn't have those--make sure you get a good TF--it makes a huge difference), and even if you don't finish all or most of the readings, you'll still get a huge amount out of the class. Brian's lectures are spectacular and are reason enough to take this.",
    "The texts in this course are pretty self-explanatory - if you like Shakespeare, you'll like reading them (even though you have to move through them very quickly, and you're definitely not gleaning as much value from them as they have to offer). While it would be great to spend more time with the plays, it's understandably impossible to do so in a survey course. The written assignments are very reasonable - a couple of average-length essays and a performance review. Prof Walsh is so nice and well-meaning, but his lectures can be pretty hit or miss. Try really hard for a strong TF if you want to get the most out of the course.",
    "Brian Walsh is a lot of fun as a lecturer, and I thoroughly enjoyed going to class. His takes on Shakespeare's tragedies and histories were fascinating: he both examined each play in its own light, whilst also developing an understanding of different themes and characters that Shakespeare returns to multiple times. It is, unfortunately, a somewhat rushed journey through some very dense plays (Hamlet and Lear were particularly long for only two lectures and one section), but otherwise a fun course. The essays are graded fairly harshly, and the plays add up (especially if you don't read them on time!), but it isn't a horrible course, and I found it very enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely take this class with Brian Walsh. His lectures are engaging, compact, and often surprisingly funny. The hardest part of this class is actually reading the texts (well, and the essays, but there's only 3 of them, and they're pretty short), so if you're confident you can enjoy or at least tolerate reading Shakespeare this may be a class for you."
