    "If you have little exposure to ethnography and are interested in the topic, take it. But if you have a background in either the study of black communities or ethnographies, it could be repetitive and boring.",
    "If you would like to be introduced to ethnography or African American studies or even continue your education in it than this would be a great class. If you actually do the readings, you'll learn a ton from this course but class discussion is basically non existent. You and your classmates have to be prepared to make conversation happen or else Professor Anderson may just take over. This really is a good course and I'm very thankful I took it.",

    "Great class if you are interested in African American history and ethnography.",
