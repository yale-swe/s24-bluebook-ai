    "A great overview of Ancient Greek philosophy, with an emphasis on Plato and Aristotle. A must for everyone interested in philosophy.",
    "The course was a solid course. I learned a lot, both material wise and skill wise. The course was a bit dry and technical. But I'm not sure how that could be improved. If you love philosophy, take this course because it will definitely improve your analytical skills. Ancient philosophy is very dry though.",
    "Philosophy 125 is fantastic. Probably my favorite class this semester. Verity Harte is brilliant; her lectures are full of great insights and witty humor. And she has a British accent. You can't go wrong.The workload for this class is nowhere near as much as I thought it'd be. The reading is a little dense sometimes, but it's never too much, and Professor Harte does a great job explaining what it all means. Make sure you read before lecture so you can follow what she's saying. Also, you only have four assignments, and the longest one only has to be between 4 and 6 pages.Because this is an intro class, the material doesn't go into a lot of detail, but what you do cover is essential in building a solid background in ancient philosophy. The Plato sequence is especially strong, and the final survey of Stiocs, Skeptic, and Epicureans is great too, if not a little too brief for my liking. I'd recommend this class to anyone, and I'll definitely be taking more philosophy classes next semester.",
    "PHIL 125 is a good introduction to ancient philosophy (and by ancient I mean the Greeks, especially Plato and Aristotle). The class studies the evolution of western philosophical thought, starting from the Presocratics and ending in the Hellenistic Period. It focuses around two of the greatest philosophical works of Antiquity - Plato's \"Republic\" and Aristotle \"Nicomachean Ethics\". The lectures are good, but the discussion sections are awesome and imperative to getting the best out of this class. Although the workload is pretty chill (weekly readings of a few pages, 4 short assignments in total), the grading is harsh; in order to get a good grade you'll have to write your papers very carefully, with emphasis on clarity and accuracy. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in ancient philosophy or the history of western thought (after all, the Greek philosophers were the founders of western civilization). If you ever felt the need to understand, at least a bit, Aristotle's blocks of esoteric philosophical writing, then this is the class for you. If you are simply interested in philosophy (but not interested enough in order to major in it), then it might be better to take a different class that focuses on aspects of modern or recent philosophy. Most of the stuff covered in this class is indeed interesting and raises many questions, but it does feel quite outdated; a class in more modern philosophy may be more relevant to the present day, at least for people generally interested in philosophy.",
    "I have mixed feelings about Intro to Ancient Philosophy. Professor Harte was understanding in the acknowledgement that, for many of us, this was our first philosophy class and set us on a pathway on how to analyze and create philosophical papers based on the passages discussed. However, attendance was mandatory to her class, and the lectures were, on occasion, just not enticing enough to keep me completely focused throughout the class period.",
    "Overview of ancient philosophy, quite simply. Heavy focus on Plato and Aristotle. Yes, I would, if someone wants a background in either of these two thinkers.",
    "Philosophy provides an excellent, in depth look at multiple different ancient schools of thought. It is an excellent course and I would definitely recommend it. You learn not just how to write well, but also a lot about different thought processes that could change your life.",
    "I recommend it to philosophy majors, but for non-majors looking for an interesting course, there are better options.",
    "This is an excellent class. If you have any interest in Philosophy, or if you want to gauge your interest in Philosophy, take this class.",
    "yes def... you need to take a philosophy course some point at yale, and this is the one!",
    "They do not give A's in this class. Do not take it if you worry about your grade.",
    "Average for a philosophy class. Take it if you are interested in Plato and Aristotle, since that's what you study most of the time.",
    "This is a lovely class\u00e2\u0080\u0094Professor Harte has a darling English accent, and says \"jolly well!\" at least three times in every lecture. The readings are short and sweet, usually not more than a page or two at time, but Professor Harte is able to pull a lot of learning out of such short passages. Often puffed-up students who fancy themselves philosophers already can lead the discussion in section somewhat astray, but a good and vigorous T.F. can put things back on track. In view of that, lecture is probably more useful than section (although the sections, thankfully, never stray far from what was actually covered in lecture). It's a great class if you have any interest in philosophy (and really, everyone should), but try to get in a section with friends if you can so you'll actually enjoy discussion.",
    "This is a great introductory course for philosophy. As a freshman, I had never taken philosophy before and starting with this was a wonderful decision. The class is engaging and interesting and has inspired me to continue with philosophy.",
    "Do it whether you want to major in philosophy or not. The readings are interesting and fun and the teacher is very good at what she does.",
    "The class was very well designed and expertly delivered! I loved Professor Harte's lectures and enjoyed going to class. Having a section to complement the lectures worked out quite well, and the reading load was reasonable throughout. Take the assignments seriously from the beginning, and even for the earliest ones, I would recommend going for extra consultations before it's due. Professor Harte outlines grade guidelines that are much stricter than usual Yale standards, and getting a B on an assignment can be quite the achievement.",
    "I would recommend Phil 125 to another student, because its material is very good to know, as old as it is. The course runs through works of ancient philosophers, with a stronger focus on Plato and Aristotle. The course seems to build toward the theme of what makes \"the best life.\"",
    "I found the class to be really interesting, but to anyone who considers taking it, if you want to succeed, go to your TF early and try and gain a good understanding of how to correctly write a philosophy paper, and practice identifying conclusions as you read the assigned passages",
    "The bulk of the course focuses on Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, but attention is also given to their other works. It is bookended by the pre-Socratics and the Hellenistic philosophers. The workload is not bad at all, and it nicely eases students into writing philosophy papers. I actually wish that we had had more reading and writing assigned. I would definitely recommend it, especially since this course is required for philosophy majors if you haven't done DS, but I also suggest reading beyond the required passages to get a better sense of the works as a whole.",
    "It was a great class. The work is very manageable. The sections are pretty chill. It gives you a pretty good understanding of Plato, Aristotle and various other schools of philosophical thought. Professor Harte is super nice and a great lecturer. I highly recommend it.",
    "If you have an interest in Philosophy and are a good essay writer, this is a solid course for you.",
    "Yes",
    "Philosophy majors - you need it for the major, so nothing to discussNon-phil majors - Listen. There's NO TEST for this class. Its JUST papers. and the grading is NOT FAIR and Relatively Random. Even if you're very good at philosophy, the TA can give you a B- because he decided that one of your verbs was vague.There is a HUGE disconnect in this course between what is TAUGHT and what you are GRADED ON.Taught: You are taught some major ideas in ancient philosophy, and Prof Harte's solution to some major problems and central issues in these works.Graded on: Your ability to produce a philosophy paper EXACTLY in the way that Prof Harte\/the TAs like it. Don't get me wrong - it's a fantastic way to learn how to write good papers. Yes, they give you a nifty four page description of what thispaper should look like, but until you get your first paper back with all the angry scribbles you really have no idea what that means. This is NOT a course where if you try your hardest and you're brilliant you will get an A. If that bothers you, don't take it.Prof Harte - if you're going to grade students based on the papers they produce, please give more guidance on how to write them. Coach Harrington gave us a paper describing what a push-up is, then asked us to get down an give him 5. We all sucked at doing pushups in the correct form, because without practice and correction from others we didn't know what we were doing - even though he gave us a nice write-up of what he was looking for.It's good that prof harte allows you to redo one of your papers. However, this is NOT enough to justify the toughness of her grading. Either (a) she should give students MORE practice in writing before their grades count (ex let them rewrite both papers) or (b) the grading should be more lenient.",
    "If you are interested in Plato and Aristotle, I would definitely recommend this course. The material is interesting, and it's not too much work. The lack of final exam does a lot to lower the stress level about remembering everything. Instead, you can focus on what you want to for papers and then just enjoy learning the material instead of worrying about it. Professor Hart is also interesting and I think as clear as you can be with some of the complicated ideas of some of the philosophers.",
    "This course is perfectly fine for those interested in Ancient Philosophy. However, unlike most courses at Yale where participation is graded, this course takes it seriously and attendance is taken at lectures and section, so if you're looking to just read and write, this is not the place to do it.",
    "It is a great introductory course that I would recommend to anyone who has even a small interest in philosophy. It is a good simple starting course. The class mainly involves reading philosophy for lectures and 4 writing assignments that are structured to build off of one another.",
    "If you're interested in philosophy, take this course! It's a requirement for the philosophy major, but worth it for non-majors too if you like the material. Verity is awesome and witty. She does a great job of clarifying the readings, and tying things together at the end of class. But it's worth it to do them, because her explanation will make a lot more sense. Four writing assignments, but you only get three grades \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she lets you re-do one of the assignments, and take the best of the two which is really helpful. The class covers several ancient philosophers, but focuses mainly on Plato and Aristotle (so if you've read a lot of them already you might not find it as interesting). Still, Verity's lectures are great, and it's useful stuff even if you don't end up majoring in philosophy.",
