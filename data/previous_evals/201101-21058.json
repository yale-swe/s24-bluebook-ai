    "I would recommend the course to an undergraduate but not a graduate student. The theories are a little too 'big picture' for the often nitty-gritty experience of grad students. It is difficult to hear that 8 easy steps will solve a public health problem when its clear that in the real world, it is rarely that simple.",
    "For someone with a lot of professional experience, I would not recommend it, but for someone who is interested in global health who is either an undergrad or grad student without much professional experience, I would definitely recommend it."
