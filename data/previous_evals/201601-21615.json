    "Definitely would learn a lot but time consuming.",
    "Be prepared for work - there's no curve and if you want a good grade, you better work for it. That's not to say it's not worth doing -it definitely is, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "LOTS OF WORK!! BEWARE!! Much more than 1st semester. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED... A fun class, however.",
    "I would recommend it as either a segue to higher level courses or for people needing the language credit. It's a small, but continuous amount of work, and there are daily vocab quizzes-- at the same time, a lot of the vocab is familiar, which helps some. And by the end of the semester, you really do become a better speaker and writer.",
    "Take this if you really want to learn the language. If you are coming in second semester, you may find the transition a bit rough because you won't be familiar with the expectations of the course, although you will learn quickly. Expect 1-2 hours of homework per night, between the and studying for the next day's"
