    "I learned how to use various printmaking techniques.",
    "I had never done printmaking before and this class opened up that world for me. I feel confident now using printmaking in my own work, citing artists who use printmaking in their work, and thinking in an inter-disciplinary way. Because all of the assignments were open in terms of content, it also helped me think about how I can transfer ideas i am interested in across various ways of image making. I loved this class!!",
    "This course placed an emphasis on developing hard skills, which I loved. I had never used etching or woodworking techniques, and only very minimal screenprinting techniques, so it was a steep but satisfying learning curve.",
    "This class was a wonderful way to develop an understanding and technical proficiency in many types of printmaking. I also felt like I grew as an artist through the consistency and freedom of the assignments as well as the final project. I find myself very drawn to printmaking as an art form, and appreciated having access to a class, lab, and expert help in the medium."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength was the set up- technical lessons followed by looking at artists followed by making work with our own content was great and led to wonderful final projects. It was very time intensive, but that didn't bother me.",
    "The sense of community from the small class size was wonderful. I really liked the range of techniques, but sometimes it felt very rushed. I think an improvement would involve changing around the scheduled assignments a little to give more time for practicing the skills rather than just observing, so that the weekends don't become marathons in the printshop.",
    "Really strong art course. Well structured and fulfilling. I felt that I gained a very good understanding of all of the mediums that we worked in. While we did spend time on the history of printmaking and contemporary artists, I would have enjoyed even more opportunities to talk about printmaking in the art historical context. I appreciated the opportunities for workdays, but wish the work could have been more spread out so as to spend fewer late weekend nights in the lab. I also would have liked more technical feedback as well as conceptual."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I took this class having no previous knowledge about printmaking and was very pleased with the various techniques and skills I picked up. We learned several ways to make prints from screen-printing, to copper plate etching, to woodcut printing. It was a lot of work and I usually had to dedicate an entire day each weekend to finish my assignment in the print shop but I found it to be a pretty rewarding course.",
    "Yes, if they were willing to invest a large amount of time in the class.",
    "I would recommend this class: it teaches you how to use the printshop (which you have access to beyond the class, and after finishing).",
    "Yes!!! This class was amazing if you are willing to invest a lot of time into it, you will get a lot in return. Particularly if you are an artist the skills you learn here are great for adding new elements to whatever work you are already making, no matter what the medium!",
    "Yes, for anyone who wants to try their hand at printmaking techniques, or who wants to refine what they already know.",
    "I would strongly recommend printmaking to other students, both art majors and non art majors. Printmaking is a very fulfilling form of art making, and the depths and breadth of processes that you learn in this class is wonderful. A great way to both broaden and deepen ones artistic practice. One of my favorite art courses that I have taken at Yale."
