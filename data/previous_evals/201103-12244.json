   "comments": [
    "If you're taking it, I'm gonna assume you have to. If not, then why else?",
    "I thought Theater 110 was fun and interesting. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in theater history in general and doesn't mind doing a lot of reading and memorizing.",
    "Theater history, very in depth and with a performance component at the end. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to in order to major in Theater Studies. It's not particularly interesting or difficult.",
    "Yes, I would, so long as a good TA and an interesting section topic are available to him.",
    "The primary reason to take this class is as a prerequisite for the performance classes within the Theater Studies department. Otherwise, another history\/literature course may prove more engaging. The course is interesting as often as it is dull, depending on the play being treated at the time. As well, because there is no text on the theater history, there are inevitably gaps in the historical understanding.",
    "A LOT of reading, but clarity in class and section",
    "Honestly, it's a lot of work. A final project that will require finding times that your whole group can meet up and rehears is difficult. The course also requires a final paper and a final exam. This many end of the term assignments are almost unheard of. The course will take a toll on you, so make sure you like reading plays and discussing them in a historical context. More importantly, if you are taking this first semester, make sure you enjoy reading plays like Tartuffe, and Everyman, and obscure stuff from the middle ages etc.",
    "Theatre 110 does a great overview of the influences that originated theatre, but does so through means that make it difficult to learn and enjoy the class at the same time. The classwork is potentially prohibitive to this who may only have a budding interest in theatre (a play for each class, supplementary readings, a group performance, a ten page paper, and two finals) and at times the readings are not engaging. This class teaches a lot, but it does take the theatre out of theatre.",
    "Unfortunately, you have to take this course to get into the higher level THST classes and acting classes. There is too much reading crammed into a short amount of time and never any opportunity to either delve into the material or see how it may have evolved over time. Also, be careful about who is your teaching fellow; freshman, I recommend shopping sections. It makes a big difference! You will survive and make it to sophomore acting classes eventually, I promise!",
    "I would recommend this class! It gave me a great introduction to Theater History!",
    "You'll do a lot of work and still feel like you know nothing when it comes to the tests.",
    "I would recommend Theater Studies 110! The class provided a great foundation for theater history, and I definitely learned a lot. We read some great plays and were exposed to works of different eras and cultures. If you\u0092re not very interested in the history of theater, you may not enjoy doing the readings and discussing and writing about them, and there is a significant amount of reading, but if you\u0092re genuinely interested in learning about theater history, it\u0092s a terrific course. Professor McGinley is really engaging, and her lectures are great! Also, the other students in the class were very cool people, and it was great to get to know other students also interested in theater. (We all got to know each other well in section, in putting together our studio performance project and in study groups for the final.)",
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy theater. The professor is good and the material is interesting. I truly enjoyed the class despite the gratuitous amounts of reading and work.",
    "Definitely! If you're thinking about majoring in Theatre Studies, it's a must (also, it's required...but that shouldn't be the only reason you take it).",
    "Only take this course if you are seriously considering becoming a Theater Studies major or you want to take more advanced courses in the Theater Studies department. It isn't nearly interesting enough to take otherwise.",
    "It's theater history. It's a prereq for the theater major. You won't regret taking it, but you've got to care and puteffort in for it to be interesting - otherwise it gets really boring, really fast.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I went into it having heard that it was just a boring prerequisite for other theater classes, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes. I found it really interesting learning the historical context of many different types of theater, and connecting themes throughout history. It's a great balance of broad ideas and very specific and interesting key terms. Professor McGinley's lectures were generally engaging, and if you can get Ryan as a TA he is FANTASTIC. There is a lot of reading, but the plays are all interesting and fairly entertaining to read. The performance aspect was also a lot of fun, and really brought the people in my section together. I finished the semester feeling very connected to my section and the whole class, as well as very knowledgeable about theater history and the historical climates of many plays and theatrical movements. The semester started slowly but turned out to be really fun.",
    "The course is a very general and comprehensive survey of theater from around the world. The course will expand your general knowledge of theater history.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in seeing theater through the lens of world history. I found this very satisfying and fascinating. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and knowledge at the end that is often missing from too-specific courses. I wasn't taking it for the major, and I still found it very worth, being interested in theater and theater theory, and generally in theater culture throughout the world.",
    "Take the course mostly because you get to meet the majority of theatre kids in your grade who will probably become your good friends. This is a huge reason. The class itself is interesting but not riveting .",
    "A very broad overview of theater history. The class is not always the most compelling, but it's important to take as a student of theater, and it's a great way as a freshman to meet the rest of the theater community.",
    "I would not recommend this course. While the information is very unique, class periods are tedious. The TAs also proved to confuse students as they rarely try to present unified information. For instance, their review sessions were detrimental and confusing. Unfortunately, this course is a prerequisite."
