   "comments": [
    "I developed a knowledge of Chinese history, and the critical components of China's rise today.",
    "Learned history and political science aspects of the rise of China. Developed critical thinking skills and was exposed to multiple points of view of the rise of China from scholars through readings.",
    "I gained a deep, deep knowledge of China's history and domestic\/international politics. I also improved argumentation skills + evaluating of arguments.",
    "I learned a lot about Chinese history, and how China's complex history has led to its current domestic and international political climate.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of China, its form of government and how that fits into the global sphere.",
    "Gained an overview understanding of China's political history, and some analytical handles on contemporary Chinese politics.",
    "This course is an overview of China's history, domestic politics, and international relations. It was very effective at giving students a high-level introduction to global challenges caused by China's rise, and gave me ideas on what to explore next when learning about China on my own time.",
    "Understanding of last 150 years of China's history, the historical context behind the communist regime.",
    "Learned a lot about history, domestic, and international relations of China.",
    "Take this course to get a great overview of Chinese history, followed by a slightly less engaging and interesting 'modern' section. You will learn an incredible amount in both parts of the course, and will definitely understand China (an important topic) and its interactions with the world more.",
    "Typical class on China",
    "A lot of history and knowledge of china",
    "I had never taken a political science class before, so I became familiar with the field and how political scientists do research and analysis and approach issues. I learned a lot about China, especially in comparison to the U.S.",
    "What I appreciated most about this course is that it wasn't US-centric like many other China courses here at Yale. Professor Mattingly was very conscious in pushing back against American stereotypes of China, and we didn't learn about China through the lens of what would benefit the United States. Half of the course is focused on a recap of Chinese history from literally the Xia dynasty (first) to Xi Jinping and the modern-day. I learned a lot of in-depth material about Chinese history that I didn't even know as someone who is Chinese, and found that really crucial to understanding Chinese policy in the present-day. I also learned a lot about the strategy of China moving forward, from Xi Jinping's intentions as a leader, to what the CCP's legitimacy rests on, to the Made in China 2025 plan.",
    "I learned how to handle reading various texts weekly, and being able to not only process new information, but also read faster. I learned how to examine more deeply author's arguments and find areas where author's arguments were strong or weak. I learned how to extend author's arguments and add my own perspective. In regards to China, there was so much I did not realize I just did not know. I learned about early Chinese history, to China's domestic politics, and China's unique position in international politics.",
    "Analyze trends in history",
    "I learned about the history of China, with the first half of the course focusing on the Qing Empire through the Mao Era into Xi Jinping's presidency. For the second half, I learned about the domestic politics and institutions of CCP's China and China's international politics, today, through the framework of contemporary debates on China's rise which speculate on whether it will be peaceful or include war. I'm very grateful that I learned enough to form my own opinion on China's rise as well as the strengths and weaknesses of various leaders and initiatives. This has sparked my interest in China, and how it'll continue to navigate domestic pressures in an international stage, as well as really interesting facts about protest in China and China's investment in Africa.",
    "This course was one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. China is a country that is often in the news and this class helped me understand the history of China and the domestic politics that the government is dealing with. I feel much more knowledgeable about China and can speak more on its relationship with the U.S.",
    "I got a better understanding of China's rise and political science research.",
    "a survey course of everything about China",
    "I learned about how important China is in our lives even though I was unaware of their power until this class. It was extremely enlightening because of how relevant China is in the US decision making.",
    "Amazing survey course about Chinese history, politics, and international affairs. Very insightful content and prepares students for real world conversations about contemporary Chinese affairs, US-Chinese relations, etc.",
    "The class provides a very well-rounded introduction to China's rise, with a thoughtful inclusion of Chinese history at the beginning of the class to ease everyone into modern Chinese politics. The lectures also follow either a chronological or thematic order which is conducive to students understanding the course materials. Professor Mattingly also places an emphasis on analyzing the research papers we read in class, which asked us to critically examine the conclusions we are given.",
    "By the end of the course, a view of where China is going on the global stage: its ambitions in terms of disrupting the western-led world order. Skill-wise, learned how to write response papers and critically analyze research.",
    "China's history and rise as a global economic and political power",
    "I was able to gain a solid foundation in Chinese history which will allow me to understand China today.",
    "I learned so much about China, how it became the power it is, and its relationship with America and many other nations.",
    "This course gave me a robust first introduction to recent Chinese history as well as the politics of the CCP. I feel much more confident talking about China from a foreign policy angle.",
    "The ability to comprehend and explain theories of a nations development. I did not know much about China before entering this course but now feel like I have a good grasp on its history.",
    "I learned how to read subtext and how to research thoroughly.",
    "In the beginning, we did a big sweep of Chinese history which I appreciated so we could better understand the rest of the course material. We then learned first the domestic and then international politics of China and covered a variety of topics from the environment and climate change to nationalism and the political system. This course teaches how to think critically about others' research and hypotheses and how to interpret the policy decisions of a country through a historical lens and while also taking into account the domestic politics of the country.",
    "Introductory course on Chinese Politics and IR",
    "I learned a lot about modern China from the Communist takeover onward, and a little bit about the history of China before that as context for China's later rise. These both helped me better understand China today. The course is taught from a strongly pro-China viewpoint, as the professor acknowledges, but of course he encourages students to form their own opinions based on the material and is not on a campaign to get you to think his way.",
    "This course provided an interesting overview of Chinese history and politics.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and domestic and international politics of China. We also covered some interesting political science concepts regarding revolution and autocracy.",
    "A deeper understanding of Chinese history and politics. By learning about the historical setting of China's rise, I now better understand China's behavior on the world stage.",
    "Comprehensive overview of modern China and the history that led to it.",
    "Learned about the history of China. First half of course focused on China's ancient history and second half focused on China's recent history both domestic and international topics.",
    "Got a great overview of Chinese history and a pretty solid general summary of China's current political system and ideologies",
    "Great intro to the politics and history of an important country.",
    "Political, social and economic history of modern China, key debates and issues regarding current Chinese politics and US-China relations.",
    "Learned a lot about current politics of China and a brief historical overview",
    "This class gives you the foundation to be a more knowledgeable and critical consumer of news about China. It provides a strong historical background that sheds light on contemporary Chinese politics. Highly recommend!",
    "This course provided a really large overview of Chinese history, philosophy and China's position in the world today",
    "We learned about China's deep and intricate history, before looking at domestic and international politics of the nation. This was useful, as I knew very little about China starting the course. This way every student was able to discuss China's current politics in an informed way.",
    "I went from essentially zero knowledge about China to having a level of understanding that would qualify me to deeply engage in most intellectual\/political debates regarding Chinese issues.",
    "Knowledge about China, relations between the US and China",
    "Learned the history of China from late Qing to present, got an overview of Chinese politics and society today, acquired the skills and knowledge to formulate informed views on China and its future."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A great course. Couldn't be better.",
    "Strengths- professor and TAs were really enthusiastic and informative, material was interesting. Weaknesses- sections were too crowded and it was hard to have meaningful conversation.",
    "No weaknesses. Fave course this semester.",
    "Strengths- extremely interesting content, accessible to everyone, lectures interesting, homework load not too heavy Weaknesses- I honestly loved this class so much... the only think I can think of is more personal engagement with the professor, i.e. inviting us for dinner to his house",
    "The lectures were engaging, but the readings were hit or miss.",
    "Loved lectures, and the assessment structure of the exams. Professor Mattingly was engaging and I always looked forward to class.",
    "The weekly readings and topics selected were relevant and useful for gaining a clear understanding of China's politics. Lectures can do much more if the videos were cut (took up around 15 mins every lecture) and the review\/summary portions were cut (took up around 10 mins). If necessary, videos can be added to the syllabus for students to watch on their own, or even during section.",
    "A great, balanced, and informative introduction to contemporary China and what the future holds for it and the United States.",
    "This course was well-organized, engaging, and covers a lot of material without being overwhelming. As long as you go to lecture, you will learn a lot no matter your level engagement with the readings. Readings served to extend what we discussed in lecture to practical examples and were all worth it. I don't know of any weaknesses besides when Prof. Mattingly started incorporating time for questions in his lectures. That is what sections are for, and the same person asked something every time. I would have rather just hear more lecture!",
    "Lectures usually try to fit too much into one lecture, causing us to rush and not give topics as much analysis as one would like. Interesting and relevant readings, great lectures.",
    "Couldnt be any better!",
    "Strengths: Very clearly outlined in terms of structure. The readings were interesting and well-chosen",
    "It wasn't the most exciting.",
    "Mattingly is great, but tries to fit a little too much into lecture sometimes. His slides are mostly pictures, which works in class but makes it hard to study later on if your notes have gaps. There was too much reading most of the weeks which was impossible to complete with other coursework. I liked that we wrote two response papers on differing weeks throughout - nice way to synthesize the material. I'm not a fan of take-home finals, so I would have preferred a normal final.",
    "Strengths: - Professor Mattingly is very conscious in pushing back against American stereotypes of China, and we didn't learn about China through the lens of what would benefit the United States. I wish more China classes at Yale were taught by him\/professors like him! - The focus on Chinese history really helps in understanding Chinese culture and modern-day China. - The lecture material is really concrete and fact-based, which left me with a lot of solid knowledge about China leaving the class. - Professor Mattingly is an engaging lecturer, and the readings were very interesting. Weaknesses: - The last couple of classes were taught by TAs and included a roundtable, but I think that may have been because Professor Mattingly had a family emergency -- I am unsure as to whether it was the original plan. Those classes were a lot less engaging. - I would appreciate more Chinese TFs who can speak to the country's situation on the ground\/their personal experiences.",
    "I love how engaging and insightful all the readings Professor Mattingly assigned were. Never once when I was completing a reading, I questioned why did Mattingly assign this. I really appreciated how the readings included various perspectives, for example, whether or not the Thucydides Trap exists. The readings truly provided me an opportunity to reflect and consider exactly what I think about China's rise and its influence on the globe stage. I also found the lectures to be very engaging and insightful. Sometimes Mattingly would use funny photos or engaging videos, and I think these efforts, along with clear lesson objectives and takeaways, kept me engaged. I found the TAs to be incredibly helpful during section, as well as giving feedback on response papers. I think from the very beginning, Professor Mattingly clearly outlined his expectations for the course, and because of that, I felt more confident in my ability to perform well and learn without the added stress of any confusion of expectations",
    "TFs were very helpful. Lectures could have been more interesting",
    "The review session for the midterm was a joke. Professor Mattingly wouldn't answer a single question on actual material. He would respond to any legitimate questions by saying he would not answer that question and asking if anyone had any questions on formatting. If you're going to have a review session and refuse to answer any meaningful questions beyond whether you should use blue or black ink on the bluebooks, just don't have one.",
    "I thought the course was great. Professor Mattingly began to take more questions from students towards the second half of the course which was a welcome change.",
    "I loved everything about this course. lectures were interesting and discussions were even better",
    "This is a great course.",
    "In this course, I learned about the important events in Chinese history and how China became the nation it is today. While also understanding the political, economical, and cultural aspects of the country and government. I became aware of how powerful China is and it gave me a better rounded understanding of global politics.",
    "Strengths- Prof Mattingly is the GOAT! Content could not be any organized and taught any better. Weaknesses- take home final was annoying",
    "The course material was very interesting and I enjoyed the flexibility that it offered. It was also great to learn about events that were currently happening",
    "This was a great course with a good balance of lecture, documentaries, discussion, and response papers.",
    "Its a super interesting topic and very relevant today. It has a variety of knowledgeable TFs, and Professor Mattingly is another reason to take the course. It was twice a week for 50 min which was ideal, so there was really no weakness to this great class.",
    "I felt that some of the studies assigned in the syllabus were superfluous. Despite being very long and sometimes difficult to understand, there were many readings that were neither discussed in lecture nor in section as they weren't especially pertinent to the key themes we covered in class.",
    "The professor was always looking to help its students even with such a large class.",
    "I think the class could be more interactive.",
    "Strengths: Professor Mattingly is a great professor and lecturer! The lectures were usually interesting and fun with many videos interspersed. The course expectations were very clear and the assignments were fairly given and graded. We covered a broad array of topics that were very interesting and i liked how I learned so many different things and aspects about China. Weaknesses: The expectations for the paper were a bit unclear in the beginning but I understood after the first one.",
    "Good review of Chinese history and looking at US-China relations. Strength is Prof. Mattingly's breadth of knowledge and the organizational structure of the course (the course is divided into 1. Chinese history, and 2. Chinese Domestic Politics and International Politics)",
    "The professor is a great lecturer, nice guy, and quite knowledgeable about China. He posts detailed slides in case you need to miss lecture, but I always went to lecture anyway because it was really interesting. The ratio of learning to work put in was very high, which is always good. As with most classes like this at Yale, section is a major weakness (super boring discussion of readings nobody possibly had the time to read), but that's a Yale-wide problem more than a TF problem.",
    "This was a very good course and I don't have many comments. The readings and lectures were engaging. I would have liked more direction on the response papers because it was difficult to pull a strong argument from some of the readings.",
    "Lectures and section were very informative and well-organized. I very much enjoyed the content and teaching. One area for improvement would be a more clear grading rubric for response papers. I felt the grading might have been somewhat arbitrary.",
    "Very informative. Loss narrative a bit at the end.",
    "Course was very broad and gave a very big picture overview.",
    "Strengths: this is the most well-organized course I have EVER taken at Yale. From the unit breakdown to the lecture themselves, this class was meticulously curated and the readings were STELLAR. Dan is such an amazing lecturer! He get's the material and makes it fun and interesting and doesn't read off of any notes or slides. He's legit. The TA's were also wonderful!! If you get the chance, go for Christina-- she breaks down the readings super well and her section always felt really inclusive. Weaknesses: not enough interaction with Dan. He's literally a genius when it comes to this stuff, and I really wish we had more time for questions or office hours.",
    "Really good!!",
    "A wide breadth of topics but if class was longer than 50 minute, it would feel so rushed all the time.",
    "Strength: I learned a lot of new information and found the class really interesting Weakenss: A LOT of material is covered.",
    "I think this was an excellent course and cannot think of anything I would change.",
    "Strengths: Interesting and engaging lectures that I actually enjoyed. Great reading material. The TF's were great and even helped you outside the classroom with improving your writing. Weaknesses: The professor seemed distant at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Excellent course that offers a good level of knowledge. But I am still not clear on the contributions and politics of 'transition' leaders like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao - we technically covered them, but not as incisively as the big leaders. Same with Sino-Soviet relations."

    "Yes. This course is very well-structured and the readings complement the lectures perfectly.",
    "Definitely. Fascinating stuff.",
    "Yes- Professor Mattingly is great. He organizes the material in a very logical and clear way, the topics are interesting and relevant, and the assignments are challenging but absolutely doable.",
    "Yes. Prof. Mattingly is such an amazing lecturer, and his slides and classes are not boring and very relevant to the world we live in today.",
    "Yes, there is literally no reason not to take this class! Not a gut in the sense that you do have to put some work in, but it is definitely not difficult at all to do well in this class. Interesting lectures (Mattingly is a very clear and engaging professor), cool readings, important\/relevant content. Take!",
    "Yes",
    "YES! I loved this class. China is such an important place in the world and you will learn so much about it and about the US in context\/today's global order. The economics and politics are fascinating, and it's nice to have a bit of history, domestic, and international politics. Professor Mattingly is also wonderful and the TFs were great!",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned so much about China's history, and the workload wasn't too bad.",
    "Yes definitely. I think it is really important given today's context to understand where China has come from and where it might wind up going. This class provided great background and context.",
    "Good as an overview class for contemporary Chinese politics.",
    "Yes. It is the type of class that you get out what you put in. If you are enthusiastic about learning more about China and being better able to more deeply understand current headlines and news stories about China then take this course.",
    "Yes, take it if you want know little about China and want to learn more but also want to take an easy class with little coursework.",
    "Yes! It's such a great course. Daniel Mattingly is amazing and makes the course really interesting. The first half of the class goes into Ancient China, but you quickly move into the 20th and 21st centuries, which makes the class topical and very relevant. It's very important to know about Chinese politics right now, and Professor Mattingly makes it really easy to understand",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! I knew nothing about China before starting, and beginning with an overview of the history of the country established the foundation to succeed in the rest of the course as we moved into domestic politics and international relations. The amount of information in relation to the depth of what we were learning was perfectly balanced. This is a great class for someone from any major to learn a lot, but also get out what you put into it. It isn't super challenging persay, but is very exciting so you will naturally want to learn more. Great course overall!",
    "Great intro class to learning about the history of China and how the communist party has developed to where it is today.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes. You'll really learn about China, which is important. You'll be able to read the news (about stuff like the trade war) and have a much deeper understanding of it.",
    "if you want to learn about China, this class is everything you would expect. Map quiz, midterm, two papers, and a take-home final. workload is pretty manageable, but sitting through class was hard because of how dry the material was. It is interesting for sure, but we talked a ton about the history of china, which can be pretty boring. It was an OK class. Not bad not great",
    "Yes! It's interesting and the workload isn't too bad, depending on your TA.",
    "Yes. If you haven't learned about Chinese history and want a primer on China's modern-day politics from an engaging professor, you should take this class.",
    "I recommend this course to almost everyone I talk to. I think the course content is fascinating--with engaging lectures and reflective readings. The course is organized extremely well, and the workload is flexible and manageable. Professor Mattingly is a very welcoming and kind professor, and he is truly passionate about this course and his students. I did not know what to expect before taking this class, but I am so glad that I did, because I have experienced the most growth with this course. This course provided me with a strong foundation on how to approach my future courses at Yale, and ignited my passion for studying more about China and international politics.",
    "Yes, the lectures are very interesting, Daniel Mattingly teaches well and introduces interesting political frameworks, thoughtful readings, and interesting documentary clips\/news articles\/China opportunities, section can be fantastic. However, it can be tempting to skip lecture, esp toward the latter half of the semester, in which case you miss out on a lot because lecture slides don't include all the details and you miss out on Mattingly's anecdotes.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. Despite it being a super interesting topic, the class was remarkably boring and disengaging. Almost half of the overall lecture time was spent watching documentary clips. Total waste of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course to another student. I took this course without any previous knowledge about China and this class serves as a great introduction to the country. Also, Professor Mattingly is extremely engaging and knowledgeable. At the end of each lecture I walked away learning something new.",
    "Absolutely, you'd get a better understanding about China's rise, a topic that may not be common knowledge",
    "Yes, really interesting and relevant info.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in China. This will be great for you to jump into conversation as well.",
    "Yes. This is a great course that blends Chinas rich history with their complex current state of affairs. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions about todays challenges, like the Trade War, and learnt a great deal about China today.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. I think anyone interested in politics should take this course, but also anyone who wants to have a better understanding of todays world. It was a really engaging course and the TAs were also really helpful with the readings and big concepts.",
    "Yes. Absolutely necessary for any poli sci\/global affairs\/history\/econ majors but also a great course for anyone to be a better informed citizen in contemporary affairs.",
    "I strong recommend this class to others. Just as Professor Mattingly said in his opening lecture, everyone should take a class on China at some point in their Yale career, and this is a great place to start.",
    "Overall, it's a decent course, but nothing lifechanging. Could probably have gotten the main takeaway of the course just by following the New York Times for a few weeks, but that said taking this course is also useful because 1\/3 of it is dedicated to Chinese history and it's a good way to learn about Chinese history without having to take a full-semester course on it",
    "Yes, It was very interesting and I believe the material is important for everyone to know because China is such a large part of global politics and economics",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone, especially as China plays a greater role in the the global community.",
    "Yes!! It was so interesting, you learned a lot without much effort, and its important to be aware. Your entire experience depends on your TF, though, so choose wisely.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding the political implications of China's rise on the global stage regardless of their previous knowledge of the region. Much of the history in this course is essential to understanding China in a global context and I believe everyone would benefit from studying it.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, very interesting topic.",
    "I would to those who want a broad sweep of Chinese history and politics and simply want to know a bit deeper the political climate of China. It is an interesting class and Professor Mattingly is an engaging lecturer.",
    "Yes. I'm an American, and I tend to only view China as it relates to US interests. This course taught me to view China on its own terms, with its own unique history and issues, systems of governance, and desires for the future. In addition, Mattingly is an excellent professor. Will not be surprised if I see him or his work involved and included in US-China policy in the next 20 years.",
    "Yes. The course is interesting, and is a great example of how you can learn a lot (if you go to class) without doing much work. The professor is a talented lecturer, and lecture is great. The map quiz, two response papers, and final are not bad at all. The midterm is a little tricky, but not too bad either. Section was terrible just like in all similar classes at Yale, but that's the price you pay.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It can serve both as an introductory course for someone who wants to study China longterm or a good survey class for someone with a passing interest.",
    "I completely would. This was a great course! Very interesting, not terribly difficult, and relevant for contemporary global politics.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "If you're looking to get a good understanding of how China came to be and where China is now then for sure",
    "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. This is the most well-organized course I have EVER taken at Yale. From the unit breakdown to the lecture themselves, this class was meticulously curated and the readings were STELLAR. Dan is such an amazing lecturer! He get's the material and makes it fun and interesting and doesn't read off of any notes or slides. He's legit. The TA's were also wonderful!! If you get the chance, go for Christina-- she breaks down the readings super well and her section always felt really inclusive. Exams are fair, and the essays are super easy to knock out, especially if you talk to your TA about the reading you've chosen to write about beforehand.",
    "Yes, it was a rich and illuminating overview of Chinese politics and economics.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "Yes!!",
    "If you are a poli sci major or interested in China, yes.",
    "Yes I definitely would. I would recommend this course to any other student, even if only remotely interested in Chinese politics and culture. It is essential to know about one of the most important countries today.",
    "Yes, this course was incredible! I went from essentially zero knowledge about China to having a level of understanding that would qualify me to deeply engage in most intellectual\/political debates regarding Chinese issues. The lectures were constantly engaging and detail-packed. If you would like to gain any knowledge about China's Rise, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes it was interesting and I learned a lot about the potential future of the US and China.",
