    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a wonderful way to learn about 18th century prose and it will change your way of thinking in ways that not all classes can do.",
    "One of the very best classes I've taken at Yale. Bromwich is the smartest teacher here: learning from him is reason enough to become an English major. But this class shows him at his best... He knows 18th century prose so well that you come away thinking it's the most underappreciated set of texts in history. You'd be a fool not to take this class.",
    "An in-depth study of the writings and thoughts of three 18th century thinkers and writers on the borders of politics and literary criticism.",
    "A fascinating travel through the giants of 18th century enlightened, but peculiarly conservative thinkers. Philosophy, criticism, and beautiful writing all mixed into one course. A must-take.",
    "Age of Johnson was a wonderful course. You read great texts, and if you give them the attention they deserve, the course will be that more fulfilling.This seminar is one in which the professor tends to talk\/lecture more than there is time spent on whole class discussion. As someone who prefers seminars that are like this, I thought it was great. I've always felt that I've learned more that way. You just get to absorb knowledge and information---and with someone as eloquent as Professor Bromwich, listen closely, and you'll get something out of every class. There are few people who are able to speak as he does. He does enjoy discussion and encourages it, without a doubt, and people have a chance to speak. I just think that class was always most interesting when Bromwich was able to talk.The seminar eager beavers who get upset at not being able to control the conversations in class will probably dislike their lack of power in this seminar. If you are one of those and willing to let go, go for it.If you are like me, and enjoy listening to the thoughts of very very very intelligent people, you should take this class---assuming you have some kind of interest in the material. If you're not sure, at least do some research.If you come from DS, and liked DS, you will likely enjoy this course."
