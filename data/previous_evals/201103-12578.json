   "comments": [
    "You read a lot - a LOT - of works of \"classic\" literature and discuss them, some in more depth than others. There's too much material to give it all the time it deserves, but the main ideas of every work, and smaller themes in major works, are well-covered.If literature and literary discussion appeals to you, this course is a great way to cover ancient stuff, but don't come in thinking you'll find new meaning in Homer or the Bible, and know that you'll miss out on a lot that most works have to offer simply because there isn't enough time. If you don't quite see the practical purpose of literature\/analysis, SKIP THIS! Context doesn't get much attention.If you don't like literature much but really want to try DS for other reasons, don't let this part of the program dissuade you, but give it thought before you sign up.",
    "Directed Studies: Literature during the 1st semester is an overview of Western Literature beginning with the Iliad and ending with Dante's Divine Comedy. The literature chosen for this class is superb--no where else will you get such a cumulative and encompassing overview, and you see that in many ways the works are all in dialogue with one another. Exploring why this is and how the authors explore themes in new ways is fascinating.",
    "I would summarize it as a speed read through the greatest literature works of the ancient world--from Ancient Greece through the Middle Ages. I would absolutely recommend it because it provides such a great literature foundation.",
    "Yes. DS is really great and you will be happy in the end for doing it.",
    "Yes, take it if you're a writing\/ reading type person.",
    "DS Lit is survey of some of the most important works of Western literature. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course - hugely expands your breadth of knowledge.",
    "If you have any sort of interest in classical literature, then yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. I always felt like I was remarkably under-read in high school; along with my interest in classical literature, I was spurred along to take this course. Out of all of the DS courses, this one was my favorite. The reading load is, of course, intense. And most of the time, we move very quickly (perhaps too quickly) through the texts. However, despite this break-neck speed, DS Lit has provided what I feel is a good foundation for any other literature classes I may take in the future; I am now more familiar with texts with which I was not familiar enough with before. The exposure, although quick, is effective, and it has facilitated a great curiousity in me to explore these texts even further, whether through papers, class discussion, or discussion with the professor.",
    "DS Lit in the fall is great. The literature speaks for itself - ancient texts are more exciting than they appear. Prof. Levin does them justice - she really knows her stuff. However, we got a cookie-cutter interpretation of these texts. Perhaps that's good for a broad introduction, but it was frustratingly conventional at times.",
    "DS is a lot of reading, so I would suggest you only take it if you're interested in spending a couple hours each night reading texts handed down from the Ancient Greeks and Romans in the first semester. If this survey of the Western Canon interests you though, I highly recommend taking DS. I really enjoyed Lit with Professor Levin - she is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about each work we studied in class. \"Momma Levin\" also very kindly treated our entire class to a meal at her home at the end of the semester.",
    "There are few things in college worth waking up for 9:00AM for, and Jane Levin's Literature class is worth it. If you have her, don't switch out; if you don't, do everything you can to switch in. She is the best teacher I have ever had, and I am far from the only one in my class to think that. Her passion for the subject is infectious. You can feel how excited she is to be teaching freshmen these canonical works and she brings such positive energy into the classroom. Her teaching is extremely clear, is the perfect mix of student discussion and her guidance, and she gets at the most important points of any text in the most efficient way possible. I've sat in other classes and only then appreciated how well she uses her time (which is one problem with DS, that a few classes is by no means enough for any of these books). She is also the most motherly professor one can have. If a student misses a class or is just interested, she takes even an entire hour out of her schedule (remember, she is head of DS and Richard Levin's wife) to fill you in on everything about the books. She is extremely understanding about deadlines. And she just loves her students. I (and anyone in my class) wish she were my mom. Yes and the syllabus itself is great. Almost all would say that Lit is the best of the three DS classes, at least for the first semester. The reading is a pleasure (although also the most skimmable in DS). There's a lot to be taken away from this course. And being in DS is well worth taking because it's honestly not as tough as it's made out to be (I did minimal reading and got out alive -- but do regret not having done more. This is an opportunity you want to make the most of). Take this for the subject, but more importantly, take it for Jane Levin.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is Directed Studies Literature. Exactly what you would expect from the course description. Perhaps a little easier than everyone makes it out to be. In any case, you get used to the work load. Take it! You'll be thankful you did at the end of the year and sorry if you did not.",
    "Great. Yes. A huge amount of reading, but the texts are all necessary",
    "DS lit has the same benefits and flaws as everybody says: it's a great overview of the canon, but it's just an overview, and occasionally the way in which we breeze through the great literary works can be frustrating. Levin's excellent reputation is well-deserved though. Her enthusiasm really is contagious, and her feedback is thoughtful and helpful."
