    "Songwriting!",
    "I learned a great deal about the basic principles and traditions of lyric writing in musical theater.",
    "I realized what kind of theater is \"successful,\" what small things differentiate \"pop theater\" from \"art songs.\"",
    "I got a lot of great practice churning out songs in the musical theater style! Plus, as someone lacking familiarity with a lot of musical theatre, I got a sort of survey of notable examples of theater composition.",
    "My ability to compose music improved dramatically. I also learned a lot about musical theater in general. I loved this course, and I think it contributed a lot to my life this semester in general.",
    "I learned to write vocal music VERY quickly and to revise weekly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked working composers and lyricists together",
    "I thought the course format did an overall good job of catering to lyricists and composers, though there seemed to be a greater amount of time spent discussing composition instead of lyric writing. But the material was engaging and class time never felt wasted.",
    "I thought more energy could have been spent teaching lyricists and composers what goes into successful collaboration. Little time was spent in this class actually \"teaching.\" I think the professor could've been overall more critical, and students should've had the option to write their own music\/lyrics. That said, it was a fun class with supportive people and a very friendly teacher. The atmosphere in the room was my favorite of any class I took this semester. I think more time needs to be spent figuring out how to teach musical theater in an academic sense for this class to really get off the ground.",
    "I think the critical part of the course is the requirement of producing a song each week. This is what kept me engaged and provided the most effort from all the students. Revision was a bit hazy -- sometimes Rosenblum would ask for \"a few tweaks\" with no implied deadline (the next week), and on the other end sometimes we had a week with no new song required where some students wouldn't really have something concrete to revise (besides a tweak or two). I feel revision is important... although I don't love it myself. Perhaps the course would benefit from some sort of rhythm of new material and revisions: three weeks of new, one week to revise two of the three, etc, with revision weeks rotated across students so that we could listen to and comment on new student material each week.",
    "I loved the opportunity to write songs and receive feedback on them. Due to the higher number of students in the class than usual, I was not able to receive as much instruction as I would have liked. However, I also very much appreciated being able to work with the lyricists.",
    "I wish the class was less discussion based and more thoroughly taught by the professor. I loved my class but thought class got out of control."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if interested in writing for musical theater - there was some tension when some students didn't seem to want to write for that genre at all, although they eventually made compromises.",
    "This course is well worth taking. It offers you the opportunity to connect with other potential lyricists and composers. It challenges you through a variety of prompts that, while specific, offer artistic freedom and support for experimentation. And you're given wonderful feedback that ranges from the technical to the general. These factors unite to create an encouraging space ideal for creative growth.",
    "No, because I think one would be better of working on a long-form project. I don't find the exercise of writing weekly stand-alone songs to be very helpful.",
    "If you want to write music, odds are you already do. However, a structured course that provides weekly feedback and pushes you to produce something new and expand your \"harmonic language\" (a Josh Rosenblum staple term) certainly can't hurt. If you can see yourself putting in the work and writing some nice music, by all means dive in!",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. I think that students should be aware of their musical ability going in, and just keep this in mind, but I think that this course offers a lot for many people with different levels of ability. I loved this course. I think it was very educational and very engaging, and I improved my composition dramatically.",
    "YES!"
