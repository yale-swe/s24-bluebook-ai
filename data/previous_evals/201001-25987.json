    "Yes, Directed Studies not only takes you through the greatest works in the Western canon, but equips you with the skills necessary to succeed in subsequent classes at Yale.",
    "If any student is interested in Philosophy and has the stamina for this course, I would recommend it.",
    "Without doubt. Prof. Smith keeps you on your toes.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is an interesting course that traces two key themes in modern thought: morality and the nature or reality. You begin with Descartes, then Leibniz, experience the weirdness of Berkeley, travel to the all-too-enlightening Hume, confusing Kant, and end with Nelson Goodman. It\u0092s a cool survey of how thought evolves, and chances are that you will have no idea what Kant is saying the first time you read him. It\u0092s okay; very few people do. Hume is a boss\u0097just remember that. I must say that this class was my least favorite of the three, but it was still a great experience. Matthew Smith is a funny, cool, and nice section leader. I don\u0092t think that he is particularly brilliant, so if you are looking for a big name philosophical scholar, look elsewhere. Yet he will make the reading clear and understandable. He likes to call on people, so make sure that you do the reading. And I think that he is a fair grader. He is extremely particular with word choice, though, so precision of language is key. I would recommend a class with Smith, but only if you can\u0092t get into Possen\u0092s, Saucedo\u0092s or Gilmore\u0092s section. (Raul Saucedo is, in my opinion, probably the coolest and chillest professor ever. He\u0092s awesome!!) Try to switch into Possen to experience Possen paradise. It\u0092s that good\/mind-blowing. Possen or Saucedo will be awesome.",
    "This class will be one of the high points of your undergraduate career! The philosophy covered in this part of DS is essential to understand the connections established in the first semester to thecurrent debates in philosophy. You will also hone your thinking to an even higher level of logic and analysis.",
    "DS Philosophy is terrific. I highly recommend it. Matthew Smith is a terrific Professor. You consider some of the most fundamental and important challenges facing humans.",
    "An interesting class. I found it to be very thought-provoking and brain-stretching.However, sometimes DS is sold as a way to study the meaning of life. You might expect this to be especially true in philosophy, but Idid not find it to be. For example, several hundred years of philosophy is just devoted to proving that objects exist, which is interesting, but not particularly meaningful to me.Overall, I thought this was the most challenging of the 6 DS classes. Class discussions with Prof. Smith are always dynamic and engaging but I often left class still feeling very confused (that may have been my fault, not his). I also felt that the works' relevance to our lives and connections between the works were not discussed as much as they could have been in lecture and in section.",
    "Good course, if you're willing to put in the work and actually think about the philosophy.Matthew Smith is a great section leader, but he can at times be mean to students who don't understand the material. If you participate a lot, he will be great for you. Really funny, really engaging, and willing to challenge you on many points. If you are less confident in philosphy, though, might want to look for a professor who is a bit friendlier and more helpful.",
    "If you want an overview of philosophy then definitely.",
    "If you're reading this, you're in directed studies, in which case I need not tell you what a brilliant decision you've made. Furthermore, you're either contemplating switching out of Smith (don't.) or switching into (maybe, but if you've got Possen, don't.).",
    "Take DS! Get prof. Smith if you can, he was amazing. Great section leader but a very demanding grader. Having some of the best professors at yale take you through the western canon... take it already!"
