    "It is a good introduction to the major themes in evolutionary theory. I would definitely recommend it, as it is provides a unifying framework for a doctoral education in evolutionary anthropology.",
    "I would tell another student that you address some of the central issues in evolutionary biology in this class, and get to read and discuss some influential works. I'd also tell them that it'd be very helpful to have a solid background in evolutionary theory before taking this class because you're not given much introduction to the topics during class. I would also say that you get as much as you put into this class. It seems like it would be very easy to skim the articles and phone it in during discussion, so you need to be intrinsically motivated to learn the material."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided a very basic level of knowledge of evolutionary biology absolutely essential to further study of evolutionary anthropology. I learned a lot and feel I have a decent grasp of a lot of things after the class that I had either heard reference to or had a cursory knowledge of before taking the class.",
    "The final paper for this class gave me the opportunity to apply evolutionary ideas to topics that interest me and clearly synthesize my understanding of relevant ideas. Also, many of the topics we discussed will be important for me to understand during my future teaching career, and have influenced the development of my particular field. However, the topics covered in class itself often did not directly relate to my dissertation\/research."
