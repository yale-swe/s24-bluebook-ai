   "comments": [
    "Very engaging course, even for someone with no prior knowledge of US politics (other than high school civics). It provided me a strong understanding of the circumstances facing the US political climate, and it was very relevant especially with the changing administration.",
    "Participation is weighted too heavily.",
    "Strengths: Schlesinger is brilliant, the lectures are really interesting, he circles around to fundamental aspects of governance, American politics, current events, healthcare financing and policy realities to elucidate the difficulty in creating good health policy. Weaknesses: papers are not based off of environmental scans, but selected literature. Less structured prompt would allow for more aspirational work.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course. Lectures were interesting and engaging, and readings primed me for absorbing the most out of lecture.",
    "Too much reading! More discussion would be great.",
    "Course is fine; readings are heavy but assignments were broad and expectations were difficult to meet.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses and I feel as though I learned a lot during the course. I do wish the assignments were longer, as there was much requested in the prompts.",
    "This course was very effective at discussing the political outlook and policy issues behind health policy. It wasn't a civics class, but we had to have an understanding of how the functioning of the government works. I liked the first assignment, but the second one wasn't that fruitful. It would have been much better to be an individual assignment, since the entirety of the class was dependent on your individual takeaways from the reading and lectures.",
    "I could listen to Mark lecture for hours. always so well organized. I wish we wrote out some practice health briefs or may be had some examples of some good ones.",
    "This course is excellent. I looked forward to going to class each week. Coordinating the group project in reading\/finals week was quite difficult, but that is the only issue I had with the class. Interesting readings, fun first paper.",
    "Great response--Mark really knows his stuff and makes the course. Learned a lot and it covered exactly what it said it would cover and more. Research paper was hard! But learned a lot in the class.",
    "This course was taught in such a confusing manner and at such a slow pace that by the time the midterm and final came about, it was nearly impossible to disconcert what material was relevant and what was not.",
    "I learned a lot of new information, the papers helped me feel like an expert on various policy issues.",
    "There are 2 big assignments that make up the grades, and that could be really stressful. The first policy paper is a lot of work, and the biggest hurdle in the class. But it improves the policy writing skill significantly. I believe a lot of the people in the class had a hard time, but we all managed in the end. Mark is simply amazing, and the depth of his knowledge is bottomless. He does get to know your name, and I suggest speaking up in the class to engage even more! I highly highly recommend this class (not only to the HPM students, but anyone who is interested in health policy more in detail!)",
    "excellent content but could at times be a lot to take in for one session without a break.",
    "Phenomenal in depth analysis and discussion of many of the nuanced dynamics of health politics, governance and health policy. Strengths include the diversity and depth of topics discussed.",
    "This course is one of the best that I've taken at YSPH. The assignments were a great opportunity to explore the material further. Classroom discussion was always interesting. The class could seem long without a break in the middle of the two hours.",
    "Great professor, sometimes reading were too many",
    "The readings were torture. They rarely related to class conversation. I was expecting a informational class on government. Instead I got- a high level political science discussion course that is meant to weed out the weak with a nauseating amount of reading meant to Sedate even the most eager of caffeinated students",
    "An amazing and necessary course. This course may not seem as practical as other courses at first glance, but I think I learned some incredibly crucial skills that are will be applicable to any public health practitioner, policy-maker, or advocate. It's incredibly important to have this kind of \"big-picture lens\" of how, when, and why change in our system is made and what stakeholders react to.",
    "Strengths - very challenging course that had us read a lot to understand Marks philosophy and thinking about the subjects. Very challenging projects that really forced us to dig into the topics deeper. Weaknesses- class was too long to follow his lecture style. We needed a break during it because he dug so deep into the topics if you faded for a second you'd be lost."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Who are you?",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The course was effectively taught.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is great. I thoroughly enjoy how his class is organized. None of the readings made sense, but when he started to deconvolute them all the lectures were cohesive and made the readings make sense. I also liked how he didn't use powerpoints because it made you pay attention. It was unfortunate because many students use computers and don't actually participate in the class and it's evident.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0well organized lecturer",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an amazing professor. I can't say enough good things about his brilliance, his eloquence, his organization, his interest in students' opinions, etc.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Amazing, incredibly intelligent and devoted instructor. He knew what he was talking about and relayed it in a way that anyone from any background could understand. No criticisms.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Brilliant man",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Good instructor but has clearly been teaching the same material, word for word, since forever without changing up the material at all. Many of the readings are outdated.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I absolutely enjoyed the class, and going to the class. Each class builds on each other, and even though you don't get tested on the material from the classes, going to the classes is worth your time!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0One of the best faculty you will encounter at YSPH!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is engaging and so responsive to his students. He goes above and beyond to help us and his feedback is always extremely constructive.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Excellent instructor, really thoughtful, really incredible at being engaging in discussion and lecturing without using slides or traditional tools. Wish he didn't print out so much paper every class though!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is incredible. He is so knowledgeable about the subject and does an amazing job of making the material easy to understand and accessible to students. His lectures are topical and his examples are relevant to current policy debates. He facilitates productive classroom conversation and is always open to meeting with students outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great, approachable, intelligent",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Every question was a game of \"read my mind\". Instructions for written assignments were 5 pages long for a five page paper, after reading those five pages you still had no idea what you were being asked to do",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0A truly phenomenal professor. YSPH is incredibly lucky to have Dr. Schlesinger. Dr. Schlesinger put in a large amount of time to providing feedback, constructing thoughtful prompts, and helping students who reached out. You have to see Dr. Schlesinger lecture before you graduate. I looked forward to this class every week.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great lecturer and extremely intelligent, many times he was way over my head but very motivating for that reason. Very helpful for students when you ask for help."

    "Great course for those interested in politics (or who might need to understand it for their field of interest). Overall, I learned a lot, and it was one of my favorite classes in the program. I felt as if the first project did a great job of allowing me to integrate everything I learned in class into an assignment.",
    "It's an excellent course that teaches material that is fundamental to American health care policy creation. If you have to take it, you can look forward to it; if it's not required, I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "If you are good at reading large amount of policy & politics paper, you should do it.",
    "The course has a fair bit of reading, but it very interesting and worth the effort.",
    "This course is the introductory course to health policy and the dynamics that govern federal and local policy implementation. I would recommend it to any student who wants to learn about how the government functions in the specific capacity as it pertains to health policy.",
    "great course that puts health policy making in the political context. given my own personal bias, I am interested in reproductive health policy. given how much it is in the news it would have been interesting to discuss this from a governance\/policy perspective",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I would absolutely take the course again; I feel that I've gotten a lot out of it. This was one of my favorite two classes at YSPH.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Great class, work effort is concentrated in a couple segments, but you learn a lot.",
    "You will learn a lot about the way our government makes health policy--very interesting.",
    "Learn how to write persuasively for policy briefs.",
    "great class, definitely take for a greater understanding of how to navigate the US political system in order to make changes to the health care system.",
    "A really thought-provoking class that really led me to be interested in health policy for the first time, in a way that might be career-changing. Lots of great reading and reference materials, and excellent discussions in class. A bit of a time commitment, but take it if you can!",
    "Phenomenal in depth analysis and discussion of many of the nuanced dynamics of health politics, governance and health policy. Strengths include the diversity and depth of topics discussed.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The course material is highly relevant and important, and the professor is amazing.",
    "Take it if you want a wide scope of health policy",
    "A game of fight the urge to sleep for out of class work and in class instructor ESp",
    "This was a great \"meta\" look at how policy and public health practice is created, and what forces influence both the process and outcomes of policy creation. I would recommend this to everyone, even if you're not in the Health Policy track.",
    "Very challenging yet imperative course if wanting to go into policy design. Such an important course that provides students with capacity to evaluate challenging policy issues."
