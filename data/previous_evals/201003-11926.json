    "When I took this class, it had the format of a lecture course and the size of a seminar. This basically meant that you didn't need to spend as much time on the reading as you would have to for a seminar, but you still had plenty of opportunities to participate.Professor Landemore is a great discussion leader, and she's really pushes back at your ideas and opinions. While Professor Landemore extremely knowledgable, she can also be very precise and technical when grading the papers. Invest in a dictionary early, and save yourself the shock of the first grade.",
    "yes take the class.",
    "Justice is a class that traces conceptions of justice from the ancients through social contract theorists and modern philosophers. The second half of the class is devoted to thematic discussions of justice: just war, global justice, affirmative action, etc. All of the material was very interesting, though there was a lot. I'm not sure how many of the people in class were actually doing even a majority of the reading.It's a very solid class and I recommend it wholeheartedly. If you're interested in politicalphilosophy and want a more engaging experience than you'd probably have in Smith or another lecture, think hard about this. A good class if you're not new to the field, too. Professor Landemore is really great.",
    "Great course if you want to learn more in-depth material from political theory. The discussions on Rawls, and thematic discussions on affirmative action were particularly engaging.",
    "If you want to get a historical overview of different theories of justice, then yes. If you want to spend a lot of time thinking deeply about what justice is and how to create a just world, might not be the right format for you. You can make that your experience in the course, but it's not automatically given by the course.",
    "It's a really good class. You get the same background you get in one of the political philosophy lectures but with interesting applications and contemporary theory, and you get a small class with a really nice, smart professor. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the syllabus, but do go talk to Professor Landemore about your first essay if you've never written a philosophy paper before.",
    "The classes were a lot fun. You get to debate with other student about questions of justice. However, the grading for this class seems unnecessarily hard. BEWARE OF THE ESSAYS! Professor Landemore will often mark you off for random reasons and leave you wondering where you went wrong. There is a lot of reading, but it is kind of necessary for the scope of this class. Some material is definitely covered better in class that others...",
    "This is a survey of big name western thinkers and their theories on justice and more specifically just political society. It is a poly-sci class with philosophical elements, not the other way around, so if you don't like poly-sci that much you might find it boring."
