   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are an Econ major. The theoretical part is the main focus. There are lots of models. If you are not an Econ major, maybe you will not be interested.",
    "Not a bad class to take. Not too much work. Grading can be a bit arbitrary though.",
    "Good intro course.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "Amazing.",
    "Good experience, one learns a lot about a very important subject from professors who really know what they're talking about.",
    "the material being introduced is not that difficult, but the lectures and slides are not very clear. if you're after a class with a reasonable workload, this may work. but if you want a good grade, you may want to reconsider, because the midterm was poorly prepared.",
    "Take the course if you are interested in trade. Can get pretty dull especially with the applications part of the course.",
    "This was a very good econ course. The tests are a little unpredictable but everyone is in the same boat so it all evens out. The workload is very manageable and the textbook is very well written. I wish that we dealt with more case studies towards the end of the class instead of just talking about economic policy theory, but overall it was a very informative class. I am sure that I will use what I learned in this class in the future.",
    "i would not recommend this course, because both teachers are not very engaging and make the class pretty boring.",
    "I would recommend it because its an extremely important topic that people should know moreabout. Also, the chance to learn from Zedillo and Srinivasan is something that probably should not be passed up.",
    "If you're an econ major interested in international trade then you might find this course interesting. Most people didn't show up to class everyday, so you could probably get by with the textbook and section."
