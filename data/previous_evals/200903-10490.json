    "It is a course requiring serious reading and thinking. Never expect to muddle through. I will definitely recommend this course, for it is indeed inspiring and helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "This course has not only deepened my understanding of certain theories but also help me familiarize lots of literary texts which I did not have chances to learn before, which indeed served as an eye-opener. Interactions with the instructor and classmates have broadened both of my academic interests and intellectual visions.",
    "This course focused on modern migration language and literature in the Chinese diaspora, which is a very specific topic that will not help with my own research at all. However, the secondary or theoretical sources will be very helpful in finding new perspectives to analyze different kinds of works.",
    "The engagement with recent future-oriented issues and works in the field of Chinese literature not only deepened my knowledge of the discipline, but exposed me to several approaches and areas of literature that I had not been aware of until I took this course. The focus on different ways to conceptualize and position \"Chinese\" literature contributed to my research in that it opened up new avenues for engaging East Asian literature. While the course offered an unorthodox way of entering into Chinese literature, I found extremely valuable for reassessing the canon and the field itself."
