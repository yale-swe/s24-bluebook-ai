    "In EP&E the senior essay is what you make of it. It's great if you have an engaged advisor and second reader -- but the experience of writing the senior essay could be seriously improved by having far more support, guidance, and sense of a group as the thesis goes along. It seems like the EP&E department is working on it, but there is so little guidance from the department on what the expectations for the essay are, and how to carry it out successfully. There was one meeting each semester to lay out guidelines, and then a meeting with the senior essay advisor -- both things that were helpful, but there was no sense of EP&E community or sense that my thesis was deeply tied to the major."

    "Again -- the senior essay in EP&E is completely what you make of it. It can go in so many directions, and the rigor with which you connect your work to ethics, politics, and economics is totally up to you. This freedom is nice, but it's also a bit frustrating that there are so few expectations or guidelines for what the essay will look like. There's also no sense of community or knowledge of what other people in the major are doing, what they're working through and learning about - which, again, makes it less of a time commitment (because we don't have a colloquium or meetings regularly), but also makes it less engaging and rewarding.",
    "Yes!"
