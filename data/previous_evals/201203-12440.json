   "comments": [
    "If you have a reason to learn Old English, this is a good class (I feel like you can read things pretty competently by the end, you get practice with translations, and you come out with some basic historical knowledge.) Professor Frank was very helpful and flexible about people's particular interests as well, so the balance of literature, linguistics and history might be open to change, and individual presentations are an opportunity to look more closely at your area of study.",
    "An amazing introduction to an amazing language. Professor Frank is astounding - she's funny, she's friendly, she's a genius. You'll get to read gorgeous poetry and prose, ending with Seamus Heaney's magnificent Beowulf. The workload is very manageable - a midterm and a final, plus a 10 minute presentation, in which you're allowed to pursue your own interests, be it pop culture, linguistics, poetry, history, etc. Put in the work in the early weeks to get the grammar down cold - you won't regret it when the actual texts come that much easier. I also feel it necessary to repeat that Prof. Frank is one of the most wonderful people you will ever meet.",
    "The basic structure of the course is a few weeks running through Old English grammar followed by several weeks of readings in Old English, finishing up with a reading of Beowulf in translation. I would highly recommend the class: the class is well-structured, Prof. Frank is amazing, and (most importantly) Old English literature is fascinating.",
    "I didn't really know what to expect going into this class, so I hope I might be able to clear up some potential misconceptions for you. To start, as Professor Frank is careful to note, this is NOT a class on the history of the English language, and although it is cross-listed with Linguistics, there is virtually no linguistic content. My other are of confusion stemmed from the fact that I'd never studied a dead language before. You won't learn to speak Old English, nor will you get any practice writing it - rather, this is mostly a translation class. Typically we'd read a passage and translate it for homework and then go around the room reviewing the translation as a class the next day. I really enjoyed the class! The readings are usually fun, and you get this great feeling of satisfaction after translating them. Professor Frank is also wonderful. She is unbelievably knowledgeable, and whenever someone asks a question she can't answer off the top of her head, she makes it her homework to find the answer.Just note that for the tests, you (essentially) need to memorize the assigned passages.",
    "If you are interested in the history of English this class is a must take. It's very different from other English classes: each day you prepare a translation and go around the room reading your translations. There's 1 small project near the end of the course, a mid term, and a final. The exams are more difficult than you'd from expect from the nature of the class, and you either have to have your translation skills well honed or memorize a lot of passages.Honestly, it's worth taking this class just for Professor Frank. She's amazing. She has a unique sense of humor that only advanced age and a lifelong study of Anglo-Saxon language and history can produce.",
    "Yes. Even for students like me with no background in Old English, Latin, or German, this is a very enjoyable course. It can be a struggle at first, but when you overcome that, this course is not too challenging and yet immensely fun. Roberta Frank is sweet and funny and can answer all of your questions on the spot. Although the English language has changed, taking ENGL150 can help you think in new ways about language in general. Discussing the ambiguities and nuances of OE was also a lot of fun.",
    "This is a fun class if you're interested in the subject matter. You really get out of it what you put into it. The environment in the classroom was laid back and fun, and the professor is very knowledgable.",
    "A general introduction to what is known about Old English grammar and vocabulary, with readings of the most important works of Old English literature. Highly recommended to anyone interested in linguistics, English, or Anglo-Saxon history and culture.",
    "Yes, take this class. I'm not going to be a linguistics major, and I had never taken a linguistics course before this one. I just thought Old English would be a cool thing to learn, and it was! It isn't a stressful class. Here's a tip: use the Old English Aerobics website. Before I found out about it, the texts were really grueling to translate. But after, the workload was hardly something to complain about. Also, to do well, you will have to end up memorizing ALL of the anthologies (not minitexts, though). For the midterm, she only tested us on one anthology, which was a piece of cake. And for the final, I was expecting it to be the same. Nope. She wanted us to know everything. So keep this in mind. You may want to memorize the pieces as you do them. Don't leave it until the last moment like I did. It was horrible, but it turned out alright. She's pretty nice with grading.Lovely professor, by the way! It was worth it."
