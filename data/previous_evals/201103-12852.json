    "definitely a drop off if you're coming back from beijing. a lot of work, but very manageable. your speaking ability will drop for sure.",
    "If you've spent a summer in China, your language abilities will stagnate and possibly degenerate by taking this class because there is very limited speaking (in addition to the fact that you are now back in the States). This was basically a repeat of my summer in Beijing but you kind of need to take this class to fulfill prerequisites and just to know Chinese so I would recommend it",
    "It's what you would expect out of Chinese 150. If you went to China on the Light fellowship, your chinese will get worse but not as fast as it would if you weren't taking Chinese 150. At the end of the day, this is what it comes down to: you just put in your 30 or so minutes a day, write your essays on the weekends, and get 1.5 A's at the end of the term.",
    "A lot of work, but worth it if you plan on using Chinese in your future career. Took a summer program? Take this class so you don't forget everything.",
    "Yes, but only if you're prepared to lose a little bit of your patience with language courses.",
    "A good course, but very difficult to return to after doing HBA or PIB over the summer. You'll definitely feel like you're losing your Chinese for the beginning of the course, mostly in that opportunities for speaking are much less. However, though I'm still not sure that I've surpassed the point I was at the end of the summer, I'm sure that if I hadn't taken this course I would have forgotten everything.",
    "This is a good Chinese class, but I think that any Chinese class that meets for only 50 minutes daily will be kind of a disappointment if you're just coming back from the Light Fellowship at a program like HBA or PIB. My friends and I all went to HBA and all took the same section of Chinese 150, and we didn't really feel like our Chinese had gone backwards, but we also didn't feel like it was really progressing. It's probably got nothing to do with the class and everything to do with having left the immersive environment we had in China, so it's not an explicit reason not to take Chinese 150, but you should still adjust your expectations accordingly.The class is well taught and fairly graded, and I do feel like I learned a decent amount of characters (although I'm sure I've forgotten many of the ones we learned over the summer haha).",
    "The work can be suffocating at times, but doable.",
    "having to study for quizzes and do homework everyday could be annoying but if you don't want to lose your chinese, take it.",
    "A good class for maintaining your Chinese level (if you spent the summer abroad). Not that much work compared to the summer. Just take it!"
