   "comments": [
    "Interesting to anyone with a biological focus. Very informative and great for anyone who's curious about how the immune system works",
    "Information heavy introduction to the immune system. Not a research methods course but very useful for general information about the immune system.",
    "Immunobiology 530 provides a basic understanding of the concepts in immunology with some emphasis on the particular topics presently being researched here at Yale. I would recommend the class to others although it may be important to know that it requires a lot of time spent with the material for a full understanding.",
    "Not particularly. Perhaps if they are in the Immunobiology grad program and memorizing signal transduction pathways really interests them -- as a graduate microbial disease\/public health student, I was frustrated by the lack of conceptual underpinning of some lectures (especially the signal transduction lectures), and felt that the final exam tested details and memorization too much.",
    "Sure. It is one of the best courses available. All the teachers are kind of experts in the field.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to how the immune system works. The instructors clearly and thoroughly covered the major topics in immunobiology.I would definitely recommend this course to another student!",
    "I would if you want to learn about diseases and the immune system, which I did so it was all very interesting. There was a lot of material and the tests were a little difficult, but still worth it.",
    "Great introductory survey of immunobiology. Ideally, you should keep up with reading to get the most out of the course. Having many instructors coming through was actually something of a strength in this course.",
    "A great overall immunobiology review class that will teach you the basics of all the major systems and how they interconnect. I would definitely recommend it as it has a lot of practical value to many other fields as well as modern society and health.",
    "You have to really really really love mass memorization and\/or Immunology to get any value out of this course. All others should avoid like the plague.",
    "Immunobiology 530 01 is a great overview of the vast and exciting subject of immunology. It provides a strong foundation while also covering many important recent advances being made in the field. Accordingly, I would recommend it to anyone interested in immunology or who might want to explore it. You can\u0092t find a better collection of faculty to teach the course anywhere else in the world.",
    "It was a lot of material, but it was definitely worthwhile. Especially if you need to learn the immune system from the basics, this class gives you all the information, and it does a good job of painting the whole picture. I would recommend this course, but only to people who need to know Immunology. For the rest it's too much work.",
    "Immunobiology is a challenging but rewarding class where you can learn a complex subject from the leaders in their field. The course involves a lot of time memorizing in the weeks before the exam.I would recommend this class to other students who are motivated to learn. This is not a class where you can get by with only a little work.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ibio 530 to another student, especially if they are a Bio major. It is a well-taught course with excellent professors, workload is not overly demanding, and you come away with a slightly simplified yet well-rounded view of Immunology.",
    "It's a good class with current information being presented. Go to class and learn the material presented.",
    "Hard and a lot of work, but worth it if you're interested in the subject because you'll learn a lot in the lectures. I might reccommend that another student audit it if they weren't going into immunology or didn't need the credit\/grade, because I got most of what I got out of the course out of the lectures, and the exams can be fairly stressful, just because of the vast amount of material, and the fact that they don't really narrow it down for you or help you prepare in any substantial way.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, as it is an excellent introduction to the field of immunology, and will give you the baseline knowledge to critically evaluate the claims of anti-vaccination groups, homeopathy and other specious practices."

   "comments": [
    "My potential dissertation research won't focus on immunobiology but the biological background is helpful for potential research. This class significantly increased my knowledge in the field",
    "This course helped me very much to understand the basics of immunology. Although I may not remember all the details, I think the overall ideas will definitely help me to better understand my research projects as well as others in my field. I have already had multiple times where the information in class has contributed to my background information relating to my research products.",
    "My major is microbiology which is closely related with immunology. So I really learnt a lot from this course.",
    "Immunobiology provided a deep overview of immunology that will help provide a great foundation for research in the field and in related areas of biology and\/or biomedical research. These subjects are all much more relatable now and the interconnectedness of immunology is more evident.",
    "Since I joined an immunology lab, this information is immeasurably important to my research. I've already gotten a ton of use out of the knowledge I've gained from it, and I'm sure it'll keep coming in handy as I do more research.",
    "This course was essential as a first year Immunobiology Graduate student. It would be next to impossible to fully understand your research project or others with out this background.",
    "Since I had not had an Immunology class prior to this, this course was fundamental to my learning and understanding of Immunobiology.",
    "There's a lot of information out there about current immunological topics. It definitely deepened my understanding about innate immunity and the interplay between components of the immune system. Information is extremely recent and is directly applicable to many areas of my research.",
    "I learned a lot and find immunology really fascinating. I'm sure I'll use some aspects of what I learned in my research, however I am not going into the field of immunology specifically, so it doesn't directly apply as much."
