    "Helps to illuminate both Hegel's own philosophical system and many central aesthetic concerns of German idealism. With reflections on the relevance of Hegel's aesthetics to modernity and contemporary art.",
    "I would highly recommend anyone interested in this period of German philosophy taking any course Prof. Harries has to offer before he stops teaching.",
    "This course is not only recommended, but I think that any student interested in continental philosophy should regard it as a MUST.",
    "I would strongly recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "Situates Hegel's aesthetics within the whole of his philosophy. The text itself directly engages much of the philosophy of art that preceded it and draws conclusions significant to any aesthetics that would follow it.",
    "This course has deepened my knowledge of enlightenment aesthetics and philosophy hugely and I am very glad to have taken it.",
    "I am in the political science department working on political theory, and this course will inform my interest in political judgment, which is often rooted in the history of philosophy concerning aesthetic judgment. Prof. Harries is very good at connecting aesthetics to the other philosophical discipline."
