    "Animal Communications and Human Language was a very interesting and enlightening course. I particularly enjoyed learning about such a wide range of animals and their communication systems. Definitely a very interesting--and unique!--class to take at Yale. I highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "So, ugh, here's the deal: I'm an EEB major with a very strong linguistics background who used to be fluent in sign language (not ASL, though, so the aspect stuff was new). Not surprisingly, I was bored to tears. This class is a gut that pretends to cover basic linguistic concepts, to highlight the communication systems of several different animal groups, and to introduce the attempts to teach ASL to monkeys. Really, though, it's just a gut. If you want to learn about animal communication, take an EEB class (Animal Behavior, Ornithology, and Evolutionary Biology all significantly cover communication systems, and I think there are some primatology classes in the Anthro department?). If you want to learn about linguistics, take Historical or Intro. Only take this class if you're desperate for a social science credit, and even then, expect this class to be a waste of your time. If you take the class anyway, do the readings - both Anderson's and Pinker's books are really interesting (like, honestly, if you're interested in non-technical linguistics buy Pinker's book, \"The Language Instinct,\" just for fun) although Hauser's book, which is \"recommended\", in a complete waste of money and shelf space.",
    "Mediocre. Interesting material and very knowledgeable professor. But, the lectures are not the best. It's very easy to miss lectures and still do well. So, if you're looking for an easy Cr\/D class--this is absolutely it. But, if you're looking to be consistently intrigued by the material, this is not it. The lectures move too slowly to be stimulating, and the essay assignments are kind of silly. If you need a psych credit, go for it. Otherwise, I'm not sure.",
    "Take this class only if you care about getting a credit without doing much work.",
    "If you're interested in learning about the communication systems of different animals and language development in humans, take this class. It's really easy. Prof. Anderson can be boring but he's pretty much the leading scholar on the topic so it's cool to learn from him.",
    "not much work and no tests is a big bonus but the material is not that exciting",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. There were not tests\/quizzes which was definitely nice. However, your entire grade is based on the short papers which are graded out of 10 points and a final paper\/take home test at the end. Therefore, the grading in this class is fairly questionable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he\/she doesn't mind being bored to tears on a regular basis. Don't be fooled by the seemingly interesting name of the class. Also, while there is relatively little work, it is graded harshly.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. I used it as something totally different than any of my other courses which we more of pre-requisites and it was a great release.",
    "Yes! It's great. The Professor is amazing and the material is fascinating. His book is great also, so if you can't take the class, definitely read the book. Very good read.",
    "Need a writing credit or a psych class without stressing yourself? Then take it. But unless you really care about animal communication don't expect to get much more from it than your credit.",
    "An interesting class describing the communication systems of several animals species. Work load was small - just a short 2-page paper every couple of weeks, and an 8-10 page final paper. No exams. The book written by the professor is very helpful and basically mirrors the lectures. If you need an extra credit this class is definitely worth checking out.",
    "Yes. Somewhat interesting but incredibly little work.",
    "Interesting class. You'll learn about how different animals communicate, which sounds awesome but it gets kind of boring at times. There aren't any tests, which is great - just 6 two-page papers and a final paper (they drop the lowest 2pg grade). Professor Anderson is interesting enough to enjoy the class, and with the grading set-up it's definitely worth taking.",
    "This is low-stress since you only have to do 5 small writing assignments and one final paper. There is no need to learn all of the material or even go to most classes. Take it for the credit but not if you're looking for a good time.",
    "Take it! It is not took bad of a work load and many of the topics and film clips are genuinely interesting and entertaining. Use the TAs when you have questions.",
    "Would recommend as a gut. If you're taking it as a core, ditch; the workload's light.",
    "I would recommend it to another student as it is very interesting, and you essentially get out of it what you put into it. The readings aren't mandatory, but if you want to do them, you're better off for it.",
    "I recommend it. You don't really have to go to lecture if you look through the slides online and are really good at researching stuff.",
    "Yes, this class is an interesting look at the similarities and differences between animal communications and human language. the two page papers every other week are easy and the final paper is a topic of your choice and only 8-10 pages",
    "Although the lecture style did get a little monotonous, the extent of Professor Anderson's knowledge and expertise about animal communication and human language was readily apparent with every class. With a course whose material is very term-heavy and necessarily abstract, Professor Anderson did a good job adding videos and sound clips that illustrated the material effectively.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with some linguistic knowledge. Towards the middle of the semester, it gets a bit linguistics-heavy and it definitely helped me to have taken intro to ling. Prof. Anderson is brilliant and you can learn a lot if you pay attention and listen to his words. The workload is very manageable and the readings are really interesting. This class was huge this year, about 4x the size of last year, because it made it onto all the athlete lists but a lot of them got crushed on the short papers so it evens out. Also, the final paper is actually fairly fun to write. Overall, this course is recommended.",
    "Dont take this course, very awkward dynamic of topics and grading.",
    "This is an interesting course in which the students essentially learn how different animals communicate with each other in different ways and how these differ from humans. I would recommend as it is interesting and not too difficult.",
    "Relatively easy-- lectures can be a little boring, but the content of the class is actually kind of interesting.",
    "Good intro course. I would recommend it just know that the lectures will be a bit on the boring side sometimes.",
    "If you are a good writer and a Psych major, you should take this class. 5 two page papers and 1 eight to ten page paper.",
    "If you want a solid overview of animal communication from a linguistic perspective, that's just what this course is. The lectures are a little dry, but the writing assignments are interesting and the final paper is fun as long as you choose a topic you like.",
    "If you're already interested in this topic, then check it out and see if you can deal with Anderson's teaching style. There's so little work that it really makes it worth it.",
    "I would recommend it because I learned a lot about how animals communicate that would not be covered in most psychology or science courses. It was very interesting material.",
    "Interesting topic, good lectures though some are a bit slow at times. The essays are not too long and are manageable. In my opinion, choose to write a final paper rather than the take-home--you'll enjoy it a lot more.Take this course!",
    "This class was sick. Like 5 really easy 2 pages essays. You never have to go all you have to do is look at some slides before you write your paper. 8 page paper as the final isn't bad at all you have forever to do it.",
    "I would recommend it as a fun, random class, especially if psych\/linguistics isn't your major. It's pretty easy... you write five two-page papers that don't take very long, and then either a take-home final or 8-10 page research paper. I did the take-home final and it wasn't too hard. Class is kind of boring, and only about 30 out of 100 people went to lecture consistently, which made the class a bit of a joke.",
    "This is a very easy 5th class so take it if you need it for major requirements. With that being said, realize that this entire class is essentially a summary of Anderson's book, \"Dr. Dolittle's Delusion.\" You can literally learn the semester's worth of information just by spending 2-3 hours reading the book.",
    "It was very easy. I didn't find it particularly stimulating. I liked writing the final paper, but that was because you could write in on whatever you liked.",
    "VERY interesting subject material. Dull professor, although going to lecture is completely unnecessary if you've done the reading. Also a fairly easy class in terms of workload. Again all of the material is very interesting to the linguistically inclined, especially along the more sociohistorical lines.",
    "The class is definitely interesting, and not too difficult.",
    "Animal and Human Communication reviewed all sorts of animal communication, and touched on how those systems related to human language. I would recommend the course. The material is quite interesting, though lectures aren't always the most engaging.",
    "It's a pretty interesting course with a light workload. Recommended.",
    "This is a fairly easy course that covers interesting subject matter. There's a 2 page essay every other week or so, and a final 8 page essay. Professor Anderson's lecture style is a bit dry, but he wrote the book used for the class so he's very knowledgeable about the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Recommend for sure. Very intersting to write all the papers on the different topics and I see animals in a whole new light."
