    "An in depth look at the writings and times of Niccolo Machiavelli. Touches on everything from The Prince, The Discourses, Florentine Histories to Guicciardini, just to name a few. Midterm paper and final paper in classic seminar style. I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Ardito is a fabulous professor, and her knowledge of Machiavelli is just incredible. The level of preparation that went into each section was really wonderful. I would also highly recommend going to her office hours and just talking with her. It was at office hours that I learned the most.",
    "I would recommend this course. Machiavelli is constantly referenced in our culture, but few know anything other than he must be tricky or something, this course will go well beyond that.",
    "Great class!"
