    "An analysis of the technical structure of poetry and how it contributes to the tone and meaning of poems. I recommend this class to everyone who loves poetry and many people who don't think they love it--you will, after taking this class. Professor Stern is a delight and this class has changed the way I read and write poetry forever.",
    "Light work load, heavy intellectual load. It's the best combo ever.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Howard Stern is a brilliant and relaxed person, and this class is a VERY welcome respite from all the angry marxist angsty literature classes you might be tempted to take. The workload is super low, and you'll learn a lot about life and everything else. I usually hate European Literature and traditional poetry (just not edgy enough for me!) but Howard Stern brings out the beauty in everything he teaches. He's hilarious and engaging and this class rocked my world.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "This course and the professor who teaches it (Howard Stern) are absolutely delightful. It's a very laid back class and although it isn't a rigidly capped seminar, this semester it only had 11 or 12 students. In terms of assignments, you are required to write two papers, a midterm essay in which you do a close reading of a short poem and a longer final essay in which you focus more on the overall theme and story of a long poem. I am a junior and the last time I dealt with poetry in any form was in English AP in high school so I would say that this course is very accessible to non-English, non-Literature, non-Humanities majors. However, you do have to do a bit of reading to understand finer analytic points related to rhyme\/meter\/etc. Stern's lectures are very insightful and he leaves you with so many quotes that you just want to write down in a little notebook and carry around withyou all throughout life. We work on some very tough poems that aren't easily understood, but Stern is great about breaking them down and shedding light on their meaning. The syllabus may say that one class a week is devoted to lecture and the other class is devoted to discussion, but Stern pretty much lectures all throughout both sessions. Take the class! I was taking 5.5 credits this semester and this course was very manageable.",
    "It's a good course if you're interested in the formal aspects of poetry, either as a reader or as a writer. It's more lecture-based than discussion-based; it's a lot of fun to sit and listen to Stern lecture about the poems and whatever else he happens to talk about (especially the whatever else, which is often insightful and nearly always entertaining). There's not really that much discussion, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. You'll get out what you put in with regard to the readings. Professor Stern will, more than likely, make every class memorable. If you do not enjoy his speaking, you probably should pass on the course (though I don't understand how you could not enjoy the insights and moments of comedic gold he delivers).",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course, but only if you are going to consistently do the reading. It isn't a lot, but it takes some effort to understand the poems well enough on your own to make the lectures and discussions valuable.",
    "Relaxed seminar where you can read as much or little poetry as you want, and participate as much or little as you want. I would suggest taking a literature class beforehand, as I was confused by many Lit terms I had never heard of in my text-based\/close reading English classes. Howard Stern is awesome...very smart and entertaining in class. He always tries hard, and even when I was dead tired I was happy that I showed up to his class. Oh PS: never be late. It's kind of uncomfortable."
