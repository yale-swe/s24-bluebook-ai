   "comments": [
    "I really liked the material in this class. Before, I had taken MATH 115 and 120, which I realized were more focused in computational math. While there are computations in this class, too, I learned the importance of having an image associated with each concept and then polishing it further as we went along. When I was first introduced to concepts like vector spaces, subspaces and subsets, I was initially confused and had the wrong image about them, but the more we learnt and used such concepts and the more time I spent with the material, the better it felt. There are still questions I have about the material, but I am confident that, just like in this course, they are developed in deeper levels in other math classes.",
    "I learned how to do proofs, which is good, though not really why I took the course. I took the course because I wanted to learn linear algebra. I learned that too, but not as well as I'd have liked. We spent more work learning the proofs than actually learning the concepts, which may prove problematic later when I need to use the concepts. For someone more interested in pure\/theoretical math than I, this would be an ideal course.",
    "This course taught me more about taking a proof based approach to a topic that could easily be generalized into memorization and formulas. Definitely recommend if you are interested in higher level mathematics and truly understanding how everything in linear algebra fits together.",
    "I learned a ton through this course. I had never taken a linear algebra course before and was pleasantly surprised by its wonders. I learned a lot about matrices, transformations, and vector spaces. Even more, this class was my first exposure to proofs, which was and still is intimidating but I am grateful for the insights this class gave me about prospectively seeking a major in mathematics in the future.",
    "Really great class if you expect to take proof-based math classes in the future but have never been exposed to it. It goes at a quick pace and demands a lot out of the students, but in my experience that was the best way to the learn the material. The Professor and TA office hours and critical for those either with a weak mathematical background or are struggling with proofs. But for students unsure of their abilities, I would recommend at least shopping the class to get the vibe. If your semester permits, I would strongly recommend this class over Math 222.",
    "Obviously, I learned a lot of linear algebra, and how to do proof-based math. In addition to that, I have a better understanding of how the world works. Before I took this class, I didn't really understand what a dimension was; now, I think I do.",
    "This course is a great introduction to proofs as well as linear algebra. I previously had no experience with proofs, but feel rather comfortable with them now.",
    "I developed two sets of skills: First, an understanding of linear algebra and the central concepts involved in that; Second, a preliminary understanding of how to write and think of proofs in math.",
    "I already had a weak background on linear algebra, so I took this class in the hopes of firming up my understanding and learning more complex topics. I really feel I gained the first, but because the course is proof-based, it covers less ground than the applied class, so that's something to keep in mind.",
    "In this class, I learned the principles of both theoretical and applied linear algebra. (The course lies somewhere in between, though it's more theory heavy.) I also learned how to do mathematical proofs for the first time, which is a whole new way of thinking.",
    "Facility with linear algebra algorithms like solving a system of equations, inverting a matrix, taking a determinant, etc., and writing out proofs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths is the textbook. Prof. Qi is a strong professor and I was often amazed at how he could offer examples for certain concepts off the top of his head. Another strength is other students: it is one of the few classes where you learn from every question your peers ask. I, however, felt that the strongest aspect of this course was the TA. Andrei's sections proved very helpful for me and he would tirelessly insist for us to understand the material, so whenever we felt confused about some explanation, he would either repeat it providing more detail or use a different method.",
    "The strengths are that Prof. Qi is a lovely person and really puts his heart into teaching this. He'll meet with you whenever you need, he really wants you to learn things, and he even offered to FaceTime us while he was abroad during reading week if we needed help. Also, he helped us to understand how to prove things and what conditions were necessary to assert other conclusions. Its weakness was with the actual linear algebra. I feel like I need to take a Khan Academy on linear algebra now because my brain is so full of proofs and reasoning that I don't remember the actual equations and formulas for applications. To be fair, I should definitely have taken 222 since I'm more on the applied side, but I wanted to see how I liked proof-based, and it turns out that I don't really. But that's my fault\/learning, not the professor's or the course's. I would recommend not putting the quizzes right at the end of class. I had another class at 10:30 all the way across campus, and the quizzes would be given at about 10:12. Therefore I felt extremely rushed and was not able to do my best work. The lectures would tend to run over time in general, which is again problematic for people who have courses with required attendance directly afterwards. Also I would recommend doing more examples in class, as those of us who learn by example would really benefit from that. But overall, I think it's a good course for the kind of person who's interested in pure math.",
    "I wish this course was a 2 part year long course because I felt like we didn't cover many important topics and had to rush at the end to finish some material.",
    "The strength of this course were the teacher and the teaching assistant. They truly made the class engaging and enjoyable. Although they could be intimidating at times because everything seemed trivial to them. Nevertheless, they were always helpful. The Course followed a textbook linearly which helped with studying and working ahead for the course.",
    "I feel as though it was assumed that we knew more than we really did since not all students came from the same background but were allowed to take the course. I think the pre-requisites should either be more stringent or the class should start off at a slower pace covering more background material (assuming students have never been exposed to the notation used, terms, etc.)",
    "The class overall was great, but I feel like it could really benefit from having a course-based peer tutor who had previously taken the class to help especially at the beginning of the course.",
    "It was a great course, but could have been a bit more application based. You Qi still makes clear all the proofs and it's really interesting.",
    "The class was interesting, but the professor was a little too political for a linear algebra class. Multiple times throughout the semester he made fun of presidential candidates, which I found inappropriate.",
    "This is a pretty good class. The material is interesting, it's well-taught and the amount of homework is appropriate. This is one of the few classes where I always kept up with the material, even when there wasn't a test. I'm really bad at studying for things outside of class, but doing the problem sets was excellent review. I didn't have any trouble with any of the four pop quizzes that we had, even though obviously I didn't study for any of them. I do have a few suggestions for improving the course: -Make sure that students are familiar with all of the mathematical terms that are employed. For example, a lot of us didn't know what \"injective\", \"surjective\", and \"bijective\" meant, but the terms weren't defined and it was assumed that we would know them. I didn't even know what \"onto\" meant before taking this class, so I think it's important to explain those concepts. -It might be helpful to go a little bit slower when explaining certain difficult proofs, although I understand that there's only so much time and overall I think you managed time well.",
    "The course speeds up quite a bit halfway through, and I don't know if I was ready for that. Otherwise, it was quite solid. The last chapter (inner product spaces) was very hasty, and I can't say I learned that much.",
    "I thought it was a good course in the way it was structured. I thought it was a little bit rushed; in particular, I didn't like how homework on a subject was often due the day after we covered it in class. I also thought the last chapter (chapter 6) came out of nowhere, and there was no need to cover sections 6.5 or 6.8 (we could have allocated that time to other things much more efficiently). I like the teacher's notes and ways of teaching. I thought some of the concepts were needlessly abstract -- things like a Vandermonde matrix did not aid our understanding of topics but took up nearly half a class. I also didn't like that there weren't answer keys posted. I recognize that the teacher didn't like to suggest that there was \"one\" answer or way of doing things, but even for the True\/False questions, or for giving sample answers, I think that would have been helpful. Those aside, I thought it was very well taught!",
    "The course had a great deal of homework--which I understand because certainly it's necessary for any course to really drive points home--but I would have preferred the same time-investment in homework for fewer problems. For example, instead of the ~12-17 problems of varying difficulty we were typically assigned, I would have enjoyed having 5 extremely difficult proofs.",
    "This course was extremely well taught, and the material was presented at a good pace. The lectures were fantastic, and I actually enjoyed the tests. (I frequently learned something new on them.) I wish there were more application examples, but this is a relatively small concern.",
    "I liked the textbook, the lectures, and the overall organization and focus of the class, but my one complaint is that the homework sometimes got a bit ahead of the lectures.",
    "Given that the course covers pretty standard material, and that I learned the material, I thought it was pretty strong. One weakness was that some of the material near the end of the course felt a bit rushed; I would have liked to learn more about more advanced topics like quadratic forms. Another big weakness was that class was at 9:00 AM."

    "I would strongly recommend this class to any student. It is not just for people passionate about math, although this is an important aspect. There were engineering, economics, biology and applied math majors in the class. It is a beautiful class, because it is just the opposite for computational calculus and it explains linear algebra at at a deeper level. The material was VERY new to me and I felt I learned many things and even though I was not the best, I never felt that being the best was important in this course. What Prof. Qi always emphasized was spending time with the material and asking questions, which I really enjoyed.",
    "If you're into pure math and proofs, then yes, by all means, this course would be delightful for you. If you're interested in applying linear algebra elsewhere, you will regret, just as I did, taking this instead of 222. I was taking this in part to determine if I liked proof-based math. The answer is no. But now I feel somewhat behind in linear algebra. Prof. Qi is lovely and really puts his heart into teaching this. He'll meet with you whenever you need, he really wants you to learn things, and he even offered to FaceTime us while he was abroad during reading week if we needed help. Also, he helped us to understand how to prove things and what conditions were necessary to assert other conclusions. Be warned, there are pop quizzes, and they usually get \"popped\" at about two minutes before class ends, so if you have another class right after this one, be prepared to be late to it (the lectures tended to run over time as well). The final was significantly more difficult than the midterm and had a lot of proofs. Again, if you're not sold on doing a lot of proofs, I'd recommend steering clear. The homeworks are really long and take a really long time. The good thing is that a high proportion of people get A's, or at least they did this year, so while the material is tough it shouldn't kill your GPA if you put in the work--and it's a lot with the problem sets relative to the actual difficulty of the material. I complain that the problem sets were not that instructive in teaching what we actually needed to know. You'll need to read the book to do them.",
    "Yes, highly recommend taking this over MATH 222.",
    "For someone looking for a rigorous introduction for proofs, but does not want the weekly grind for problem sets that math 230 presents, I would recommend this class too. For someone who has an interest in pursuing a math major, this would be helpful for too.",
    "This class was very difficult and felt like I was behind from day 1 because a solid foundation was not made - assumed that you knew more than some of us actually did, making the semester a bit shaky from the start.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class over MATH 222 and for anyone who expects to take more proof-based math classes in the future. This class taught me how to defend my ideas and rationalize my thought process, skills that I believe will be crucial toward my success in the future. Spending all my time in the more computational realm of math, I thought this class was particularly illuminating a",
    "This class really opened the world of math to me, and for the first time I was able to appreciate the beauty of math. I recommend this course to anyone who wants a challenge and wants to see if they love math or not.",
    "If you study any STEM discipline (I'm a biologist) I would recommend that you take linear algebra, because you need it to understand the world. For example, we talk about dimensions all the time--2D space, 3D space, etc. But what really is a dimension? I'd never really thought about that before I took this class, and now I feel like I really understand it. It's already proven to be relevant to a bunch of my other classes, like physical chemistry (If you take it, linear algebra explains that describing a system in terms of vibrational variables vs. rotational variables just requires a change of basis). If you're going to take linear algebra and you are interested in WHY it works as well as the mechanics of using it, I would recommend taking this class. Prof. Qi is a pretty good lecturer. He's clear, helpful, funny, and really emphasizes the importance of understanding why things work. This class is a great intro to proof-based math for anyone who doesn't have too much experience with that. Math 225 is probably a little bit more work than average. Although the early problem sets are easy, some of the later ones can take quite a while (~10 hours?) However, it's quite manageable, and the problem sets are actually really, really helpful in understand the material. In general, if you really try on the homeworks, you can't help but keep up with the material and you'll do well in the class. Grading is generally fair. Homeworks are only 10% of your grade, and are scored pretty leniently (i.e. if you get a couple true\/false questions wrong they don't take off points). Pop quizzes are 20%, but are pretty easy and you should do well if you keep up with the homework. The midterm and final make up the rest of your grade. Neither exam was super hard (the homework problems are substantially harder), but be careful to avoid careless mistakes. The textbook for this class is actually quite good. I'd recommend getting a copy if you can--you'll use it a lot. There are free PDFs online, but it really made my life much easier to have a physical version.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student who has never taken linear algebra or a proof-based math course. It is a much superior to alternative to Math 222, but you have to be prepared to put the time into it as it DOES take a lot of time to understand the psets, and you WILL get stuck on a lot of proofs if it's your first time doing them.",
    "It's a tough but good class that makes you think rigorously about linear algebra, building up the field from scratch. Definitely worth it, even though I don't think I got all too good a grade!",
    "If you would like to have a solid conceptual understanding of linear algebra, I would recommend this class--particularly if You Qi is teaching. If you are hoping to learn more problem-solving or applied techniques rather than proofs, keep in mind that this is proof-based, which I personally loved but I realize isn't everyone's preference.",
    "This course is fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone interested in mathematics or who is required to take linear algebra.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who needed linear algebra for what they were studying, but not just as a general interest class or for non-STEM people. I think that's just the nature of the material itself though; it doesn't much reflect on the teaching\/execution.",
    "Take it if you have to, but keep in mind that the professor's teaching style makes or breaks the course. You Qi didn't do it for me, even though he was a very nice person. The lectures were bland, rigid, and often difficult to follow, so I ended up trying (unsuccessfully) to teach myself out of the textbook."
