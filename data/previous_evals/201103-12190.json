   "comments": [
    "A good introduction for someone who is unfamiliar with the Balkans situation, but, for someone (like me) who knows the basics going in, a chance to go much, much deeper and think more critically about the whole mess. As far as I'm concerned, must-take course for majors in the Slavic Department.",
    "Absolutely. Its a great class to take for anyone. No previous knowledge of the region is necessary as long as you are interested in it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The grading is completely fair, the workload is manageable, and both the TA and professor are great at their job (and very nice).",
    "I would totally recommend the class if you are interested in Nationalism, Language or the Balkans. You not only get to know a fascinating region, but also get articulate in theories of nationalism, linguistics and their inter-relations,",
    "Prof. Greenberg is amazing. His lecturing style is funny and authoritative at the same time (because he's an expert in the field - couldn't avoid citing him in the final paper). (Our TA, Maria, is amazing too.) The readings are definitely manageable. The course is even more enjoyable if you like participating in class discussions and engaging with the concepts with fellow students (and Prof. Greenberg will make many insightful comments).",
    "Take it, but would be helpful to have historical background in the area.",
    "Yes! Take it take it take it! Interesting subject matter, and it almost tempted me back to political science. It's how a seminar should be taught. A few of the readings can be a teensy bit dry, but you won't mind.",
    "Take it! This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Greenberg is hilarious and brilliant, and class is almost never boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students. Do it only if you are really interested in language issues or in the Balkans. You'll definitely come out learning a lot about Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and a lot of other countries that you probably will not have studied elsewhere!",
    "Good class, with a linguistic influence. As someone who came in with no interest in or knowledge of language, I found it to be both interesting and relevant. Great class!",
    "Great introduction to the history and politics (especially, but by no means exclusively, language politics) of the Balkans. Professor Greenberg is awesome, enthusiastic, and (obviously) very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this if you have any interest in the Balkans.",
    "A great class! Very interesting topics and there isn't too much work. Professor Greenberg is lots of fun, engaging, and very helpful.",
    "Absolutely! Really loved it, wish I'd taken more advantage of the blogging."
