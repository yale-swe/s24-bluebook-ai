   "comments": [
    "I learned the material extremely well as a result of the clear instruction. I now feel confident taking any sort of line or surface integral, and more generally approaching problems involving vectors and vector fields. I also learned quite a bit about partial derivates and two and three-variable integrals. Outside of just basic knowledge, this class also helped me learn how to problem solve and think creatively when faced with problems unlike those I had seen before.",
    "This class further improved my spatial reasoning and calculation skills.",
    "Helpful as a post- single variable calc class. Tests too hard. Needs a curve. Miki is awesome.",
    "This was a fantastic course that was super helpful in learning multivariable calculus. Line integrals make so much more sense now.",
    "I greatly improved my appreciation of calculus as well as my ability to handle mathematical problem solving. I also have a greater appreciation for the application and beauty of mathematics.",
    "I learned the basic concepts and useful techniques in solving multivariable calculus problems. I also further realized that I really like math.",
    "Manipulation of functions of multiple variables, extensive experience with vector fields and integrating vector fields over space curves, surfaces, and solids. Most of the second half of the course was dedicated to line integrals, surface integrals, and double and triple integrals.",
    "This course was challenging for me so I had to learn a lot about resilience in spirit. I also learned more than I ever thought I would need to know about math. It was challenging but I am proud of what I learned",
    "I furthered my knowledge in mathematics.",
    "In Math 120, I learned calculus of 2 and 3 variables. We started with the basics of vectors and moved through 3D lines, surfaces, and solids, double and triple integrals, line integrals, surface integrals, and various related theorems.",
    "This course effectively helped me grasp three dimensional thinking and also helped further my grasp of calculus. By providing a solid understanding of multivariable calculus, this course helped shed light on aspects of other topics such as Gauss' theorems in physics.",
    "Learning how to visualize how math ties into three-dimensional spaces was pretty mind-blowing. Learning how to use specific theorems (like Stokes', Green's, and Divergence Theorems) was useful, but the most valuable part was learning how to logically think through surfaces and parametrization.",
    "Learned multivariable calculus and its various applications in Physics and Electromagnetics. Developed the knowledge of extending theorems of lower dimensions (1D and 2D) to higher dimensions (3D and beyond)."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that the information is delivered extremely clearly and concisely, and that the professors (at least my professor) were always open to helping students when they struggled with certain topics. The only weakness of the class is that it can sometimes feel a bit fast-paced, due to the amount of information we have to cover in only a semester.",
    "The material is challenging, the problem sets are long, and the tests are difficult, but this course is not impossible. It is extremely well taught and there are many ways to get extra help.",
    "I honestly have the best section and the best instructor (yay Miki she is the best!) but as far as I know some students in this course are really struggling because their section instructors are not as good at explaining things well. So maybe find a more balanced group of teachers?",
    "Strengths is everything except I feel like more review time could be spent at the end of term thinling about when to use each theorem.",
    "The course is organized and delivered extremely well. The only issue is that there is so much material that it must be covered quite quickly. This can be difficult to process, but I think is ultimately beneficial. It paints a really neat picture of multivariable calculus.",
    "The class focuses more on the application of theorems. Although there are other classes that focuses on proving these theorems, mentioning the proofs briefly in class would facilitate understanding. My instructor, in fact, did briefly introduce some of the proofs and I found that to be very helpful.",
    "I thought the course was well-organized with clearly defined content, and the tests were fair, even though they were hard, and I thought grading on the tests was sometimes unnecessarily punitive. The homework assigned prepared us well for the exams and was reasonable. If you are completely comfortable doing the homework problems, the tests should be okay. Having 90% of your course grade ride on exams is quite stressful, though, and I wish they did something to alleviate that: a higher percentage weight for homework, a class participation grade, another midterm exam (there were 2), etc. Also, half the practice exams had answers (like \"3 pi\"), but not solutions (the work to get to the answer), so they were pretty useless unless you got exactly the right answer, since you'd never know where you went wrong. I wish the practice exams had all included solutions, and I also wish there had been more practice exams I feel I would have done better with more exam practice as opposed to practice out of the textbook, which I used instead.",
    "I really thought everything was great. Miki was fantastic",
    "This course was taught really well and the assignments were really helpful. It could be improved by having a more collaborative classroom. Rather than speeding through material.",
    "The course is a very difficult one and it is extremely fast paced. It would do better to possibly slow down the pace and focus on topics for longer periods of time.",
    "I think the problem sets provide just the right amount of practice to learn and cement the material taught in class. I never felt like the homework assigned was busy work. I also appreciate the strong framework of support available to students-- with the combination of office hours and peer tutors there was almost always someone on the clock to answer questions.",
    "Because there are only two midterms throughout the year, and each midterm only has ~6 questions, a great deal of the final grade depends on these two tests. It would be nice to have more opportunities to demonstrate one's understanding of the course material.",
    "The instructor makes or breaks the course. Miki was amazing and I'm very glad I had her, but I also heard from my friends that they had bad experiences from other instructors. Although I never used peer tutors, I heard they were amazing.",
    "The course requires a huge amount of time outside of class, which is not necessarily something that can be fixed since it is just a result of the very extensive curriculum.",
    "The strength of this course is that the materials are well-established, and have been taught at various schools for many years. The skill we learn is relatively more technical and there lacks a more practical element to it to tell us why what we learn is important and how we can apply it to the areas we pursue in the future.",
    "The strengths are that the class is organized very well. You can never miss a deadline since homeworks are due at the same increments every week. The tests should be curved, though."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. There is no doubt that it's extremely informative and that it serves as a great foundation for anyone seeking to take more math classes in their Yale career.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who excelled at math in high school and have an interest in learning a multivariable approach to calculus. Multivariable calculus is a very useful topic to understand because it applies to a lot of practical life. But this class is challenging and will require many hours of studying to do well on the exams.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students, provided that they enter the lottery and are assigned to Miki's section. She is really cool, and this class is really what you need to satisfy most of the STEM major prerequisites. So go for it! But if you do not have Miki, then I cannot comment because my instructor is Miki.",
    "Yes, because it's required for most STEM majors (like me).",
    "No unless you truly need the math 120 credit.",
    "Loved it. Take Miki!!!",
    "I definitely recommend the course, great introduction to multivariable caclulus!",
    "I would recommend this course to whoever wants to learn multivariable calculus systematically.",
    "Most people take this course because it is a prerequisite to a broad range of majors, so a recommendation isn't really relevant since you have to take the class. If you don't have to take it but are really excited about learning how to integrate vector fields over curves and surfaces, take this class, but I wouldn't take it just to get a QR requirement out of the way, since it's challenging stuff and a fairly narrow range of topics. My instructor was Miki (Marketa Havlickova), and I'd highly recommend choosing her section if you can she's a great teacher and very, very knowledgeable. I got the sense she explains things more clearly than some of the other teachers of the course. Note: if you did well in BC, you are prepared for this class. You don't need to be able to integrate complicated functions, so if you don't remember how to do that, that's okay. Most of the concepts are new anyway.",
    "Very much so, as long as you get miki. We had a sub one day and it was one of the other lecturers and I felt the quality of teaching was clearly inferior.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have an interest in math. You do not need to be a math genius but you do need to put forth effort and care about your learning.",
    "Only if it is required for their major.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student if they enjoy\/are interested in math and if they feel relatively comfortable with single-variable calculus. The workload is not intense-- only one problem set per week, which usually took me 3-6 hours to complete. I did not find that I needed to do many extra practice problems beyond the assigned homework to learn the material, although I did make use of office hours and peer tutoring, which were very helpful resources. The exams were difficult but manageable, and the practice tests gave a good idea of what to expect on the actual test. I must note that I was extremely lucky to have Miki (Professor Havlickova) as my teacher-- she is an engaging, clear, and thorough lecturer, and whenever I went to her office hours I felt like my understanding improved immensely. Some of my friends in other sections did not have experiences that were quite as positive, so I would definitely advise anyone considering taking the course to pay close attention to teacher reviews.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody thinking of majoring in a STEM related topic. The techniques and uses of multivariable calculus can be very useful in many other topics such as physics or engineering. The course is also taught very efficiently and concisely, focusing on the most fundamental parts of multivariable calculus.",
    "MATH 120 is a necessary evil. You learn a lot of useful concepts like parametrization and vector field integrals, but it's painful. It starts off pretty easy but then gets difficult and busy about a month into the course. The concepts themselves are pretty cool, but it gets repetitive after a while. With that said, if you have friends to go through MATH 120 with you, it's going to be a good bonding experience.",
    "Although I technically did not need this course for my major or any sort of requirement, I decided to take it because it's very relevant and applicable to other STEM classes that I will need to take in the future. I am really glad I made it through -- I do feel as though I learned a ton, but it definitely took a lot of effort. I'm sure there are plenty of people in the class who understood the material by just doing the problem sets and going to class, but I personally needed to do a lot of studying on my own to finally grasp it. If you need to take it or think that you might benefit from knowing the material, go ahead, but be ready to put in a lot of time and work. Looking back, I spent more time on this class than on any other class I've taken at Yale so far, so that should definitely tell you something. On a final note, Having Prof. Havlickova as my instructor is probably what made the class worth it for me. Her lectures are so clear and easy to follow (despite the difficulty of the material), and she is always so nice and accommodating -- I am not sure I would have understood the material at all (even with my hours and hours spent studying outside of class) if it hadn't been for her teaching style.",
    "I would be neutral about recommending this course. For sure multivariate calculus is an important basis skill to learn for students planning to go into STEM fields, but the class itself is not very interesting and I did not enjoy the class as much as I enjoyed other classes I took this semester. Some students I knew had a lot of difficulties with the psets even if they had math background in high school. The quality of teaching varies a lot by instructors.",
    "Yes, I would. The class is very challenging but the material is very interesting and the class is taught in a very organized manner."
