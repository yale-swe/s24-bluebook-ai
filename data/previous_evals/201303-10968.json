    "This is the worst class I have ever taken, including high school. As long as they are still using SmartPhysics, don't do this to yourself. I honestly almost dropped the class even though I had an A, because it's basically a picture of everything that is wrong with big university lecture classes. Nobody cares about how you're doing, the textbook is laughably bad, the TAs are generally pretty rude and the lectures aren't great. I cannot believe I am paying money to take this class. One of the worst experiences of my life hands down",
    "I only recommend it to a physics major or someone who needs this for a major requirement.",
    "It's probably a required course. I didn't love it but you'll make it.",
    "If looking for a moderately interesting intro class in Physics or needing to take a year for a major requirement, consider Physics 180 as your option. It lacks the medical applications of 170 and leads to a purer understanding of the concepts at hand. Additionally, the class doesn't have a textbook, but instead runs on a series of online video-lectures called smartphysics. This program is an excellent tool (possibly what a better-funded khanacademy would look like) and I enjoy the teaching style a lot. Because the online work is so comprehensive, lectures often seem to be redundant, but the demos are many and it's easy to draw a working knowledge of physics from what's offered.",
    "I would recommend that you take this only if you need it as a pre-requisite. For students who have performed well in AP Physics C, this course will seem very redundant. It is almost unnecessary to go to the lectures, and the book used is pretty mediocre. I'm not saying that this is a terrible experience, but at a school like Yale, there are many more valuable classes to spend your time on.",
    "It is difficult even if you have a physics background, but the work is worth what you get out of the class. Stay on top of the psets, and ask questions when you need to.",
    "Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. There was no consistency in the material covered by smartphysics, lectures, psets, and tests. All of them covered different types of problems which made the midterms and final horrible. There needs to be a calculus based physicsclass that is ONLY FOR NON SCIENCE MAJORS! I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to be a non science major yet I can't actually learn physics well because the little bit of physics that is actually taught is taught for engineers, not for normal people. If the class was structured and based around smart physics in the psets and tests, and the lectures focused on going deeper into the material covered in online videos instead of going over the videos again in class, this would be a better class. But right now, and with my other experiences with the sciences at Yale, this is the worst part of Yale, hands down. Professor Barrett is a horrible professor. He never answered my nearly 10 emails to him regarding my grade, material, the midterms, etc. I approached him in class and I was pushed away. I'm sure he is knowledgeable about this topic, but maybe he should teach at a higher level to only engineering majors. He is the worst professor I've ever had and probably ever will have.",
    "This course sucks if you've never taken physics before. Be prepared to never be helped if you ask and to constantly be frustrated with Professor Barrett. It's too bad that I could not be taught the material properly because I actually enjoyed learning the new subject area, but the inconsistency in material that was on the p-sets to what was on the Smart Physics program online and the exams made this course impossible for me to master.",
    "I would recommend this course if you don't feel like you have a strong enough base in math for a higher level course.",
    "It's physics. Pretty standard. Take it if you need to. I took it for fun, and it was a little bit fun at times, but never like \"oh wow I love this!\" type fun. Homework got tedious.",
    "I'd recommend it as a prerequisite for engineering majors for a basic physics\/mechanics background. It's a lot like AP Physics B.",
    "Physics 180 is exactly what you make of it. You can slack off in the big lecture and get by, r you can really learn something. I wasn't a huge fan of the Smart Physics required videos, but only because they seemed unrelated to what was covered in class. If they were to go in deep with the whole smart physics curriculum, the course would be a lot better.",
    "Useful course to understand physics principles. Would recommend.",
    "I would definitely take this over the other PHYS levels.",
    "Summary: watch online videos, do checkpoints, do online homework, go to class and see the same material, do written assignments.I would recommend it as a first physics class because the videos are effective in demonstrating key ideas.",
    "This class is a great into to Physics. It's interesting and easy to learn especially with the new SmartPhysics curriculum. You won't get lost in this class, which tends to be a major problem in science classes.",
    "This class will teach you college physics. That's about all I can say about it.",
    "This class single handedly ruined my entire Fall semester. I did not learn anything it lecture, felt that lecture always was a waste of my time. The written HW compared to the online HW compared to the midterms\/final were all so different. The written HW was indecipherable hand-written questions usually so confusing that the professor had to send multiple emails to clarify his questions. The Online HW was okay the most manageable of all the assignments in my opinion. The midterms and final had so much more math and vectors compared to all other assignments that we had been doing the entire semester that it through off your understanding of the material at times because you were unprepared as to how to approach it from such a different perspective. This class cannot be taught effectively lecture style to people with no exposure to physics because the AP 5 physics people in the class who should be taking 200 make the professor feel there is a good level of understanding when secretly many of these people are just already veyr familiar with the material.",
    "Hmm, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m somewhat indifferent to this class. I love physics, and I think this class could teach it in a better way. They switched to using \u00e2\u0080\u0098SmartPhysics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this year, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also somewhat indifferent to. The way the course is set up really made you stay on top of everything. Tedious, but I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than doing everything last minute? Twice a week, you had to watch\/click through ~10 minutes worth of video that taught you the information and do \u00e2\u0080\u0098checkpoint\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions. Twice a week, you had to do online psets. Twice a week, you had to go to lecture to be present for \u00e2\u0080\u0098clicker questions\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Once a week, you had a written pset, and once a week, attend an optional (may be mandatory in the future) discussion section. There were weekly study halls the night before written psets were due. I wish they had thought through the material more thoroughly at the beginning.. we never got to thermo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and spent a biiit too long on basic mechanics and rotational motion. I felt like I learned more from the SmartPhysics videos than from lecture, but you had to go to lecture for participation points. Lecture consisted mostly of convoluted, drawn-out derivations and rambling, along with demos that were relevant, but not necessarily explained in terms of what was being taught. Sometimes I felt like it would have been more productive to just play the SmartPhysics videos in class. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do fine in this class if you have a relatively solid background in physics.Professor Barrett is a little all over the place.. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enthusiastic, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he knows what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that great at teaching that knowledge to students.The TA for the section I signed up for was great for the sections that I went to. I can see the benefits of having section because practice is always good, but it was just a bit tedious having to specially walk up the hill to just do more practice problems\u00e2\u0080\u00a6",
    "Eh it was whatever. Definitely not good, but not too terrible. The weekly problem sets took some time but were manageable, and the two midterms and final were alright.",
    "I don't recommend this course because they've switched to a new sysetem called SmartPhysics, take 170 instead.",
    "You probably have to take physics. There are many different introductory physics classes. 180 is your traditional calculus based physics class. I would recommend this over 170 even for bio majors and pre meds as a good foundation in traditional physics is useful and can be applied to the biological sciences later. It also lines up with the lab much better. Overall I think you should take this over 170 even if you are a bio major as I took physio at the same time and many of the physics concepts were easily applied to physio even without the bio emphasis in the class while also learning traditional mechanics.",
    "if you actually pay attention to the class and do the work, its a really easy class",
    "Great class, not a lot of work and you will learn the physics pretty well (especially if you some background in Mechanics)",
    "Professor Barrett is an ebullient man and a snappy dresser. I believe very strongly that if I was able to spend more time with him, we could become the best of friends. I also enjoyed when he played with his big tennis ball and used the fire extinguisher; such interactions were invaluable in nurturing my love of science. However, physics is a dreadful course and this was too much for me to overcome. I wish very strongly I had not had to take this class, as I hate physics with tremendous passion. The final was particularly ruinous! Now, it is finished; I can only hope that a merciful, fair, common sense approach was taken towards curving the final or I am in trouble!",
    "I did not like that Barrett taught directly from Smart Physics. I didn't like Smart Physics.",
    "I did not really enjoy Physics 180. I was thinking about an engineering major before the class but now I am definitely turned off from all science majors. But they may just be me.",
    "Take it if you need it. A lot of people are pre-med\/engineers in this class it seemed to me.",
    "It was a solid intro on classical mechanics. If you're premed and thinking about taking this class or 170, I would recommend this class since it's a more traditional class where you learn the concepts of classical mechanics instead of focusing on a lot of its applications.",
    "I found physics hard and required constant maintenance. Additionally, I wish we could ask questions during tests.",
    "It was okay, and I'd choose this over the other intro physics lectures offered. I took AP physicsb in high school and it was pretty similar to that.",
    "I would recommend it if you just want to learn the basics and don't want it to be that hard.",
    "Don't take it with Barrett if possible. A lot of demos that take up class time, but then again, class time is mostly devoted to regurgitating the SmartPhysics material that you were supposed to have learned the night before in the pre-lecture. The main reason for going to class is to click in with your clicker so you get that 10% of your grade or whatever it is. If you have to do it for pre-med or major requirements, it's not super hard, it just isn't enjoyable. Watch out for the problem sets -- the exams aren't awful, but the problem sets really can be quite tough.",
    "Terrible. Avoid at all costs if PHYS 200 is taught by a competent professor. It is an embarrassing showing of what a physics class is and I feel robbed for taking it. I did learn a lot of physics but that was from using MIT Open Courseware and learning from another book on my own. It made me put a lot more effort into the class than was needed and it genuinely pissed me off.",
    "Challenging intro level physics course. A lot of material is covered, which makes it high paced and you have many assignments due each week. The new smart physics book is good.",
    "if you're good at physics\/math, you'll do well. if not, who knows. basically high school physics. smartphysics is annoying but helpful given the fact that barrett's lame",
    "You'll probably have to teach yourself everything for the course. Barrett is a great guy, but lecture is really not helpful.",
    "Take it if you have to, and it's not hard. But just because it's easy doesn't mean you will get a good grade. The curve is absolutely ridiculous and Professor Barrett's lectures simply don't add anything to your understanding.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably need an intro physics course for your major requirements \/ pre med. PHYS 180 seems better organized than the 170 track, where many of the pre-meds go, and is pretty standard as intro-mechanics courses run. Barrett is very responsive to emails and very friendly. Lectures are of questionable usefulness but discussion sections and study halls are great if you're stuck. May contain a few people who belong in 200 but want an easy class.",
    "The lectures are not the most engaging thing in the world, but with the adoption of the Smartphysics online course material, you can basically learn all you need without the lectures. The tests are not too difficult.",
    "Physics 180 is not too much work, but it is not very well taught. The professor does demonstrations and makes class fun though. The expectations regarding midterms\/finals for this class is not very clear, but that's not too different from other physics classes either. Overall, I'd say take this class over 170 b\/c you'll actually learn some physics in this class.",
    "take it from the other teacher -- or, if you don't need the credit but just wanna learn physics, buy the paperback smartphysics book that has typos in it because that is the class",
    "Easy if you've had Physics in high school.",
    "Aa. Do not take this class unless you have to. Barrett is boring and unhelpful to the extreme, and though not difficult, the class is quite tedious and a pain in the workload.",
    "Make sure you shop all the different levels in the beginning. You won't be penalized, and it's worth it to be in a course that won't bore or overwhelm you.",
    "Physics 180 was a decent physics class. The professor's lectures didn't always match up with SmartPhysics, which was really annoying. However, the SmartPhysics system did seem to work quite well, although it was pretty exhausting to have so many Physics assignments all week long. The TFs were all very helpful and enthusiastic, and there really were many avenues to receive help outside of lecture. I thought the midterms were fair. The final exam not so much.",
    "Professor Barrett is entertaining, but I took maybe three lines of notes every class. I did get my readings done for other classes, though, so that's a positive. Make at least one friend so you can go over psets together. You'll be fine, just make sure you use all of the resources available if you are having trouble teaching yourself.",
    "PHYS 180 is really a course designed for students who have not taken AP physics C in high school. If you got a 4 or 5 on the AP exam, you'll be quite bored. So for premeds, if you don't really care about learning physics, then I guess you can just take it again, cuz it should be an easy A. If you have any desire to really push yourself intellectually though, I really suggest you try 260 or 200 (200 isn't really that bad).",
    "Physics 180 is enjoyable and you earn a lot. However, I thought the curve as always pretty steep. The professor is really good at explaining things in an uncomplicated way. I thought the workload was much greater just because there was always something due. Also, I enjoyed the demonstrations we always had during class.",
    "I would recommend this class over 200 but would say that lecture is almost useless if you do the prelectures. I thought that the material was really interesting.",
    "Easier than PHYS 170 thanks to smartPhysics, which really helps you learn the material well.",
    "Boring class, but fairly straightforward. Better watch out for that second midterm though!",
    "I would say this is a basic introduction to college physics and that it is on the lighter side in terms of complexity. There is virtually no multivariable calculus or any difficult math in this class. I would only recommend this if someone has never taken physics before and doesn't want to major in it or if someone wants to take and easy physics class as a prerequisite because their other math or physics classes are very difficult.",
    "It's good and manageable if you've had AP or honors physics before. It's a nice step down from a 200 level class but not too much of a step down if you like physics like I do. Be prepared to get a little help outside of class because you probably won't get your questions answered very well in lecture (but I would say that about any lecture). Very good TFs. A good coverage of important topics in physics.",
    "Take it if you have to. Sean Barrett is a lively professor, but his teaching skills aren't the best. The demonstrations are interesting especially as the semester progresses. I was not a fan of the smartphysics online system at all. It really helps to have some background in physics for this course, otherwise it will be a struggle. Its not that the exams or homeworks are difficult, its just that things aren't taught very well.",
    "Physics 180 is a standard introductory Physics class. It covers a lot of what is covered in AP Physics B and some concepts from AP Physics C. I have heard the pests in this class is much easier than those in Physics 170. However, the exams are hard to get above average on, so take this class only if you have a strong Physics background. Professor Barrett does cool demos, but they don't exactly help you solve problems on the exams.",
    "Take this course if you have to. Smartphysics is a bit of a pain. I would get used to doing all of the week's work the weekend before its due. Overall, I put a lot of time into this class but ended up getting killed by the final anyway. :(",
    "If you've never been exposed to physics before, you will definitely have to work harder than other students. The SmartPhysics can be frustrating, so try to find a decent online textbook to supplement your studies.",
    "Phys180 is an intro physics course that probably covers Phys B from high school, and some new stuff such as fluids and fluid statics. This class is not calc-based. The problem sets are not that bad and the material itself is not that hard, but some concepts may be confusing and the probems on the midterm and final are kind of confusing and lengthy. Overall a good course though!",
    "Physics 180 is just a general Physics course, but Professor Barrett provides a lot of different opportunities to learn the material. The SmartPhysics Prelectures are incredibly useful and easy to do, while the actual lectures provide some awesome demonstrations. Totally would recommend this class if you are choosing between Physics classes.",
    "Take it if you think (like me) that you want to get your concepts cleared before you move to more advanced physics (I had done physics for 4 years before this but still did 180) or if you've never done physics before. Otherwise do Phys 260. Don't even think about 200, it's horrible",
    "It's a good course. There are some cool in-class demonstrations and the class is enjoyable.",
    "This class is poorly taught. SMARTPHYSICS is the worst. It would be fine if it was supplementary but what is the point of watching prelectures that ARE THE EXACT SAME as the lectures? All the examples in class were from smartphysics, as were the powerpoints yet the tests were not. The tests were similar to tests in the past which was the only redeeming quality of this class and then BAM the final comes from left field. You probably have to take this class. It's not that hard just disappointing.",
    "I took Physics 180 over 170 because I wanted a broader understanding of the material. After a semester, I think I made the wrong decision. Physics 180 teaches a very plug-and-chug method of physics. Professor Barrett's in-class demonstrations are fun to watch but didn't add a whole lot to my understanding of the material. Smartphysics, the online textbook, was tedious and not all that helpful (though it does force you to practice with the material). Overall, I would say take 170 or 200 instead of 180.",
    "If you have to take physics, I definitely recommend taking Phys 180. It is MUCH MORE fun than your regular physics class, and the materials are not too hard to follow as long as you do all the assigned homeworks and lectures. There needs to be quite an amount of self-teaching, but smart physics makes this easier. You may have to do some extra problems from more traditional textbooks such as haliday.",
    "A solid introduction to basic physics, although the online homework is annoying. Do not take this class if you've already taken AP Physics B and C in high school, however--you'll find that the pace of the class is too slow.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you've never taken AP physics. It's not too difficult. Don't take if you want a challenging physics class.",
    "I had never taken physics in high school, so I was obviously apprehensive about taking it for the first time at Yale. By the end of the semester, I found myself not only doing well in physics, but genuinely loving it. Professor Barrett is incredibly helpful, hilarious, and engaging when teaching. There is a heavy collaborative atmosphere at the homework study halls, and everyone is more than willing to help one another with difficult problem sets. I am sure that everything I learned that didn't come from the lectures came from the study halls. This class can be difficult from time to time, but there are plenty of resources available to help.",
    "If you have high school physics, don't waste your time with 170. Take 180 and you'll be mostly prepared. Weekly problem sets (drop one), two midterms, and a cumulative final. Mostly what you'd expect from an intro science lecture. Be prepared for several tedious lectures. This was the first year we used the SmartPhysics (Google it...) system for prelectures and post-class online homeworks (in addition to written Psets). Professor Barrett is fine and likable although he can sometimes lose track of time or start late.",
    "Most students who take this class take it because they have to. I was one of these students, so I wouldn't recommend it but you may not have a choice.",
    "A lot of day to day work but you learn a lot of physics so is rewarding. Fun if you like the material.",
    "Classic physics, straight up.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You will regret it, since Professor Barrett is not a good teacher. Take 170, or challenge yourself and take 200.",
    "Take it, but really it's a course taken as a pre-req. Class was well taught, and you won't find many qualms with it (except maybe the strict grading curve).",
    "I would say it's an easier, non-calculus based version of AP Physics. People who've placed higher should consider shopping 260 if they don't want a gut class.",
    "Its definitely tough but definitely doable. You need to keep on top of things or you'll get lost, but it also won't consume all your time. I'd recommend it because i find it interesting. I would just say stick to studying past tests and exams: thats the best way to prepare",
    "It's not a bad course but unless you have to take it, it may not be very enjoyable.",
    "Yes, smartPhysics is the real teacher. The thin book and videos makes its easy to pick up the concepts. The curve is high, so maybe a lot of students had a physics background.",
    "It's intro physics. Either you have to take it, or you don't."
