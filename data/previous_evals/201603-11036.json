    "My writing skills improved incredibly by taking this class.",
    "Learned a general history of Western Europe (and the surrounding land, when applicable) from 300-1500. Personally, I learned a great deal about the origins of my faith (Catholicism) both from the course and the research I conducted for my final paper.",
    "A very interesting and insightful overview of the Middle Ages, presented by an extremely passionate lecturer. Half of the course focuses on improving writing skills, which is helpful.",
    "Not as much as I think I should have. I think this course was very disorganized, it didn't feel like anything was integrated into some overall framework or anything of the sort. It made everything feel very disjointed and particular.",
    "I learned a lot about how to make my writing focused and concise.",
    "Not only did I learn a lot about medieval history, but I also think that my writing improved dramatically because of this course.",
    "Reading and analyzing historical texts.",
    "The skill to write a history paper.",
    "I improved my ability to read and understand texts in translation. I also learned a lot about how to learn history, as I hadn't taken many history classes at Yale before. I felt as though I left the class with a much better general understanding of the middle ages. I also improved my writing abilities and learned how to write more concisely."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are fantastic, passionate teaching and the extremely helpful focus and improving your writing. Weakness would be too much course material to fully absorb through the readings, but the lectures are very easy to follow and are awesome!",
    "The course didn't have a lot of structure, which was both good and bad, as it forced you to take a lot of responsibility, but didn't offer a ton of opportunity to engage.",
    "I really enjoyed lecture and section. I thought it was always interesting. Sometimes the online listing of readings was unclear and didn't seem to match up particularly well with where we were in class.",
    "This course is a challenging history course with a lot of information to remember. Even for people who are interested in history, this course is still a challenge. For those who are passionate about medieval history, however, this course is packed with interesting information. You needed to be very on top of the material in order to really comprehend what was going on. The lectures were structured by theme, not necessarily chronologically. Sometimes the lectures would jump back and forth through time, which was personally a bit hard to follow for me. The readings were fairly interesting, though they were definitely quite long and hard to keep up with.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and the reading was manageable. The papers were very beneficial in that they allowed me to delve deeper into one specific subject, and that they helped improve my writing skills. However, I think writing a final paper and attempting to study for the final exam at the same time was a bit overwhelming."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the cultural history of the Middle Ages or what to improve your writing, then go for it.",
    "I would if the person expresses an interest in the material, and is ready to write a lot.",
    "Would recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in Middle Ages history. It gives the broadest strokes to 1200 years worth of history.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're interested in the Middle Ages.",
    "If you are passionate about anything related to the medieval world, then this is a good course to take. It's a substantial amount of work, but if you want to take a writing credit where you can not just learn how to write but also become exposed to a lot of content, this course is definitely for you.",
    "Yes, as professor Winroth's lectures were enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Yes, definitely. A very interesting course on the Middle Ages, and you really learn how to write a paper well.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students who are totally and completely sure they are interested in medieval history. Even students who were generally interested in history, such as myself and a good number of other students I talked to, found this class a challenge to keep up with, both in terms of workload and understanding. The class covers 1200 years of history in only a few months, and mostly focused on history relating to medieval empires, wars, and religion. If you're 100% sure these topics interest you, this class is thorough and will satisfy your interest. However, this class isn't for just any student looking to take a history course because it will probably be too narrow of an area of interest. Don't take this class just to satisfy a writing requirement. Even though my writing improved, this class requires a lot of reading and preparation that goes with writing, and therefore you need to be really interested in what you're writing to keep up with the workload. This isn't a good class to take as a 5th credit either -- there's really too much material and reading to keep up with.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student; I really enjoyed it."
