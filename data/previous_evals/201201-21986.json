   "comments": [
    "It will change the way you look at the world and see how color interacts. It's an awesome course, probably the best one I've taken at Yale. That being said, what you get out of it in large part depends on what you put in.",
    "This is a great class, but it will take A LOT of time, which you will have to be willing to put in. But definitely worth taking.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, it introduced me to a whole new way of seeing the world. I am not an art major, so it was especially fun for me to have a hands-on class where I could create work I'm proud of. The first half of the class is exercise-based where the assignments have right answers. The second half gets progressively freer until the final project, which definitely allows you to let your creativity show! Clint was a very good, understanding professor, who made time for us and he also seemed excited about our work.",
    "Yes, nice introductory art class",
    "This is a great class to learn about color, whether it's the only art class you ever take or you use it to inform your other work in painting or graphic design or other field. Clint is a wonderful instructor, and the class is always fun. You can put as much or as little time into the work as you want, and you will probably get more out of it the harder you work.",
    "This class is my favorite art class I have taken at Yale. The entire class is based on the lessons developed by a famous artist and colorist and former Yale Professor Josef Albers. The approach was extremely methodical. This class is for a creative perfectionist.I would recommended it to ALL art majors and any student interested in color who is looking a for a change of pace.What you put into this class is what you get out of this class. OS I would recommend taking it during a lighter semester. It will be much less stressful and a lot more fun!",
    "Don't be fooled by the title. It's hard and tedious. However, it's rewarding if you put the time into it.",
    "This is a great course if it's your first time taking an art class, or in my case, if you have taken many art classes before but want to develop your skills.",
    "I would recommend it. It helps you think abstractly and across disciplines. A good balance of assignments and free assignments"
