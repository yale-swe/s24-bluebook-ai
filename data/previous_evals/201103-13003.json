    "Just like L3 but harder.",
    "Take this class with Mercedes Carreras, I can't recommend her highly enough. She's really fun, incredibly understanding, very helpful... Seriously, just take it with her!",
    "The course is somewhat similar to L3, albiet with less busy work and more content. Take it and with Professor Carreras if possible. She was absolutely wonderful. While I felt L4 was organized much better than L3, I enjoyed the class due to the professor and not necessarily the content.",
    "I would recommend it to another student; however, like all Spanish classes, it can get a little tedious and boring. However, Profesora Carreras did her absolute best to keep the class interesting.",
    "If you want to keep going with Spanish after L3 I highly recommend Spanish 140. It's a fun and great continuation of the Spanish program.",
    "Yes, I recommend it. Manageable workload, helps your Spanish (if you make an effort to learn, not just get through the assignments with minimum possible work), and Carreras is great.",
    "Take with Carreras, you won't regret it. She's the best by far!",
    "If you are going to take this course, take it with Carreras. She wants every student to succeed and she really cares about every student. The course itself is the same as 130 or 120 but with more presentations and fewer homework assignments."
