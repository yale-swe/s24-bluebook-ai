   "comments": [
    "The course was perhaps a bit ambitious for the introductory level, trying to fit three different dialects of Aramaic into one semester. It was a difficult, bit not impossible course for a student without knowledge of proto-Semitic, or having only one Semitic language coming in. However, the requirements of the course and Prof. Butts' instruction ensure that the student will learn a great deal in this course.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but would certainly qualify the recommendation given the various aspects of the language expected out of the course.",
    "Semitic 531 01 is a whirlwind tour of Aramaic in different periods and dialects. It will help improve one's Aramaic, while offering the student a picture of the study of Aramaic in its various periods.",
    "I would summarize it as a survey of various Aramaic dialects with the general basis of grammar in the beginning. I would suggest it to another student because of the amount of material that the class covers in such a short time and the satisfaction of learning so many new reading and grammar skills across several different historical time periods.",
    "I would recommend this class but I would suggest the student take Comparative Semitics first."

   "comments": [
    "It deepened my knowledge of the development of Semitic languages.",
    "I gained knowledge of a language I had not previously known.",
    "This course deepened my understanding of the discipline by exposing me to a comparative semitic environment. While that was not the focus of the course, the theme of comparative semitics was evident throughout the course, and helped me a great deal in other courses in semitic languages that I was taking simultaneously. It has given me the added ability to read Aramaic texts, which will help me in my research as well as my own enjoyment of texts into the future."
