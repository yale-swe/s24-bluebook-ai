    "Music 210 is a very challenging course that will require you to put in a lot of time. However, it is a great way of learning a lot about music theory over the course of one semester. Especially if you do not have a lot of comfort with arranging\/composing for multiple instruments, it's a great way to gain experience.",
    "This was a very chill class. Not too much work, and very fun. If you can take this class with Stefanie, do it, she is clear and helpful.",
    "The class is about theory and classical style rules or writing and analyzing music - it wasn't exciting, but it was what it was. i would recommend it only if you need to take the class or if you really like theory.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class, as long as you've budgeted enough time for it. If you're considering this class, your prior experience with music theory is probably limited to AP Music Theory in high school, some sort of intro theory at conservatory pre-college program, and\/or Musi 110 at Yale. In all of those cases, Musi 210 is going to be your first truly thorough and legitimate music theory class ever. Expect it to be significantly more demanding than music classes you've taken in the past. (I am writing this warning because I didn't have this expectation and was rather surprised!!) I'm not saying the workload was horribly overwhelming, but it's still very substantial and definitely not below average for a Yale class. To prepare for each lecture, you have to do one reading (which is usually rather dense) and one assignment. It usually takes 3-5 hours total (if, that is, you put in the effort to digest the readings fully and do your assignments assiduously). Obviously that workload isn't awful, but it's also probably a greater time commitment than you'd want from a fifth class or something. This class is designed for the music major track and is therefore quite rigorous - just be aware of that. As for the content, this class will give you a really solid foundation in harmonic and formal patterns of the Classical and early Romantic styles. (Yes, it really is rigorous! You're going to get a deeper understanding of the material than the people who test out and jump into 211 have, and a MUCH deeper understanding than AP Music Theory provides.) It's been very rewarding for me as a musician - I have so much more appreciation for the music I play from the relevant time periods. And if you get Stefanie as your teacher, you'll be in good hands - her feedback is super-detailed, and she's a really patient teacher. TL;DR: It was a lot of work, but very valuable, especially with Stefanie at the helm.",
    "If you have prior music theory knowledge maybe it won't be as hard to you. But as someone who didn't have much theory knowledge beforehand, it was extremely difficult. It takes a lot of time outside of class, and a lot of dedication if it doesn't come easy to you."
