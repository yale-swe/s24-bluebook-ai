   "comments": [
    "recommended for those who are interested in combining all basic concepts learned in biology to understand how the body processes function and how major conditions we hear about develop.",
    "Yes, if looking to go to medical school or just looking for an easier biology course (relative to physio, cell bio, etc)",
    "It's really interesting material. A very medschool-ish class, so good if you're trying to figure out if that's something you're interested in. It's a bit tricky to switch professors so often but so it goes.",
    "The course is an overview of the some pathology of the body, discussing cellular issues, kidney issues, digestive issues, and cancer. Really interesting stuff!",
    "This is probably the closest undergrad class that Yale has to the medical profession. The lectures focus on the body's responses to insult and injury (as the name suggests) and the biological processes behind these responses. If you are interested in medicine, and interested in the human body, there is no reason you should not take this class. Sections are mandatory, and there is no final exam, just three in-class exams distributed pretty evenly throughout the semester.",
    "It's a difficult but interesting class.",
    "YES! Andrew West is an amazing TA who knows how to go over and teach topics in ways that are interactive and simple to understand. The class itself is very interesting and had 3 hour tests with no final and a great curve",
    "Yes. You learn a great deal of content in this class.",
    "Great class, but could use more continuity between different lectors. Exams are very comprehensive and test the material quite well. Not too difficult with enough studying. Some of the lectures are much more interesting than others and some professors are truly stellar (Sklar, Kashgarian)",
    "A tough course, with a lot of different material, but you learn a great deal in the end.",
    "You learn about the GI tract, cancer, the kidney, and other cellular injuries. If you like or think you would like internal medicine, pathology, or oncology, you would probably like this class. You end up learning a lot but be careful of the grading--it gets really nit-picky.",
    "Good class, pretty interesting, although for more detail and such, consider taking physiological systems.",
    "If you want to go into medicine, great course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially those eventually interested in pursuing a career in medicine. Each block of lectures is taught by a professor speaking about their specialty, and the supplemental lecture material is very well-organized and helpful.",
    "Yes. MCDB 315 may not be the most perfect course, but you learn SO much about the body, and it ties Cell Bio and Biochemistry in very nicely. Amazing course. Not easy, but not too hard either.",
    "Good course- lectures a little dull and sometimes not sure of what would be tested on the exam but the TA's are amazing especially Vinita!",
    "Absolutely recommended",
    "i would recommend this class if you're looking for med-school lite; personally i prefer more experimentally based bio classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in a look at human pathology, with a few caveats. First, there is no book (although each lecturer does provide some supplementary readings), so you need to go to lecture to do well. Also, there are 5 lecturers in the course, and they are of varying quality. There is a lot of information presented, all of which is interesting, but which can be difficult to put into context if the lecturer doesn't present in a logically-organized way. I found going to section to be a great way to help with this, as the TAs were pretty effective at identifying the most important material and how things fit together. From what I can tell, the curve is pretty generous, but I think that getting an A will require a fair amount of studying. Overall, a pretty good course, but not my favorite Yale science course.",
    "A great class for anyone who want to know a little more about how the body works.. and breaks down. I must take for biology majors. It takes all the cellular level information and gives it relevance!",
    "It's like being in Med School, I imagine.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are a premed or at all interested in medicine. Really interesting class, light workload, and not difficult to do well on the tests if you just put a little work in for a couple days before each test.",
    "I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone. It's a good application of all the sciences you learned in a medical \/ anatomical way.Also the grading isn't too harsh so that's always a plus.",
    "This was a great class. It was really interesting, and I loved that we got different professors who were experts in their field. I thought the exams should be re-structured however. The really broad questions test more your luck in managing to put down the answer that they want instead of testing your real knowledge. Some more specific questions might be better in weeding out who did study and who didn't. The cancer lectures in particular were very interesting. I actually think physiological systems went more in depth to some of these topics, and if you're a bio major, that might be the way to go, but if you're not, this definitely gives a good insight into some really important topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student - it provided valuable information about disease processes but cemented concepts in our mind through discussion of normal physiology. I think it will be particularly helpful for those students considering medical school.",
    "Tests are very difficult but the class is interesting..lots of memorization involved",
    "Anyone who is pre-med should definitely take this class. Come find out what medicine and illness really is! Not a terrible amount of work; on a weekly basis you will probably read the course packets distributed in lecture to prepare a bit for section. 3 exams and no final during finals week. Great class to study the specific functions of portions of the body and what are the causes and effects of various injuries from a cellular to systemic level. Take it! This course has re-piqued my interest in medicine and the human body.Get Vinita or Andrew as TAs. Both a great in different ways so it may even be worth shopping both to see who fits your interests and study methods better."
