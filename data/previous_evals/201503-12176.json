    "I think Professor Drixler did an excellent job describing the class in the syllabus. Ostensibly, it's a class about Japan and Tokyo's urban history in particular. However, it goes much further. It's a class about the development of ideas about cities, modernity, and so on. It's a class about history itself and the discourses that dominate our thinking about society. It's also a great class to learn how to be a better writer. I would definitely recommend it to another student because it's such a great intellectual experience for a freshman still adjusting to college expectations, whether or not they are interested in Asian history (which I was not).",
    "Tokyo was a history-based course on its namesake, which means that unlike its description it focused surprisingly much on Edo period Tokyo rather than current events. However, it was still a very informative class, and I would still recommend it - just be aware of long readings that may sometimes turn out to be less interesting than expected!",
    "If you are at all interested in urban history or Japanese history, I recommend this course for you. Spanning the entire history of Tokyo, the course covers a wide range of topics (from attitudes towards sexuality to train systems to food customs) and as it moves chronologically through the city's development. I myself knew almost nothing about Japan coming into the course and still enjoyed it. Professor Drixler is a great instructor with extremely impressive knowledge of Japan who clearly cares a lot about his students and what they have to say. The success of the class depends some on who enrolls, as a lot of class time is spent on group discussion, but even if the class group isn't great you can still get a lot out of the readings. The class demands a lot of reading, but the number of assignments is relatively lowthree or four short essays over the course of the semester and a short final paper.",
    "TAKE IT. It's so much fun, not too much work, and counts as a writing credit. You get sushi too at the end.",
    "Tokyo is a fascinating and eye-opening class. It's really a course on Japanese history, but it delves into so many different worlds of inquiry that it's a great class for just about anyone with broad academic interests. Fabian Drixler is a great professor, but he mostly lets the class be about the discussion of the articles that we read. Plus, we watched movies and had a sushi party, so I should need to do much more convincing.",
    "I highly recommend this course for its intriguing content and readings, and for its thoughtfully designed discussions led by Professor Drixler.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a writing credit and is interested at all in Japanese history.",
    "I would definitely recommend Tokyo to anybody who is interested in Japanese culture\/history, and wants to learn about that in a freshman seminar context. This is what I was looking for, and the class gave me that and more. I really feel like I developed more as a student during my time in this class, and so I think the class was extremely rewarding.",
    "This course combines a detailed look at the evolution of Tokyo but is likely more important for the contextualization it forces you to do at Eastern history as a whole. This of course means that a lot of the scope of the class lies in readings and research papers, not in class discussions."
