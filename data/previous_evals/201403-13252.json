   "comments": [
    "CHNS 154 is a wonderful course. I was worried about the potential level of intensity, especially after the rigor of CHNS 150\/151, but I found this course to be well-paced, interesting, and a manageable time commitment. It is not as strenuous as CHNS 150\/151 but retains all of aspects that I loved in the program: presentations, cultural videos, etc. Definitely well worth taking, even if you feel hesitant or unsure about continuing in the track.",
    "Take it. If you do the work you'll learn a lot, for a course that meets 3 times a week. Zhou laoshi is also excellent. The best reason to take this though is that you need this class to do the Chinese electives.",
    "Much more relaxed continuation of 150\/151",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to any students continuing looking to study Chinese at an advanced level. This course definitely helped me improve my language skills and my speaking especially improved from the course.",
    "It is 1 credit language course and there are lot less work than the intensive levels. However, I found the pace suitable, and felt that I had learned material more thoroughly than the previously levels. Professor Zhou is also very friendly, and a good professor.",
    "This is the best Chinese language I've ever had in my six years of studying the language. The texts and materials are engaging, entertaining, and informative. The advanced level of the class has winnowed the Chinese students down to a dedicated core, so the classmates are great. You'll also learn really a lot. Willie Zhou is one of the kindest, most understanding, most personable, and most effective professors you'll ever meet. If you are taking Chinese, do NOT miss this class!",
    "If you've made it this far, keep going!"
