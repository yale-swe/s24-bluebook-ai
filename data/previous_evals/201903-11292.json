   "comments": [
    "We learned the basics of point-set topology and algebraic topology (about an even split between the two). The course follows Munkres pretty closely.",
    "Overview of Point-Set Topology and Algebraic topology, up through the classification of 2-manifolds. We covered most of Munkres and some additional topics that Caglar taught from notes.",
    "Topology! It's cool.",
    "I gained a rigorous understanding of point-set topology and an introductory understanding of algebraic topology. I also practiced my proof-writing and mathematical communication skills through problem sets and in-class exercises.",
    "I learned more point-set topology and the basics of algebraic topology: the fundamental group, covering spaces, and surface classification.",
    "Good proof-writing skills and independent learning",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of algebraic topology, as well as some point-set topology.",
    "Most of the content in this course is closely aligned with Munkres' Topology. From that textbook we covered the bulk of chapters 1-5, 9, and 11-13. (The semester is split almost 50-50 between point-set topology and algebraic topology.)",
    "We learned the common curriculum of Point Set Topology (that is, the basics that any grad student would be expected to know), as well as the basics of Algebraic Topology without going into Homology (that is, covering spaces, fundamental group, classification theorem of 1 and 2-manifolds, pretty much Chapter 1 of Hatcher or Massey's Algebraic Topology: an introduction)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Algebraic topology is an inherently interesting subject, and Caglar is nice. Weaknesses: Proofs in class were often disorganized, lacking rigor, or wrong, and we moved very slowly for much of the semester, so we ended up not covering as much material as expected. The course was overall at a lower level than advertised.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, fair workload, two take home exams, test corrections (seriously, the fact that we got these was wonderful. I have never in my life been more incentivized to actually review my exams, see what I got wrong, and learn how to do it right), phenomenal teacher. Weaknesses: class was slightly disorganized, and grading on the PSets was....bizarre",
    "Keep Caglar teaching it as long as possible. Maybe do a little less point-set, maybe skip the proof of Tychonoff, and maybe talk about homology a bit or at least higher homotopy groups.",
    "This was a great class, and Caglar is a great professor. The order of contentswitching between point-set and algebraic topologydidn't make a ton of sense to me, but it worked fine.",
    "This course was really well taught, and I thought Caglar did an excellent job of pacing the class. The final was a lot harder than the assignments and midterm before it, so that was an inconsistency. Sometimes lectures could have been a bit better organized.",
    "Strengths: professor is extremely kind and cares about the students, lectures are very clear and excellent board work Weaknesses: occasionally a little disorganized but not even really that much",
    "This was a very strong course overall. The teaching and the problem sets were both great for learning without being overwhelming.",
    "Honestly, most things about this course are fantastic and don't require any improvements. The content, pacing, and structure are all great. Caglar is wonderful. My only complaint is that there were some topics (namely the finer points of quotient spaces and universal covering spaces) that we covered in lecture, only briefly covered on problem sets, and then were (reasonably) expected to know on the take-home final. I would have liked more problems on these topics to appear on homeworks during the semester so I could better assess my understanding of them, rather than having to learn them in a panicked frenzy during finals period. Other than that gripe, this course was excellent.",
    "The instructor is amazing! Caglar is really willing to explain all topics and make sure everyone gets the content. There were quite a bit of psets, and although it could have been more demanding or more rigorous at times (mostly on the Algebraic Topology parts), it honestly made for a great third or fourth credit in Math."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This was taught as a mid-level course for non-math majors, or a low-key elective for math majors. Math majors who want a thorough introduction to algebraic topology should consider taking graduate topology instead.",
    "Yeah absolutely, especially if Caglar is teaching it. This is one of the classes with the best chill-to-learning ratio in the department. Lots of interesting material, fair workloads, and like zero stress.",
    "Yes! Algebraic topology is a cool field. Unlike algebra you're actually dealing with concrete things, and unlike analysis the proofs typically aren't messy. Caglar is a gem and if you don't love him what are you even doing.",
    "Algebraic topology is a fascinating field and Caglar is a great professor, so yes, please take this class! Problem sets are reasonable, we only had one (also reasonable) in-class exam and two take-homes, and, again, Caglar is fantastic. Lectures were super interesting, and Caglar is really interested in engaging with students. One of the best math classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! A really beautiful and fundamental area of math. If you are a math major, you should definitely try to take algebraic topology before you graduate. Also, don't be seduced by the graduate version of this class. Remember that this class is the prerequisite for that, and it will give you a much stronger foundation in the field.",
    "Absolutely! Caglar is great and the material is very interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I was very interesting, well-taught, and the workload was not crippling.",
    "This is the perfect pure math course. It covers enough content that you feel satisfied at the end of the semester, but not so much that you feel lost and confused like in other math courses. Workload is very reasonable, the content is presented very clearly, and Professor Uyanik is excellent. Algebraic topology is a beautiful field; everyone interested in pure math should explore it at least once in their life. In terms of prereqs, a course in abstract algebra is a must, but I think someone who has only a little exposure to analysis would be fine. My only experience with analysis concepts prior to this course was in 230\/231 (I hadn't taken 305 yet) and I felt sufficiently prepared.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely! Topology is such a beautiful gem of mathematics. Point Set Topology have that axiomatic feel of Planar Geometry and Group Theory, and it's really great to have it built from scratch in class. Algebraic Topology, on the other hand, is mixing all this geometrical fun with the fun of Algebra! A must take in my opinion. It's also not very demanding so a great addition to any upperclassmen or advanced sophomore in Math."
