    "This course very eye opening for me - giving insight into myriad immunological disorders and understanding the process by which researchers go about planning investigations into them. This class was one of my favorites in grad school and I would definitely say it is very valuable, not just for immunology students.",
    "I learned about the involvement of the immunological system in various diseases. I also learned to critically evaluated data published.",
    "how to evaluate disease",
    "Different translational research in immunology, and how it translate to the clinical aspect.",
    "This class provided insight into ongoing questions in clinical immunology and how these issues are being scientifically addressed. This introduced a broad range of techniques used to probe translational immunology and allowed for interesting discussion about the future of the field. This class also provided the opportunity to write an short proposal on a relevant topic."

   "comments": [
    "A major strength was getting to hear from the people on the front lines - each class involved a different professor or clinician who gave insight into the specific disease they work on. I like the relatively informal discussion style and I the homeworks did a good job with allowing us to process the information. My sole critique is that I know there was a voluntary clinical visit we could participate in, which I ended up not doing, mostly because I forgot that we had the opportunity. This is one of the few times where I actually would like to see something be made mandatory because I think that would have been a great experience to expand on the course. I wish I had taken the initiative to do that :(",
    "No weaknesses to this class. The strength of this class was that when talking about a disease, we had an expert that has personally dealt with patients diagnosed. They allow to gap the bridge from book information into actually clinical relevance.",
    "engaging",
    "Enjoyed the different lecturers coming in and talking about their research. Some gave more background than others which made it easier to follow the lecture. Would have liked to see the class better organized.",
    "This class consistently had interesting and engaging professors that discussed the field of their research. A new topic by a different professor was presented each week, which kept the class exciting and without traditional exams it allowed us to focus on the material and discussion. As the short proposal is the largest assignment in the class, it would be helpful to have a peer review day where we can discuss proposals."

    "Without a doubt. This is what I was hoping graduate courses would be like for me and so far is the only that has truly met my expectations. I'm glad I had this opportunity",

    "great course",
    "Yes. Very discussion-heavy. Great course if you like hearing about how translational research happens.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It focuses on having students learn from experts in the field and the workload is very manageable. I learned a lot throughout the course and highly recommend it."
