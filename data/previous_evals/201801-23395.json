    "I gained significant insights into the functional role of pests and pathogens in shaping natural ecosystems.",
    "The power that microfauna have in this world. We stress too much on macrofauna and conservation methods for those larger creatures. We also need to focus and protect the little guys - without them, our world stops.",
    "I learned how to read scientific\/ecology articles. This certainly was my biggest skill I took. But we also explored sampling methods - and I definitely broadened my horizon on that as well. Mostly though, I learned a lot more about the role of pests, pathogens and parasites in forested landscapes.",
    "Great foundation in the biology of pests, pathogens and parasites and their interactions with their hosts. Enhanced understanding of the contributions pests, pathogens and parasites make to species diversity and to ecosystem functioning. Improved understanding of the complexity of pest\/pathogen\/parasite-host interactions and their mechanisms.",
    "Understanding of spread of diseases, parasites and pests in forest, humans, and wildlife"

    "This class 100% exceeded my expectations. The course was very straightforward, and Liza was very flexible with trying to cater to student interests through adding optional articles.",
    "Just about perfectly!",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is the topic and structure of the course, including the subtopics covered, good reading material, etc. The main weakness of the course was the low enrollment (5 students), coupled with divergent interests and foundations, which hampered the discussion part of the class. The class and lecturer are of far better quality than the level discussions emerged. This class needs prime enrollment by serious graduate students in ecology and evolution.",
    "Strengths The professor will go over anything you have questions about the content. She takes the time to go everything you ask in detail.",
    "The strengths are that it's a very relaxed course, yet I also found myself learning tremendously throughout the process. Learning a lot without the stress. Liza creates a very comfortable dynamic that is conducive to good dialogue. The only weaknesses that I can think of would be maybe slightly more lectures? I don't think there should always be lectures, because I like the flow of the course. But maybe lectures related to the course could be uploaded on canvas (if Liza didn't want to take time out of the class) or a few times we could have lectures? In addition, we submitted class assignments and sometimes we wouldn't discuss the answers to the questions in class. I recognize we could have sought the TA or professor out outside of class, but more inclusion in class discussions would have been nice too. Lastly, more feedback on the graded assignments (especially the final presentation and paper - but it's possible we'll get comments on those soon!). I would love to learn how to better improve from those.",
    "I thought the course was great and Dr. Comita is a wonderful instructor. She communicates clearly, motivates discussion and inspires interest in the subject matter. I liked the course a lot and would continue to study the subject matter. In some ways I wished it could have been longer or somewhat more extensive, I would have been happy for it to be a 3 credit course. Related to \"improvements\", I am not sure I have very good suggestions but I like marine ecosystems and so would like to see more about the role of pests, pathogens and parasites in those systems and more examples of their interactions with hosts in those systems.",
    "more class discussions"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course for all graduate students in ecology (forest and urban), evolution and policy\/governance.",
    "Keep on top of the readings. Ask questions at office hours. This course is straightforward and you get a lot out of it. Just do the work.",
    "I would advise a student to be prepared to talk, and to do all the readings. I think they'll get more out of it if they write down questions while they read the articles and bring them up in class.",
    "Dig into the subject matter as there is a lot of substance in there and you can get deep in the science if you want to. Read the optional materials as they enhance the learning experience.",
    "A great course to take"
