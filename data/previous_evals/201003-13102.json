    "This class provides an in-depth look at Ancient Greek History through a variety of ancient sources. I would recommend this class to a prospective student if he\/she has a passion for history, but for someone who is not really interested in history as a discipline the class might prove too intense.",
    "Yes if Kagan is teaching it. If not then no. The current format it is an easy and interesting class and a good overview of the civilization considered to be foundational to western thought.",
    "The lectures take you through the history of the independent polis in Ancient Greece. Moreover, you get a real understanding of the disputes among scholars today. You have a midterm, term paper, and final exam. I could not recommend a class more. I is truly incredible.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student with a keen interest in Greek Civilization and ancient history. I was not interested in this topic, and therefore found the material tedious at times. That said, there was a lot to get out of it in terms of thinking about and analyzing history, so all was not lost. But to get the most out of this class, you should go into it with a love and interest in the specific subject matter.",
    "Fabulous course. Kagan's still got it. If you want to spend a semester thinking about conflict, politics, and humanity (and maybe a thing or two about Greek civilization) take it.And if you're a history major, you literally have no excuse for not taking it. A Pre-Industrial with one of the most brilliant historians of the twentieth\/twenty-first centuries. A joy.",
    "Recommend. Its a classic.",
    "This is a wonderful course. I enjoyed every minute and Professor Kagan is amazing. To be in a room with someone so internationally renown and for him to treat you as an intelligent person is really special. You would be stupid not to take this class.",
    "Disappointing. The class is supposed to be one of the great lectures at Yale, but I was thoroughly underwhelmed. After 6 semesters at Yale, this was the first class I've skipped regularly.The workload is pretty light, but I'd hesitate to call it a gut.",
    "Great way to learn about ancient Greek history, but a lot of work.",
    "It is a great history class and you should take it, regardless of whether you are a historian or not.",
    "Yes. I think it is a good overview of Greek History and Kagan is the man.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because you get a good broad base about what a person should know about Greek history in order to understand the development of western civilization as we know it.",
    "I would totally recommend it. The workload isn't that much, and the optional section is great. The material is interesting and Professor Kagan is a great teacher.",
    "A great course. Kagan is the best part of the class. Some of the lectures, especially those concerning the Peloponnesian War, were brought to life by him. It was incredible enough to sit in a room and listen to him lecture and defend his own opinions in person. The class itself was great, Ancient Greek History is fascinating and the combination of history and modern scholars opinions was great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Kagan is a wonderful lecturer and the material is interesting and can be relevant, despite being occasionally frustrating due to the uncertain nature of ancient history.",
    "Only if you really love Classics - this isn't something to take half-heartedly....",
    "Take this course before you graduate. It an invaluable slice of the humanities that will contribute to your understanding of the world.",
    "TAKE THE SECTION. It really helps you remember the important themes (and IDs) of the course. Kagan's lectures are really interesting if you are willing to devote an hour and 15 minutes focusing on his lecture. The tests are not difficult, but you have to memorize a lot of information\/dates. There is also a paper. Again, TAKE THE SECTION. It makes the course so much easier.",
    "Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "a lot of reading, but manageable if you like the subject. Make sure you take the section because otherwise its kindof a waste. Kagan is great, the class is great the material is interesting and relevant.",
    "Take it while kagan is still living.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who enjoy big lectures (which I've found I don't really like), and those who are extremely passionate about the Classics and getting into the nitty gritty details of them. Otherwise, this class can be very easy to disengage with, especially if you don't have a great section. Donald Kagan did write the books on the topic and is incredibly knowledge, but his lecture style is incredibly calm and often mirrors the reading, which can make it difficult to pay attention to. It's also quite a bit of reading, and a lot of memorization for the exams. However, I learned a lot about the beginnings of Western civilization that I would not have otherwise.",
    "Let's put it this way: Kagan gets applause after almost every single lecture. Take it! You'll learn a lot, and Greek history helps you get a much better understanding of our own democracy.",
    "Absolutely take this course. This is by far the best lecture course I have taken at Yale with a decent workload. The readings were interesting and balanced each other well. If you keep up with the readings you will be fine!",
    "You'll learn Ancient Greek history from the master, but if you don't take a section, it will be hard to learn everything from this class that you should get out of it.",
    "very interesting material, definitely take a section because it helps you understand the course and forces you to do the readings, kagan's lectures are great but a little dry. it was really hard to keep paying attention at the end when the food coma kicked in",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, since I think that both the professor and the course are very interesting.",
    "The quintessential Yale class. Take it.",
    "it isn't too much work and the lectures are really well taught. It's important history that people should know.",
    "Lots of reading, a good combo of primary and secondary sources. Very good introduction to Greece, though don't expect to focus much on Greek philosophers...and by not much, I mean not at all.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but only if they really want to learn ancient Greek history - even though Kagan's a great professor, if you're not really interested in the material, I don't think the work you would have to put into the class would be worth it. Grading can be a bit harsh.",
    "No. You can see it online, and it's not an easy A. I was misled because I did surprisingly well on the midterm and then decided not to drop the course, only to find out that Kagan was upset that everyone had done well and wanted to curve the class against that. Now I'm stuck with a bad grade and I'm a little bitter for it.Read the Melian dialogues on your own, they're two pages and they're beautiful. Then go out and take a seminar and make the best of your Yale experience.",
    "This class is pretty good overall, although Kagan can be repetitive in lecture.",
    "Definitely take the course. You will have a very detailed understanding of Greek history and recognize similarities in today's news. Make sure you do the readings, and take good notes on the readings. It will save a lot of review later.",
    "If you're a history major, especially if you're specializing in ancient or Mediterranean history, you must take this course. For everyone else, I wouldrecommend it as a fun 4th or 5th class, especially if you take it with a few friends. Kagan is a legend, and for good reason. That said, he can sometimes go on tangents that seem to take away from the narrative. Make sure to read the textbook; Pomeroy is probably one of the best textbooks I have ever come across, and it will give you great stories (defacing of the herms) for life.",
    "This course is an great introduction to ancient Greek history up through Alexander the Great. Professor Kagan manages to be an amazing lecturer even as he reads from his notes--a lot of the lectures feel rather like storytime with lots of anecdotes and parallels drawn between ancient and modern history. Though he acknowledges that some of his theses are controversial, the lectures are definitely his version of the history, so you'll have to look to the readings to see other positions developed. I ended up in a section was a really good addition to the class, but I had to shop three to find it, so be careful on that one. I would definitely recommend taking this class no matter your background or discipline--it's a really excellent lecture taught by one of Yale's foremost scholars. I would also recommend taking it credit\/D unless you want to stress a lot on the exams\/think you are good at writing history papers.",
    "It's a great class, and worth taking if you have any interest in classical civilization. The lectures aren't in-your-face exciting or immediately engaging, but if you put in the minimum effort to pay attention they're great. Both textbooks supplement the lecture material well, but I'm not sure how much reading the ancient sources (Thucydides and Plutarch) really adds, since relevant passages from those and many other sources are found in both the textbooks.",
    "Great class. Kagan is great. Absolutely would recommend the class.",
    "A fantastic, fantastic class with one caveat: all the lectures are available online via Open Yale Courses. What's more, the online lectures are better than the ones you can get in person\u0097because they were filmed when Professor Kagan was still able to stand up while reading his lecture. Naturally, this was a disincentive to go to class. It's still worth taking the class, though, to really be forced to learn about the amazing civilization with which the story of the West all but began. And you will be forced to learn it. The tests aren't easy, and there's a lot of reading, some of which of it is dry going (but NOT Thucydides, who is marvelous\u0097make sure you get The Landmark Thucydides, the edition with dates, maps, and annotations), but it's so, so worth it. My weeklong intensive studying for the final has been perhaps the most thrilling intellectual endeavor of my time at Yale.",
    "It's worth taking this class just to listen to Professor Kagan. Make sure to keep up with the reading, though. It's easy to fall behind, but it is very interesting stuff!",
    "take it.",
    "fantastic",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are extremely interested in the subject material and willing to work hard. Kagan's a good lecturer, but the section can get dull sometimes and the class is a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Kagan is a brilliant lecturer and always made lecture insightful and entertaining. The workload is light; only a short paper, a midterm, and a final. If you have the opporunity to take this class wih Kagan, go for it.",
    "Ancient Greek History is like story-time from your favorite grandfather. Professor Kagan has a presence that can only come from experience--I was told that he has taught this class for decades. Regardless of major, even for science\/engineering students, this class is most worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because the topic is incredible, but Kagan is definitely not what he used to be.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Greek History; don't only take it for Kagan.",
    "This was an excellent lecture course on Greek history. Professor Kagan is a wonderful lecturer who develops the significance of the period. I really enjoy the subject matter. The ancient Greeks, despite their age, in some ways are quite similar to us. Professor Kagan isn't afraid to emphasize the relevance of history.",
    "A very good class. I took it with very limited knowledge of the subject and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "HIST 205 is a great introduction to Greek history, especially if you are totally new to the classics. The readings are manageable and interesting and Kagan's lectures are always interesting. The course has good depth and also covers an enormous amount of material. A course everyone should take.",
    "This is a great course, and it's not too much work--midterm, final 1 6 pg paper. You basically only have to do readings from the \"Problems\" textbook. Do know that there's a heavy focus on war, which can be a bit dry; we were doing the Peloponnesian War forever. Also, there are transcripts of all of Kagan's lectures online, but be careful because it seems like he changes them year to year.",
    "An interesting course - I should have realized that to me, personally, Sparta is the most fascinating area of Ancient Greek history. I loved those lectures, but fell off the wagon rather quickly for the rest of the course.Obviously Donald Kagan is a huge figure in the field; being taught by him is a privilege. I'd be interested to see what he's like in a seminar format, because his lectures did not live up to the hype generated by reviews on OCI, other than a couple exceptional talks.To me, this was a disappointment. If you're crazy about Ancient Greece though, go for it - it is a very thorough overview of political and military events in Ancient Greece, up until the end of the polis, admirable for the long timeframe it spans and the material it covers.",
    "Standard Greek history course. A good class if you have a heavy workload not because it is a gut but because the deadlines really only revolve around the midterm, paper, and exam.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about ancient Greek history and you like history in general, definitely take this course. The material itself is very interesting. But if you're not interested in Greek history, don't take this course. You won't like it at all.",
    "Pretty difficult for an intro lecture -- take it if you're into the era and are willing to put some real work into date memorization, etc. for the tests. Lectures are generally enjoyable and it's a good class overall. Good for a pre-Ind.",
    "This course's title as an \"intro course\" is a bit of a misnomer. As a Freshman science major I was thoroughly overwhelmed by the 2 textbooks (one of which was written bu Kagan) and the 2 novels you're expected to read. Also my section was composed of 11 non-science majors majors: only 2 other freshmen, about 9 of the total 11 were either poly sci and\/or history majors, 3 or 4 of them had done DS; and myself. Kagan is an AMAZING professor and lecturer but that's why the course is on Yale open courses- so you can watch the lectures without being in the class (which I would recommend to math\/science majors). The workload is manageable but the section focuses on analyzing and debating the book of primary and secondary sources whereas the lecture follows the historical narrative book. There is a big focus on critical thinking and how difficult it is to construct an accurate and unbiased view of history from so long ago and with very limited primary and very biased later authors who were using primary sources that no-longer exist. However the midterm and exam focus too much on testing your recollection of half of this sourcebook at a time i.e. you're tested on 6 chapters and you need to know the names and arguments of the primary and secondary sources from all of them so that you can pick 1 chapter from the 2 choices for an essay. The exams also ask for exact dates for the id terms which I find a facile aspect of history.",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested in ancient history. If not there is a lot of reading that you might find boring.",
    "History of Ancient Greece, civilizations, wars, dynamics (alliances and dynamics)Yes I would recommend this class, very interesting, and engaging, good readings as well but way too many of them.",
    "This class provides an overview of Ancient Greek History from the beginning [around 3000 BC]to just before Alexander the Great. I would definitely recommend the course because it was terrific!",
    "I would recommend this class but only if Kagan is teaching it. The course is fairly easy, though for some reason the final exam was much more difficult than the rest of the course so leave time to study for that.",
    "Cool class about Greek History. It's hard though. The final was very specific. Good credit\/D class since it's a midterm, easy paper, and a final.",
    "I would take it. It's not a particularly easy credit, so don't take it for a HUMS credit, but its worth it to hear Donald Kagan lecture.",
    "You sort of know what you're getting when you sign up for this class. It's a VERY good history class. The lectures are very carefully constructed and the material is presented in a very complete manner. He doesn't just present facts--he presents evidence and asks you to draw conclusions for yourself, which actually works out really really well. I feel like I now know a TON about Greek history. And for those of you who don't know, Greek history is FASCINATING. It really is. And I didn't think I was interested when I signed up for the class.That said, there's a TON of information and it's impossible to cut corners. The three sources are a) the lecture, b) the textbook (POMEROY) and c) another textbook (PROBLEMS) that presents a number of debates about Greek history and asks you to draw conclusions. The exams have IDs and then ask you to write one essay about a PROBLEMS chapter and one general essay about the info in the lectures and POMEROY. So you sort of have to master all three sources carefully in order to be prepared for the exams. Which is a lot of work. But it's not impossible to cram for these tests. POMEROY is a fast read, you don't have to read all the PROBLEMS chapters (on the test, he gives you a choice of like 3 chapters to talk about) and the lectures are all online on open Yale courses in case you get bored in class and lose focus. You will get bored and lose focus because the material goes LIGHTNING fast and it's easy to get lost.That said, if you're going to work hard in a class, this is one to doit in. Yes, the workload kind of sucks, but I'm really happy about the knowledge I've gained.",
    "Absolutely recommended. One of the best classes taught at Yale, if you need a history credit or just any credit in general.",
    "Yes I would recommend it only because the subject itself is fascinating and you won't really have any opportunity to learn about it other than in this setting.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in Ancient Greece. The second half of the semester isn't quite as interesting and gets a little tedious with all of the focus spent on the Wars, but it's worth it for the first half which is just so interesting. Watch out for the final, it's very hard...",
    "This class is interesting, but I feel that there is a better and more interesting way to convey the material.",
    "an awesome intro to the origins and golden age of Greek civilization. Take it while Kagan is still teaching - he is a master, and on top of that, very down-to-earth. You won't want to miss a single lecture.",
    "Its an overview of Greek history up until the fall of the polis . I would recommend this class if you are interested in the subject and are good at going to class, taking notes and can handle a fair amount of reading.",
    "Yes I would, if you have an interest in the period.",
    "Yes - it's great not only for learning about an amazing civilization but also for understanding the study of history and becoming acquainted with the bases of early political\/philosophic thought. And even if it were a class on the use of punctuation in the History of the Peloponnesian War, I would still recommend it if Kagan were teaching it, because I'm sure he would find a way to make it awesome.",
    "It was a good survey course. It was taught by the \"legendary\" Donald Kagan and it was one of those yale traditions that everyone should experience. Professor Kagan is definitely an expert on the subject and his lectures are well-crafted. Often though, he has a tendency to let his ideological positions intrude on the subject or more commonly, a tendency to explicate on contemporary situations based on Ancient Greek history. Whether the latter is appropriate is debatable, but be prepared to hear grandiloquent statements like \"to the Greeks we owe the fruits of Western Civilization\" or \"had not the three hundred Spartans made their stand at Thermopylae, there might not be a United States of America today.\"The material is very fun though, and I think an important part of a liberal education. The workload is moderate, especially if you don't do all of the readings (which you don't necessarily have to). Also, bear in mind that this class only runs until the time of Alexander the Great",
    "HIST 205 is a good course and a good introduction to Ancient Greek History, just like it's title suggests. The highlight of the course, naturally, is being able to take a course with Donald Kagan. Although he is a great lecturer, I don't think you should take the course just because there is a great teacher teaching it. Only take the course if you really want to learn about Greek history or if you have an interest in Greek history. If you start taking the course and discover that you don't really like Greek history after all, then the rest of the course will feel terrible. But if you're even the least bit interested in ancient Greece, this course is a must, especially with Kagan.",
    "Yes, take this class! You will not regret it.",
    "HIST 205 is a fantastic Introduction to Ancient Greek History. Whatever your historical background may be, you will come to love the ancient Greeks by term's end. Professor Kagan does a terrific job of establishing contemporary resonances, and his presentation of the material through the Pomoroy, Problems, and ancient Greek texts was right on point.This course did have several frustrating elements. There is a clear discrepancy in expectation between Professor Kagan and his section leaders. I did not feel as if I made great strides in developing my critical thinking by term's end, as Professor Kagan proclaims to be the methodological goal of his course. You are NOT expected to take risks here -- far from it. You are asked mainly to reiterate one of several traditional arguments, and straight memorize names, dates, and places in preparation for course assessments. In short, definitely take the course as a student of history, for the love of Greek culture and its relevance to modern times. Simply be prepared for the more frustrating elements of Professor Kagan's outdated pedagogy and political biases.",
    "absolutely. maybe not freshman year though.",
    "This was a great class to credit D. You learn A LOT about Greek history leading up the aftermath of the Pelopponesian War. The topics are very fascinating.",
    "History 205 is a good course for those interested in history as well as those who are not. Professor Kagan gives a good overview of ancient Greek life. Kagan makes the material easy to understand, although it can be dry at times. But, overall, great chance to learn about the foundations of Western civilization.",
    "The course was solid. It has a very high reputation but I feel that it was able to live up to it. Kagan was amazing, exemplifying in every lecture the significance of the Greeks and their achievements not only in their time, but as applies to the present day as well. I would thus recommend the class to my fellow student. It goes over much of Greek history and dabbles in as much military history as it is possible (though it too is minute). The workload is heavy but manageable. It is key to read the Problems book and maybe one of the primary sources, preferable Thucydides. Pomeroy and Kagan say similar things, so either reading the textbook or taking good notes should be good enough to get by. I just hope that others will have the chance to take this amazing class with this amazing professor.",
    "The study of Ancient Greek History and most importantly how it relates to things going on today. The lessons learned then are the same ones we struggle with today.",
    "dope class. read the lectures online and ur set",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class. Kagan's lectures are great and the material is very interesting. This class is great for a comprehensive overview of Greek history.",
    "This course is great if you are interested in the material. If not, lectures can be dry and the readings (which cover a fair amount of material) can get tedious. Take it if the subject interests you.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the Classics, especially with Kagan as the lecturer. Material might be a bit dry for those uninterested in ancient Greek history.",
    "Kagan is the professor to take if you have any interest in the subject matter. He is extraordinarly knowledgeable and addresses fact, myth, and controversy in all of his lectures. While the lectures were interesting for the most part, the discussion sections (or, mine at least) could be a little dry. There was also so much reading, a good portion of which proved necessary for the final. The final itself, though not cumulative, was pretty hard, especially if you picked and chose your readings. If you are okay with heavy reading, then definitely take the class. In short, phenomenal professor, great lectures, okay sections, and a whole lot of reading.",
    "Overall this is a great class with an incredibly famous and intersting professor.",
    "Fascinating material. You get more and more drawn into the course as the semester evolves. Kagan is a great lecturer and ties much of the history into more modern events. A lot of reading and would make a great credit\/d."
