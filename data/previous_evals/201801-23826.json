    "Strength: conversation-styled lecture, super nice & responsive instructor, free and helpful textbook, easy exams Weakness: topic overlaps with some of the other courses in the Regulatory Affairs Track",
    "Very interactive class",
    "This course is very well organized. The textbook used in this course offers a very good introduction to multicentre clinical trials - it was written by the primary instructor too! The primary instructor is super knowledgeable and cares a lot about his students.",
    "Course was great. Felt that there was a lot more on the agenda, but this was interrupted by inclement weather. Instructor could've been more engaging with students to make things interesting.",
    "great",
    "I really learned everything useful for clinical trial in this class. It worth my tuition fee. Professor Peter is also very kind to international students. I appreciate this.",
    "Overall, it was an interesting topic. I took this class because I was interested in taking the clinical trials class in the fall semester but could not. This course does not require that one as a prerequisite and I was told by a classmate that this one was much more enjoyable. We had a very small and intimate class. There were definitely things that I learned from this class, but it was not very rigorous and did not really add a semester's worth of knowledge for me (someone who has minimal understanding of statistics, etc). It is a good class to take when you want to gain some knowledge in this area but do not want a rigorous class (its somewhat like a filler class thats an easy A in undergrad, but looks like you've taken something really useful). Overall, I appreciated the class content, but perhaps something with more rigor would be even more valuable at the Masters level."

    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Strength: nice, responsive, humorous Weakness: Professor Peduzzi improvises a lot, sometimes on syllabus structure, sometimes on exam policy, which can be good sometimes ;)",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Great! Learned lots of insightful ideas about RCT",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi is a super supportive and knowledgeable professor. He put in a lot of efforts in organizing the course, very clear of his expectations from his students, and very good at explaining concepts relating to multicentre clinical trials.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Great knowledge of subject matter with practical experience. Perfect credentials to teach the course.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Very kind Professor and also very helpful and willing to talk to students. He is just such a good professor!",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0He was very nice and caring towards his students. He was of course more interested in the fact that we learned something than he was interested in making sure that we were tested severely. His exams were incredibly fair, and on the easier side - he was very forthcoming about what he expected us to know on both the exams. I appreciated the time he took to go through some of the calculations that were more difficult to understand."

   "comments": [
    "It's an easy course overall where you learn knowledge about clinical trial history, design, sample size calculation. Exams and HWs are easy, instructor is super nice and super responsive. You'll be actively engaged in conversation during the class, and if you do, you'll find the nearly 2-hour class not so dull. And you'll find you don't need lots of after-class time since you've already digested everything in the class",
    "Great course to learn more about RCT",
    "This course is one of my favorite courses I took this year. Highly recommended!",
    "Great course if you want to learn the ins and outs of designing clinical trials.",
    "great",
    "Will. It's worth taking, trust me",
    "Even though the class was ok, I probably wouldn't recommend it to another student because I feel like you could get more out of your education with another class. Maybe not one at YSPH, but definitely one a the School of Forestry or elsewhere."
