   "comments": [
    "This course is definitely well-taught. The material is very interesting, spanning from 1945 modernism to the present cybernetics. It is a very small seminar,therefore everyone actually has a great opportunity to speak on class. If you are pursing an art history major, definitely consider taking this class. But if you are not an art history major, I think this class will be a little bit too specific to qualify for an introductory course.",
    "A course focused on the more socially progressive artists and visual art movements within Contemporary Art. The course briefly resumes the shift from modernism to post-modernism with pop art, but overall stresses art that relates to feminist and racial issues as well as issues associated with globalization and colonization.",
    "I would say that if you like contemporary art it is a great way to expand your knowledge through analysis of a wide variety of mediums. I would recommend it because it is a unique opportunity to use the seminar format of a class to engage with the material.",
    "I would summarize it as a class focusing on the most interesting parts of postmodern art. The readings are incredibly challenging but they are for the most part, a challenge in a good way. I would recommend it as a seminar but not as a freshman seminar. It didn't really have most of the components that I would have expected from one.",
    "This class is a great course on the current discussion of identity through art. I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in the art world today and who is interested in seeing how art has contributed significantly to such a critical conversation.",
    "This course is an introduction to the the ways in which political and cultural changes in the last fifty years have affected self-hood and identity in art. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with even a mild interest in contemporary art. It exposed a different side of art history that I may be interested in pursuing as a major.",
    "Identities in Contemporary Art is an interesting class, but it does require some past knowledge of art, or else a student that is willing to put in the extra work to learn concepts that are assumed to be common knowledge. Some of the more technical classes were less interesting, but this course discusses many interesting and relevant ideas concerningthe issues of identity. Overall, then, I would recommend this course.",
    "The subject material is fascinating and leaves you with a desire to continue gender and racial studies. The class went on a few field trips, and the trip to an artist's studio was the best experience of my entire semester. As a freshman, I found the lecture quality of the seminar very helpful. Professor Mercer kept the discussion structured, so I became gradually accustomed to a seminar style rather than being plunged in.The reading took a lot of time to understand: it was extremely technical. If this class is offered again, the grading needs to be fixed: we never got a breakdown of how the class was graded. There were only five assignments: three blog posts, a five-page paper for midterm, and a fifteen-page paper for the final exam. The fifteen-page paper was extremely time-intensive, and it seemed a little ridiculous to ask freshmen to write fifteen pages for their first college exam.Professor Mercer is brilliant. He was somewhat distant, but as the class progressed, he warmed up and the class became way more comfortable. He met with us each individually to discuss ideas for the papers and to give back our midterm papers. He was extremely focused on format, and took points off for not following his citation conventions (which were not told to us prior to turning in the papers)."
