   "comments": [
    "Debating American Capitalism was a great class ... if you were willing to put in the 250-300 pages\/week of reading that Huyssen assigned. I doubt it'll be offered again (since Huyssen won't be at Yale any longer), but if it is, I would definitely recommend shopping it. His lecture style is very oratorial (large chunks of text prepared and delivered in full), which isn't necessarily for everyone.",
    "A lot of reading, but very interesting summary and synthesis of all of the factors that played into our current economic system. I particularly enjoyed the discussions about the morality of capitalism and success. One in-class midterm, 1 short paper, and choice of 10 page term paper or three hour final exam.",
    "Beautiful lectures, a lot of reading, challenging material, really rewarding experience.",
    "A survey of capitalism's manifestations and the resulting anti-capitalist movements over the period from the late 1800s to today. Often skewed to favor anti-capitalist studies, but definitely worthwhile.",
    "Amazing course, I definitely recommend it.",
    "Hist 125 surveys America's financial history and relationship with capitalism since the late 1800s. As the title claims, it exposes the different angles that capitalism has affected American thought. I would recommend it to a serious student who is interested in American history, economics, or capitalism."
