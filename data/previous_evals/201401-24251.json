    "I would recommend this course. By the end of the seminar our class had really bonded. It's great to see what other people are producing. I think many people discredit art courses too much. There is something so precious about the act of creation. It would be in your best interest to take this class if you can get in! On the application make sure your write a reason why you want to get in that is is thoughtful. I don't think you get by with leaving that section blank!",
    "Such an awesome class!! You get to paint on Yale's dime! Must take course. Only work ethic needed.",
    "Learn the basics of watercolor painting. Every week look at a different famous painter and try to emulate their techniques. When it's nice out we get to paint outside! Half of class is looking at\/talking about paintings, the other half is actually painting. Occasionally we have group crits where everyone puts up their paintings and we talk about them. You don't need any painting experience to take this class!",
    "Absolutely take it. As someone who hadn't done any art in the LONGEST time, I was a bit hesitant at first, but Prof. Van Doren is an amazing teacher. You'll learn the works of the most major watercolorists in history, but also get to paint in class. Just remember that if you want to improve - which you will I promise - it does take time to do at least one large and one small painting a week at home. But it's so worth it! It's so fun and relaxing, and I promise you'll get better every time you pick up the brush.",
    "Great intro to watercolor class! Great 5th class if you can get in and great time to start a hobby.",
    "Mastering the Art of Watercolor is a great class. Super stress free and fun. Professor Van Doren is so enthusiastic and encouraging, so even at your lowest moments you feel able to keep trying again. I learned a lot, and though I\u2019m not a professional painter at this point by any means, I have developed a new sense of the light and color in the world around me which is useful far beyond painting.",
    "Fantastic class, so glad I got the opportunity. The strength is Adam and his genuine pleasure in teaching and supporting us. I also like his method of showing us great works and methods then having us try them. The general format is you sketch a little and do a large work once a week, but in reality you don't have to. If you do though, you can really see results and it's a general pleasure during senior spring. Hopefully you have good weather. Excellent excellent excellent.",
    "Best class at Yale",
    "This class is INCREDIBLE! I was lucky enough to get in, and I am so, so glad I decided to take it. I came in with no experience and am coming out of the course with a genuine love for the art of watercolor and confidence in my developing skill set. Professor Van Doren is ADORABLE and it was an absolute joy to work with him every week. He truly loves the medium and is an expert at what he does--learning from him is a true honor. If you get in, TAKE IT!",
    "I absolutely loved this class - Professor Van Doren really tries to give a great overview of all the different watercolorists and different techniques, he doesn't expect any experience and is really supportive. The workload isn't bad, you have to do at least two little sketches and one large painting per week, but there easing is not required by any means and there's only one final term paper. The final gallery show was amazing, because you get to see what your amazing and talented classmates produce! Thank you so much, Professor Van Doren, for all the hard work and showing us all the possibilities of watercolour!",
    "CSDC 300 01 involves reviewing a master's work, such as O'Keefe or Wyatt, discussing their style and such, and then using the rest of class to apply a technique from them into your own painting. We painted outside as much as possible and even when whether didn't permit, we found other exciting places (The Study, top of Art and Architecture Library, etc.) There are occasional critiques throughout and a final paper at the end. Each week's homework is to do one painting and one sketchbook entry. If you're worried about it being stressful at all, do NOT be. It is an art class with a wonderfully positive atmosphere and your level of incoming skill does not matter at all! Definitely take it. Even if you've never picked up a paintbrush!",
    "Loved it. One of my favorite classes at Yale. You get out what you put into it, but I saw myself improve over the course of the semester and really enjoyed learning how to paint from a contemporary master. Take the class, especially if you already have a casual art background.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about watercolor painting in a low-pressure environment! Professor Van Doren is great about introducing new artists and techniques while encouraging each student to develop their own style.",
    "Take this course! I didn't have any experience with painting or art (science major here), and it was a refreshing course. Each class begins with a small lecture on an artist, a critic of work where you get positive feedback and to see what others in class are painting, and then you go out and paint for the second half of the seminar. Professor Van Doren was an excellent teacher, and encouraged us to adopt new techniques every week. The course ends with a paper where you can explore the life of an artist and how they worked with watercolors. Overall, an amazing course, and if you get in, definitely take it!"
