    "I marked that the pace of this course was too fast because too many topics were cramped into the semester. I think that it would have been better to reduce the number of topics and to encourage a discussion that went in depth. It seemed like most everything that was discussed was discussed on a superficial level. For the few times that the discussion was going really in depth, it then seemed like no one was prepared for it. I definitely think the course would have been better if there were less topics covered, in other words only one topic per class rather than the two so that we could really take in the readings for one topic and carry on a discussion in depth.",

    "the ability to apply soil science concepts to real-world uses, such as research, restoration, forestry, or farming. Also, the opportunity to discuss problems and issues with peers was very useful.",
    "The discussions and presentations by instructor, guest lecturers, and students",
    "This course was very much open to critical analysis and discussions. The professor helped in facilitating discussions.",
    "The field trips were unquestionably the best. I really enjoyed them and they were great opportunities to learn hands on. I would suggest having at least 4-5 fields trips a semester, at least.",

    "The field trips can be better",
    "Discussion could use the most improvement. I don't think that it is necessary to have a lecture before discussion and that discussion should just run for the entire seminar. The format of lecture\/discussion then another lecture\/discussion made it difficult for the discussions to go anywhere.",
    "I thought the discussions were the best part of the course while the lecture component seemed a bit redundant to me at times. I think that time could have been better used to do a briefer overview and then move into more discussion.",

    "Knowing the type of soils, their characteristics, composition and limitations is useful for their conservation and management either in forest management, plantation development or ecological restoration projects. It is therefore very relevant for my overall program by helping me to better understand other courses in forestry.",
    "My masters research is in soil science, and this course was perfect for my analysis of results, etc.",
    "The course has relevance to my research projects, however, not necessarily to my coursework overall here at F&ES. I think it does provide information to really consider for understanding any environment and in conducting any research. I found the course valuable for my interests but not crucial to them.",
    "I'm very interested in Soil Conservation, and it was a great overview of the topic. It seemed a bit heavy on the tropics, which I understand is Florencia's area of expertise and also where a lot of soil conservation is necessary, but it would be interesting to see more and read more from other geographical contexts."
