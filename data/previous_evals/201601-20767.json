   "comments": [
    "As the class currently is, I would not - though a good workload and content that is worthwhile, the lectures are lackluster and despite potential for them - there are not edifying class discussions.",
    "A more honest title would be Experiments in Primate Intelligence. I know a variety of other reviews have said this, however, you REALLY have to be sure you like Chimpanzees. While this seems rather doable as far as the biological anthropology course requirement for the major, it gets rather tedious and incredibly dry after Week 5 or so. While different experiments are discussed, be prepared for a lot of repetition. Assignments are very manageable if you know how to write and attend lecture at least once a week, however, don't expect much feedback.",
    "Take this course if you would like to learn about this topic with a knowlegable professor. Don't get scared by the amount of reading or mentions of chimpanzees. I really enjoyed writing the papers although they took a bit a time to write.",
    "An interesting class with cool subject matter. The professor is cool, just hard to stay awake.",
    "I would say only if you are a cognitive science major, since it is a little esoteric. Otherwise, it was a little hard to get motivated.",
    "Interesting class if you're really invested in primates and especially experiments with them. No tests, quizzes, or finals. Four short reading responses (2-3 pp.), three longer short essays (3-4 pp.), and a research paper that's 40% of your grade. Lectures can be dry but low workload. Don't have to do the readings.",
    "The content of the course is interesting, but the lectures are very boring. However, the class is very easy in terms of assignments: a reading response about every week and then a final paper."
