   "comments": [
    "A nice introductory course for music theory for those who don't know much about music. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great class for a beginner if they are willing to put daily work in.",
    "Great course for those with little to no musical background. Students went from being unable to read music to composing their own pieces. It sounds daunting up front, but if you go through with the course you will see it is not that way.",
    "Music 110 is a great way to rapidly improve your basic skills in music reading and analysis. I recommend this to any student who has no background in music and wishes to learn.",
    "Fun class, take it if you like your teacher. Didn't take much work at all, maybe a couple of hours a week max. Final composition is also totally doable -- you get a lot of guidance which I think we all loved! Also cool that we wrote a song, given that we didn't know much before this class."
