   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Material is interesting and the exams are straightforward from the material given.",
    "It's a great Psych class with no prereqs. Really fun, not too much work. Very clear exam and paper expectations. A pretty perfect course.",
    "A good social psych class if you're in the psych major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is fascinating to learn about the science behind different types of relationships, and is very applicable to everyday life!",
    "Perfect Credit D class",
    "A relaxed lecture that teaches you a lot of real-world material. Would recommend.",
    "I think you should definitely take it if you are at least moderately interested in the dynamics and nuances of intimate relationships. It actually gave me a lot of ways to kind of apply the knowledge to the relationships that I have now and allowed me to find better relationships and enhance existing ones. The readings are not too bad either, and the textbook is easily one of the most interesting and well-written textbooks. It doesn't feel like a textbook, but rather a conversation with the author. The tests are fair and even easy if you studied and read all the lecture notes as well as the readings, and the papers are really straightforward as long as you reach out partially to the professor about it beforehand.",
    "Great class, but if you're not a psych major consider taking it as a credit\/D\/Fail class. The curve won't help you...",
    "A MUST TAKE and a wonderful 5th class. I took this course Credit\/D, but the material is so fascinating that you end up just wanting to study for the tests anyways. Definitely read the Miller book for your personal benefit. Also, Professor Clark is the sweetest and kindest professor. She even hosted a study session at her house with tons of amazing food.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major. The course covers a large variety of information on relationship studies, and this information is very practical to everyday life as well.",
    "I would recommend for any psychology major trying to expand their knowledge of attractions and relationships. It's a very cool class.",
    "Very interesting course. I would recommend it (especially if you need to fulfill the distributional requirement).",
    "Take it!",
    "Loved this class. Margaret Clark is a fantastic and accessible lecturer. Not only this, but the material is so interesting and applicable to ANYONE's life. If you can get in, definitely take it. She's so good!!",
    "As a fun, interesting course that is not so challenging this course explores a topic that is central to our lives. While we may intuitively understand some of the findings central to the field, it is interesting to see the different methodologies that researchers have devised to arrive at those conclusions in a scientific manner. It is an exciting field that is growing and students will enjoy exploring it if they have time and space in their schedule. It is difficult to get into, but worth it if you do.",
    "This class is a great introduction to psychological principles-- concerning academic theories and the experimental methods used to arrive at these theories. Students are able to relate to the class on a personal level, considering it deals with human interaction, and this class helps to clarify elements of personal relationships one may not think of explicitly in everyday life. This class was a pleasure to take!",
    "Yes! Learn a lot about attraction and relationships, through studies that solidify data collected from the class that we've all observed in our own lives",
    "great course, very manageable workload, interesting material, you learn things that are actually useful in the real world, great course not just for psychology majors, but for everyone. But if you're a psych major, would definitely recommend using this course to fulfill requirements.",
    "Very interesting course material and extremely applicable no matter what your major is. Highly recommended.",
    "A cool class on attraction and relationships and their importance.",
    "A good class to take if you are genuinely interested in the subject. A lot of useful information that overlaps other Psych classes and I finished the semester with knowledge I can use in future classes.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone who is at all interested in attraction and relationships.",
    "Yes. Very interesting course!"
