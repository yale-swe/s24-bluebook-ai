    "I would definitely recommend this class. It takes spanish 110 to the next level and adds on more vocabulary and grammar. After taking this class, I fee like I have a much better understanding of the language and I am much more proficient even though it was only my second semester of the language.",
    "This is a basic introductory Spanish course that provides a good foundation in the Spanish language.",
    "Don't do Spanish.Seriously.",
    "I would recommend this class if you took spanish 1 and are planning on taking spanish 3.",
    "Yeah, if the student is interested in Spanish...",
    "Spanish 120 is definitely tougher than Spanish 110, but at the end you feel like you know a good amount of Spanish.",
    "I took this class mostly for fun my senior year. I definitely got sick of going to it everyday, but it's an easy way to fulfill your language requirement. Professor Garcia Donoso is overall a pretty good professor who presents material clearly and answers questions well."
