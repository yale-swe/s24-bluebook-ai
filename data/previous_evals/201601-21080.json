    "Awesome opportunity: don't squander it. Do real research that matters: try to secure funding to pursue a cool experiment idea, and see if you can get it published! If you don't continue in Cognitive Science, you will always have your thesis to be proud of. Hopefully they change it to a full credit for you, though.",
    "It's a chance to learn about the theses of other CogSci majors. It's far more work than the credits suggest. If you still have to take a regular semester's worth of credit's (4 or more) make sure to choose other classes that aren't that much work.",
    "Well, if you're a senior cogsci major, this course is required - so take it if you are one and don't take it if you're not!",
    "This class is just for seniors of the Cognitive Science major to present their thesis. It's not a lot of work outside of your thesis, and you write critiques for other people's theses and receive helpful critiques of your own. Overall, this course was fascinating, but it suffered from simple boredom throughout all of the classes.",
    "The class was fun because Cog Sci is the best and I love our crew. Our groupme is amazing. Mark did a great job wrangling all of us - thank you Mark! Real talk though: I wish this class had been a full credit. It made my senior spring a lot more difficult trying to find another half-credit course to compliment this one.",
    "This is mandatory, so you must take it. But it is pretty fun and interesting to hear about everyone's senior thesis and workshop ideas together.",
    "You have to take this, but it's easy and fun. Just present your project to your classmates.",
    "CGSC 491 is an awesome opportunity to hear about the research your fellow cognitive science majors are doing, and to get real experience running an independent research project. The class is a lot of work, but also extremely rewarding. Mark is the best!",
    "A two-hour seminar for a half-credit course is a pretty big time commitment every week, but I think it was really worth it to see what my classmates were researching and the questions they were asking. The cogsci major is so diverse, and I enjoyed the wide spread of topics. My classmates were all incredibly helpful with feedback and curious when asking questions during student presentations (even though the loose laptop policy in class meant that sometimes attentional drift happened...) Mark is also a great and hilarious colloquium leader! I was really impressed by Mark's astute comments and insightful suggestions for every presentation, no matter how far away it may have been from his particular field of study. Like many of the other students, I was not taking research for credit this semester, and so this half credit encompassed my entire senior thesis, plus research time, class time, and the time it took to do the three peer reviews. I would push for this class to be worth at least 1 credit in the future."
