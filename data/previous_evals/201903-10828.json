    "I picked up new techniques related to the analysis of my data, and gained practice in writing up my research in a manuscript format.",
    "I have learned a great deal about taxonomy and the classification of insects, as well as what types of features are used by biologists to differentiate between clades. I had very rarely used an actual classification key before starting my research project, and I have found it fascinating though difficult at times.",
    "Pure research skills, collaboration, long term project design,",
    "I learned how to do independent research (including data collection and manuscript writing) for my senior thesis.",
    "I learned that I enjoy research, which I did not expect. I, personally, learned a lot about heterogeneity and about zooplankton.",
    "I got better at doing independent research, collaborating with other students and mentors, and managing my time. I taught myself to code in Matlab and greatly improved my knowledge of R.",
    "I think I moreso continued developing my prior research skills and experiences.",
    "I built upon my knowledge of lab skills, and took on a more independent role in driving my project."

   "comments": [
    "Your success and enjoyment in this course is determined entirely by your relationship with your adviser. Beyond the initial grant proposal and final writeup, what this course entails will be up to you and your advisor alone. The final writeup may merit more intensive requirements in order to better distribute thesis labor across the two semesters.",
    "I love my research topic, which made it very easy for me to spend 10 hours per week in the lab. Marta is absolutely wonderful and is a caring mentor, providing guidance and insight for my project.",
    "I didnt get much guidance but it was there whenever I needed it- made me feel really independent but confident that in cases when I needed assistance, it was there.",
    "The course is entirely what you make of it. If you put in time to do research, you'll get a lot out of it. If you don't, no one really holds you accountable and your own thesis will suffer.",
    "I would have benefited from more guidance about how to approach potential thesis advisers, and in general, with more advice as a junior about how thesis research worked.",
    "There wasn't much structure to this course, so there isn't very much to evaluate. It is what you make of itI think the lack of guidance was absolutely what I needed, because I set up a schedule with my lab. Some students may have preferred more structure.",
    "It's your research so its adviser dependent.",
    "Strengths: I was able to spend a lot of time in lab. No weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend that any E&EB major completes their thesis over the course of two semesters, rather than saving it for the spring. Research is time-intensive and always slower than expected; I couldn't imagine finishing my project in one semester alone.",
    "Given that you have a topic that is personally fascinating and enjoyable to explore, I would highly recommend this course to other E&EB students. There is much to explore, especially considering the astounding diversity of life, and this course is a great way to dive deeper.",
    "Yes. Plus its probably required if youre reading this.",
    "If you need it.",
    "You have to take it so this question is a little irrelevant, but honestly, I have enjoyed working on my thesis much more than I expected to.",
    "Absolutely! Doing a self-directed research project is one of the most valuable experiences you can get if you're going to grad school (or even if you're not). Spending time in my lab has introduced me to lab work and to working with others in an office setting. It felt more like adult work than like school, and I had a lot of fun in addition to learning many new skills and topics.",
    "I mean, if you have to do it you have to do it",
    "Definitely."
