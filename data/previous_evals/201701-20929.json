    "This lab was incredible-by far one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Wolenski and Don were invested in the class and our learning, teaching us so much about research but also life. I learned new cell biology lab techniques but also so much about possible career paths in biology and medicine.",
    "A) IMPORTANT -- READ WHAT I WROTE IF YOU ARE UNSURE ABOUT THIS CLASS If you are a freshman, sophomore, or junior reading this (and you are considering taking MCDB cell bio and eventually this labs class), THEN TAKE BOTH CELL BIO AND THIS LABS CLASS. You will want to sign up for both MCDB 344L (1st half of spring term) and MCDB 345L (2nd half of spring term). This was my favorite MCDB class ever. Joseph Wolenski might seem curt in his emails, but please trust me when I say that Professor Wolenski is not only one of THE nicest guys at Yale, but also one of the best teachers as well. Here is a breakdown of the class: 1. There is NO homework or lab report write -ups! For MCDB 344L, you will have to give a 15 min. presentation on a recent published paper. The goal of this is to help you with your presentation skills and help build confidence. You will also have a mini quiz at the end of MCDB 344L about the experiments that you did. In MCDB 345L, we do more experiments. The only thing you will be graded on here is a 5 min. mini-presentation in which you have to explain an assigned topic (ex. super resolution microscopy, GLUT4-insulin binding, etc.). It's very chill. *Note: the experiments are usually new and relevant -- Wolenski doesn't really recycle experiments from past years (and he's been teaching this class for 24 years now). 2. You should take this class because you will become extremely close with the other 14 students taking the class. Everyone in the class is on the same team -- we all help each other out during experiments and we all leave class at the same time. It's a really nice environment. 3. When does the class meet? Both MCDB 344L and MCDB 345L meet on Mondays AND Wednesdays, from 1:30pm to around 5:30pm (sometimes 6:00pm). Yes, this is a commitment. BUT IT IS WORTH IT. You learn so much from this class -- all the times you in your inttro bio classes that you heard about Western Blots, Immunoprecipitation, phase contrast microscopy, etc., you ACTUALLY do those techniques here. Take this lab even if you are already working in another lab for independent research. Take this lab even if you are in YSO (if your rehearsals conflict with MCDB 344L\/345L, then tell Toshi that you are going to take a break from YSO during the spring when this class meets). If you are a student athlete and have practices that begin at 5:00pm or 5:30pm, it might be difficult but try to convince your coach to let you arrive around 6:00pm on Mon\/Wed. 4. Professor Wolenski and his 2 TAs (which he personally picks, and the TAs each year are AMAZING) are THE BEST at explaining concepts. They are very knowledgeable about life and extremely understanding\/compassionate. You will learn so much from this class and feel more confident as an MCDB major.",
    "Science and medicine go hand in hand. If you are a doctor, you owe it to the world and to your patients to approach everything with a curiosity and desire to improve the status quo.",
    "A wonderful continuation of 344 that built upon and expanded that arsenal of skills.",
    "Much like 344L, this is the best lab class you could hope to take at Yale. Get on the waiting list early. You'll actually have fun, learn a lot (and more than just biology -- you'll learn to give good presentations and about medicine too, if you are interested) and it's such a stress free environment. Great way to facilitate learning.",
    "This course continued the work of the first half in teaching me to feel comfortable in a biological laboratory setting. Some experiments were with protocols written out entirely or us, but some allowed us choice, and forced us to think through what results we wanted, and what techniques might get us there. That practice was and will be incredibly helpful, and was a significant help in my scientific learning. One other thing that this course taught was short-form presentation, through chalk-talks. We were assigned topics to teach to the rest of the class in under five minutes, without notes or a PowerPoint - just you and the chalkboard. It was terrific practice for public speaking, and helped us learn the presented concepts well.",
    "I learned how to approach scientific problems, formulate insightful questions, and design experiments. I of course learned cell biology laboratory techniques. I also learned how to give scientific talks.",
    "This course (taken with 344L) is definitely my favorite course so far at Yale - take it! The professor and the TAs for both modules are incredibly dedicated to teaching and to making sure you're keeping up with the class. In addition to twice a week labs, we presented chalk talks to the entire class. As for experimental techniques, I performed cell cultures, immunoprecipitation, and western blots for the first time, although we also did cell cultures in 344L.",
    "I developed my skills in the laboratory, learning lots of techniques that I had never used before.",
    "You'll learn how to be a scientist, both in practice and in theory. You'll be inspired. You'll meet amazing people and THE BEST PROFESSOR at Yale. You'll have great snacks. You'll learn super useful lab techniques and experimental design - you'll be taking the best class at Yale.",
    "Before this course I had never spent time in a biology laboratory before and now I feel ready and excited to begin working on my senior thesis for MCDB next year in a lab at the medical school. We learned an incredible amount about nsAA incorporation, gels\/Western blots as well as experimental design. I also developed a strong presentation giving skill set -- learning how to perform a job talk and chalk talk.",
    "As cheesy as this sounds, I learned how to be a scientist. I learned to approach uncertainty with curiosity and enthusiasm and to embrace unexpected results."

   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses. Keep the class as it is. Keep the location in SCL.",
    "Again, a fantastic course that I know I will apply the skills in all my future laboratory work.",
    "Again, like 344L, you can clearly see how much time and effort both the TAs and Professor Wolenski go through to set up this course. They're understanding and kind (sometimes let us leave early to study for a midterm or whatever) and have so much patience. You never have to feel like you're asking a dumb question or anything like that.",
    "The chalk talks were a highlight of the course, making us prepare speeches on short notice, to be given without notes. The course as a whole was incredibly strong, and gave us great opportunities to practice being in a laboratory setting and work through protocols, sometimes designing them ourselves!",
    "The course is fantastic, and I cannot think of any improvements I would make.",
    "The strengths of this course were that the instructor and TA(s) were all very knowledgeable, dedicated, and enthusiastic about the course. Lessons were always prepared, and the instructors were flexible to new ideas and schedule changes. Even though this was the first year we investigated TUG binding, the classes flowed well. Being a smaller MCDB class, I also got to know a lot of my MCDB peers. The course was also set up in a way that encouraged students to work with each other and ask for help - which I definitely did a lot!",
    "This course was mostly the same as MCDB 344L, in that we were in the same lab with the same people and instructor, so most of my review is the same! The only major differences were that we had a different TA and that we covered different procedures in the lab. As I said for MCDB 344L, this class was amazing! Again, I loved the material, the TA, and the professor. And I still think that the small class size and twice-a-week format were the two biggest strengths and that there were no major weaknesses.",
    "No weaknesses! Best course ever.",
    "I thought it was great that the culture of the course was very laid-back because there was no shame or fear in making mistakes (unlike previous labs I've had, where much pressure was put on making sure that the lab was done correctly). I loved that this allowed me to really sit back and relax and actually learn. The class was very organized, and the classes all flew by! Can't think of any weaknesses!"

    "Absolutely. The class is incredible and you will walk away having gained so much in biology research and just about life and your career in general. You will also make 17 lab mate friends, and have Professor Wolenski and your TA as lifelong mentors.",

    "Yes! It's a great foundational course for any kind of biological research.",
    "MOST DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Wolenski is amazing and you will gain a lot from the experience. Hand down best lab at Yale.",
    "Again, TAKE IT. All the evaluations are true, this really is a must-take class. Just know the time committment before you get yourself into it. Once you commit, dive in - that's how you'll make the most of it.",
    "Take it! It's a fabulous class - but you should probably email Wolenski today to get a spot.",
    "This class is absolutely fantastic, and I recommend it strongly. Professor Wolenski is an incredible scientist, professor, and mentor. He runs the lab in a way that enables students to learn a lot, but the class isn't stressful like many of the other labs I have taken at Yale. The TF's in the course are also incredible. The course is a big time commitment, but it is a great experience.",
    "YES, I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in cell bio! This course is my favorite course so far due to the professor, TAs, other students, and course material. Professor Wolenski is understanding and will individually explain concepts to you or procedures if lost. The class meets twice a week and there's a lot of in class time, but there's not that much work outside of class which is nice. Best of all, all experiments are hands on. You're not watching the professor perform techniques or watching videos but rather doing experiments individually or with a partner.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The workload outside of the class is not very high, but you are signing up to be in the lab for 10 hours every week, so that is significant. The time goes by fast, however, and the lab is very enjoyable. You'll learn a lot and you'll have a great time doing it!",
    "You'll learn how to be a scientist, both in practice and in theory. You'll be inspired. You'll meet amazing people and THE BEST PROFESSOR at Yale. You'll have great snacks. You'll learn super useful lab techniques and experimental design - you'll be taking the best class at Yale.",
    "This course is incredible -- you become so close to your lab family and really learn how to work well with others in a lab. It is unlike any other lab course I have taken at Yale (I actually looked forward to coming to lab each Monday and Friday!). This was really due to the team-like environment of the lab and the fascinating experiments we were always running. Although the amount of hours you commit to this lab are high, the amount of time you dedicate to the course outside of lab is minimal (except for preparing two presentations -- one for 344 and the other for 345).",
    "YES, TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Wolenski and the TA's are fantastic. I thought it was great that the culture of the course was very laid-back because there was no shame or fear in making mistakes (unlike previous labs I've had, where much pressure was put on making sure that the lab was done correctly). I loved that this allowed me to really sit back and relax and actually learn. The class was very organized, and the classes all flew by!",
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough! It is definitely one of the most valuable academic experience in my time at Yale, thanks to Professor Wolenski's enthusiasm for teaching, love of experimental science, and a uniquely respectful and caring manner in which he treats every individual student. By all means take this course if you can get in ! You will grow intellectually throughout the semester, not only as a well-rounded scientist, but also as a person. The friendships, values and knowledge of both cell biology and life that you build in this class will stay a part of you for the lifetime."
