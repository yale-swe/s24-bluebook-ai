    "Highly recommended. The class looks at American history through the lens of Yale graduates and Yale's history.",
    "This class attracts students who love Yale. Take it for your peers and for a fun time, but don't expect to walk away having learned much (but you'll take away some great memories)",
    "This class ranges from broad, heated discussions about what makes Yale different from Harvard or what Yale's core values are and how they've changed over time all the way to specifics about the Yale Bowl and historic college Masters. I absolutely recommend this course if you can get in, and even if you can't, it's worth a try so you can hopefully get in the following year. Prof. G is the most spirited and enthusiastic Yalie I've ever met and he'll get you just as excited about class discussions as he is.",
    "Y&A is a great course for senior year! Where else are you going to learn about Yale history, and America through the lens of Yale figures\/graduates? Professor G is awesome--but a lot of the class is him talking about way too much stuff and random stories. It's really fun, but really scattered.",
    "A perfect senior year course, a truly great way to wrap up my Yale experience.",
    "A fun and fantastic junior\/senior seminar to enrich your understanding of Yale and its impact on the world. I don't need to sell this class to you. Gitlin is a gem, the guests who come by, from Sam Chauncey (who was the Secretary of Yale for a number of years and played a huge role in keeping Yale safe during the Black Panther riots as well as for making Yale co-educational, and he essentially co-teaches the class) to alums and parents, it's a lot of interpersonal and engaging learning. You read some great books too, like Stover at Yale, and engage with primary sources from Yale's archives. Can't recommend this more highly.",
    "Yes! Will change the way you see your Yale education (as well as American history more generally). Just be sure you pick a final paper topic that interests you and try to get a little bit of a head start.",
    "PROS: - Prof. is enthusiastic and knowledgeable - Two graded assignments. The rest are presentations. I think everyone gets an A. - Lots of fun events, and the subject matter is really interesting - Two old-time Yalies sit in on the class; one was Secretary of Yale for a stint CONS: - Prof. is REALLY scattered and disorganized. Often we'll spend a third of the time handling administrative stuff, then he'll pull out a dozen handouts and people will proceed to NOT talk about them, the reading, or anything. Basically, super unfocused, with no clear arc in the class material. - Enormous amounts of reading, but nobody does any of it because it is never discussed in class"
