   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it to a friend who wanted to better their acting skills. The course is incredible and I wish I could take it again.",
    "This course entirely depends on the professor, since they construct the majority of the curricula. I would encourage students to ask around about each professor and not sacrifice a career-changing experience for a section that's not early in the day.",
    "Highly recommended. Learned a lot about myself as an actor and as a person. Very practical and applicable to the real world.",
    "It is a hands-on practical theater class that gets you actually practicing performance and not just talking about it. I would 150% recommend it to another student. I'm not a theater studies major (I'm American Studies) and I was still very impressed with it and thought it was a formative learning experience. Great for students who want to go into the professional theater business.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. We need practical acting courses at Yale so actors can learn different ways to improve their technique. We covered neutral masks, dissecting our own physicality, building a character, and then scene work. We did one scene against type, one scene according to type and then ended with monologues. It was a great mix of practicality and a variety of helpful exercises.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students. Many of the drama department's classes are theoretical rather than practical. These courses serve a role. But if the department wants to expand, make its courses more interdisciplinary, and teach students of all walks of life, it needs to focus more on practical acting skills. This class teaches students more than just how to act. It teaches them how to be aware of social interactions, how they present themselves, and how they are perceived by others. This is not just career training. It's life training."
