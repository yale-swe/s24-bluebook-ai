    "Yes definitely take it if you get in. The main focus is a research project, so be sure that you enjoy research before signing up, but if research is your thing then this class is a great opportunity",
    "Very laidback journal-club style course which I really enjoyed. All the faculty are great and the guests were interesting. The students were really engaged which made for a good environment. A great addition to complement the more structured courses I was taking. The material range was good as it provided something for everyone: some weeks were more bio-mechanism focused while others were more big picture.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. This was a journal club-style seminar where we met once a week to discuss papers in various topic of evolutionary medicine. We also had a couple of guest lecturers who talked to us about their research and about how their personal lives were shaped by their professional careers. By far the best part of this class was Professor Stearns. He is very knowledgeable, thoughtful, and dedicated toward teaching. I especially enjoyed his strong opinions about current events and his insights into careers in academia (both from a scientific and personal life perspective). I received guidance throughout the semester toward my summer research project. The workload was light (3-5 papers\/week, meetings once a week (or twice a week when there is a guest lecturer), and a final research proposal). I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about evolutionary medicine.",
    "EEB460 was an interesting course in terms of getting exposure to evolutionary medicine literature. I found the typical class structure, which involved students getting into pairs or small groups to take one of the weekly assigned 3-4 papers and discuss important\/interesting takeaways, present a key figure, or pose follow-up questions, to be fairly effective. I did think that the discussion of the papers could have been more rigorous, as we rarely delved deeply into the validity of the methods used or conclusions drawn from the data. However, that may have been a limitation that arose from the diverse backgrounds in the class (some held primarily public health backgrounds, others had stronger evolutionary biology backgrounds, and yet others with mainly molecular biology or immunology backgrounds). I also would have enjoyed listening to Professor Stearns lecture more - I was always incredibly struck by his wealth of insights and familiarity with literature. Finally, I found the invited scientists to be both scientifically and personally interesting - although personally, I typically found the conversations about the former to be more useful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students interested in evolution, medicine, or both. It's a rare opportunity for science students to engage with fascinating material in a seminar setting. We read a few papers per week and met once a week to discuss the readings. There are also ~3 dinners throughout the semester with speakers doing relevant research. The students who are drawn to the course are all extremely bright and offer interesting perspectives on the readings as well."
