    "I learned about the history of Republican China and have a clearer understanding of the current scholarly discourse on the period. I also learned more about what goes into producing a monograph, turning a dissertation into a book, and different strategies for PhD and post-doctoral work.",
    "I gained professional development knowledge. We discussed about how to set topics, how to participate in the field, how to turn my PhD thesis into a book... Our skills in reviewing and comparing books are also enhanced.",
    "I learned the history of China's Republican period from many angles, such as citizenship, labor, gender, etc. The course also helps me develop the skill of evaluating a history work.",
    "I learned the most up-to-date scholarly books written on China's Republican Period.",
    "Not only did the class provide me with my first survey of the history of the Republic of China, I feel that I now have a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be a professional historian."

   "comments": [
    "Compared with other courses, Professor Ho generally gave slightly less 'input' and would let students lead the discussion. I think this is good because it gives students a lot of space to air their thoughts and opinions. Professor Ho also gave us valuable advice about academia, writing etc. from her own experiences. Perhaps the classes could be improved by hearing more from Professor Ho about her opinions about the historical issues discussed. Also, while some of the questions about how the books were written, their structure, the writing, the titles etc. were important questions to consider and have improved the way I criticise books in other courses, sometimes these questions would be repeated across classes and, looking back, I feel it maybe would have been better to spend more time discussing the historical events and issues themselves. Also, the second book\/book chapter would always get less attention. I think it's good to focus on one book, read well, but maybe the book can be paired with a journal article instead. It could also be good to be given a few preliminary questions to consider when reading the book which everyone can discuss as a class. These questions could be decided upon at the end of the previous week's class, then everyone will have at least one or two opinions on an issue.",
    "The semi-structured discussion format was useful, as it meant that dead discussion could easily be redirected to another question or topic of interest. I also appreciated the focus on academic writing, since it is something most of us in the class are or will soon be pursuing. In the future (if this is feasible) it might be useful to have discussion leaders send the questions in a day earlier so that the rest of the class can begin to think about the themes and topics of the readings that the discussion leaders hope to engage with in class.",
    "Strengths: responsible and knowledgeable instructor, productive discussion",
    "I like the way the course was structured and the books assigned to us. However, I would personally like more comments and inputs from the professor because sometimes it feels to me the discussions by students were a bit hard to follow.",
    "I believe that the reading list was appropriate and covered a range of important topics. We had an in-class debate on the merits of a \"gender\" week, however, and I feel that having one class period, perhaps at the end of the semester, where students in the class can pick a thematic topic that we think deserves its own week of study."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a great chance to improve discussion skills and learn how to formulate opinions. Moreover, the Republican period of Chinese history is actually fascinating and full of complex historical problems. It was great to learn about these.",
    "Yes. While seminar quality often varies depending on students' willingness to engage and attention to the readings, the discussion prep was always able to keep conversation relevant and focused.",
    "Yes. This course has enhanced my knowledge of the field and my book reviewing skills.",
    "Yes, I will. From this course a student can learn much more than just the \"history\" of a certain period, but develop the skill of historiographical analysis and critical thinking.",
    "Yes. I think it's an essential course to take if one wants to learn about Republican China.",
    "Absolutely. The books could be occasionally uninteresting, but it is material that is rarely covered in other classes. Student discussions were lively and productive, and the instructor organized and led the class in a thoughtful and stimulating way."
