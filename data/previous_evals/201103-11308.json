    "I did enjoy this course, though I felt that some lectures were too broad (overviews) while others were very nitty-gritty in the marshes. The lecture on timber markets in general should be thrown out.I think some better readings could substitute for overview lectures, and then Deb could do what she does best--going into how to understand the numbers and do modeling.Deb's very likeable, very talented at her work, very approachable, and a great asset to the school in terms of the teaching staff. I really appreciate having some practitioners in the school--for those of us looking at how we take theory into practice. And I learned amazing financial tools that would be useful even should I just simply want to buy my own property or piece of land and project costs--she helped me overcome my fear of number-crunching!",
    "Q4 and Q6 - While prof. Spalding sought to give make the class accessible to all students, I felt that the class could have been a bit more challenging, and there could have been a few more valuation exercises.",
    "2. prof. spalding is a very intelligent and entertaining lecturer and is great at explaining the concepts in the class. 3. the quantitative assignments were really useful - and i think a few more of them could be incorporated into the class - they were not very difficult or time consuming once we figured out what we were doing, and if we had a few more of them (maybe weekly?) it would become second nature. 6. pace of the class is difficult to judge - there were just too many topics - i would have liked less time on ecosystem services and more time on forest finance. 7. instructor and TA were both excellent - responsive to questions. the TA was REALLY HELPFUL. 8. course not \"excellent\" only because i think there was too much in the syllabus - should be two separate classes.",
    "A lot of material to cover and students from many backgrounds makes pitching this course at the right level a real challenge. Excellent job dealing with this, however.",
    "N\/A",
    "Question 7: Deborah Spalding provides an excellent 'practioner' perspective that is needed more often at FES. I recommend her classes to anyone at FES.",
    "1. The Klemperer book was excellent.7b. The TA was exceptionally good- he was always available and did a great job bringing people up to speed on Excel.I appreciated Professor Spalding's willingness to accept feedback and her responsiveness to our comments.",
    "Understanding land valuation is possibly one of the most important skills that FES should offer. I enjoyed Prof. Spalding's \"hands-on\" professional angle on these topics, especially because an egg-headed academic view would like not be effective post-graduation.That said, the course could benefit from more structure, and could leverage existing FES courses to boost student learning. For example, the professional skills module on finance could be offered con-currently.FES should endeavor to strengthen this course, perhaps offering various versions for foresters and business and the environment oriented professionals that stress different components. Prof. Spalding's focus on applicability should also be maintained for effectiveness.Lastly, the readings were great - but out always in context or directly relevant to each lecture. I know this is difficult - but perhaps more professional type market analysis could be integrated to keep the theory reading more fresh with practice. Just an idea.",
    "This course was a very valuable one. We were told at the outset that the class, which was being taught by Professor Spalding for the first time, might involve some kinks and that our ongoing feedback would be very helpful. But actually, I thought it was very well taught, very well laid out, and exceeded my expectations for what I'd get out of it.",
    "Overall, Deb is a great teacher, but we stayed on discount rates and forestry for way too long, and didn't leave enough time for ecosystem services, as promised in the grand compromise once all student interests were revealed"

    "Dominick's sessions on how to build a Proforma in Excel were ESSENTIAL for me, as I hadn't used the program regularly in 15 years. Excellent tutorials. Should in fact be incorporated as one of the lectures, if a TA can't offer this him\/herself moving forward.Homework assignments were excellent. I would move Bigass County post timber PAI\/MAI exercise.",
    "There is nothing more refreshing than having a professional in the field teach you. I love academia, but we don't have enough working professionals to teach us about how things will really be on the other side. Prof. Spalding told it like it was, and that was extremely refreshing.",
    "prof spalding's lecture style, the forest finance content of the syllabus, and prof. spalding's approach to decision-making under uncertainty. it was GREAT having a practitioner teach this class rather than an academic!!!! prof. spalding brought a great deal of credibility - she's been out there, dealing with these things in the real world.",
    "Lectures were often thoughtful conversations. Assignments helped with practical implications of lectures.",
    "The instructor! She is very knowledgeable, open to discussions and straight-forward. I learned a lot from her and she could discuss different topics openly and easily.",
    "The homework assignments and final projects pulled together concepts from class. This was where the real learning took place. I really benefited from the discussion after the second homework assignment of comparing 3 properties. More follow-up discussions would be beneficial.",
    "Professor Deborah Spalding.",
    "Professor Spalding gave engaging, honest and well-informed lectures on material that is essential for aspiring land managers.The assignments were challenging and great. I would have like to have had more excel-based work because that was something that forced me to learn the program far better than I ever had before. I think we could have increased the number of assignments by 25% and that would have been reasonable as well as a way for the students to get more feedback on their progress.",
    "The instructor was very open and honest about the nature of the concepts in the course, giving a real-world practitioner perspective on forest finance. This was really helpful for my neophyte understanding of the field. The course focused on practical elements of forest finance, which I found to be most helpful for my preparation of land management.",
    "The Prof.'s professional experience and willingness to share information about actual real-world conditions\/deals in which she participated.",
    "Deborah's experience in finance and wetland mitigation markets",
    "The professor's experience in the field, and her willingness to share with the class.",
    "The real-world applicability of what we were learning and how up-to-the-minute the information tended to be. On our projects\/assignments, Professor Spalding was good at giving us just enough information to work with, but also the challenge to try to make sense of sometimes scarce information (which is how forest and ecosystem finance usually happens). As somebody in the class who did not have very much experience with excel or financial models, I felt that she did a great job getting us up the learning curve quickly so as to arm us with the basic tools to roll our sleeves up with.",
    "The final project - and the emphasis on preparing for it throughout the semester.",
    "Real world examples.",
    "Gives you a financial perspective on forestry and ecosystem investments, where the concern is really about whether or not these things can be profitable. Sounds cynical that we want to make a profit on nature or be economically efficient, but the claim that we can is what TEEB and environmental economists are trying to make, that ecological and financial incentives can align. This course forces you to do some of the math rather than just debate the arguments for and against.",
    "Deb's candid portrayal of the business from a practitioner's perspective",
    "Deborah has a wealth of real world experience in finance, which you can't get from an academic."

   "comments": [
    "I would encourage Deb to do more on carbon markets--many of us are interested in those, even the volunteer markets. I didn't get much out of this course in that respect.I would have also liked for Deb to talk a bit more about opportunities for land conservation and renewable energy development, and talking us through a few specific case studies of wind turbines on conserved lands, or similar projects--how could we emulate something of the sort.Also,Deb did seem to have too much going on in her company this semester to devote heart& soul to this course. I realize it's the first time the course was taught, so every lecture, reading, set of slides etc. was brand spanking new and needed to be tweaked, but at the same time that detracts somewhat from the professionalism of the course. I don't want to leave class 30 minutes early, and we did that a few times. I want to get the full amount of knowledge from time with her!",
    "A bit more organization will come if FES is smart enough to have her teach it or a similar class again. She will have learned what worked and what didn't, and will be able to better gauge students' ability, which will result in more challenging homework.",
    "adjustment of the syllabus - move the ecosystem services topics into another course, and leave just one lecture on them to give forest finance folks an idea of what's going on in that world.",
    "I think more assignments (maybe smaller) would be good. Probably cutting out the international investments angle would be good. Also, sticking to just forestry and wetland mitigation I think would work really well. Carbon and habitat, while under separate regulatory frameworks, essentially mimic the same general principles as wetlands, for which there is more rigorous data.",
    "More structure and focus.",
    "More readings regarding valuation process outside of the textbook would be helpful. The recommended book didn't really clear anything up for me.",
    "Additional assignments or readings to keep momentum in the course.",
    "1. Follow-through on the posting of promised materials on v2.2. student engagement during lectures- Professor Spalding gave great lectures, but it would be nice to structure-in more student involvement. Open-ended questions are great, but we also need focused involvement, for example, designating students to lead certain discussions, or posting discussion questions ahead of time.3. It would be really nice to walk the class through a few examples of how people tackled the homework- we could put up their excel models\/spreadsheets and have the student walk us through them.4. We need more readings that cover a range of previous knowledge levels.5. Quicker turnaround on assignments6. More rigorous grading- I think that the grading was a little too lenient.",
    "The assignments were useful, but the one thing that would have made them more effective in reinforcing skills would have been to have more frequent, smaller assignments rather than fewer larger assignments.",
    "More projects involving financial valuation of land and related assets. Retooling of the ecosystems valuation a bit to just offer more examples of ecosystem deals that have gone down.",
    "More on ecosystem services markets",
    "The class could use better overall structuring to effectively progress through the material and build on what came before it. Also, it seemed that the finance aspects of the course were covered but not as in depth as might have been useful.",
    "Updated readings",
    "Need to have more structured lectures and assignments that more clearly state what we are supposed to learn, especially in the first weeks. Need to define more carefully what ecosystem services and mitigation banks are, and draw a clearer line about what it is about forestry investments, timber growth, or financial modeling we should be learning and applying. Assignments were way too open-ended in my opinion, because if we set our own goals, we may miss some of the important concepts. I would recommend shorter, but more timely and frequent assignments.",
    "too much redundancy in forestland investments. also, additional yet shorter weekly assignments would help drive many of the points home. there were (i think) stretches of 3+ weeks without homework, so it was difficult to fully integrate what we were learning",
    "A few more graded assignments would have been good."
