   "comments": [
    "I would recommend GMAN 120 to any student who wants to have the momentum in German after taking GMAN 110.",
    "German 110-120 was the best part of my year! It was always fun and interesting. Professor Schenker taught us so much German in one year, I can barely believe it. After two semesters, we were speaking about all sorts of literary and political issues! If you are looking to start a new language, I could not recommend German highly enough.",
    "If you want to learn German, this is the place to be. Can be a lot of work at times, since the class moves quickly.",
    "If you are going to take German take this class. Have Theresa. German isn't a super difficult language and Theresa makes it even easier. Of course, you have to do work in the class, but the daily homework is minimal and the weekly assignments weren't too bad. Also, no final is a huge bonus. The video projects are difficult but once they are over you are done before reading week.",
    "Theresa's class is more work than any of the other sections, probably (based on my conversations with students in other sections), but you'll also learn more. If you want to see a substantial improvement in your German skills, I'd take this class with Theresa - even though it might mean more work and maybe a lower grade.",
    "German 120 is an outstanding course for any student who wants to learn the German language. It is also excellent for learning about some German culture, German history, and German society. The professor is outstanding, the department is phenomenal, and I can honestly say that I have enjoyed every minute of this course. I highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend GMAN 120 to a fellow student. I think one has a lot to benefit from learning elementary German. And the workload is relatively light.",
    "Yeah totally. Awesome course to learn German, and Theresa is great, if somewhat tough.",
    "Theresa is a great teacher. She is nice but strict, and she corrects even small mistakes, which is incredibly helpful. You have to work hard to do well, and I feel like I learned a lot this semester. This is the iPad section, so there is a ton of homework.",
    "2nd semester German. I am quite proud with the level of German I achieved after only one year. I think I am able to express myself pretty well. However I am not sure that a language credit is the best way to use your yale credits. I think I would've learned more german by living a month in germany than by studying it for a year. but of course some people need to fulfill the requirement, in which case the German department is very strong and definitely a good option."
