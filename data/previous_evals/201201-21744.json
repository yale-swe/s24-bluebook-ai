   "comments": [
    "Terrific class. If you're interested in journalism, you're obviously considering this and its Fall alternative. I've only met Steve Brill once but from that experience I'm extremely, extremely glad I took the class with Mark Schoofs instead. Schoofs is a top-notch journalist with a wealth of amazing stories; a compassionate teacher who makes a huge investment of his time into each student (out-of-class conferences, copious feedback on all assignments); and a passionate believer in good journalism with strong opinions on its core values. This was one of those few classes where a real community developed--aided by field trips but generally encouraged by Mark's unpretentious yet intensely engaging style. Read classic works of journalism, write two large long-form projects with plenty of room for creativity and voice, what's not to like? Well, reporting takes a lot of time, but get used to it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend 467 to another student, especially if Professor Schoofs is teaching it. It's essentially a crash course in journalism: writing, reporting, ethics, business. You may not learn as much about writing as you would from a class like Fred Strebeigh's or Anne Fadiman's, but you will learn so much about journalism as a career, and if you're anything like me, this class--its readings, its guest lecturers, and especially its professor--will get you excited about the possibility of being a professional journalist. You will also gain, in Mark Schoofs, a real mentor and role model. Be prepared to put into this class what you want to get out of it; if you choose an ambitious final project, and spend a lot of time on your profile, you will do a LOT of work, but it will be worth it.",
    "Take this class! You'll writing will improve, and you'll learn a lot about the profession of journalism.",
    "Take the class if you want to learn about how journalism works, but haven't necessarily written a lot of long-form journalism before. There's only one major reporting project in the semester and it's not very long with about 2 months to do it.The field trips to the NYT and ProPublica to talk to reporters and editors really made the class worth it for me. I hadn't really internalized what a life of journalism was like before then, but now I have a better idea going forward into the workforce.",
    "Take journalism, and take it with Schoofs, an exemplary journalist, professor, and human being. He will care about you and your work, and help you become a better reporter and a clearer writer. But to do well, you'll have to put a lot of time into both the reading and the 2 major assignments.",
    "Great journalism course. Provides you with excellent insider perspective on the industry. Mark assigns interesting readings, brings in interesting people, and is a wonderful mentor.",
    "Yes. Extremely time-consuming, and with Mark Schoofs extremely rewarding. Assignments were hard and readings were long. Profile was lots of fun, and the final project ideally required months of preparatory research that most of us couldn't do. But this semester felt worth the time I put in.",
    "What a great course! The discussions were fantastic. You take a few field trips to New York publications. The discussions--often featuring very cool guests (go to lunch with them!)--ended up being a lot about the ethics of journalism, which was a surprise, but ended up being fascinating, topical, and relatable. The only weakness is that hard deadlines tended to move around unpredictably, which made it really hard to stay on top of.Schoofs is a really great guy. He did a good job of leading discussions without stepping on them like some professors tend to do. You get the feeling throughout the class that he's on your side--that he really wants to help you become a better writer and journalist.Meetings with him are a joy, and over the course of talking with guest lecturers and people on the field trips, you realize just how well-respected he is in the journalism world. Ask him more about his own career!",
    "Yes -- highly recommended, especially if you want to pursue journalism after graduation.",
    "Journalism is a fun class. You will learn the most by writing, though most of the class is based on discussion. Schoofs can be a picky grader, giving you an awful grade based on a sentence, so make sure you follow all of his instructions. The visits to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal are amazing. At the very least, the YJI funds a summerinternship and offers a number of other benefits as part of taking the class."
