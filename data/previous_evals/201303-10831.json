   "comments": [
    "Standard 4th year Japanese. Workload is a lot, and is somewhat of a hard transition from 3rd year IMO, but will help a lot, especially for your writing.",
    "JAPN 156 is a fantastic way to gain a greater understanding of the Japanese language in New Haven. As usual, the section is led wholly in Japanese in order to simulate language immersion. I believe that my Japanese abilities have increased significantly through this course.",
    "It is a good class to keep working on more advanced Japanese, even though the improvement is very gradual. The syllabus leans towards a more passive learning of the language, with texts to read and drama\/anime episodes to watch instead of in-class discussion or active conversation. I personally prefer this method, but I also recognize it does not seem to contribute as much for speaking, especially because the oral activities are all speeches. The one-on-one sessions with a TA can be a good opportunity to freer conversation on different topics, but I felt they were not frequent enough. Getting a tutor from CLS in order to practice more speaking might be a good idea.I would recommend this class, mainly because it is a very stress-free environment, even if the homework assignments can pile up. I would not say the material is easy, and we definitely learned more sophisticated language that can be useful in various contexts. It is definitely an important class for those who want to work towards a better fluency in Japanese and acquire more vocabulary.",
    "Japanese 156 is a good continuation of studies in Japanese. You need to be ready to commit to a large amount of work every week, but that's true for any language class. If you're serious about improving your Japanese, I would thoroughly recommend it.",
    "A good continuation of the Japanese program at Yale...not exciting like lower level Japanese but you get to read a diverse set of short stories. Good if you are looking to be exposed to so e contemporary Japanese culture.",
    "If you have already had a very solid foundation of Japanese grammar, it would be more helpful. If not, following the texts would be a little bit challenging.",
    "The course consisted mainly of readings as well as some poetry and video\/TV shows.Typically the homework for a lecture would be to read a few pages of writing or watch part of a video, prepare for a kanji\/vocabulary test, to prepare sample sentences for 10-20 words or phrases, and to write a response to the reading or video piece. This ended up taking me a long time to complete for every lecture and was significantly more work than my other classes.The class helped me improve reading comprehension and it was very enjoyable. The only thing was that the homework (especially making the sample sentences) would get tedious after a while."
