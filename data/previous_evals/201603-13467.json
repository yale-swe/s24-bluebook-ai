    "This was the first finance course I've taken at Yale and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction. While most people had some background from working at banks over summer, I had little knowledge of trading (options, bonds, stocks etc.) and had to catch up. We looked at a lot of different financial models, not focussing on the mathematics per se, but instead on the assumptions and understand what these meant and how they should be applied (if at all). We went over credit risk, Value at Risk, mortgage backed securities, endogenous risk etc.",
    "I learned a lot about the models used to assess risk management. This was a great course and I really enjoyed taking it.",
    "Basic financial instrument valuation and risks involved with these instruments.",

    "I thought this was a great course that was well-structured and gave much insight into complex models and situations without getting bogged down in the icky stuff. It was a fantastic introduction into finance. Only improvement I could possibly imagine is letting students set up training trading accounts for fun over the semester. I really enjoyed this course a lot!",
    "This was a great course and it is unfortunate that Andrea could only teach for a semester here. The biggest drawback was that the course was unable to cover all the content because classes moved a little slowly because people were unwilling to answer questions to keep the class moving.",
    "The course is very well organized and the expectations are very clear. You learn a lot.",
    "Strengths: It is very well taught by the professor. Weaknesses: It is too much material."

    "I highly recommend this course even though it's probably not offered by Prof. Vedolin at Yale again! I thought this was a great course that was well-structured and gave much insight into complex models and situations without getting bogged down in the icky stuff. It was a fantastic introduction into finance. This was the first finance course I've taken at Yale and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction.

    "Yes. It was a great course and the content was extremely interesting.",
    "Definitely. They have to be interested in the topic beforehand though. This isn't a field you can just become passionate about. Though if there was a possibility of that happening, it would happen in this class. Prof. Vedolin is awesome and knowledgeable. She is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic. I would say the class is straightforward and stream-lined for you to learn. The professor is also very warm and approachable. All in all, one of the best econ classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Very useful for the practical application of risk management.",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It was incredibly useful information taught in a way that was optimized for student learning. Fantastic course if you are looking to go into the financial industry."
