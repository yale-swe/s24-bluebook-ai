    "With demers, it's great. Low key and learn a lot.",
    "Typical intro physics class as you would probably think of one. Take it if it's required or if you're genuinely interested in learning about some of the basic principles of physics!",
    "TAKE THIS OVER PHYSICS 181 IF YOU CAN. Professor Demers and the TFs in PHYS 171 are INFINITELY more helpful and nicer than 181. The teacher isn't out to fail people or create an unfair, out-there exam. All of her exams were fair and if you studied, you were prepared and could do well. She also is a good lecturer compared to anyone I saw in PHYS 180\/181. You can tell she knows the material and enjoys teaching students. She also makes herself readily available for help.",
    "The only science class I've taken at Yale that was accessible to non science majors (out of physics 180, bio101\/102). The TFs were amazing and Professor Demers is actually the sweetest person and very approachable. The class can be challenging at times, but they want you to succeed and to understand, which is so valuable. I really appreciated this class; it was a breath of fresh air.",
    "I'd probably take 181. This was so easy that it was extremely boring.",
    "I didn't have the best PHYS 171 experience, because I'm used to traditional lecture courses. I think there are definite benefits to interactive learning, but that's why I think I learn better in lecture and section combination classes, where I get to learn and absorb and be introduced to topics in lecture, then have an opportunity to work with others and ask questions in section.",
    "If it's in the TEAL room,,, TRY TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE.",
    "Take it only if you have too. Exams tend to be trickier than in-class activities.",
    "You're taking Physics 171 because you have to take physics for the MCAT. It's worth it. If Sarah Demers is teaching 171, do 171 instead of 181.",
    "Even though this class calls itself physics for premeds, there were no medical applications to the physics concepts we covered - so this class was just a bunch of really bored premeds. Not to harp on this, but the material really sucked. Still, Prof. Demers was a solid lecturer and a very nice person. I was frustrated by the in-class activities and demonstrations, which were generally dumb and not at all helpful; and it was especially annoying that we were tested on them on the final in place of actual physics concepts. All in all, not that hard and fairly painless. Take Jared's section if you can because he's amazing.",
    "Yep! It's a great intro to physics course. However, if you're looking for a bit more math\/rigor, take 180\/181.",
    "Physics is a tough class but if you have to take it, I guess 171 is the way to go. There won't be much of a curve though because there are a lot of try-hards in there. One thing that I think would make it better would be that if instead of having to learn concepts and whatnot, for exams students were sent to encounter science (touch electricity balls, look through telescopes, etc.) and then talk about how they enjoyed it. ;)",
    "Phys 171 is much easier than Phys 170. The final was a little bit more challenging than the first two midterms, but it was still pretty easy. I don't think the class will be curved. It is most certainly doable and sometimes quite enjoyable. Not a tough class at all.",
    "good introduction to physics, taught by passionate people, but not attended by passionate peers",
    "I would recommend this, especially to those who want to take a physics class but are a bit math-shy. This is also a good physics class for a non-science major.",
    "It's a decent class but not great. The material was kind of confusing but if you don't like math, this class is probably better than PHY 180.",
    "Physics 171 is a good introductory physics course. I would only recommend to those who are pre-med, but it presents the material in a clear, concise way and the professor is great. This was a good course that was not overwhelmingly difficult like some other pre-med classes.",
    "I don't think anyone takes Physics 170 for fun-- it's mostly people who need is as a pre-med or biology requirement. That said, if the choice is between 171 and 181, I think 171 was a better experience as a whole (my peers talked about how horrible the tests for 181 were, and I think the 171 ones were really fair and straightforward to prepare for).",
    "Yes absolutely. The teaching fellows this year (in general) were very helpful and generous with their time. Professor Demers-K also takes the extra effort to have very useful review sessions, demos, etc. and it really shows that everyone teaching the course really does care that you learn the material. I had personally shopped 171, 181, and 201 in previous years and hadn't taken it because I had been nervous about the workload and the speed at which the classes went. Take PHYS 171 with Prof. Demers-K if you need an intro physics course. The tests and exams are very reasonable, the material is very well taught, and even though I had some E\/M background I still learned a great deal. Its definitely the best intro phys E\/M course there is.",
    "If you've never done any electricity and magnetism, this is probably your class (unless your major requires that you do 181 or higher). I'm left feeling like I could tackle a normal Physics II class after completing 171. That's a little sad in a lot of ways, but Physics 170\/171 is pretty much remedial physics.",
    "It's good if Prof. Demers is teaching. Less stressful than 170; the numbers of assignments are the same, but the homeworks are not endless nightmares and the quizzes are manageable.",
    "PHYS 171 is overall a good course. It better teaches the basics of physics that 170 (definitely more applicable to MCAT). Professor Demers did a great job at making us keep up with the material with weekly quizzes and homework assignments, which were VERY representative of what we did in class. This is especially nice because usually professors make quizzes and homeworks impossibe to figure out and it's a very stressful experience. But for Professor Demers, you know if you went to class, paid attention, and studied over the weekend, you could do well.",
    "As someone that took PHYS 170 with Simon Mochrie and dropped PHYS 171 with Stephen Irons last semester, I can definitively say that PHYS 171 with Sarah Demers has been better than my wildest imagination. I wasn't aware it was even possible to teach physics this well. The class is so well-structured and well-taught that I actually *gasp* LEARNED things and enjoyed it! The psets, quizzes, and midterms are not too hard - and this is coming from someone that didn't take physics in high school. Take this class if Sarah Demers is teaching it again!! You will learn the most and suffer the least with her than with any other professor. If Jared is a TA again, get into his section because he is a godsend.",
    "PHYS 171 is a low-effort, low-gain physics class. All the biology connections that were big in 170 are gone, so it's just an easy physics class. If you took AP Physics, you'll already know all the concepts. Maybe a few new formulas because you do simplified problems with Maxwell's equations, but overall it'll be easy. Demers is a good lecturer, and I really like the interactive format of the class.",
    "I really liked PHYS 171. You learn standard electricity and magnetism concepts but you also learn really cool real world phenomena using these concepts. Also, the professor and all the TAs are amazing! Professor Demers is really nice and tries to make Physics as easy and fun as possible. She also has a great sense of humor! I highly recommend this class.",
    "For someone scared of physics, I genuinely enjoyed this class. Prof. Demers Konezny was a fabulous instructor. Psets and exams were very level appropriate and fair. Both seemed much easier than Physics 170. Liked that their was less emphasis on derivations than the fall. Also, in class activities were much more manageable\/appropriate (unlike the fall which tried too do too much)",
    "Electricity and magnetism intro physics class. If you need to take it (or if you're just interested) I'd definitely recommend it. It's very well-taught, and none of the material you learn is unreasonably difficult. One of the few science classes I've taken where I feel like the hard work pays off.",
    "This is the way to take physics at Yale. I came in as a humanities major and boy did I make the right choice. This class was a gut and non-science majors should try and take it. Demers is really cool and she will say whats up to you on the street.",
    "Demers is much more laid back than Mochrie. The problem sets are much more reasonable and take less of your time. However, the quizzes are pretty difficult because they aren't based on content that you were previously tested on (as in 171). The midterms and finals are pretty easy too, which kind of destroys the curve. Overall, not too bad and much less work and stress than 181.",
    "TAKE THIS! Prof Demers is one of the nicest, most caring, most patient professors you will encounter. If you took PHYS 170 and are a bit dubious about 171, TAKE THIS COURSE if Prof Demers is teaching.",
    "Sure! It was a great course, and I really enjoyed it! Beware of Eric the TA (who I believe will be co-teaching the course). He is pretty impatient in section.",
    "2 semester to intro physics. Not as biomedically-focused as the first semester.",
    "Good solid intro to Physics. I liked it.",
    "NO",
    "Yes, take it. Much more interesting and interactive than 180\/181.",
    "Most people only take this class because they need it to be premed. It isn't as bad as 181 (better taught, better organized) but is still a class that you'll only take if you have to.",
    "Yes, if you can take this and get it over with.",
    "This class is perfect, if you take physics make sure to take it with professor Demerara and have Jared as your TA",
    "Would recommend - Professor Demers really made an effort to make this a useful learning experience for everyone, and is a good teacher; apart from this, fair problem sets and fair tests.",
    "PHYS 171 was a course that I believe would be beneficial to anyone interested in the biological sciences. It is a course that requires persistent study and preparation, yet I believe it can a very engaging course as well.",
    "With Prof. Demers, PHYS 171 is a good intro physics lecture course. The pacing is good, the exams are fair.",
    "The class was pretty good overall. Definitely worth taking it if Sarah (Prof. Demers) is teaching it again. There's not a whole lot of biology associated with the physics taught in 171 as compared to 170, but the physics is still pertinent and almost makes more sense on its own. (A lot of 170 felt as if they were trying to force physics-related concepts onto biological ideas to make us feel more comfortable, but if anything, just made it more confusing.) There were less in-class activities than in 170, which we appreciated (or at least I did), but enough to make it interesting. I just wish that the psets were more carefully done since one was done willy nilly and ended up pushing back all the other psets. Things were also not uploaded to classesv2 (quiz solutions, pset solutions, midterm material) as timely as possible. But overall, especially if you have to take this for pre-med\/MCDB\/other major requirements, I think the class is worth it. Prof. Demers is extremely kind and caring and walks through all the physics clearly so that everyone can follow.",
    "Phys 171 is probably mandatory, but the class was great. I found the material to be very interesting and relevant to real life.",
    "good class, fair",
    "Keep taking it if you started with 170, it's less bio-related but pretty decent. At least this year, workload was lower than last semester.",
    "I have mixed feelings - demers is great, teal classroom sucks. Overall, though, i enjoyed the course.",
    "Yes!",
    "A great course that I feel is delivered in a much more understandable way than 170 if taught by Demers. I really enjoyed learning about circuits and electromagnetic forces. Not a difficult class, but enjoyable.",
    "Lots of tests\/quizzes.",
    "I never would have thought that I'd be giving a physics class an excellent rating. Professor Demers is by far the best physics professor I've ever had. Even though I loathe the subject and always will, going to class didn't feel like a chore because she was so engaged with the students and would constantly make us laugh. The TAs seemed more enthusiastic this semester too because of her. Tests, quizzes, and psets were ALL very reasonable, which hasn't been the case with previous 170\/171 professors. I dropped PHYS 171 last year when it was taught by Prof. Irons, and that turned out to be one of the best academic decisions I've made here. tl;dr Professor Demers is the ish and you'll be lucky to take physics with her. Also, I think the material in 171 is way more interesting than that of 170.",
    "171 is extremely easy. You should probably take 181 if you are good at math or physics in any way, or are actually interested in learning. If you care more about the grade, 171 is a surefire A as long as you are diligent - though it is not very much work at all. You will be amazed by how easy the exams are. Demers' teaching philosophy is that you should test only the absolute easiest type of question presented in class. Getting a 100% on one of her tests is no big deal. Consequently, if you do happen to make a stupid mistake on one of the tests, that will hurt you disproportionately more than it would in a real class.",
    "171 is definitely a great course if your premed and not really into physics. The material is interesting, but not overwhelming. It's also worth it just to have Dr. Deniers as a professor, because she's awesome.",
    "This course was a huge improvement over Physics 170. Professor Demers has great energy and she goes through the material at a good pace. This semester we were in the TEAL classroom again, however this time we had \"frozen\" tables, so we sat with the same people each class. I think this really made the class more interactive, at least when we did activities, because you weren't talking awkwardly about physics with complete strangers. The homework was reasonable and was actually harder than the midterms or final. Overall, this class was a good experience and I'm glad I took this over 181.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this to a student unless they were choosing to fulfill a requirement. May be too easy for people who have done AP physics.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class was one of my best science experiences at Yale. teaching style was great and understandable. however, communication wasn't always great and grades sometimes took a while to come back to us.",
    "Sarah Demers is hands down the coolest person you will ever meet. She's also an amazing professor and explains everything clearly. The material is challenging but not difficult and all exams, problem sets, and quizzes were fair.",
    "Yes 171 is great.",
    "AWESOME. A MUCH better course than any other premed course. It's a reasonable difficulty. Not so easy that you don't have to go to class, but not so difficult that you have to start studying weeks in advance.",
    "You probably have to take it, but it was very manageable. If you're looking for more of a challenge, then take 181. But I still learned loads in 171!",
    "I would recommend it, if only because you get to take it with all of your pre-med friends. I don't think there's too much of a biological focus in this semester as there was in 170, but I do think we don't focus on many of the same core concepts that other physics classes focus on. Because of this, I felt a little lost in the lab. However, I would choose to take it again if I could.",
    "A wonderful class for someone interested in learning about the natural world in a fun, creative environment. Definitely take it!",
    "I think PHYS 171 is a lot less rigorous than PHYS 181 based on the amount of work I did for this class compared to peers in PHYS 181. I would recommend it for students looking for a lighter physics class. If you want to learn E&M more in-depth, I might not recommend it.",
    "Godo general phsyics course for people who are more interested in biological sciences; slightly different approach.",
    "This is a totally reasonable, fair class. It can definitely be enjoyable, and I recommend it to anyone who needs to take intro physics.",
    "I would recommend this particular PHYS 171 to aspiring premedical students or people who are just interested in learning physics. I have heard that PHYS 181 is more in line with classical physics; however, I believe that PHYS 171 is equally as straightforward, if not more so, in terms of teaching classical physics with the added bonus of understanding biological concepts. Professor Demers is a wonderful human being and really clicks with all of her students - she makes sure that everyone understands the material and is very happy to help those who do not! I loved this class and am happy that I took it, especially over 181.",
    "Physics 171 with Prof. Demers was really enjoyable! Take it! The problem sets are more of a confidence boost than a burden and the exams are fair!",
    "Physics 170 and 171 were the best taught science courses I took at Yale. This is hugely important because Physics can be so difficult to understand. I would recommend PHYS 171 to any other student regardless of science background. Professor Demers makes the material understandable, interesting and relevant. I feel lucky to have taken this course with her!",
    "If you have to take a physics course, I've heard this course is better than 181. In any case, I think this course is decently easy to do well grade-wise in if you go to class and even just barely pay attention, though many students don't do even that. The truth of phys 171 is that you need to learn about 10 formulas, and what situations to use them in, and a little bit of theory behind them, and then you know the course. Personally, I didn't really enjoy the course itself much. I feel like Demers was a slow lecturer, which honestly probably isn't her fault as many of the students in the class were slower learners. I was satisfied with the course up to the first midterm, but felt like following the first midterm we lost a lot of the support that we had before for the final (and if anything it should be the other way around). The notes for the class aren't Demers's, they're from Mochrie, and so Demers doesn't follow them closely, which can be confusing and unhelpful. All in all, I felt this class was much more fickle than 170 and very inconsistent in a lot of ways. If you stay on top of your stuff and don't get lulled into a sense of security though, you should be able to get a very satisfactory grade. Problem sets about once a week, quizzes about once a week, weekly section that is meh helpful, and a midterm and a final. The final was much harder than the midterm and memorize the formulas you'll need because they aren't all given on the formula sheet.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Best science class I've taken at yale.",
    "I was looking for the easiest physics option for a biology prerequisite, and that's definitely what this class is. Midterms and finals were really similar to the p-sets and quizzes, but the class notes posted online were sort of useless. Lectures were clear and easy to follow, except that we spent several classes going over long proofs that didn't really seem important. Good, easy class if you're looking to fulfill requirements.",
    "Take this class if you need to fulfill a distributional requirement or you want a fun time with problem solving.",
    "This course is much better than 170. It is difficult but prof. Demers is a great teacher. She is really caring and attempts to make lectures as transparent as possible.",
    "You're probably pre-med if you're considering this class, and I just wanted to say it's not bad! Even if you hate physics (like i did), you might change your mind after this class! The problem sets aren't hard, the midterms aren't hard, you just have to pay attention in class. It's really manageable.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The professor was amazing, and the material was fascinating. Definitely take this class.",
    "Take this over 181 if you value your life.",
    "Take if you have to.",
    "Yes, Phys 171 is a good class with a helpful teacher and awesome TA's who help you to succeed. The class is very fair and I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Take this course. Its boring in class but the material is interesting and the tests are easy."
