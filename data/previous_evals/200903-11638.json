    "Take it. Just take it.",
    "It is very much about finding inspirtion to write. You really don't learn how to write necessarily. You will never be told an idea is bad. You are told how to think...",
    "Unbelievable course. If you've ever written a dialogue and liked it, if you have any kind of passion for the theater, if you have any kind of passion for the nuances of life, expression, people -- take this course.",
    "yes. it is really fun and you will write a full length play with as little stress and as much support as possible given the magnitude of such an undertaking. you will get to hear yours and other peoples' scenes read out loud by the wonderful performers in class every week, which is a very exciting way of sharing the amazing plays everyone is working on. the class is so different from other classes - it really makes you think and be creative and uninhibited, which is a wonderful break in the week.",
    "It's a massively fun (how often can one say that in this situation?) and quite loosely structured course. If you really wanna buckle down and learn the mechanics of playwriting, you'd do better in the English Dep't equivalent. But if you wanna spend two days a week sitting cross-legged on the floor of a grad-school bar holding forth on your own life and partaking in the wisdom of perhaps the greatest storyteller and most brilliantly sardonic wit on the Yale payroll, this is your class.",
    "Definitely. I feel sorry for people who never experience this class.",
    "Deb is like the hidden gem of this university. If you are a Theater Studies major, you already know that. If you're not, and are just interested in writing a play with a professor you may not have heard of, you are in for a real treat. Deb's class will teach you about yourself and about humanity, and will make you WANT to say something in a play that is deeply important to you. You will learn about yourself, about humanity, and maybe most importantly, about the types of things you need to speak about.Bottom line: TAKE THIS CLASS if you have even the slightest inclination. Expect to sit on the floor and talk about your life and your classmates' lives. Expect to come away feeling like this is the type of profound experience you expected when you decided to come to Yale.",
    "Absolutely, anyone who loves to write or is interested in theater should take the class.",
    "This is not an English class that will tell you how to write a play. This is a class, run by an incredible woman, that will help you find what you need to write a play about and provide a setting in which to think about, discuss, and workshop that play. It is as much a study of yourself and the classmates as it is a study of writing a play.",
    "You should absolutely, without a doubt take this class. It is one of the best, if not the best class, at Yale. It is life-changing! Students are forced to examine the experience of living in addition to the art of the stage. You learn to write a full-length play, andto think about the world in terms of the way it can be written about."
