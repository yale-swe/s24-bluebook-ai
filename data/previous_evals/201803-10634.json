    "I learned a lot about organic synthesis reactions, techniques, and equipment (including NMR). Most importantly, I learned how to research a project idea, create a proposal, and then actually carry that out. These skills are invaluable to any scientist.",
    "This course taught me how to perform a long, multi-stage experiment and how to better synthesize my results in writing. It was also one of the first courses I have taken in the sciences where I had the freedom to choose what I wanted to study, which allowed me to study something I was interested in.",
    "how to use lab equipment, how to write scientifically, how to design an experiment",
    "I learned how to go about researching and preparing my own experiment and also how to improvise when experiments do not go as planned."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course is the flexibility to do something you actually are interested in for the second half of the semester. This really engages students in the research process. The three training sessions were also very helpful (especially the library one!). But the biggest strength without a doubt is the fact that Parr runs the course. He is simply the best. There are no weaknesses to this course.",
    "The strengths of this course are the amount of time we spend in lab, the small class size, and the excellent guidance of Dr. Parr. There were no weaknesses.",
    "It was all strengths. I really really loved the class and Dr. Parr is an amazing teacher. Sam is also an amazing TA. Between the two of them there is nothing that cannot be done. They also do a really good job of helping students get a handle on their projects and optimize experiments. They really care about what each student is doing and are always willing and ready to help."

   "comments": [
    "Be warned that this a lab that is twice a week for at least 8 hours per week. However, overall this class is worth it, mostly because of Parr. Compared to p chem lab with Vaccaro, this class is liberating. Getting to spend 8 hours a week with Parr doing your own experiment is awesome, and this was most important class this semester that actually will teach me useful things. While the time commitment was tiring at times, Parr is an incredible lab professor and makes this class worth it. He teaches all 3 advanced labs, so you'll have him no matter what, but this is definitely a class to take if you ever wanted to take a class that is like a baby independent research class without any repercussions if stuff goes wrong. Take it if you need an advanced chem lab\/elective! Our TA Sam was also 10000\/10 and hopefully you can have him as well. Since this is a writing credit, you will have to write two full length lab reports (in a JCS article format) and a research proposal, but Parr gives a ton of help.",
    "This course is fantastic. Dr. Parr is a great instructor, and the two experiments (the second of which we get to choose) were interesting and fun to perform. Take this class!",
    "yeah, this is the best lab class i've taken. prof parr provides great feedback and is always there when you need it. i never felt pressure in the class since its relaxed. i actually had fun.",
    "100% I would recommend this class to another student. I loved it and learned a ton. The structure of the class is great for getting to really understand how to research and the teacher and TA are amazing and super helpful\/kind."
