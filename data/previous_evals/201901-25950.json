    "I learned about a wide range of biomaterials applications and learned how to read scientific papers with a deeper understanding. This was one of the first BME classes where I actually felt like I was gaining application knowledge.",
    "An interesting survey of how the body and biological systems respond to biomaterials. We examined the foreign body response in depth and considered how engineering adaptations may be utilized to mitigate its effects. Interesting case studies included glucose sensors, brain implants, and tissue engineered vascular grafts. I learned a lot about the foreign body response, but even more so about reading research\/technical papers critically and how to extract the most important or relevant information from publications.",
    "This course taught me how to think like a researcher and to understand the intricacies of the interactions between biomaterials and the tissue surrounding the implant.",
    "I learned about the foreign body responses and engineering adaptations that can be utilized to optimize the bodys response to biomaterials.",
    "Good knowledge of reading scientific papers",
    "I learned a lot about the biology of materials placed in the body. I think was able to synthesize information from scientific papers a little better.",
    "Beyond gaining a better understanding and awareness of the field of biomaterials, the most important skill I developed was the ability to read scientific journals critically. There are a lot of pitfalls\/tricks, and Prof. Kyriakides goes out of his way to make sure his students know what to look out for.",
    "Something I really enjoyed about this class is that it goes beyond teaching you about basic biomaterial concepts. The class heavily focused on studying current biomedical research papers and exposed me to many different biological techniques used to study cell and tissue interactions. As a person who is interested in the biomedical industry, this component gave me a better idea to what is being developed.",
    "Themis' unique perspective on the field of biomaterials, something that most professionals (who should be) are not knowledgeable. Loved it! Learned how to think critically about this field and thoughtfully consider the implications of biomaterials and devices within the human body.",
    "I learned a lot about a variety of biomaterial applications and the cellular and molecular level of biomaterial-tissue interactions. I also gained more experience in reading scientific articles and how to critically assess their assumptions and validity.",
    "How to read scientific papers",
    "Great introduction to biomedical engineering in a relatable and important context.",
    "Learned about current litearture on biomaterial tissue interactions. Learned how to read and analyze scientific literature",
    "I learned more about biomaterials and how our body works.",
    "I learned how to think critically and read scientific papers."

   "comments": [
    "I wish there were more recent papers. A lot of the things we read were quite old and I wish we read some more current things.",
    "Themis is a fantastic professor; he brings unique research and industrial insights to the course. The course is designed to be very modern, and we often discussed recent developments or recently published papers. If you are not very interested in biomaterials, tissue interactions, the foreign body response, or learning how to more critically read research papers, however, do not take this course. It really is just a survey of relevant papers and discoveries in the field, and so it does get dry at times. I wish the course were slightly more organized and\/or structured. There's no real syllabus, so it seems that Themis will discuss essentially whatever he wants over the course of the semester. I also wish that a little bit more time were spent explaining the details of some of the more significant experimental techniques, or that the course focused a little bit more on design elements. It didn't feel like, by the end of the semester, there was a particularly clear unifying or cohesive theme that brought the entire course together. The workload is exceptionally light, but do be prepared to go to every class and write down everything that is discussed. Exam questions will sometimes be verbatim small details that Themis pointed out in commenting on a particular paper, and the lecture slides are pretty much useless without notes. This is especially because exams are open note, and sometimes felt like a game of \"can I find this fact fast enough\". Taken altogether, this is an engaging class with a great professor that, however, lacks some structure and with exams that felt a bit arbitrary.",
    "This course was amazing because the lectures were very interesting and insightful. It really helped me develop the analytical and critical thinking skills necessary to evaluate scientific advancements and come up with the best way to design biomaterial implants. More feedback would have been helpful to help us with conceptual understanding throughout the course, instead of only for the exams.",
    "I felt like the units werent well linked together and the scope of the class was rather narrow. I also wish there was more of an emphasis on learning about the chemistry of specific biomaterials.",
    "There is an info lull in the middle of the course when the biology gets really tedious. However, the info is really interesting on the bookends of the course.",
    "On occasion, the organization of the material felt somewhat random, but this didn't impact my ability to learn the material. All background information was always provided before it was needed, so I never felt lost or confused. It was sometimes difficult to see how different \"units\" tied together.",
    "Something I noticed is that like myself, a lot of sophomores were taking this upper level BME course. I would recommend at least waiting until junior year take it because it does help to be more familiar with some of the topics covered. But overall, this class is incredibly interesting and this is mainly because Dr. Kyriakides himself. Kyriakides is honestly a hilarious guy and I enjoyed listening to him call out things that he doesn't believe make sense in the papers we covered. He also teaches with the philosophy that lectures aren't only about getting through slides. For example, whenever we would go in depth on something during lecture and got sidetracked, he wouldn't try to then rush the lecture to \"stay on pace.\" He teaches whatever he wants to teach and thinks is important. However, my only concern with this course is that it's very dependent on how well you take notes. The tests are open note which is amazing however the 9am time frame can make it hard to concentrate and you really do need to write down everything he says or else the slides won't make sense. Kyriakides believes that one should be rewarded from going to class every day so I get it but if you're feeling groggy one morning and miss something, it could really hurt you on a test. Nonetheless, seriously take this class. It is well worth it and pretty chill overall.",
    "Honestly the ideal class. Although it was a bit early and I am not a morning person, the necessity of going to class to know the material was good.",
    "A strength of this course is that many of the assigned readings are journal articles. It is very important for students to be exposed to primary scientific literature and this class did so in a way that enabled people to get exposure to the literature but not get lost in it. Many of the articles we were assigned were also discussed extensively in class. This class was not narrow as it introduced a wide variety of biomaterial applications and topics that are broadly applicable.",
    "It was really great to have such an application based class",
    "Themis' teaching style not only encourages genuine interest in the material, but also helps students become more discerning and critical readers of scientific material.",
    "The trajectory of the course is confusing, but the information is all relevant and helpful",
    "This course was very interesting and I felt like I learned a lot. The lectures were engaging but at times felt like they got repetitive or boring. But overall The class was very well structured.",
    "For me the class was difficult because I wasn't used to that way of learning and I didn't know how to study for the class."

    "Yeah definitely if you would like to learn more about the biomaterials field.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is super interesting and the insights developed in this class is really useful for other BME classes and research.",
    "Yes, an easy class where you learn quite a bit without pressure to cram.",
    "This class is fantastic! Prof. Kyriakides is one of the best lecturers I've ever had! Despite the 9am time slot, I was always excited to go to class because I knew each lecture would be interesting and engaging. This is a great introduction to the world of implants and the immune response.",
    "Although this class is lighter in terms of workload compared to other upper level BME courses, this isn't one you should sleep on. Take this course because it's full of great content with a pretty cool professor! But also make sure you are alert and taking good notes as it is a 9am. These notes greatly affect how well you do on an exam.",
    "Absolutely. Themis' lectures are enjoyable and the content is very interesting. As long as you come to lecture and listen to him actively, you will be fine in this class. How every class should function.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is not a high workload and the lectures are very well done. Professor Kryriakides is a great lecturer and knows what he's talking about. He is also good about giving suggestions on how to analyze journal articles critically.",
    "Absolutely. It is a great senior BME class in particular and comes full circle in a lot of ways",
    "Yes - low workload but great material",
    "Yes, it's a useful course to become familiar with the literature in this field",
    "Yes if they want to learn more about the human bodies response to implants or foreign objects that we place into it.",
