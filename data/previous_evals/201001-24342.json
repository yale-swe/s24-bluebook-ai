   "comments": [
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to any student who thinks they have the time and stamina that it deserves.",
    "Of course I would recommend it.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken in Directed Studies. Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "No surprises here: DS Lit, spring. The readings are great, however long. Get reading done over break. Also, fight the good fight for intellectual ownership and creative, idiosyncratic interpretations of the works you read. Beware of cliches!",
    "A great course--better, I think, than all the other DS courses. Professor Levin is very nice and her great love for literature shines through in every class. She was very accessible outside of class and happy to talk.",
    "Take DS if you like to read and won't get stressed about weekly papers. Otherwise, you might want to reconsider. Remember, it may not seem like all that much work compared to high school, but in college, things are totally different.Levin is a great professor, although her section is perhaps a bit overrated. People will all scramble to get into her section at the beginning of the year. She is incredibly nice and helpful, but there are also other great professors out there. If you do end up with Levin, be sure to meet with her about your papers. She will practically tell you what to write...",
    "DS Lit is a thorough and satisfying look at some of the best works of the \"Western Canon.\" Of course, the main complaint about DS is always that you need more time to look at each book, and \"a book a week\" is always going to be a rushed approach. That may be, but I also think that having to read almost a book a week makes you work a lot harder than you would in a course with shorter readings and less books. Like it or not, learning comes from working hard, not pretending that you will notice more detail just because you are lazy and don't want to read more. Plus, if you are really enjoying the works, what's the problem? DS Lit was great for meprecisely because it did not feel like \"work,\" but rather like a very accelerated and thorough form of reading for pleasure. In addition, any sense of not having spent enough time on a book tends to feed a desire to go back to that book in the future, which is never a bad thing. So yes, if you could not tell, that means I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would heartily recommend the spring literature aspect of DS. On the shear pleasure and appeal of the texts, I think this is the best of all six DS courses. It also has the most reading, but, to be honest, I never really minded it at all. Take DS, and love this class.",
    "Any student who has completed the first semester of DS should DEFINITELY take the second semester. It is fascinating to see how first semester genres, like the epic and lyric poetry, evolve in modern works. The syllabus is absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed every work, and even ones that are 600 years old (Don Quixote, for instance) stand alone as incredibly modern&fascinating books. The benefit of DS Lit over something like English 126 (in which they read a lot of the same works) is the interaction between H&P and Philosophy. Tolstoy's view on history would not have been half as interesting without the perspectives of Hume, Nietzsche, Marx, etc. I definitely benefited a ton from the syllabus&atmosphere of DS, and I would insist that anyone who's completed half the canon should continue on with the rest.",
    "The books you read definitely make it all worth it. I loved every single book we read. My advice would be to make sure you read the necessary books over the breaks. It makes the entire semester go by easier.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. You'll be challenged, but it's well worth it. The readings are all amazing, and even if you can't finish them during the year, you'll be packing them as summer reading. Prof. Levin's involvement also can't be underemphasized.",
    "It aptly expresses the trends and developments of western literature in one semester. I highly recommend this course to anyone with the remotest interest in literature."
