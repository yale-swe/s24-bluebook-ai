   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about research methods, particularly about the events occurring at the neuronal level during action potentials.",
    "I learned about anatomy of the sheep brain and how to dissect it along the coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. I learned about electrophysiology, action potentials and Na+ and K+ channels and the timing of the channel openings. I learned how to conduct electrophysiology experiments measuring conduction velocity and looking at the effects of habituation on the earthworm giant axon, cockroach mechanoreceptors on spines, and the third nerve of the crayfish. I learned to look at action potential data on LabChart, tracing techniques, brain imaging techniques.",
    "I learned how to dissect a sheep brain and how to obtain electrical recordings from earthworms, cockroach legs, and crayfish tails. I also learned a lot about the different processes and stages of the action potential in the neuron.",
    "This course game me significant practical experience in experimental protocol, and the weekly experiments gave me hands-on knowledge of various methods of dissection, preparation and measurement. Additionally, the lectures and reports stimulated my critical thinking, forcing me to question my own assumptions and search for alternative explanations. The final assignment also gave me insight on how to write a scientific paper, and encouraged both primary-source research and a better historical understanding of key topics in behavioral neuroscience, requiring me to situate the topic at hand in a different context of understanding and operate from there to find plausible hypotheses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The grading in this course was very difficult but the material was engaging and the instructor was great.",
    "Strengths: complementary with PSYC160, explains action potentials in greater depth and forces you to really know the brain anatomy\/function of different systems and parts of the brain; dissections are fun and interesting and electrophysiology experiments are super cool and help you see habituation happen for real Weaknesses: lectures are a bit dry; lecture slides could be more organized and easier to follow with key bullet points",
    "The strength of this course was the detailed perspective from which we were able to examine different topics in neuroscience. It was a small, lab-based class that allowed a lot of interaction between the students, professor, and TF which definitely facilitated learning. The main weakness of this course may have been the really dry, long lectures at the beginning of the session every week; they usually aligned with the day's lab but sometimes felt a little repetitive or unnecessary.",
    "I think this course's greatest strength is its hands-on, experiment-based approach to the topics it approaches. Not only were the weekly experiments engaging, they allowed me to view the subject at hand with a level of detail and understanding that I would never reach as easily through a textbook or lecture. My one criticism would be how the lectures and material explore the historical narrative to the course's main topics: the lectures themselves are engaging and informative, but only occasionally discuss how the question at hand was approached in its own time, with no clear narrative link in-between. Connecting the topics together in a historical context could improve the lectures in that respect.",
    "The class size is small, which is a nice break from the larger lectures that are more usual for psychology courses. Also, the course includes interesting labs. The best are the brain dissections at the beginning of the class. The crayfish dissections and earthworm labs were also great. It's a great class because it involves more hands-on experience than the traditional psych courses offer."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to fulfill the research methods requirement. It was very interesting and well organized and the professor is extremely caring and helpful.",
    "Yes -- it's a good course for understanding some of the PSYC 160 concepts in greater detail (action potentials and anatomy). As for teaching research methods, I'm not sure how well it does because it's more structured around hands on dissections and experiments rather than the nitty gritty details of how to plan and conduct an experiment, how to address internal\/external validity, what are the different types of control groups, etc. It is not really lecture based. It's definitely an interesting and engaging course, and going to office hours really helps you understand the material from the lab experiments.",
    "This course is a requirement for the psych\/neuro track and the new neuroscience major, and that being said I would only recommend the class to someone who has to take it for the major. However, it was an interesting, fairly painless class that gave students an in-depth look into the processes of the human brain at the macro and micro levels. You definitely have to study hard for the tests but they are reasonable; the weekly lab reports are tedious and annoying but usually don't take too long, and seem to be graded pretty generously. The sheep's brain dissection unit is awesome for someone who has never dissected a brain before, and it made it so much easier to fully understand the spatial relationships of structures in the brain. Professor Donegan's lectures are extremely dry and sometimes last up to 90 minutes, but he really does care so much about helping students learn.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is excellent at conveying its educational material in a manner that is varied and engaging, while still in-depth enough to offer a proper understanding of each topic. The course devotes the majority of its time to hands-on learning through a variety of experiments, which are tremendously refreshing to any student used to lecture or even seminar courses. The workload each week was very reasonable, and the environment wasn't stressful either. I had a lot of fun! My initial fear upon taking this course was that I would be out of my depth: I had not taken the prerequisite course, and the last time I had performed a biology-related experiment was in high school. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that all of the work was well within my reach: the course takes great pains to deliver all of its necessary material as clearly and simply as it can, and the experiments themselves are explained in very good detail before they are undertaken, with ample room for retries."
