    "Dudley seems like a very nice guy, however I would not recommend this class.",
    "A little disorganized and crazy, but you watch (maybe 75%) great films and its cool to explore Film Studies for the first time.",
    "Yes, this is an amazing course for students keen on learning about the different cultures and films.",
    "Loved the films, okay about the class. Lectures can get kind of disorganized sometimes because there is so much ground to cover. Discussion sections can be disheartening when classmates are less open-minded towards alternative modes of filmmaking from less familiar territories.",
    "Take this class if you are really interested in learning about films from around the world, but not necessarily if you want to learn about film as an art. It is more a literature class than a film class.",
    "As a non-film major, I probably did not gain as much from this class as it was intended to offer, so for me it was essentially watching incredible foreign films that I would have no exposure to otherwise. Personally, I found the lectures quite boring, mostly because the lectures were really disorganized. I would have rather just gone to the film screenings and sat in on the section afterward (which was usually helpful), but not actually take the class. But if you want an easy humanities credit that is mildly interesting...who is going to stop you?"
