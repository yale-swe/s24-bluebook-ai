    "If you are interested in the French language then I would recommend taking this course. It is a little advanced.",
    "This class is a lot like L1\/L2, but with reading in addition to the usual slate of worksheets and oral exercises. It's a lot of work (probably about 10 hours a week), but Madame Jensen is really nice and helpful. I enjoyed coming to class everyday, much thanks to her work, even though I didn't particularly enjoy the assignments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Absolutely. This class is a lot of work, but the more input, obviously the more you improve your language skills.",
    "A lot of work. If you put in the work, you can succeed. But if you do not know french going in, don't take it"
