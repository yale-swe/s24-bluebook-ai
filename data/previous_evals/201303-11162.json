   "comments": [
    "In many ways this course is almost an introductory geography course. It is probably best for those people who already have an interest in urban or environmental studies and want to learn more about cultural geography. That being said, learning how to use landscapes as sources is a valuable skill for anyone in American Studies or History.",
    "I would definitely recommend it--it's a really interesting class atmosphere, and the readings are phenomenal.",
    "Yale doesn't have a geography department, and this is a shame. This was a very cool course, where we discussed radical cartography, deconstructed the landscape ideal, and discussed the mechanisms by which space--too often assumed to be a static, ahistorical fact--is constructed by ideological and political forces. It's not a class for everyone, but I definitely recommend it to people who are interested in critical theory from a humanistic perspective, as well as anyone in or around American Studies who wants a different way of discussing history and politics.",
    "One of the best classes ever; I very much recommend it. The home-project, where you explore your scholarly sense of home through an art presentation, analytic paper, and class presentation was amazing; I wanted to just keep working on it all semester! The class-led visits were fantastic; the best way to learn about a sense of place is to actually go visit different places."
