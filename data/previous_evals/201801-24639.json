    "The course focused on vocabulary building (mostly everyday topics at this stage i.e. L1), basic ASL grammar (classifier use, time descriptors, question forming, etc. though not much emphasis on structure\/syntax yet), as well as conversational skills. There was also a deaf culture\/history component to the course, which I appreciated.",
    "I acquired basic signing skills (I had no prior knowledge of ASL before taking the course, but now I am pretty confident having basic conversations) as well as an introduction to deaf culture.",
    "You learn basic ASL and enough to have a conversation.",
    "I developed knowledge of ASl vocabulary, sentence structure, and communication style. I also gained insights into deaf culture and different experiences of deafness.",
    "I learned more about Deaf culture and a basic understanding of receptive and signing skills for ASL L1."

   "comments": [
    "The class is very interactive and engaging important for language learning!",
    "This class was really dynamic and interactive with a lot of presenting in front of the class and working with other students.",
    "This course was well organized and very interactive. It would have been helpful to have more videos.",
    "There were countless strengths to the course. Foremost, Professor Tanner was an extremely patient, clear, and engaging professor. She was a clear strength of the course because of her exhaustive knowledge of ASL, her enthusiasm for teaching, and her ability to communicate with hearing students who were just beginning their studies of ASL. Another strength of the course was how well we picked up vocabulary through storytelling. The course could be improved somewhat by adding slightly more structure and organization. I think because it was a pilot course, the actual course did not follow the syllabus as closely as other language courses I have taken. A more-clear syllabus would improve the course, as would clear, written instructions for graded assignments. I also think I would have preferred a little more partner work than one student presenting to the class.",
    "This class was very well structured in terms of workload and quizzes\/tests. One weakness was that the schedule was changed several times over the course of the semester and grading policies regarding attendance were unclear. Those could be edited in the syllabus to make students more aware of the importance of regular attendance."

    "YES!",
    "This class was amazing and it became one of my favorites at Yale! I would recommend this course to everyone!",
    "I loved this course! ASL is such a rich language. I also really liked that ASL was very different from most classes I have taken in that it is less written (and not at all spoken) and more experiential, descriptive, and practical. We have so few opportunities at Yale to learn more about disability and even fewer to learn about deafness. This course allowed me to learn about deaf culture and to practice a language that was totally unlike other languages or classes I had ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend and have recommended this course to other students.",
    "Absolutely"
