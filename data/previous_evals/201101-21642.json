   "comments": [
    "I would take it if you are looking for the feeling of a freshman seminar, because it is quite informal and discussions are easy. It can become monotonous at times though and reading can be overwhelming if you have other reading courses.",
    "This freshman seminar is fantastic for freshmen who are interested in film. The course consists of one week of literature analysis, a film screening, and then a week of film\/literature analysis. Professor Marcus is incredibly knowledgeable about all of the films and texts used in this course -- some of her work on the very same films has even been published. She's always prepared for class discussion and is really nice and helpful when it comes to papers. Definitely take this class -- one of my favorites of freshman year.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You read 9 texts (including a play, short stories, even the BIble) and then watch the film adaptations. It is quite a bit of a time commitment because of the film screenings, but it is worth it. I have learned so much about literature, film, and life in general. Professor Marcus is one of the nicest people in this world and her passion for film and Italian culture is infectious in the best way possible. If you can, take this class.",
    "This was a great course. It was a completely different field for me and I was definitely always interested. The course was a little Italian heavy (teacher was DUS of Italian department) which I didn't realize going into the course, so our readings were not exactly my favorite or anything really interesting. But, the comparative literature aspect was really great. Also, the teacher, who is so approachable and wonderful, is a little hands on. Class was never really a big discussion, just everyone answering questions she hands out before class and assigns to people. Overall though, a solid, not difficult, although slightly time consuming with the movie times, class.",
    "Yes, this class was a ball. It's one of those small, focused seminars that teaches you so much about a specific topic.",
    "I would recommend the class but under the following precondition: you must know that you will be studying, to some degree, tiny works that no one has heard of. Don't expect to be comparing Lord of the Rings or something.",
    "If you enjoy reading novels and watching\/analyzing film, this is a great class for you. Plus, the way it's set up, if you don't like a particular book\/film, you'll only be talking about it for one or two weeks, before you move on. If you haven't taken a freshman seminar, this is a great one because there's so much student interaction so you get to know your classmates pretty well.",
    "I would recommend it all the way. If you can get in, take it. It's an awesome class and it fills up quick. Make sure to turn in your application on time and go to the first class and be involved. This class is awesome.",
    "This is a great introduction to the student of films adapted from literary sources. Thoughmany of the films and texts studied were somewhat unapproachable because they were subtitled or translated, respectively, the course was a good one overall. Professor Marcus is extremely friendly and she truly loves the material in a very obvious way. She even held a party at her house for students at the end of the seminar.",
    "Literature into film is a very enjoyable freshman seminar. You get to read interesting books (both American and international), watch well-made films, and reflect your opinions in short essays.It is easy to do well, it is more difficult to do VERY well. As long as you're aiming for around a B+, you should be fine - the amount of work is manageable. If you're aiming for an A, though, it's much harder since essays are very subjective, so something very small makes the difference between an A and an A-. Still, it's definitely not impossible.Take it - I really liked it!",
    "Don't take it unless you really want the \"freshman seminar\" experience. Take other higher level courses that would be much more interesting (and challenging) instead.",
    "It provides and interesting introduction to the field of film study. It was the time I took a class in the field, and I found it extremely enjoyable and enlightening."
