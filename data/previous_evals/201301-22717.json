   "comments": [
    "Definitely! As I said, a great way to learn about chemistry. There is a lot of \"you get out of the course, what you put in it\", unlike some other courses where you end up learning regardless. But since the lab reports are less \"answer these questions\" type, the more you research, the more you will learn.",
    "This lab involves a lot of focus on a few lab reports. The write-ups are long but rewarding.",
    "Good class. You'll learn lots of cool techniques (x-ray crystallography, solid-state IR, etc.).Unfortunately experiments often ran long, once even to 6:00. All compounds are pretty colors (\"colours\")! :OOOOReports are written like journal papers, and hence take forever...very good skill for a chemistry major to have, however!",
    "Yes! It is a great way to get your upper-level lab credit or a WR credit. Laid back and not too work-intensive: only four lab reports, plus one 2000-word research paper if you were doing the WR credit (a GREAT deal for a WR credit). Parr basically babies you throughout -- for example, he guides you through every step and tells you exactly what to do during lab (this was great for me as I am not confident with benchwork; if you're more independent, keep in mind you might be annoyed by this). He also reads drafts of lab reports, so if you start your lab reports a few days ahead of time and put a reasonable amount of effort into them, there's no reason you shouldn't get an A.",
    "Pretty great lab. Just start your lab reports ahead of time. Other than that it's not super arduous.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Though it is not a requirement for the chem major, it is a great companion to the inorganic lecture course, and overall a very interesting class on its own. I am really happy I ended up taking it. The experiments were very interesting and covered a broad range of topics. In addition, you learn a lot about how to research a topic in-depth, how to write scientifically, and how to present data, which I thought was very useful.",
    "This lab course may seem to be a little bit tough at the beginning, but Dr. Parr is always willing to offer help. There are only four lab reports throughout the semester, so the workload isn't terrible.",
    "Not that bad. Now imagine that on a T-shirt and assorted memorabilia.",
    "CHEM 251L is great! Parr is awesome, there's 4 relatively short reports (a few more for Wr credit), and you learn some cool techniques such as X-ray diffraction. Also, not as many people take it, so much more personal attention and more laid back than say, for example, general chemistry lab.",
    "Take it! But definitely at the same time as CHEM 252 if you can. The two go hand-in-hand pretty well. And take it for the WR credit definitely. It's not much more work but you are graded more harshly. But with that being said your science writing skills improve greatly in this class from the feedback you get from Parr and the TFs.",
    "Take it if you need the full lab credit.",
    "Yes. It was a valuable learning experience and a good course to count towards the advanced lab requirement."
