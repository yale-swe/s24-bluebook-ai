   "comments": [
    "This was the first year this class was being taught so it was inevitably quite disorganized and expectations for students was unclear. During class things could seem really theoretically and conceptual, but the problem sets weren't bad and there was no midterm exam. Plus, it's a small class and so a lot of it flowed by discussion in a really low-key, informal way. My impression is that it's a pretty standard class for the geology department and Mark Brandon and I'm sure it will improve dramatically in future years. You do learn some really cool stuff and look at some very pretty pictures also, which is a plus!",
    "Geomorphology is an incredibly interesting subject. While I wish the class had been more organized, I learned a lot and enjoyed the class. Mark is one of the most engaging teachers at Yale. He cares that his students understand the material fully and encourages students to think critically about the material.",
    "Surface morphology is a good class that discusses the mechanisms by which the surface of Earth is shaped; quite an important and interesting topic. The class begins with the general principles of physics and geology which control weathering and erosion, and then discusses types of erosion: rivers, glaciers, etc. Definitely an important class to understand surficial geology and why the surface of Earth is shaped the way it is.",
    "Geomorphology is an important and worthwhile class, but I think in its first semester, its delivery could have been better. We learned how tectonics, atmospheric processes, glaciers, gravity, and rivers changed the shape of the earth. The Saturday field trip was enjoyable, but could have been better prepared. The work for the class included about six problem sets and a take home final. The textbook was a bit too complicated to be helpful; instead, I found the lecture notes most useful for the psets. However, with Mark's often tangential \"sidebar\" lecture style, I didn't really get the full utility out of being in class - often I was confused and annoyed. If this topic is important for you, definitely take this - you will learn a lot, and I'm sure it will improve next year. Otherwise, I would consider other options, especially if Stratigraphy returns."
