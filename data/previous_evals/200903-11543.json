   "comments": [
    "YES! Take EPE 215, my class was relatively small, 8 people, and the discussion in the course was great. You really learn a lot, and you read great philosophers.",
    "This class with Professor Stimson is absolutely fantastic! The thinkers covered are obviously really interesting and really different some of them, so it's great to have a class like this where you can learn from the professor but also discuss a lot with the other students too. I know I definitely have a more than surface level knowledge of the theorists we read now, as well as how many of their theories compare in terms of goals, mechanisms and views on human nature and the future progress of humanity. So great class, especially with Professor Stimson. Take it if you can.",
    "It was a great seminar that allowed me to re-read and re-evaluate major works of the western cannon. Definitely take it with Prof. Stimson if offered in the future.",
    "If you're interested in political philosophy or great thinkers or the state of society, take this course. Stimson is a great professor who really connects the dots in the course. It's a survey course with intense discussion of some of the great political philosophers- Rousseau, Smith, Kant, Tocqueville, Mill, Marx... It focuses not only on political aspects but also economic and moral considerations.Great course. Quite a bit of reading and preparation for classes. 3 papers about 6 pages in length. Not an easy class but very exciting nonetheless.",
    "YES -- especially with Prof. Stimson! She's a wonderful teacher and makes the subject matter interesting. She is also good at facilitating rich classroom discussion.",
    "EPE 215 is a class that you could probably pass by slacking of you tried hard enough, but you would never want to. It isn't easy, but it's fun."
