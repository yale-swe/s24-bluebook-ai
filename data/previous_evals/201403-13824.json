    "Take this if you're interested in the topic and would like to learn more about it, but expect that this course is going to be challenging in terms of the excessive amount of work involved.",
    "It's a look at the scientific arguments against free will. A lot of the reading is kind of a greatest hits list of psychology studies but framed as an argument against free will. But they're still really cool studies and it's interesting to think about their implications for free will. The workload is very manageable and the exams are fair. Final paper topic is very broad. I would recommend if you're interested in the topic and won't be frustrated by almost all of the arguments being against free will and a dismissiveness toward religion. If you've thought a lot about the questions before, you probably won't break new ground. But it's still interesting to learn a little more about who has what to say on these issues. Also, I appreciated having a place where these important questions could be discussed, since outside of this kind of setting free will goes unquestioned.",
    "I recommend it! Even if you aren't doing the neuroscience psych track.",
    "Take this class if you want to be challenged to think like a humanities major. It's one thing to know neuroscience, it's another thing to be able to apply what you learn to culture and metaphysics. And if you don't mind the weekly reading responses , Free Will is a great class to take.",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Brown is great and seminar discussion was always interesting. If you're interested in the intersection of neuroscience and philosophy, this is your course."
