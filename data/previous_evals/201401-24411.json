    "At times both my favorite and least favorite class of the semester. Go check it out for yourself. It's totally unique on this campus in terms of the structure, and the resources available to you.",
    "It will be a lot of work but a unique and cool way to learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend MENG 491. If you're an engineering student, just know that the first half of the semester will be spent on learning about the space and identifying potential projects. I wish more time could have been spent developing prototypes, but given that you start the semester with little to no knowledge about the class topic, I suppose it's necessary to spend the time in the beginning researching background. Dr. Zinter is also an amazing instructor. I liked the format of having 4 different projects rather than 1 class project as they've done in past years. I would shop the class on the first day to see if the project space is interesting to you. Overall I thought it was a great experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I am an MCDB major who had no background in business or engineering going in to this class. You are from the onset immersed in an interdisciplinary and creative environment unlike any other at Yale. The end product of your semester's effort will make you extremely proud and appreciative of the journey you just experienced. Because of this course, our group won 25k and will be implementing our prototype in the field this summer. This class was literally life-changing.",
    "Definitely! This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. There's something in it for everyone. Teaches you a cool way of thinking, and you'll develop skills faster than you would believe! As an engineer, I'll say this is one of the few engineering classes at Yale where you actually get to be a real engineer and make things. Definitely worth it. Probably good to take as a junior. Also, Joe Zinter is awesome and it is a privilege to be his student!",
    "If you can get in, take it! Each year, the theme for the class changes to a new problem in a developing world setting. Though it lacks an actual field visit, you spend the first few weeks reaching out to anyone and everyone trying to learn all you can about the space. This year, our class started with the prompt: \"1.8 million people die each year from vaccine-preventable deaths\" and from day 1, we set out to learn as much as we can. We then worked on generating ideas for interventions that would be feasible, viable and desirable, before narrowing it down to our top 4 ideas as a class. Overall, this class SCREAMS multidisciplinary. We had engineers and architects working alongside global affairs and chemistry majors trying to really navigate this space. By the end of the semester, we had our final prototypes all ready: a thermo-sensitive SMS alert system; phase change material packing for vaccine vials; a pre-filled, single-dose vaccinator and accompanying carrier; and a bracelet that electronically stores vaccination histories and empowers mothers to actively seek necessary vaccinations. The last one actually won the Thorne prize for $25,000 to actually get this out into the field. Cool shit. you should take this!",
    "My favorite course this semester and definitely top-3 in my three years at Yale! If you can get in, take it!! The course is based on a real-world problem (this semester it was vaccines in developing countries) that you make a contribution to solving in some aspect. The first half of the course is spent conducting extensive research and proposing various interventions, while the second half is spent creating a prototype based on the intervention, along with a group of 4-5 people across different majors. The professors were wonderful and very enthusiastic throughout the course of the semester. Weekly meetings with them, outside of class time, is very helpful in providing direction. You are also given the opportunity to make connections with professionals in the field of interest in order to evaluate your idea and gain a better understanding of the problem. My criticisms are that it is not always very structured and requires students taking their own initiative to organize the work. In addition, because all work was done in a group, there were instances of free-riding, where some members would work much more than others. Overall, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take this course! Just realize that it is a ton of work and as an engineering student you might be doing a bulk of the prototyping due to only having a few engineering students in the class. Either way you learn a lot! The course as a design course is a wonderful experience for both engineering and non-engineering students. Having a chance to be in a physical workshop is so much better than having to do problem sets week after week and a new experience to students who have never done any engineering in their lives. You gain an appreciation for the work on the other side (engineering or business). It's a great course to provide a break to your problem set courses.",
    "If you can get in, definitely take it!!! It gets to be a lot of work towards the end but its totally worth it! Take it!",
    "I would completely recommend this class. It is worth every minute you spend on it. The professors are the most involved and supportive professors I've had at Yale, and it was true pleasure to work on a project that you've designed from the very beginning."
