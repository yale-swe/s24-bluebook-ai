As long as you keep an open mind and remain flexible, you will learn tons from this class. I am going on to actually start the business we worked on in this class, and the help from Maureen and David has been immensely useful in starting up and securing funding.",

   "comments": [
    "A little more direction and encouragement regarding applying to competitions. More presentation and public speaking practice.",
    "The course is designed for traditional start-up stage ventures, specifically in the Silicon Valley style of rapid growth, low-cost companies. Companies that are not built for rapid scaling and growth, or that require high capital costs, are less likely to benefit from this class.",
    "Some elements need to be updated. For example, most PE\/VCs do not look at a company's business plan anymore",
    "The terms negotiations assignment was a little slap-dash; could be explained to students better and have more direction given.",
    "None",
    "Needs to be updated to reflect modern entrepreneurial realities: 25 page business plan (\"the book\") is rarely required; capital structure can and often should focus on non-VC funding; not all businesses need to exit; the 20 year old powerpoints with stupid sound effects are terrible; better explanation of financial model; guest speakers would be nice;",
    "I think there are 2 main areas that could be improved: 1) I think the structure of the class is very much designed for a particular type of start-up, in the VC mold of extremely rapid growth, like a new app would want. It doesn't really fit for a company that would rather be a non-profit or slower growing socially minded business. 2) I'm not convinced that this kind of business plan is the most current way of starting a business. There are probably many ways that the class could be modernized."

    "Advantages: forced to deal with navigating complex interpersonal relationships and personality mismatches Disadvantages: the same",

You will also develop an incredible amount of knowledge in the field your business is starting in.",
