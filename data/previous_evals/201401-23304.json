    "I'd take it freshman year so it helps with future papers",
    "No matter what your major, you should consider taking this class. It will help not just your academic writing, but also your writing outside of the classroom and your understanding of what you read.",
    "Don't take it if you are not interesting in reading or writing the modern essay, like me.",
    "A fun and engaging English class that I imagine most people at Yale should take, unless you really don't like writing about yourself or about issues you're passionate\/care about. No analytical writing, only personal essays, op-eds, portraits, and critiques. Good writing credit, though not an easy one - don't come in expecting to get As on papers. More interesting and relevant than high school English.",
    "TAKE IT. Seriously, if you take one English class at Yale, this should be it. I thought I was done with English forever, but this class made me love it again. The essays are fun to write, and they really improve your writing skills. Though getting A's is difficult in this class, don't make that your ultimate goal. Let yourself have fun with the open-endedness of the essays! You read some good essays as well. The workload can be tough at times, but it's still manageable. Dr. Hopper is super sweet and wants you to succeed.",
    "We read 5-6 short, enjoyable, New Yorker-style essays per week and discuss their techniques in class. We write 5 essays through the course of the semester, handing in a new draft every week. The first week is a rough draft and then a substantially better final draft the next. Twice during the semester my essays were workshopped by my peers. I really enjoyed the class and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their writing skills rapidly without having to do a ton of reading. I also liked the focus on non-fiction creative writing because it gave me the time that I wouldn't have otherwise invested in reflection regarding issues of my past or just things I hadn't explored about the world.",
    "English 120 teaches you effective tactics for writing the modern essay that are essential to know for any college student. I would definitely recommend taking it, even if English is not your major.",
    "Necessary for anything you'll do in the future.",
    "Fun writing course. Not Too much work (try not to procrastinate too hard on essays)."
