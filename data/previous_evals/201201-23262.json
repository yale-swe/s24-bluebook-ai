    "I wouldn't recommend you take this class",
    "very good course. the class is laid back and fun, which is a nice change of pace, especially compared to other 400-level seminars. i would definitely recommend.",
    "I would say take this class. It's a really good look at important works of medieval art. It does tend more towards a lecture than a discussion-based seminar, but Professor Jung knows more about the subject than you do, so she is most definitely worth listening to. Even when the class did start discussions, things got a little bogged down because people didn't know enough basic information about art in the Middle Ages, so that was a little frustrating. Also Professor Jung is the kindest, most caring professor I have ever had at Yale, and she is always willing to help in any way that she can.",
    "good survey of medieval art pieces. recommend it",
    "If you are interested in medieval art and already have some background In it",
    "Monumental Narrative made me appreciate medieval art more, but it was not the most interesting class. I guess it depends on the people in your class, but in my class, it was two people who talked and eight who just sat there. The theme of the course was strong though, and the different pieces connected well. Besides the fact that there was a TON of reading each week which it seemed like no one did, the only assignments were a paper and a presentation so it was not too much work besides the book a week readings.",
    "YES. Really interesting in that it forces you to deal with a crazy variety of material. And then to think about how narrative is conveyed and what it means in the middle ages."
