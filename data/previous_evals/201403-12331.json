   "comments": [
    "I would recommend; manageable amount of reading, interesting readings, and a offers a totally new perspective of your basic assumptions about the modern American political state.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in political history, as the course covers many of the important writings on the development of the American bureaucracy.",
    "PLSC 272 is a small seminar which explores the process of American party formation through leading literature on American political history. The course touches on populism, Jacksonian America, founding views of political actors, etc. Students read one major work per week and then discuss it in seminar, writing a final term paper at the end of the semester. I would absolutely recommend this seminar to another student interested in American political history. You will learn a TON in a seminar that is well-organized and full of the major works of scholarship that you will inevitably run into. Students are asked to read lengthy and sometimes verbose works of scholarship, but Professor DeCanio is awesome and if you enjoy American history\/politics, you will like this course.",
    "Very interesting course on the formation of the modern bureaucratic state and origin of today's political parties. DeCanio is brilliant albeit cynical, and made it worth going to class every week. The reading is no more than a book per week, which is a lot but you can skim much of it. The final paper is 80% of your grade, which feels great in the beginning of the course because there's no real work, but is really annoying at the end when that makes or breaks your entire semester. As a poli sci major I definitely would recommend it."
