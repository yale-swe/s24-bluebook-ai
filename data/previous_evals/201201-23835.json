    "StrengthsAttempt to provide students with a hands on research project through the survey and presentation of resultsWeaknessesCourse did not align well with Biostats 2 and did not seem to provide information that was all that much different than Biostats 2 and therefore, an efficient use of students time for a required class.The instructor really needs to work with Biostats 2 instructor so their instruction can complement each other. It is pointless to teach something in methods before it is taught in Biostats.Course packed a lot of information in that seem solely related to economics research and very little relationship to public health issues.Course was only taught from the perspective that all Health Policy and Management students would only do economics research.No effort was made to help teach students proper survey designAny intent of trying to teach us something through homework was lost due to the fact that the majority of the time was spent trying to write SAS code in which the instructor provided poor instruction on.The final individual project seemed pointless and it provided no opportunity to actually simulate research methods on a topic of personal interest--once again providing a rote assignment that only relates to public health on the peripheray.",
    "Excellent course. Love the content, very useful, and the combination of lab and lectures are pretty helpful for digestion the knowledge and getting hands on experience",
    "very good,",
    "Strengths- very comprehensive. However, we went VERY quickly and skimmed over many topics which we hadn't yet learned how to do in biostatistics. It would be very helpful to have BIS505b combined with a data management course first year, and then this class as an advanced methods course for research design, etc. offered in the second year. We didn't know enough about SAS and linear regression to purposefully create or analyze the information from the survey.",
    "Strenghts: Exposure to quantitative research methods.Weaknesses: Did not come out of the class with a comprehensive understanding of research methods in public health. Class was mainly SAS and quantitative focused and addressed only a small subset of what would be needed to conduct research in the field. Too much emphasis on details in specific methods which may or may not be useful in my future career.",
    "It is a great course to teach you about reserach methods. I think we spent too much time talking about the group orjects and not working close enough with the groups to make sure that they were grasping and applying the concepts appropriately.",
    "-good class slides-quizzes more difficult than homework assignments-last paper unnecessary (backloaded too much work)",
    "To my mind, the course balances all the weaknesses of the statistics II course. Without research methods, it would have been difficult to understand logistic regression, interaction effect, dummies etc. While the statistics II course verbally portrayed these mathematical concepts, this course illuminated them.Also, the practical research component brings the concepts to life and is one of the most applied assignments I have had hitherto in the MPH curriculum. Great!Overall, a very well crafted course.",
    "Strengths:1)The materials presented in this class provided essential statistical evaluation tools that were essential and applicable in a professional public health setting.2)The power-point slides were helpful during lectures and as a reference when doing homework assignments.",
    "A-",
    "Great course for learning statistical methods to be used in analyzing research. Course is taught to advanced of a level. Assumes a stronger background in statistics and SAS than the students actually received in their biostatistics classes.",
    "excellent.",
    "The course is a research methods course and covers most statistical methods. However this course should resemble more the \"Data management\" course required for students in some other divisions. We should learn how to do something step by step. To do some of the homework problems some of us had to look online for hours to get the code for SAS. Also, the homework problems are too confusing and most of them are due in the first few weeks of the semester when they should be more spread out. The individual research paper assignment was interesting and I wished we are more assignments like that.",
    "Strengths - The prof is a good guy and tried his best to convey the informationCons - While he was really trying and thought everything was very clear, the slides and way he depicts it just isn't. For the most part the class was confused during lecture and so much so they didn't even bother asking questions. Having a course \/ text book to read in supplement would have made a huge difference in grasping the material.Also, the timeline for the final group project was just not realistic for a good product."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0While very enthusiastic and a very nice person, the instructor is not skilled at delivering information in an organized, understandable manner. He presents way too much information without connection and examples that people understand. This was the same problem with Microeconomics in the fall. Also, he is not very knowledgeable about public health in general which makes it difficlt for him to provide accurate examples, etc. He has a lot of potential but someone really needs to spend the time evaluting his teaching methods and work with him to improve them. He should also have a mid-term evaluation so changes could be made. It is completely unreasonable to have homework assignments requiring us to write SAS code when he doesn't teach it. Finally, he only held office hours twice during the course of the year.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Great teacher. Patient and teaches slowly, make sure that everyone can understand",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0he's one of the greatest teacher in YSPH",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0One of the best instructors at YSPH. Still Doug sometimes goes a little too quickly- his brain just works at a faster speed than our does, but he slows down and tries to explain concepts whenever a student requests. Great enthusiasm for teaching, and he makes class fun as well.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor was very personable and very receptive to the students' needs. He addressed them in class, and was responsive to repeating difficult concepts.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Very friendly and approachable, willing to meet with students outside of class. However did not have a good understanding of the limited knowledge that most students enrolled have had with computer programming and SAS.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0He's got a very laid back teaching style, but I don't think it is detailed enough for some of the topics the course covers. He could use more examples for some of the more complex topics (e.g. Intrumental Variables) and use more literature\/publications to supplement his presentations of the topic.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Simply excellent on all dimensions.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Strengths:1)The instructor presented materials clearly and in an organized manner. This allowed the materials to be better understood.2)The instructor is accessible to student should students have questions or need help.3)The instructor has good feedbacks and replies to student questions readily.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0A",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Good professor. Lessons could be improved by taking more time to introduce the topics, reorganizing slides and focusing on main ideas.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0excellent. very enthusiastic for the topics tought. very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug is very nice and always ready to help students. I just think the course is structured in a confusing way (we talk about advanced statistical methods but don't go over the basics). Sometimes his explanations are a little confusing. But he definitely allows available to discuss any matter.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0He really cares and you can tell he is trying. However, there is still a big gap in his ability to convey concepts clearly to the class. I know it makes sense to him but things rarely don't click and I really struggled in understanding the lectures. Having a textbook that he follows would have made things much easier to understand."

   "comments": [
    "The TAs merely helped us write the SAS code so we could do our homework because the instructor didn't do an adequate job teaching it. While friendly, Nick wasn't able to provide accurate information, assistance or explanations. Leo was much better but he was only able to repeat what the instructor presented in class. Both TAs seemed invested in the class and want to be helpful but they weren't able to provide much additional help outside of anything said by the instructor. However, both TAs did stay in the computer lab well beyond their office hours to make sure everyone received the help they needed. In that way, they were much better than TAs I've had for other classes.",
    "I appreciate the questionnaire work that TAs have done",
    "they are all great guys",
    "We didn't really use the TAs- office hours weren't convenient, and also the work was pretty individual. When we did ask, sometimesthe TAs didn't know the more advanced SAS questions we had.",
    "TAs were readily available and had great insight.",
    "Nick DeVito and Leo Quigley: Very friendly and approachable, however did not have a strong enough background in SAS and methods to be very helpful during the homework help sessions. They tried their best to get through the problem sets, but it would be more informative to either have easier lab assignments or TA's that are extremely familiar with the methods being taught (i.e. PhD candidates).",

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student and I would encourage them to see if they could substitute a different research methods class in LEPH if this class is a requirement. I do not feel that I learned skills that will help me do research on my own as it was only based on regression. I received a better foundation for that in Biostats 2. The program is doing policy and management students a disservice by requiring this particular class in order to learn methods.",
    "Highly recommend it\uff01",
    "highly recommend",
    "This class goes faster than the Biostats class, so some topics you won't have had exposure to yet...Don't worry- you'll figure it out by the end of the semester. (Make sure to start data analysis early for the group project, and take advantage of the time with the professor and TAs...)",
    "This course is a great step in to creating an investigation. However, I would suggest to have assigned lab time where the instructor goes through the code word by word so that we can understanding the thought process for doing it.",
    "Useful in terms of getting more experience working in\/using SAS, however practical application of methods needed in public health policy\/management work is uncertain and questionable. Course would be more useful it it was more of a survey\/overview of all research methods and not just using SAS to get through a handful of topics related to quantitative methods for conducting research.",
    "It's cool. It is a decent intro to research methods in policy, and it is pretty SAS heavy, which I don't know it that is warranted or not. I would recommend it as an introductory course.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and would always recommend it to fellow students.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students who want to gain more experience in working with SAS, a statistical program. Also,I would recommend this class to students who are looking to design a survey and to use survey questionnaires for their thesis. This course allows students to practice designing research questions, to acquire data responses, to clean data responses, to evaluate data responses and to interpret them.",
    "I hope you like regression",
    "Good class for learning to analyze data. Takes a lot of outside work before it the subject matter clicks.",
    "excellent. highly recommendable to all MPH students.",
    "This is a mandatory course but it really needs to be structured differently. I haven't learned many things in this course that I feel like can serve me in my professional career."
