    "The content of the class is very student driven. If there is something you are interested in Anna will make it part of the course. The required books are definitely a hard read for an L5 class and more in class focus in understanding them would have been helpful.",
    "It is a wonderful course that goes at a good pace. It is difficult to mention any weaknesses because I really liked it. I would like to see more focus on the modern day Naples."

    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a great course if you want to keep up with your Italian but do not have time \/ do not want to take the traditional L5 class. You learn a lot of interesting things and the midterm\/final papers were actually fun because you are given the liberty to write about practically any topic you want (as long as it is relevant to the class).",
    "Take this course! Anna is simply wonderful! You will fall in love with Naples and Yale's Italian department.",
    "Yes!!! If you are at all interested about Naples or just Italian as a language, this class is engaging and fun.",
    "It is a great course! Take it! Professor Iacovella is a pleasure to study under. She has all the insights since she is from Naples. You will not only improve your Italian but also learn the history and linguistic characteristics of the Neapolitan."
