    "Hands down the greatest class I've ever taken in my entire life. Amazing. Lots of work actually, this is definitely not a gut. You have to do a lot of work on your own, often with very little instruction. But honestly, it is so worth all of your time and effort because you get so much out of this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN! THE BEST EXPERIENCE YOU WILL HAVE AT YALE!",
    "it is a beautiful, incredible gift to have such a class and to get to know such amazing professors--they're amazing scientists, but they're also pretty incredible people. i'm so happy I took it.",
    "Amazing class. After going to the rainforest to collect plant samples, you get to spend a summer conducting original, independent research. The amount of independence given to undergraduates to pursue their research interests in this class is unheard of. This class really is what you make of it - you can pursue botany, medicinal, and chemistry topics - whatever interests you. The course's small class size also facilitatesinteractions between professors, students, and TAs, which is rare in any science department.Take this course.",
    "The best class in the world. Take it.",
    "The trip to Ecuador is really fun, but you must realize that is not the point of the class. Words of advice: figure out who you want to live with over the summer early. Find a collaborator early and get those details settled so you aren't scrambling at the last minute. The lab work is a lot towards the end of spring semester, do not underestimate it. It is still a cool and worthwhile class! We are just starting summer lab at the moment, and the first day was super hectic and crazy - so much stuff to do!",
    "Absolutely take this class! You won't believe how much it'll change your life. You will love every second of it! It's definitely worth the summer in New Haven.",
    "Rainforest Expedition and Lab (REAL) is a class that will launch you into research at Yale, and at the same time will provide you with unforgettable memories and introduce you to great peers and professors.",
    "BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE! Just when I was starting to feel discouraged by the lecture-style, memorization-based science classes at Yale, I took this class, and I am so glad I did because it totally changed my opinion of science at Yale and got me really excited about what I was learning. This class is taught by three amazing professors and two awesome TAs, all of whom are so dedicated to helping the students design their own research projects and get excited about science. It's really rare to find a science class that is based on helping students design their own projects rather than memorize information or follow lab protocols, so take advantage of it if you are at all interested in science! The trip to Ecuador is amazing. Some advice: The workload is not evenly spaced so start working on big projects ahead of time, especially your plant list and the bioassay project. Expect to spend at least several hours per week in the lab after the Ecuador trip.",
    "If you think for even a second to take this course, and even if you find yourself reading this sentence for no reason in particular, do take it. Although it requires you to spend a summer doing research in New Haven, which you may or may not desire to do, the trip to Ecuador is worth the price of admission alone. Even though most of the trip is paid for, I was poor after the trip and yet still I view it as an investment very well spent. The only regret that I could possibly have about this class is that the rest of my schedule was so jam-packed and difficult this semester that I could not spend as much time as I would have liked thinking about my research plans with this class.The Rainforest lab is the most hands-on and applied class that I have taken here at Yale. I believe the knowledge I have gained here is the most profound of all my classes at Yale but one, in terms of how it will remain with me and still be useful. You learn what you need to know, when you need to know it, and each new thing is a blast. My learning here got me interested in Rainforest preservation, the indigenous peoples of the Amazon, botany, mycology, drug discovery, etc., the list goes on and on. Do know that you should be prepared to work in this class, without it ever being a chore.",
    "Taking this class was the best decision I made since coming to Yale. It was an absolutely terrific class. The trip to the rainforest was the most interesting and coolest trip of my life. The professors are incredibly caring and fun. And the project is independent and exciting--you really do claim ownership of a project and (hopefully) get to see it to fruition in the summer. The workload is very manageable, but it is enough that it keeps you on top of your game and makes you learn new things. I've learned a tremendous amount from this class, and I bet that this summer will teach me even more. You'd be crazy to not want to take this class.",
    "YES. Amazing. By far the best course I've ever taken at Yale! It's really just such an incredible, once in a lifetime experience. The trip to the rainforest is incredible. Plus, this is one of the few opportunities you will have as an undergrad to develop and take charge of your own research project. The professors are also wonderful. They are definitely my three favorite professors at Yale. All of them are so approachable, fun, and supportive. It's been so nice being able to get to know professors so well. This is not an opportunity to be passed up."
