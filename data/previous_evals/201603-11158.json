    "Developed great understanding of Italian!",
    "Time management, linguistically skills, memorization, application skills",
    "I have never taken a spoken foreign language before, so I found the class to be quite difficult. Anna made it enjoyable and I looked forward to class everyday.",

    "It really hits you with a lot of vocab but doesn't make you learn it. I learned minimal vocab and was fine on assessments. They really slam you with grammar. But overall, it's a good course. Moves fast, but you learn good info and Italian is fun. Also, Foccaccia Blues is a terrible movie. I am so confused about why we watched it. It was simultaneously incredibly boring and wildly bizarre. Also weirdly sexual in places. It's just a very bad film. I looked it up and it was panned by critics. It is not a good movie. Please pick another film to show.",
    "Strengths: Fun, informative, enjoyable!",
    "The strengths of this course was the teacher and the classroom environment. The weakness of this course was maybe the lack of explanation on a couple of the grammar topics.",
    "There could have been more spoken Italian in class, but other than that the work was reasonable.",
    "I think that it was extremely fast paced and I wish that we had more time me to go over the concepts in class.",
    "I loved the class engagement and ability to speak freely. I wish we had more time in between the tests."

    "Yes! It is a great deal of work though ... 1.5 credits means 1.5 x the amount of work!",
    "Yes an awesome language course!",
    "I would. I loved this class. I loved the teacher and the things that we learned.",
    "I honestly loved going to Italian everyday, because of Anna and my fellow students, though I do not enjoy foreign language much I would still recommend this class.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone thinking of taking a new language. It is amazing and not too hard to learn but not exactly easy. It challenges me but also is so enjoyable to learn."
