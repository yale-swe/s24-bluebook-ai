   "comments": [
    "Even if you're not a math major, this is a pretty cool course to take.",
    "A fun course that gives you some introduction to group theory and some practice on linear algebra.",
    "I would recommend it as a good way to solidify one's algebra knowledge by tying the abstract concepts to very tangible ideas.",
    "I would recommend MATH 235 to someone who is seeking a bridge course between linear algebra (MATH 222\/225) and abstract algebra (MATH 350). It introduces you to group theory (though focuses on a very specific part of group theory), and presents some practical and hands-on applications that will become a lot more abstract and general in MATH 350. By the end of the class, you'll also be learning theorems whose implications are honestly just really cool. Overall, yes, I definitely recommend the course if Prof. Lachowska is teaching it.",
    "Reflection Groups is a lot of fun. The material is amazingly interesting. Professor Lachowska is the best professor in the department and that aside is simply incredible. She is clearly enthused by the subject matter and is so approachable and helpful. This course is prefect after 222 or 225--I took it after 225 and gained a greater proficiency with proofs, with group theory (a subset of set theory) and general mathematics. It is a great inbetweener after linear and before more intense pure math. The psets are fun, the final and midterms are a lot of fun too. You get to know your classmates well and it's genuinely just a special environment.",
    "Best math class ever. Take this before you go into abstract algebra or representation theory. It gives a good introduction to group theory while solidifying your understanding of linear algebra. I came into this class with little experience in proof-based math, but now I feel much more confident writing proofs. The problem sets were never unmanageable, especially if you work in a group (I became good friends with people in my study group this way). The exams had an usual format: Prof. Lachowska gave everyone a pool of questions to look at beforehand, and on the day of the test, everyone randomly drew several of them (2 for the midterm, 6 for the final). It forced me to study all the questions really well without stressing too much, but it does mean some people had really easy draws and some had really hard ones. Working on the questions together was a great bonding experience. I highly recommend this class.",
    "Take this class after 222 or 225, but make sure to brush up on your linear algebra before class starts. This class seems like an optional ramp-up to 350, much like 250 is a (semi) optional ramp-up to 300. I learned a lot about algebra and group theory, and even more about the magical Coxeter groups. It's a nice class, and covers some material you might not see until a much higher-level math class.",
    "Math 235 is a difficult but low pressure math class that will get you to start thinking like a mathematician. You learn a little bit of group theory with special attention to coxeter groups. It is a nice mix of abstract algebra and geometry. I would recommend this class a lot to anyone who thinks they might be interested in pursuing higher level math."
