    "I became better at reading arabic. Also, I became familiar with the al-jazeera website which will be extremely helpful as a source to maintain my arabic proficiency. I think my conversing skills improved a bit through our weekly collaborations. And of course, my vocabulary expanded.",
    "Reading and writing skills, primarily.",
    "I mostly improved my current fluency of arabic rather than learning any new topics or vocabulary -- I thought this was a very valuable experience given that most of L1-L4 emphasized new topics without giving much chance to practice conversation. To be sure, I also learned a lot of new vocab, and I had the opportunity to do some more in depth translation, but it was primarily a \"bridge\" class which I found helpful.",
    "Class was rarely engaging, seemingly often for both the students and for the professor herself. We did the same round of Al Jazeera exercises every week until the end, when we focused more on the project, which was moderately better but still stopped far short of really interesting and rewarding. Since the students in the class came from far different skill sets and backgrounds in Arabic, nothing in the curriculum felt like it fit anyone's education correctly. Most people, from those I've spoken with, seem to feel that taking the class didn't progress their Arabic so much as, at best, maintain what they'd gained from study abroad experiences and, at worst, lose part of their speaking skills. That being said, our TA did a phenomenal job and section with him was often the only time I felt like I was receiving the instruction I needed and wanted.",
    "A little bit of vocab; that's about it.",
    "I developed more vocabulary",
    "In this course, I further developed my grasp of the Arabic language, which I have been studying at Yale for the past two years. Specifically, I became much more proficient in reading\/listening to and discussing news articles and videos in Arabic, as well as in reading and discussing Arabic literature."

    "Learning Arabic here at Yale is very difficult. Aside from a 50 minute class three times a week, there is very little exposure to Arabic. I am not sure if there are any ways to improve this, but I would say THE BIGGEST WEAKNESS: is the lack of faculty for the Arabic program. Due to scheduling conflicts, I cannot continue with Arabic 151 next semester, and I was extremely upset to hear that it will be an entire year before I can pick up with Arabic again, because nothing for my level, not even dialect, would be offered next fall. Arabic is not only a beautiful language, but such an IMPORTANT language -- especially in the context of global affairs and international policy. For there to only be THREE faculty members for AN ENTIRE LANGUAGE is ridiculous. It is a disservice to not just the language, but each student here at Yale who wants to learn Arabic, who needs to learn Arabic for their prospective professions. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are poured into other language programs here at Yale -- namely, Chinese. Honestly, on the global level, Arabic is just as important as Chinese --- yet, the Arabic department cannot hire more staff because there is no funding? Are you kidding me? I cannot continue with Arabic because there aren't enough professors to teach an alternate course -- because Yale doesn't have enough money to hire the professors to do so??? In 2015 Yale had a 25.57 BILLION dollar endowment -- and I cannot continue with Arabic because Yale does not have enough money to hire more Arabic professors. How can this course be improved? Hire more professors so that I and my peers can actually continue to learn the language.",
    "Sarab is absolutely fantastic. The other strengths of this course are the focus on reading articles, and free-form writing exercises. I had so much more fun doing the work for this class than I had for any previous class. Another strength is in the atmosphere of the class -- Sarab really made it friendly and enjoyable. I liked that we were always assigned to talk to different students, and do collaborations with them, so we all got to know one another. And of course, the class was enjoyable because Sarab is always so upbeat and funny -- though of course also serious about the work. The structure of the projects was also awesome -- each was short enough that it never felt unmanageable, and I was never stressed about the work :) Main weakness was that book of short stories. I think it's objectively a pretty bad book, and also filled with weird typos. It's definitely not appropriate for this level of Arabic course. Every single person I know in the class really struggled to understand even the essential ideas of their short story, because every one was written in such flowery and poetic language, and was unlike anything we had read before. I got help from two native speakers, both of whom said the story was \"weirdly\" written, and difficult even for them to understand. Reading that story was by far the worst learning experience of the class -- I spent hours and hours of break combing through the story with a dictionary, and getting only incoherent translations because the language was so metaphorical, and filled with expressions. I then had to spend a lot of time with native speakers helping me, and they helped me put together a summary -- so I got a good grade, but didn't get too much out of it. The other problem these stories caused was that whoever was giving their presentation that week was so lost with their story that they dominated the section, in order to ask about a translation for pretty much every line. So it's just not an appropriate choice for this level. I love the idea of reading short stories, but we would need to find simpler ones, that we can understand on our own. Also very important!! There really needs to be an upper level Arabic class offered in Fall 2016.",
    "The professor was very strong and attentive to student comments. She changed the structure of the course to accommodate students' interests. One of the problems is that there are too few higher level Arabic courses so the students in the class had very different levels, which made it difficult for the teacher to accommodate everyone.",
    "I thought the main strength was the structure of the class. I liked working on a new, student-chosen article each week, translating it and selecting vocab to be quizzed on. I thought this was incredibly helpful. I also loved the collaborations, and the in-class emphasis on speaking. I think there is definitely some room for improvement, however. For one, the \"homework\" for the articles was far too easy. It took me about 10 minutes a night to do the multiple choice, matching, etc. Second, I thought aspects of the final project were not ideal. Most importantly, we received very little guidance on the literary translation part, and I think it would have been helpful to work on some of those stories as a class and answer the respective questions in the textbook (much as we did for the aljazeera articles). Finally, I think it might have been helpful to introduce one new grammar concept a week along with the articles, especially if there was some novel grammatical use in one of the articles.",
    "The main problems with the course were: 1) There were not enough Arabic course options, so students of vastly different skill levels were grouped together in one class 2) Too much emphasis on speaking MSA, and not enough practice reading texts",
    "More grammar would be useful, as people were coming into L5 with different backgrounds.",
    "Needs more conversation and more engaging reading material with organized class discussions.",
    "The course was great in that it was very much student directed - we selected what articles to read and discuss, what vocab words to study, etc. On the other hand, this made the course feel a bit unstructured, and it was difficult to retain new vocabulary and other skills when each week kept changing so significantly."

    "Yes, if you are interested in maintaining your Arabic skills, this course provides a good outlet to do so. You will not learn too too much, but you will not lose any of your Arabic either.",
    "If you have done any research at all about the Arabic department here, you know that Sarab is supposed to be the best professor (although I don't speak from personal experience with others). As long as she's teaching the course, this is the best Arabic experience you'll have had so far at Yale.",
    "I haven't take other Arabic classes at Yale but I enjoyed this one. I prefer the Al-Kitaab system because it's very systematic and allows you to learn a significant amount of material quickly. However, the structure of this class was more adapted to using Arabic in real life, reading newspapers and the like. I certainly learned a lot and found it useful.",
    "A great class if you are interested in building up fluency! L1-L4 at yale are very vocab and grammar heavy and you don't end up learning too much about how to actually speak, write, or translate. This class is the opposite: you don't learn too much grammar or vocab, but you really learn a lot about how to talk and write, which I found very helpful. The workload is really easy, you get to choose what you translate, and its probably my favorite of all the arabic classes at yale!",
    "This class was a disappointment. After an often subpar, monotonous experience with L1-L4 in Yale's Arabic department, I was hoping to finally learn Arabic in a way separate from the vocab lists compiled from a random assortment of words and the glossed-over grammar lessons that characterized beginning and intermediate Arabic classes. I ended up taking yet another dull Arabic class, with students of wildly differing levels and backgrounds of Arabic that rarely, if ever, worked together in a productive way. We read short Al Jazeera articles, again randomly chosen, with a few new words each week and a quiz every Friday on those words, which were promptly forgotten since they weren't meaningfully incorporated into the curriculum. We spoke more than in past Arabic classes, but again, because of the mismatch of students' language levels in the class, ended up running circles around the same topics. The overarching, semester-long project progressed in fits and starts, some of it ridiculously difficult, some of it easily accomplished in an hour. Frankly, if you've gotten this far in the Arabic program, you know what to expect. There's no real focus on learning to speak Arabic; it's rarely challenging enough in the earlier classes, which means those that learn Arabic through study abroad are stuck in an uninspiring advanced class and those that have stuck to the two-year, Yale track find themselves classified as \"advanced\" speakers without the actual grasp of the language necessary to even remotely claim that level.",
    "It's a fine way to keep up your MSA if you have time in your schedule - but I don't think that I progressed in my language abilities.",
    "This course was adequate and would recommend depending on the goals of the student",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student - it is very good at further developing Arabic language skills, and helps students achieve a very high level of comprehension of written sources."
