   "comments": [
    "Dean Flick is the MAN.",
    "I would not recommend this course because there was little intellectual challenge or rigorous engagement of assumptions by the professor.",
    "Take if you are a bit acquainted with Hinduism and Hindu literature. It may be difficult to follow if you have no prior exposure.",
    "Great course.",
    "Presents a great opportunity to read one of the greatest religious\/philosophical works ever produced. Great ROI: low commitment, but can gain a lot from the class, especially internally.",
    "Great course, more philosophical than religious",
    "Good course, interesting discussions, Dean Flick is awesome.",
    "This class is very relaxed, If you are looking for a chill humanities credit and\/or are interested in Hindu spirituality, then this is a great class to take.",
    "Dean Flick's classes are legendary. You will learn as much as you put in & the class will turn into family. Only take if it is a small class!",
    "Another of Dean Flicks brilliant classes on the classical texts of the hindu faith.",
    "A great course, I would definitely recommend anything taught by Dean Flick.",
    "Take this class! The Gita is a wonderful text, and analyzing it is a fruitful exercise. Krishna's teachings are universally applicable, so don't feel deterred of you're not Hindu, or even if you're not religious. Dean Flick is an absolute gem! He is friendly, approachable, an expert in the field, witty, and soft spoken. His translation of the Gita is lucid and easy to follow, and his interpretations of the various aspects of Krishna's teachings are very convincing, and make perfect sense. It was an absolutely wonderful experience being in his classroom. Workload: weekly reading and short writing response; 5 page paper; 10 page paper - all very manageable, and very rewarding.",
    "This is a really fun class that is not too much work, but can really get you thinking. 2 papers in this class and weekly forum posts online determine your grade. The instructor is very relaxed, but interesting. I would recommend taking this class no matter what during one semester at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is an enjoyable and feasible way to gain a fundamental understanding of a crucial text, and sometimes even contemplate the nature of our own actions. Take this class if you have the chance!"
