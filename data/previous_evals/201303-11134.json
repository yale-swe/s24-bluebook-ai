   "comments": [
    "Yes definitely",
    "If you're interested in cancer and don't have too much specific background knowledge of cancer biology but have a strong science background, then this is definitely the class for you.",
    "This class is a wonderful introduction to the topic of cancer-- underlying molecular mechanisms, some present therapeutics, and history. I would absolutely recommend this course. It was an extremely interesting class on an extremely interesting topic.",
    "If you are not a science-person but into cancer, this class might be wrong for you. The lectures really focus on mechanisms of cancer, including mutations of specific amino acids in a protein which leads to improper binding with kinases and those kind of things. If you are a pre-med or generally interested in science and caner,please take this class. It was the best class I had in freshman fall and I liked every bit of it!",
    "Definitely take this class if your intereste in science",
    "Excellent course, you'll learn a lot! Medium workload, very fun.",
    "This is a very good class for a student interested in molecular biology and molecular biology research. The seminar setting is great because it is a small and personal class and are able to discuss and ask questions about the material to really grasp it. You also get to know the professor very well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in cancer research. It's especially fitting for a freshman seminar because when I came into Yale, I had absolutely no clue what I wanted to do. Taking this seminar has convinced me of my passion for cancer research, and it may do the same for other aspiring students with interests in biology or medicine.",
    "This course is great for any freshman who is interested in medicine, cancer, or biology. I would recommend this course solely for getting to know Sandy"
