   "comments": [
    "I think my biggest takeaways were broad changes in my perspective on the work of Congress. The course renewed my faith in a body that is often known for its inefficiency.",
    "The freedom over paper topics forced me to think more critically\/imaginatively about readings. I learned to feel comfortable and confident enough to criticize giants in the field.",
    "General knowledge of American congressional history",
    "I learned about the historical Congressional battles and how they persist today.",
    "I was challenged to read and digest extensive works on Congress in order to write 5 important papers. This improved my confidence in organizing my thoughts and laying them out on paper.",
    "I developed my writing skills and critical reading skills.",
    "You learn how Congress works: its internal structure, the member incentives, popular politicking, causes and effects of partisanship, and many other things. You also get to learn about the instances when Congress almost single-handedly changed the course of action this country was taking. Overall, if you are in any way interested in politics, especially in the Congressional politics, this is an amazing course!",
    "It deepened my understanding of the role of Congress and how it operated in various historical scenarios.",
    "The skill developed here is, unsurprisingly, that of historical frame. Which moments are part of a trend and which are unique?",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Congress and how to analyze and write about it. I also gained some insights into Congress from the political science we read, although less than the history.",
    "This course offers a comprehensive history of and look inside the United States Congress. From the earliest days of the Republic to the present day, Congress has played a central role in American politics and policy. We study how the legislature operates as a body, both in the light of history as well as the light of other democracies. This is a reading and discussion seminar; instead of a lengthy research paper, there are five short comment papers.",
    "I learned the theoretical underpinnings of the political incentives behind Congressional action as well as a broad overview of Congressional history, delving deeper into specific Congressional periods that interested me personally. I also worked on skills to synthesize political theory with historical narratives in a way very few other classes engage with.",
    "The best class I have taken at Yale, hands down. Professor Mayhew is a legend in his own time and it's a privilege to learn from one of the greatest political scientists alive today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course could be improved by more historical grounding. Professor Mayhew has so much knowledge, and I would have loved to hear more from him throughout each class.",
    "Weaknesses: readings in first section were pretty boring compared to the others. Strengths: Mayhew is an absolute gem. Total giant in the field. One of the kindest professors I've ever had, plus a genius to boot. Validates and engages with every student's ideas. Encyclopedic knowledge. Given how knowledgeable Professor Mayhew is, I wish he lectured\/framed texts and ideas a bit more. Classes, particularly at the beginning of the semester, seemed a little too unstructured. Systematically walking thru each reading like we did in the third part was great.",
    "Love Mayhew!",
    "The students in the course were intelligent and very eager to interact with the material. As such, the seminar style of student exchange was exceptional. Every once and a while, however, I wanted to hear less of the students and their opinions and more of Professor Mayhew and his thoughts.",
    "The class is very \"do it yourself\" 5, 5 page papers that can be done any weeks.",
    "Mayhew is a legend and the readings were interesting.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Prof Mayhew. He is 82 years old, as of now, but in his mind, he is younger than me (I'm like 19). He loves Congress and extremely passionate about this class. Its a pleasure to hear him talk about Congress, or anything to be honest, but he also makes sure that he doesn't talk for too long in the class, so that everyone can participate. Since Prof Mayhew is kinda famous, this class also attracts the brightest Poli. Sci.\/History majors and trust me when I say this, I have never taken a class with such a brilliant, insightful, and engaging group of students. Also the readings are super interesting. Sometimes he would ask us to read only one or two articles each for the discussion but people would end up reading all of them anyways. I think the weakness of the class was its grading. 30% of the class was based on participation and he also didn't give us a letter grade on our papers, so we weren't sure what we were making until the grades were out. Our grades turned out to be great but still it was a bit stressful not to know the whole semester. Also, I don't think it was a weakness since I learnt a lot from this portion of the class, but felt that the last segment of our class was a bit open-ended so sometimes I found myself not so prepared for the discussion.",
    "The discussion was meandering but the readings were fascinating.",
    "Often discussions became too student-controlled. Though my classmates were smart and lovely people, I had hoped for more advisement and direction from our distinguished leader.",
    "The strength was the syllabus and the readings, particularly the \"big books\" and the articles we read in the last part of the course after reading sections of Mayhew's book. The weakness was the seminar itself, primarily the students who were really bad at carrying a discussion about the topic. Everyone seemed bored and disengaged and didn't really try to make points that were insightful or particularly relevant to the readings.",
    "The course structure makes you a more confident writer and speaker. I absolutely loved the course's three-act division of analytic themes, high-stakes showdowns, and policy-making. Each section connected beautifully with the others, and it kept things interesting. Every few weeks it felt like I was in a different, but related seminar. That was refreshing. I loved the middle section of the course, where we each managed to read and present a book. The papers were long enough to touch on interesting ideas and themes, while straightforward enough to not be imposing or distracting from the syllabus. The course suffered from no weaknesses.",
    "The first portion of the course, which focused on the theoretical underpinnings of the class, worked very well and inspired robust discussions. The second portion of the course, however, where students did presentations on one of 6 books over the course of three weeks, sucked a little bit of the energy out of the conversation because when you weren't presenting, there was not much incentive to engage with the material and you had very little reading assigned. I would suggest that Professor Mayhew lower the number of books available to present and have more people assigned to the same book, which they would discuss in conversation with eachother rather than present to make the classroom more dynamic. The third part of the course worked better than the second part but had some deadspace. In it, all students read Professor Mayhew's book Imprint in Congress and then chose articles from an assortment. Sometimes, this worked well because there was a breadth of expertise to the discussion, but it could also lead to only a few people dominating the conversation at certain points since not everyone had the same reading material. I would decrease the number of articles to choose from and tighten the discussion closer to the content of Mayhew's book, using the articles as more supplementary material rather than the driving force of the conversation as they were. Overall, Professor Mayhew is an incredibly engaged professor who makes time for his students and eagerly provides guidance on how to best explore their interests. He stimulates an open and lively learning environment.",
    "No weaknesses, but everything about it is a strength. I have too many good things to say about this course."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in Congress and politics, yes. If not, no.",
    "Yes! Jump at the opportunity to take any class with Professor Mayhew!",
    "Yes! It's so fun to hear Mayhew speak, he's brilliant.",
    "Yes! Professor Mayhew is a charming individual who's goal is to have students learn and share thoughts. Not stressful even though the work was a bit difficult at times.",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot about the history of congress and Mayhew is so smart and nice!",
    "Yes!",
    "If Prof Mayhew end up teaching this course next year, TAKE IT! This is the best class I've taken at Yale so far and you learn so freaking much in this class. If you're into Congressional politics, you'll like the course materials and all the readings, they never get boring. This is a fantastically designed class and total gem.",
    "If you meet with Professor Mayhew frequently then you will get a lot out of readings and discussion more broadly.",
    "This is a great course for the student who wants to read about Congressional history, and who can be self motivating in that sort of study. If you want to have more structure, this isn't the right course.",
    "Perhaps. It is a fun way to study Congress, but it could have been so, so much better with better students and if Professor Mayhew had facilitated better discussion. I still learned from it but the class was difficult to attend sometimes because it often felt so unproductive, although it did get a little better closer to the end.",
    "Yes, without any doubt. This is a fantastic course for anyone who is interested in Congress or politics more generally. This is one of those classic Yale seminars that expands your horizons and opens your mind. It is one upon which I will look back fondly.",
    "Yes, Professor Mayhew is an incredible professor who makes himself available for his students and knows his subject matter better than anyone. Take a course with him if you can.",
    "Absolutely. If you are lucky enough to get in, take it without a doubt. Professor Mayhew is a gem and he attracts, unsurprisingly, some of the best and brightest students from every corner of campus."
