   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course if it is offered again. Professor Bruegemann assigns a few economic research papers (both theoretical and empirical) each week and gives weekly assignments for evaluating the authors' arguments\/methodology. Some of these papers are extremely difficult but Bruegemann provides comprehensive guides that allow you to understand at least the main arguments and approachs of the papers. If nothing else, the experience of reading 25+ economics papers alone makes this course worthwhile, especially if you have any interest in writing a senior paper. In class, students make presentations about the week's readings, which provide the basis for discussion.The professor obviously cares a lot about the class and is extremely helpful.",
    "The papers that you read often deal with interesting topics like the effects of work share programs and the impact of unemployment benefits. However, be ready to read papers that often involve understanding regression models. But even if you don't remember too much econometrics the professor does a great job in providing reading guides to help students understand what is going on in the paper.The workload is kinda light: 2-3 papers per week to read with a 2 page response and 2 presentations during the semester about one of the papers.",
    "If you're going to take an econ seminar, this is a solid choice.",
    "pretty interesting class. weekly assignments and no final paper. the professor is a very nice guy. id recommend it",
    "Each lass focuses on a different policy question having to do with the labor market, such as, \"will graduating in a recession affect you in the long run?\". To answer the question you read a couple of research papers that address the topic. A student presents each paper each class. Then you discuss what you think the answer to the question is, based on the papers you read.",
    "take this course if you want to learn about the effects of recessions on different aspects of the labor market. take it.",
    "I think this seminar is tremendously interesting, especially for those students who are perplexed by the current fiscal crisis and interested in studying its implications."
