   "comments": [
    "The class was not rigorous enough. We spent a lot of time dwelling on definitions and splitting hairs.",
    "Ya if you need the dr",
    "Religion and Politics is an... unfortunate course... The material is not highly engaging, the lecture is terrible, a vast majority of students never attended lecture, the assignments are as simplistic as they are pointless, and if I could go back in time I would have absolutely not picked this course. I do not recommend this course to anyone. -1\/10.",
    "Pretty easy fifth class with not a lot of work - just make sure you study for the writing assignments.",
    "This course gives a broad overview of historical and modern relations between religion and politics. It focuses mainly on Christianity and Islam. The lectures were quite boring at times, to the extent that only 30 out of the 100+ students in the class would attend lectures. Overall, the material is interesting, it's just that the delivery of the material can be quite dull.",
    "I would not recommend it because it did not go too far beneath the surface. The course moves along extremely slowly, and gets boring really quick.",
    "Great introductory class on interactions between religion and politics. Very manageable workload and fair assignments\/tests.",
    "Highly recommended class!!",
    "If you're looking for a gut, this is it. Beware it is a gut based on amount of effort necessary to put in, but not grade-wise. Six writing assignments, drop one, worth 60%, and one final, worth 40%. Easy material, but graders can be nitpicky.",
    "I might recommend this course to a student, depending on what they are looking for. It is an easy fifth course if you are prepared to come to class on a somewhat regular basis and memorize facts for the quizzes. I know some of my classmates didnt do those things and did worse than they were expecting. I think if you are willing to put in the effort, you will learn about the history of the relationship between religion and politics in Europe, Islamic nations, and the US. However, you wont get too deep into any political or religious theory. Still, I found the course to be fairly interesting, and I learned some facts\/concepts that will probably stay with me for a while.",
    "fun course",
    "Great course for what the title describes it as.",
    "Good and easy.",
    "Take it! Low course load and interesting material",
    "interesting readings, little workload, lectures somewhat pointless.",
    "Must take",
    "NOT A GREAT CLASS!! It is def a gut, if you don't mind leaving with a B or B+",
    "This is an easy poli-sci course that is quite interesting if you go to class and pay attention. If you don't pay attention, though, it can get quite boring.",
    "Unorganized.",
    "A valuable class that all students should take.",
    "It's a really easy class. Subject material has potential to be really interesting, but currently it's just ok. Take it as a 5th class",
    "If you are interested in religion and how it affects politics, take this course, but be aware that going to class might bore you a bit. The content by itself is very interesting and is worth reading.",
    "The worst class at Yale. Period.",
    "Engaging material and a very laid back class.",
    "Really easy course about a topic that is prevalent and thought-provoking but it could have been taught much better. Prof Kahl is so smart and kind but not the best lecturer"
