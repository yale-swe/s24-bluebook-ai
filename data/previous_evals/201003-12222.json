    "This is an interesting class, but definitely more challenging than I expected -- this is not a bare-bones overview of the human body; it is an in-depth look at how systems like the cardiovascular, skeletal, urinary, and reproductive systems work. Be prepared to work hard (this is not an easy A)! However, Dean Segraves and Professor Kundel are really approachable and helpful, as are the TAs, so you can get a lot of help if you need it.",
    "Take it if you need an easy science but prepare to do some work.",
    "Good science credit for non-science majors, 3 quizzes and 3 tests, none of them cumulative. no final.",
    "It's a great overview of the biology of the human body that is interesting for all people to know. I would definitely recommend the class--it's a great science class for non-science majors.",
    "Human Biology is a perfect science course for non-science majors. Interesting material, manageable workload, terrific teachers, and well-prepared-for tests. Highly, highly recommended!",
    "Human Biology is not a gut class, but it is not a hard class either. The tests got progressively harder, and the quizzes were all fair. I didn't do much of the reading at all, because what's on the test is mostly covered in lecture. I did, however, skim the chapters the day before the test. You do have to study before the ex am, but not much. I studied an hour before the review session, then always attended the TA-led review session, came back to my room and studied all of my notes and the review session material for 3 hours. So I'd say a total of about 5-6 hours of studying, including the review session. I studied only the day before the test, and I've done relatively well (either A or A- in this course). But you have to make sure you buckle down and work the last day. Use the TAs, because they're helpful, and take really good notes, including the clicker questions because they're usually on the test. In summary, this was a great class that I learned a lot from, and I think if you're a non-science major like me, try to apply to get into this class. Go to all of the classes, and express interest before they decide who gets to enroll. If you get in, definitely take it for your Sc credit.",
    "This is an excellent science course for non-science majors. The class is both manageable and engaging; it is in no way a gut, and by the end, I feel like I learned a lot of material. Dr. Kundel gave excellent, clear, and concise lectures throughout the semester. He helped to clarify and focus the material from the textbook and was very helpful in answering students' questions. Professor Segraves was very well-intentioned and clearly cared about teaching; however, his lectures in the last third often seemed to run off on tangents. Ultimately, it was unclear what material we actually were expected to learn for the exams. Overall, I would highly recommend Human Bio to a student who actually wants to learn something in a science class. It has 3 midterms, each of which is not cumulative, and ends before reading week. Take it!!!",
    "A really solid class that introduces new topics but isn't a burden on your work. For non-science majors, definitely a course to consider taking.",
    "This class is very easy and mind-numbingly boring. I wanted to learn biology in an interesting way because I had never taken a biology class before. Much of this class is taught as if the students are morons; no one seems to realize that we're not stupid--we're just not that interested in science. I found myself checking my watch every minute or two during most classes. You can easily get by without doing the readings, except perhaps before tests. But the tests and quizzes are mostly very easy, too. Still, if you want a gut science class, don't pick this one. No mistake, it is a gut. But a gut should be interesting, and this class is not. You'll spend a lot of time learning very specific things like how blood works and what skin is made of, but I would much rather have learned something more interesting; after all, I'm not ever going to use whatever foundation in biology I might have learned in this class. If you want a fun class, you'd probably be better off with another science credit. The professors are very likable, which makes it harder to hate the class. And the sections are very interesting. You just have to go to three throughout the semester, and each one is about a different, more advanced topic in contemporary biology. If the whole class were like the sections, it would have been fun. As it is, it was a waste of time, and I sincerely regret taking it.",
    "It's a great class - both Prof Kundel&Seagraves are funny and lecture material is cool&relevant. There are 3 midterms&3 quizzes. The 3 exams are actually rather challenging with concept based questions (rather than mere memorization of vocab\/facts) and so you need to study to do well. Definitely not a gut class but very rewarding if you put the work into it.",
    "This is an awesome class, you should definitely take it!",
    "Absolutely take this if you get in. One of my favorite classes at Yale. As a non-science major and someone who thought they hated Bio in high school, I was surprised by how engaging I found the material. The things we learned are things everyone should know about the way they human body works. Dr. Kundel and Dean Segraves are both great lecturers, kind, helpful, and very funny. The workload is not bad at all but you do learn a LOT from the lectures, and you learn it very thoroughly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The workload was not overwhelming and the material is useful and applicable to everyday life.",
    "Excellent, excellent science credit. If you can get into this class (if you're a lucky freshman\/sophomore, and they cap the class at around 50), I highly advise taking it. The professors (Kundel and Segraves) are engaging and approachable, and they take a potentially very dry subject matter and make it accessible for those with weak Biology backgrounds (I hadn't taken Biology class since freshman year of high school). The tests are reasonable, though they do expect you, regardless of what they say, to delve into the minutiae of it all (memorize and make sure you know the key terms lists they provide you for every test backward and forward!). That being said, if you're looking for a relevant, fun, easy science credit, this is the place to go; this was the best course I took this semester!",
    "Ok, basic science class with some fun stuff added in. Keep up with the work and you'll be fine.",
    "Take it if you aren't confident of you science skills\/knowledge. You learn a lot, class goes smoothly. Work is greater than expected, but very rewarding.",
    "Great course for a non-science person who is looking for something interesting, meaningful, and light. It is similar to AP Bio.",
    "If you're looking for an intro the human body and don't want to be fighting premeds in discussion, yes, take this course.",
    "A great course in Bio for non science majors. It's a lot of quizzes and tests, so you have to be on top of your game for most of the course. The teachers are really helpful and accessible.",
    "Definitely take it. A good Sc credit that is straightforward and worthwhile to learn.",
    "Human Bio is a fantastic class if you really enjoyed bio in high school but don't want to take a dry intro bio class with a bunch of science majors. It has some overlap with AP Bio at the beginning bu it fades pretty fast after the first exam. The material is fascinating and very relevant. Great class for athletes...NOT because it's relatively easy (that makes it a great class for everyone) but because a lot of the human bio is very relevant to athletic performance. Really a must-take science for non-science majors.",
    "A comprehensive exploration of how the primary biological systems work. I recommend this class because it really helps one understand how our bodies function which can hbe helpful in lots of different ways.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're a non-science major.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a science credit. It is a fantastic course that makes science digestible and accessible. The professors are just wonderful, and they know exactly what they're talking about. Please, please consider this class seriously if you're looking for a science credit and don't know exactly what you want!",
    "If you don't want to suffer through a boring and excessively difficult course to get a Sc credit, take Human Biology. You will learn a lot, and the material is actually interesting.",
    "Yes. Super interesting if you have any interest in the human body.",
    "Definitely recommended if you need a science credit.",
    "MCDB 107 is a class for non-science majors. However, as someone who went in having taken three years of high school biology, I still found that there was a fair bit of new material to learn. I found myself relying on the powerpoint lectures and often only used the textbook for review before quizzes and tests. Some parts of the class are not terribly interesting; on the other hands, there are other topics, which make up for this, that are downright fascinating. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you're at all interested in how the body works. If you're not it will be a pain. But the professors are great, and it's really well taught, even if the tests are a littlehard.",
    "This is a great course for non-science majors who want to complete one of their science requirements and learn something useful about biology. The professors are great and the class is just the right size. The workload is completely manageable (only about 1 chapter of reading a week, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, and 3 very short papers) in comparison to other Yale courses. If you can get in and you're not a science major, definitely take this course! Do not pass it up!",
    "Don't take it unless you love biology. There are easier SC credits.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Human Biology to a student searching to fulfill his\/her science credit. The class begins with the standard biology material anyone who took AP Biology would remember, and then progresses into focusing on specific topics such as hormonal regulation, nutrition\/the obesity epidemic, and gender and sexuality, to name a few. In addition to the lectures we also had to attend three discussion sections, each of which delved more into depth about the topics we learned about in class. Some students complained about the sections but I personally found them interesting. Participation in lecture was encouraged. The professors were both kind and engaging, grading was relatively generous, and the material wasn't too difficult at all. This class is definitely a steal, so if you're lucky enough to get in, take it.",
    "Yes!"
