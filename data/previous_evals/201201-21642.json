   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but his style of teaching (mostly lecture, little to no reading, open-book\/internet tests, etc) is very different from more traditional lecture classes. If you can work well with these conditions, this class is definitely the orgo class for you.",
    "Wonderful course. Any second semester Orgo course is going to be better than its first semester counterpart, but this one's especially good. Andy Phillips is a star.",
    "Definitely take this class with Professor Phillips! If you have to take orgo, make sure to get him. We had 3 midterms, 1 of which gets dropped, and 2 of which were take-home. The other one, and the final, was completely open book. He doesn't mind giving high grades if the whole class does well. There was not a lot of reading, and as long as you came to lecture, the problem sets were pretty straight forward. Also, the topic is interesting - not boring orgo! It really gets applied to biological cycles and systems in the body.",
    "Avoid this course at all costs.",
    "Good class, but not like your typical chemistry\/orgo class.",
    "Much more interesting than Orgo I. Andy Philips is a good, engaging lecturer. He moves at a fast pace though and the exams and problem sets are entirely based on lecture material, so you HAVE TO GO TO LECTURE and have to keep up while you're there. If you stay on top of it, it's a very manageable class, but if you fall behind and don't go to lecture, it becomes really difficult.",
    "It's not your typical Orgo II and is a lot more like biochem, but because of that I found it a lot more interesting. Phillips is great at making the information he teaches applicable, and you cover organic chemistry that is really important in nature (carbonyl groups) and the techniques that organic chemists use. Very interesting and not too difficult. Definitely take this class if you can if you need to fulfill any pre-med\/science major requirements!",
    "Definitely try to be in Andy Phillip's class! Take it with him even if you don't have to! Great science experience!",
    "This is a pretty good class. It's easier than normal Orgo because 2 of the midterms are take-home, but difficult because it focuses on chemistry of biology, so it's more abstract than regular orgo. I would take it.",
    "I really liked this class but I feel like other students may not like this course. I feel like not too much material is covered in this course but it is a good course. The style of teaching and learning is unique that emphasizes a more holistic understanding of chemistry rather than in depth learning of reactions, etc. However, this still makes it hard to study. If you are super concerned with protecting your premed gpa, the style of this class may be unfamiliar or daunting to you, just because it is set up differently than most other science classes.",
    "CHEM 230 was a continuation of the principles that were taught in CHEM 220. While this class is a bit more interesting than the first semester of Organic Chemistry given its biological applications, the class was poorly organized and poorly taught. I did not feel that Professor Phillips put enough time and energy into planning out this class. I don't think that we covered too much material either. While Professor Phillips is a very kind-hearted individual and is good at explaining concepts, he makes little to no effort to get to know his students.In this class, you will have one in-class exam, two take-home exams, and a final exam. I absolutely hated both take-home exams. It seemed like I learned next to nothing for both exams. I hope that Professor Phillips changes the organization of his syllabus before teaching this class again.For these reasons, I would not recommend CHEM 230 to a fellow student unless it is taught by a different professor.",
    "I didn't think it was possible, but Professor Phillips has found a way to actually make organic chemistry interesting. Take it!",
    "Would recommend- very interesting, much better taught than first semester organic chemistry.",
    "Good class, probably required to take it for some pre-med program or BME major, but it's not as bad as first semester.",
    "Finally, a highly relevant and interesting science course! Professor Phillips is incredible. I'm actually considering switching to a chemistry major from biology because of this class.",
    "SUCH A GOOD CLASS",
    "Hard material but Philipps makes the class do-able. I would definitely take it if you have to but remember that Orgo is Orgo. Take very detailed and thorough notes, study them before every test and you will be very prepared for the final.",
    "An amazing Organic chemistry course! The testing style is interesting and challenging with out being overly difficult. It is very informative and I am very glad I chose this over Freshman Orgo. Two.",
    "Organic Chemistry of Biological Pathways is very different from Orgo 1. Class with Professor Phillips was reasonably enjoyable. It was cool to learn about the biology parts. Psets are not terrible, and exams are fine. A very manageable approach to orgo on the whole.",
    "A pretty great course. I actually learned a lot, and Professor Phillips is incredibly fair in what you have to know. Two take homes, and the other exam and final are in class, but it is still open-book, notes, laptop, etc. And, you can drop 1 exam.",
    "Completely different from Orgo 1. More biochemically focused, stress learning abstract concepts over rote memorization, doesn't really follow a textbook, not too much actual work for the class (7 psets, 3 tests - open note is a lifesaver) but since it's organic chemistry it is definitely a challenge. Only take it if you have to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I know that people tend to think of organic chemistry as a class that pre-meds and chemistry majors only take because they have to, but I actually found this course to be very interesting and rewarding. I'm neither a pre-med nor a chemistry major, and I am very glad I took this class. The work load is totally reasonable, and you will learn a great deal!",
    "Compared to 1st semester, this class is a cakewalk and VERY interesting. The exams are jokingly easy, and the psets take 10 minutes. If you took orgo 1, might as well take this class! It even seems like it will help with biochem next year.",
    "It's organic chemistry 2, so I wouldn't imagine that one would be taking this course unless it was required for a major or pre-med requirement. It's a great class, even if you don't need it for requirements.",
    "If you're taking this class it's probably cuz you're pre-med. Well it's much better than orgo 1 and the midterms are take home (at least 2 of the 3 are) all are open book too.",
    "It's much less painful than first semester, but I don't know how much I actually retained from it. All exams are open book (and open internet), but as a result you just rely on those resources and I didn't feel like I could apply what I had learned. Really low time commitment in terms of workload and reading, but at the same time I feel like I learned more first semester. That being said, Professor Phillips is an amazing teacher - he's a really chill guy who is great at explaining things and really enjoys helping students. I wish I had gotten to know him better. It's really easy to let this class slip through the cracks, so try to stay diligent so you make sure you're actually learning. And try to learn how to apply what you learn in lecture to new problems and situations.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Extremely interesting material, very reasonable workload, and great professor.",
    "Take it. Don't think twice if phillips is teaching.",
    "Take this over an actual orgo2 - much less work",
    "Chem230 is incredibly different from first semester orgo. Instead of memorizing reactions you are asked to understand these reactions in biological pathways. I don't know if it's better or worse, it's just different. If you are interested in biology this will be more interesting to you since it explains how things like glycolysis actually work. Andy Phillips is a really fun teacher, he is nice and easy to understand. The work really isn't that bad. The tests are all open book and 2\/3 were take home. The final is worth 50% of your grade though, so it's almost impossible to know how you are doing in the class.",
    "This class is not normal second semester orgo, and you'll be very happy that it isn't. There were 7 pset and with the peer tutors and the TAs, you could always get help on them if you wanted. The structure of this class has changed a bit from semester to semester, but we had 1 open-note in-class test, two open-note take-home tests and then an open-note final. When I say \"open-note,\" I mean open note, book and internet (even for the final!). There was some reading, but mostly for looking at mechanisms and without a lot of dense text. Make sure to push Andy Phillips to be clear about what he's teaching and why - he is very good at explaining the things he covers in class, but not as good at describing what the context is of what he's covering and why it's important. But this is basically orgo-lite! It has fewer problem sets, take-homes that don't take more than 3 hours, medicine-related examples and very helpful peer tutors and TAs. Prof. Phillips also basically announced that the average would be an A-. Good luck!",
    "It's not nearly as stressful as other science courses because two of the midterms are take-home and open-book, so you have a lot of time to make sure that your answers are accurate and that you haven't made a stupid mistake - however, the material is still really difficult, and doing well on exams still requires that you understand what you're doing.",
    "Andy Phillips is awesome. Lectures were very enjoyable. Exams were kind of difficult, even though they were open notes, open book\/internet. Defintely keep up with everything, and review as you go along so you have the big picture in mind, how all the reactions you learn in class are related and applied. Very enjoyable class overall. Problem sets are short, and there were only 7 of them this semester. Not a lot of work on a week by week basis, but you do need to prepare for the exams.",
    "Great course (especially compared to my first horrible experience of first semester organic chem with Ziegler); the material is taught in a way that you can understand and it directly pertains to the problem sets (manageable, by the way), exams (usually open note or take home), and textbook. If you put in the time to go over the notes and read the assigned readings, you'll get a lot out of the course. It's focused on understanding, not memorizing, which makes it more fun and manageable than first semester. Prof. Phillips also keeps it interesting by relating it to everyday medicine and other topics.",
    "Wonderful chemistry\/biology course, highly recommended with Philips, much better than first semester organic chemistry, greater focus on biology than in first semester",
    "Pretty chill class - but a little easy to get behind in because most exams are open book.",
    "It's much much better than CHEM 220, it's much less stressful, much more fun, and you can actually learn a lot if you put the time and effort.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another, especially with Prof. Phillips. He's a great lecturer and the material is really interesting. The problem sets are reasonable, as are the exams, and the curve is very generous. This is a really good class (much better than first semester) and definitely worth taking if you're into science.",
    "I would recommend this course. The lectures and material are interesting and the material is explained very well.",
    "Good secod semester. Much better grade wise",
    "It's basically a deeper look at the chemistry behind some concepts in biology (citric acid cycle, peptide synthesis, etc.). I found the material easier to grasp than that of Orgo I.",
    "i would definitely recommend the course- prof phillips is a dynamic lecturer and emphasizes learning as opposed to memorization. the class applies orgo to the body which makes all of the random reactions from orgo I actually applicable",
    "Chem 230 is the greatest way to learn second semester orgo that is out there. it is relevant and interesting. You should absolutely take it.",
    "Great class that is interesting and well taught. Make sure to go to office hours early on in the year to ensure you really develop an intuition for the mechanisms.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who are interested in organic chemistry and biology. However, students are required to take the first semester class with Ziegler beforehand. Ziegler was a horrible and confusing professor and really didn't care about his students at all. I'm not sure if the positive aspects of Phillips's course outweighs the negative aspects of Ziegler's course, but if you had to take Ziegler's anyway, then this course is a welcomed reprieve.",
    "A good course. Less stressful and much easier than the first semester. Phillips is a great professor.",
    "Not the nightmare you thought 2nd semester orgo was going to be, but you may leave the class feeling that you didn't learn that much. But since you're probably taking this as a requirement, it will be much easier than you thought.",
    "Odds are you have to take it, but it's not nearly as bad as first semester was. It will never be one of my favorite classes, but the psets did give you a good chance to go over holistic organic chemistry.",
    "Good class, but keep in mind all the exams are either open-note in class, or take home. I don't know if I learned that much, but it was interesting. If you're a freshman, you'll probably learn more in freshman orgo.",
    "The class is amazing, the information interesting, and the applications very cool. Take it!",
    "Great second semester Orgo course for premeds or those interested in how organic chemistry relates to other fields of science like biology and medicinal chemistry. Workload is much more reasonable than Ziegler's class and the tests are not easy but they are take-home, so it requires a bit of a different approach--I guess it depends on which type of test you prefer. It's hard to keep track of the big picture sometimes because you can get lost in all the individual reaction steps of a process. I didn't appreciate the beauty of how all the different types of reactions relate to each other until I started reviewing for the final, and wish I had done so earlier.",
    "Great course. You learn a lot, low stress environment. Manageable workload.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you're taking it with andrew phillps. If not... the class might be A LOT harder and way less enjoyable.",
    "In retrospect, I learned very little new organic chemistry material and learned the basics of biochemistry this semester. Though the course was very low stress, it was also at times difficult to convince myself that what I was learning truly belonged to an organic chemistry class. Comparisons to the freshman orgo second semester class truly proved how few orgo concepts we were learning. The most frustrating part of the class was that attending lectures seemed like it was just for fun - some peers never went to lecture and still went into the final armed with the confidence that the internet would tell them any answers that were in the notes. The majority of midterms and the final were open note, open laptop...open world. Though the answers are definitely available, they are more difficult to find as the questions are more complex.",
    "Since you're more than likely taking this class because you HAVE to, never fear: this class will change your mindset and make orgo a class you actually WANT to take. Andy Phillips is a great professor, a well-organized lecturer, and great at explaining concepts in office hours, which you should utilize. His two take-home exams were extremely fair, and the fact that you can drop the worst of your three exams anda couple bad problem sets definitely makes this class less stressful (not the mention the problem sets typically only took an hour to complete, on average). I would most definitely recommend this class, because you get to apply logic to solving interesting mechanisms rather than simply memorizing your typical orgo coursework that you probably don't really care about.",
    "Take it. Take it even if you are a freshman. Definitely the best orgo class you can take in Yale.",
    "Great class! I absolutely despised orgo 1 but loved this class, which is all about the organic chemistry of important reactions that actually happen in our body, as opposed to memorizing random synthetic reactions like in orgo 1. Prof Phillips' lectures are interesting and clear (go to class, you won't understand anything if you don't).",
    "One of the best lecture courses I\u0092ve taken at Yale. Professor Phillips makes organic chemistry relevant to biology, and because of that, the course has a really cohesive theme; Professor Phillips crafted a story over the course of the semester. Semi-weekly problem sets that took me about 4 hours over the weekend. 1 in class exam (low average, and it was difficult), 2 take home exams (both with very high averages and were easy). I found the material incredibly, incredibly interesting, and made all the worthless things I learned in first semester orgo worth it (I\u0092ve wanted to know about glycolysis since AP Bio, and learning about the synthesis pathway of steroids was so interesting). Get Tina, she\u0092s a great TA; she basically anticipated lectures and went over mechanisms in section. I would recommend take it alongside Cell Bio because many topics overlap (especially histone modification, which is Professor Phillip\u0092s fetish). A huge reason I liked this class was the McMurry and Begley textbook\u0085no silly textbox gimmicks, just straightforward and well-explained mechanisms. Overall, a great class with very interesting material that is well taught by Professor Phillips; the exams are very fair and the problem sets are interesting, and I honestly looked forward to every lecture. Please, please, please don\u0092t jeopardize canceling this class for future years by collaborating during the take home midterms; the take home midterms were a big reason the tone of this class was so much more relaxed than orgo 1; it\u0092s not fair to future classes. But definitely take this class, and try to take it with the incredible specimen of a person that is Professor Phillips.",
    "With Andrew Phillips- YES.",
    "Chemistry 230 is a great course. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to students with no reservations at all. You get the opportunity to learn a lot of things about biochemistry that could assist you as a knowledge base later on in any health professions career or relevant graduate studies. I would definitely take it with Prof. Phillips.",
    "This was an interesting class. Lecture is pretty vital to doing well on the exams without searching for hours. The exams were all open book\/note\/computer, but be wary of that if you want to feel like you've LEARNED by the end of the semester. Study for the exams and consolidate your knowledge, even if it's by rewriting notes. This might be one of the lowest stress pre-med\/pre-science requirements you ever have, but remember: you are here to learn the material, so focus on learning it. Professor Phillips is great.",
    "Chem 230 is an excellent course that provides a good chemical context for any student interested in the biological sciences in any way. The course formalizes your knowledge of organic chemistry and gives an introduction to the biochemistry of small molecules. If you are more chemistry oriented, however, you may find the course lacking in rigor or depth. I would recommend this course to all pre-medical students but I feel as though chemistry majors wouldn't like this course all that much. That having been said it's not that difficult.If you are looking for a relatively easy course that you most likely have to take for your science major or pre-medical program, then definitely take Chem 230, you might get a little bored in the middle, but professor Phillips is great so make an effort to get out of bed for lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 230 to my fellow students. Prof. Phillips is an outstanding professor, and his lectures are very clear and well-presented. The pace of the course is very reasonable, and this allows students to learn and master the concepts rather than rush through them. Another unique feature of the course is the fact that all exams are open books and internet, which reduces the performance-associated stress and, once again, encourages students to learn rather than memorize.",
    "It's a good class. The biological focus can get a little tedious at times, but you learn interesting applications of the material, and the problem sets are reasonable. The tests were all open note or take home, so that made studying significantly easier and less tedious (no need to memorize mechanisms!) Overall, I would definitely recommend this course for people needing a second semester of organic chemistry.",
    "The course is nicely tought - I definitely recommend taking good lecture noted as they will make everything clearer. It's nice to see how things come together from different perspectives (which you will get if you take a biology course like cell bio at the same time)",
    "It's a good class. Philips is bad at assigning the readings as he goes. Make sure to find whatever you are talking about in lecture and read the pertinent section of the book.",
    "AWESOME CLASS!! I learned so much; more than I ever expected. Being open note made sure I understood concepts instead of memorizing things. Also, this class taught me that chemistry is SO RELEVANT to me as a bio major!",
    "It was ok but not entirely sure it was effective since all tests were open book open internet open notes. Kind of made me not study.",
    "WARNING: I see what the professor was trying to do by allowing us to have our computers, books, and notes during exams. However, rather than making the class NOT about memorization, it made the class instead all about who could look up something faster. The answer to almost every question was SOMEWHERE online if you looked hard enough for it and knew where to look. Therefore, the class became much less about understanding the material and much more about ability to navigate databases. If this is going to be the case, it should be in the class's name. If I do poorly in this course, which I don't expect but could potentially happen, I would rather it be understood that I was not a talented database-navigator, not that I could not understand organic chemistry concepts. This system should be overhauled and the use of computers and books should not be allowed on exams. It's too much. Some of the questions on the final were VERBATIM in the textbook for the course, so that the problem essentially became one of just copying accurately. This happened on several of the exams and problem sets as well. The final was essentially a race to see who could look things up fastest.",
    "I definitely would! Although everyone complain about organic chemistry, Professor Phillips really tries to be engaging and a good teacher.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It was a good learning experience and encourages critical thinking. Phillips is a good teacher.",
    "Most students have to take this course, but as far as premed requirements go, this has been my favorite course yet. The medical applications he provides are very interesting and I really felt that I left the class with a knowledge base I will actually use later in life.",
    "Take it! If you're taking orgo II it's because you're a very sad premed student such as myself or the rare chem major. Have faith! This class is great and you shouldn't stop your path to medicine or chemistry because of a rough orgo I.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you are looking toward the medical or pharmaceutical field. The class is filled with examples and great lectures!",
    "I found this to be a fun chemistry course and nice compared to first semester. You can get by doing very little work in this class; however, I really don't recommend that. Classically, it will catch up to you. If, instead, you take up the burden of learning the material well, you can get a lot out of this class.",
    "This class studies classic OrgoII reaction mechanisms in the context of human biological processes.",
    "CHEM230 is not like your typical organic chemistry class. It is taught with application in mind, and is very related to biochemistry. The distinction between biological chemistry and biochemistry is a little ambiguous, but I believe we learned the chemistry behind biochemical pathways. The course may feel, however, a little too relaxed, possibly because everyone likes to compare it to Organic Chemistry I.",
    "Web Browsing for Chemists.",
    "Andy Phillips makes a boring subject bearable.",
    "No, only if you need it.",
    "This class was so disjointed from 1st semester orgo and to some this was great but it was terrible for me. Ziegler's class solidified my decision to become a chemistry major and this class almost reversed that decision. It reminded me too much of biochem in which there were a lot of big words that i felt just confused me and didn't help solidify the mechanisms like 1st semester hw did (no matter how annoying it was). I felt like i really learned something in the 1st semester and can't say i did this semester. take home tests made me feel basically hopeless bc I knew everyone else would end up doing so well and I wouldnt (as was the case) and drive the average up. I would rather hve just taken them in class. The final was basically wikipedia race that i would hve failed without my laptop and while i honestly probably missed more than half of the class lectures i feel as if i did as well on the final as anyone that attended every class. I believe tht I also lacked motivation to truly learn the material knowing that the exams were take-home. The majority of ppl find this course to be way easier than 1st semester but for my learning style it was more difficult and my grade will reflect it.",
    "Definitely take this class if you need a year of orgo, after Orgo I it is a good breath of fresh air and it is a new perspective on the way to apply the material learnt during the first semester.",
    "This may be the best organic chemistry course out there. As notorious as the subject is, this course makes organic chemistry manageable and even interesting. Professor Phillips is wonderful - so kind and very fair, completely understanding of how difficult it can be and fundamentally against mindless memorization. Tests are all open note, 2 of the 3 midterms were take home, opennote final, manageable psets. This is not to say that it is easy - organic chemistry is sometimes impossible no matter how well taught - but it makes it so much more enjoyable. Highly recommend it.",
    "It is an easier orgo class than freshman orgo, I think.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's kind of like organic chemistry, and kind of like biochemistry, but more awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a break from the very stringent style of semester 1 and really gets into the interesting aspects of organic chemistry. We may have been able to learn a bit more had we gone faster, but at the same time, I really understand the topics we went over well.",
    "I thought that Professor Phillips' lectures were great. However, I did not like that all the tests were take-home.",
    "This class is about a million times better than any other orgo class.",
    "Very heavy on the biochemistry aspect. Lost of information, but it's interesting, as it incorporates parts of the first semester of organic chemistry into biological subjects. Also, the professor is great.",
    "Chemistry 230 with Professor Philips is an amazing presentation of organic chemistry in a biological context. Philips's chalkboard notes do a great job explaining all of the core concepts and mirror the textbook content well. His exams, problem sets, and lecture notes complement each other very well and there was great transparency between students and the course expectations.",
    "Yes, this course is fabulous. Low stress and straightforward. Professor Phillips genuinely wants you to learn and is not confusing you. Also, he really wants you to do well. Whenever,I would ask him if a question instead of being condescending he would say thanks for asking that, I should re-emphasize that point with the class. It was so refreshing having a teacher so committed to teaching.",
    "This is a very chill class. Nonstressful. No memorizing, just understanding the organic chemistry in a biological perspective.",
    "This was an interesting course; however, I didn't learn a whole lot. Phillips is a fun professor, but he tends to progress rather slowly. If you're really interested in learning the chemical basis of life, this course will give you the tools you need, as long as you do a bit of additional work and reading.",
    "CHEM 230 was a very interesting course. Looking at organic chemistry through a biological lens was such a refreshing change from the stressful first semester of organic chemistry. Instead of struggling to get your organic chemistry bearings and drowning in meaningless mechanisms out of context, this course makes you feel like you are learning about something tangible. I loved all of the medical applications that were included, and I liked that every topic of organic chemistry we studied was not abstract, but directly tied to a biological process. At times, CHEM 230 felt more like a biology class, which I really liked. I was disappointed that there were not 10 problem sets as the syllabus promised, as the first few problem sets were an adjustment period to the course. Concerning the open resource policy for the exams, I think this is a mixed bag. While I was considerably less stressed about nitty gritty details, I do not believe I learned even the basic material as well as I should have. Lots of times the exams were an exercise of how well I could search the internet. This was amplified with the take home exams. Professor Phillps is great. He is personable and down to earth. He is an expert at concisely and clearly explaining tough concepts, and one can tell he truly enjoys teaching. I highly recommend this course for 2nd semester orgo. Take it with Phillips."
