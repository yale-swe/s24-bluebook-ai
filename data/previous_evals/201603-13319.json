Her discussion sections (both office hours and structured sections) were always teeming with students. She was the only TA to create clear, concise study guides and upload them to Canvas. These materials were often critical to grasping the content since lectures were convoluted, unorganized, and unclear. WenJun's section notes were often the ONLY written guide to the models discussed in the second half of the course, given the lack of text book.",

My general concern with the TA hours\/section was that rather than guide us through a general review of material learned or questions we had, we were usually just guided through the solutions to the problem set. There is value in that, however, sometimes a query was a more general one, and not particular to the problem set, but you really had to push to get Jeremy to discuss\/review a topic in general.",

    "Instructor: Wenjun Wang \u00a0Wenjun is the reason I learned as much as I did in this class. I was able to attend her office hours and lecture section each week to really enforce what Kotchen had taught in class. I would not have been able to get through the problem sets without her.

   "comments": [
    "13. Professor Kotchen was patronizing and arrogant. I didn't feel comfortable asking him questions, based on rude responses he made to other students.",
    "Occasionally the professor would get turned around in his diagrams and it would confuse the class. Other than that, this class was extremely valuable. Kotchen is extremely approachable and although he would go too fast at times he was willing to break it down if you asked him to. Some of the readings towards the end of the semester went over my head.",
    "Most of the semester was just pure economics and I understand that we need the basics, but I think not enough time was spent on environmental issues.",
    "In general very good examples. And indeed very good at catching potential misunderstandings with inventing illustrative examples on the spot.",
    "Professor Kotchen was not very approachable. I emailed him once over a lost homework assignment and he never directly responded to me or followed up with me about it.",
    "While I enjoyed the material, I was rather annoyed at how many times Professor Kotchen would come to class not having reviewed his slides. He frequently drew graphs incorrectly on the board--I would say he made mistakes during a majority of classes. This was fine for those who understood already and could notice and correct the mistake, but it was utterly confusing for those who do not have a strong background in economics. I think this class would have been MUCH better as a flipped course.",
    "I am so glad that I took this course ( even though some weeks with hard PS's and during the midterm and final study periods I was regretting it..!). Understanding economic concepts and environmental resource economics helped me in EVERY SINGLE other course this semester. Especially my Industrial Ecology Debate and my Climate Policy course. You really can't graduate from FES without taking this course or knowing these concepts.",
    "Regarding question 13- Matthew was great at explaining the concepts throughout the course. However, I think my biggest struggle was how he would sometimes explain something incorrectly during class (drawing a graph incorrectly, or labeling parts of it incorrectly). I do most of my learning in class and with initial exposure to the material, so to learn and re-learn something during class was hard to do. I totally understand how confusing the subject matter is, so this is not a complaint. Matthew was a good lecturer. But I think learning something incorrectly and then having to go back through my notes to fix things afterwards hindered my understanding during lectures.",
    "Kotchen tripped up on his lesson at least once per class. To students trying to learn introductory material that is brand new, this was frustrating. I went to a small, liberal arts undergrad and was just not used to professors who didn't prioritize their teaching. He clearly has a lot of other important responsibilities. However, he is a very funny and nice guy. Nothing personal!! Also he brought his son into the final exam and he was so adorable.",
    "The class was well-structured as it went through the basics of econ theory and then how to apply that to environmental issues. It would have been interesting, though maybe a bit difficult to have some more structured discussions in class about current events.",
    "My one suggestion is to include graphs and models in the Powerpoint slides, especially once the lectures and Mankiw text diverge. Accessing the slides on Canvas was very helpful in studying, thank you for doing those. However, they could have been even more helpful with models. Some days - especially when Kotchen had to erase his work several times and start over - my notes were hard to read, and verified guides would have been helpful. Mankiw provides this for the early lessons, but after that it's SOL. Also, it would be helpful - especially for those of us who are not economists - if the exams tested our ability to interpret graphs as much as they do our ability to create them. This would also be a better reflection of how many of us will use these skills. Thank you!",
    "I wish we spent a little bit less time on the microeconomics (noted that it is very important) and a little more time on environmental economics.",
    "Q.15) The course is helpful for any student who wants to pursue an introductory environmental economics course.",
    "The course, while interesting, was far too simple for a graduate level course. I understand that not everyone has background knowledge of economics but it was simple to the point of unchallenging at times. It is a survey course, so there was a lot to cover in a short amount of time. However, if the instructor demanded greater comfortability with math, we could have really delved into more challenging aspects of the models than just the simplistic ways in which they were covered in this course. The problem sets were a good way to stay on top of the material and a great way to work through the topics learned in class. The professor is really good; he teaches and explains well. He always took the time to answer questions and review any aspects the students were struggling well. The strength of this class is entirely the strength of Professor Kotchen. He was engaged and fun to work with.",
    "Great course. I would have appreciated more acknowledgement of uncertainty (barring our brief mention of it for MDF\/MAC curves there was none). The truth is, our world isn't linear and modeling at such is an enjoyable intellectual experience but fails to capture the dynamism, despite its ability to establish a framework for the uninitiated. Numbers without pluses and minuses associated with them are meaningless to a study motivated by the scientific method. Acknowledging \"Fat tails\" and \"black swans\" would go far to enhancing this classes ability to explain the world and perhaps curtail some of the backrow economics haters' comments. An additional small suggestion: when releasing the keys, please preface the answer discussion with a repetition of the question. It doesn't take much effort but it sure is a pain to switch back and forth between pdfs on canvas. thank you, almost signed my name here.",
    "Does not know the material he teaches. Avoids questions.",
    "Overall professor Kotchen was enjoyable in the classroom. He was familiar with the material and was able to effectively answer almost all student questions. At some points we covered lots of material in a short time and I feel we could have benefited from a slower pace. His humor kept discussions light and I think he connects well with the students. He is very attentive so students in the classroom, which shows his caring nature and want for all to succeed.",
    "This course was useful but sometimes too fast-paced for students without having any background in Economics. The microeconomics section was taught well and the concepts were covered thoroughly; however the switch towards environmental economics was daunting. Too many topics were covered within a short period of time making it difficult to grasp important concepts. Also, the midterm exam was too constrained on time and the ban of calculators during some lengthy calculations added to the difficulty.",
    "Professor Kotchen is one of the best teachers I have ever had. I was nervous about taking the class since I had never taken an economics course before. However, the course is incredibly-well organized with reading materials and problem sets that are perfectly complimentary to the class discussion. The Teaching Assistants were available multiple times throughout the week to assist in clarifying the concepts and Professor Kotchen always posted his discussion slides prior to the lecture, allowing us time to prepare for the next class. While I greatly enjoyed the live lectures, I learned best from the recorded lectures that Professor Kotchen prepared one day in which he was absent from class. I found that Professor Kotchen spoke entirely too fast in class for me to understand, but the recordings allowed me to pause and rewind to ensure my understanding of the material. My suggestion would be to record the live lectures and allow students to go back and watch them or to please slow down in your explanation of the material!",
    "The course lectures were very useful and typically clear. Occasionally the Professor Kotchen ran through the slides a little fast though.",
    "Lectures were extremely unclear. Indeed, if a student's schedule did not allow time to attend Wen Jun's discussion sections, I'm not sure how this course would be navigable.",
    "The course is an excellent introduction into economics for students in the environmental field. I particularly enjoyed the policy sections in the second half of the course. And Professor Kotchen is excellent!"

   "comments": [
    "Wenjun's discussion section",
    "The lectures - they were well paced and interesting",
    "I loved how the professor challenged the class. He would often explain what could be perceived as controversial statements and provide economic proof for making such claims. It was a refreshing dose of reality that many classes can lack in the environmental field. He was also very open to class discussions which were very interesting to follow.",
    "I found the problem sets helpful",
    "A lot of the concepts presented were presented in a fairly simple way, but still fairly powerful tools conceptually.",
    "Professor Kotchen did a good job of providing interesting examples to go along with the theories.",
    "Studying measuring Willingness to Pay",
    "The best aspect of the course is that it provides pragmatic perspectives to environmental management strategies that are not talked by other courses in an economic context.",
    "Lectures were lively and interesting. All basic economic concepts were explained using environmental examples, which was very helpful for keeping the material relevant to our studies. Overall a great intro to environmental economics.",
    "Really enjoyed the early morning lectures -- kotchen is super entertaining (he resembles a young jerry seinfield) and you can just sit back, listen, take some notes, and enjoy his jokes...knowing that WenJun would explain it all again during her sections.",
    "I really enjoyed the topics covered in the second half of the course (forests, fisheries, etc.). It felt very relevant and I appreciate that knowledge.",
    "Gaining a strong understanding of environmental economics.",
    "I liked the weekly homework, the concepts were easy to understand, the workload was perfect. Kotchen was very good at allotting time in class for questions\/discussion.",
    "The lectures are interesting and Kotchen is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "While the problem sets felt like a drag sometimes, they really pushed me to figure out things on my own and learn the content.",
    "Second half of the semester was the best and most applicable",
    "The second half of the class was the most applicable to resource management and was the most interesting.",
    "The class is quite interactive and the professor is very helpful and approachable.",
    "The lectures for this class are very well taught, and the problem sets are great practice.",
    "Professor Kotchen is by far the highlight of this course. He clearly enjoyed the material and cared about the student discussions that resulted.",
    "Matthew Kochen gives great examples and always made sure to make the class interesting!",
    "Exposure to important concepts and applications of microeconomics. Understanding of the 'economics' rationale or perspective towards environmental issues. Explains some of the real world conflicts I encounter.",
    "The application of economic concepts in the environmental issues such as Forestry,Non-renewable resources,Pollution and Climate Change among other",
    "Kotchen was a great professor despite the early class time. We discussed a range of information and being able to work in groups was extremely helpful both to understand the material and to work on team dynamics. I particularly liked the later section where we learned more about application.",
    "Useful economic concepts were explained in a very clear and engaging way",
    "meeting with other students to work through problem sets.",
    "Assignments incentivize team work. There was always a group of people working on economic problems.",
    "As someone who has never taken an econ course I felt the material was very appropriate for an intro\/grad level environmental economics course. The power points all the way through were helpful but I also enjoyed how well the professor thought on his feet and was able to convey information on the blackboards.",
    "Discussion sections by TAs.",
    "The way it was organized with readings, problem sets, lectures and TA discussion sections. Students have every tool they need in order to succeed.",
    "The course was my first introduction to economics, and proved to be a very useful tool for my other courses and interesting in its own right.",
    "Kotchen was a very engaging professor, and I enjoyed this class the most. I felt like I was having a lot of fun each class learning about various concepts, which were always tied to real-life examples. I also really liked the problem sets. I liked working through them with my peers and reflecting on our lectures. They were sometimes painful to finish but altogether valuable for reinforcing what we were learning.",
    "The lectures were always engaging and Professor Kotchen was so great at integrating student questions, real life examples and an interesting discussion into all lectures.",
    "I really enjoyed Prof. Kotchen's teaching."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Kotchen's attitude",
    "The critical thinking - there was very little.",
    "Many times the professor would get stuck or lost while making a point. This could be frustrating while taking notes in pen and while trying to comprehend complex points he is making. Sometimes I found myself asking \"so what did he finally settle on as the right way to do it?\" I also thought the microeconomics part moved a little too slowly at the beginning (I did take micro and macro econ in highschool so maybe that is why) while the pace at the end was a little too quick. Evening them out a bit could help. For the midterm and final, the ban on calculators didn't make any sense. We are tested on concepts, it'd be impossible to cheat and insert information into a calculator. That and unnecessarily quick pace for tests made it seem more like a high school class than conditions in which we would have to use economic concepts in the real world.",
    "I think Kotchen could be clearer with his explanations- sometimes it was hard to follow. Also if you missed class there was really no material that matched what we did in class.",
    "The section on non-renewable resources was odd. Not thorough enough to be really helpful in actual analysis, and yet quite tricky. Would consider removing, changing or something like that.",
    "The mistakes Professor Kotchen would make when drawing the graphs was a serious problem because it led to a lot of confusion. I would have preferred to take a flipped version of the course because it would have meant there could be no mistakes in the lectures.",
    "Nothing that I can think of.",
    "TA's didn't communicate. Some would mark answers incorrect after another had said they were correct. TA Zach let people use calculators on the exam, while Kotchen had told us we could not.",
    "It would have been interesting, though maybe a bit difficult to have some more structured discussions in class about current events. This would give students the opportunity to have more of their questions answered in class, instead of being brushed off as \"off topic\" or \"use your intuition\"",
    "Wish we had the videos to watch for every class. That was very helpful being able to pause, and think, and replay. Wish Kotchen prepped some problems to go over for the final review session instead of making us come up with questions.",
    "While the lectures are helpful at understanding broader concepts, they are not useful for answering the problem set\/test questions. The book is awful and not helpful at all after week 3. The book selection could really be improved.",
    "They last few weeks of the class moved really fast for me, and at points I felt like I'd lost the overall point of what we were doing in order to focus on the details. Each time we begin looking at a new model I think it would have been helpful to spend more time discussing the overall point of the model and why it's useful. In a few cases I didn't really figure that out until the problem set or exam studying.",
    "Sometimes material was presented incorrectly and this was very confusing. Notes should be consulted more frequently.",
    "The graphs that are discussed in class should be included in slides so that students can refer to them later.",
    "Throughout the semester, many of my classmates expressed interest in discussing economics while considering socioeconomic disparity and environmental justice issues. Each time these questions arose in our course meetings, Professor Kotchen failed to answer them. I do not believe there was a genuine attempt to make this course realistic to the environmental challenges we will face as professionals in this field. I do not foresee myself taking any further economics courses and believe this course could do a better job of incorporating discussion of challenges impacting the theoretical frameworks in the future.",
    "The difficulty of the course needs improvement. Also providing additional material on the graphs. Professor Kotchen would explain the graphs on the board (the slides didn't contain graphs) but it would have been useful to have some material to review in conjunction with the notes I took (just to clarify parts).",
    "I think the class went a bit faster than necessary, it was hard to keep up sometimes.",
    "I generally like Prof Kotchen's teaching style. In class he is charismatic, clear, responsive and he expects the best from the students. But sometimes his (unmet?) expectations makes his comments come across as patronising.",
    "Seems like there is a lot to cover within a short period of time.There could be ways to split it to ensure a better grasp of the concepts than just rushing though.",
    "I'd like to see even more application and a greater range, if possible. I thought this was very helpful.",
    "The office hours and discussion sections should be in bigger rooms! It was stressful and crowded to be in the tiny kroon basement rooms for Wenjun's office hours.",
    "The course was based mostly on graphical illustrations. Perhaps it would be useful to dive more into the numerics and equations too.",
    "I think it would be good if students are asked to take Microeconomics basics before they join the program (or maybe a week before\/after MODs). This course could then be dedicated to just environmental economics, instead of spending half the course learning the basics in an accelerated manner (which might not work well towards greater understanding of the material).",
    "I thought the wording of some questions on p-sets and tests was a bit confusing and could be clearer. The pace near the end of the class was also fast. It would also be helpful to get p-sets in word doc form.",
    "Lesser topics can be covered in greater detail.",
    "I thought that Professor Kotchen spoke too fast for me to keep up with the lectures. I would encourage him to slow down and repeat and\/or emphasize certain important points to make sure students don't miss those.",
    "I felt a lot of this course moved very slowly."
