    "The in class work was the most helpful for me. I wish we had spoken more or done some in person oral production.",
    "The course is very rigorous, and if you start to fall behind, it gets harder and harder to catch up. I wish more attention was put on teaching the verb forms and how to use them rather than vocabulary. Some of the vocab learned seemed a little not applicable to every day life. However, because the class was rather hard and forced you to practice every day, you feel as if you are actually learning a lot and can see the results."

    "Any student who wishes to learn french should take this course.",
    "This course is a lot of work, so be prepared. However, it is extremely rewarding and you actually feel as if you are learning french pretty quickly. The class meets every day, there's a quiz (written and oral production) every week, there's a written composition every week, and there's textbook exercises checked every week, which is a lot to keep up with. It is doable if you stay on top of things, but if you start to fall behind on the work...yikes. It is actually a really good class though."
