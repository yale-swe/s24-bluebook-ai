   "comments": [
    "PHIL 270 provides a strong introduction to an extremely important area of philosophy. Though it felt disorganized at times, the material was always fascinating, and Keith DeRose is an engaging professor with a great sense of humor. Be aware that, as far as the humanities go, this course is rigorous, and a lot is expected from you in terms of both time and thought. If you're willing to put in the effort, however, it's a rewarding class that, unlike most experiences you'll have at Yale (or anywhere else, for that matter), really does change the way you think.",
    "This was a very good introduction to a foundational field in philosophy. The texts were very difficult, but worth the time. Professor DeRose is a good lecture, but almost impossible to get in touch with by email. However, as long as you plan around this you can usually catch him after class or during office hours. The weekly writing assignments are pretty tough since you have little time to do the reading and write the paper, but they are good incentive to not fall behind on reading. The tests and paper were reasonable. As long as you don't mind putting in a bit of work, this class is definitely worth it.",
    "The professor was a bit too snarky sometimes and it made it difficult to pay attention",
    "This course covers different Theories of Knowledge and different philosophers who have studied knowledge and skepticism. The readings are a very moderate length, interesting, and thought-provoking. Professor DeRose gives great lectures, although sometimes he meanders around topics. This semester there weren't dates listed on the syllabus, so we ended up having to rush through the last readings at the end of the semester since we took too long in the middle, but hopefully next year it will be organized differently. Evan was a great TF, and this course was very interesting and engaging, especially as the semester went on and we got more comfortable with the material and the discussion.",
    "If you know you're interested in philosophy, then definitely.",
    "Make sure you really like Professor DeRose's teaching style and are very interested in the topics covered during the first few classes, or else it'll be a drag. In terms of work: six reading responses, one term paper, one midterm, and one final, plus short readings every week, so it's definitely more than most philosophy classes, but not outrageous. I didn't enjoy Professor DeRose's style, and wasn't all that into the subject (I came in thinking that we can't know anything, left thinking we can't know anything, and didn't think I learned anything of much import, but that's just me).",
    "Phil 270 provides an excellent overview of epistemology, and at the conclusion I feel like I have a very solid grasp of the major theories and concepts in the field. Professor DeRose is an excellent and engaging lecturer (also one of the leaders in the field), and Evan Rodriguez was a wonderful TA very willing to meet and talk with students. In terms of workload, the focus was on relatively short but typically dense, readings, and I thought this was an excellent system, especially coming from DS where there was often a focus on quantity. These short readings meant that it was possible to engage more fully with the readings, and gain a deep understanding of the material, in addition to the weekly lectures and section. Besides the reading, the workload is also relatively minimal, with short weekly assignments, a midterm, final, and final paper. Both the exams, even if strictly graded, are very manageable. In sum, I would absolutely recommend this course, both to philosophy majors (for whom it's quite possibly essential), and even to others who simply have an interest in what is\/can be known",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to another student. The class is essential for philosophy majors and would be useful for other disciples as well in regard to the critical analysis of the term\/usage of knowledge.",
    "This is a basic course in epistemology. I really recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing philosophy any further, as the questions you think about here will recur in any field of philosophy. It is a huge opportunity to be able to take it with professor DeRose.",
    "Great lectures, interesting material, tests aren't bad. Professor DeRose is a great lecturer, and is an expert in epistemology, but is a bit disorganized. He is an absolutely phenomenal character though.",
    "Great class if you enjoy philosophy."
