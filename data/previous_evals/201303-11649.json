    "I highly recommend this class to folks interested in literature, postcolonial theory, and any\/all critical disciplines (ER&M, WGSS, AfAm, etc.). Prof. Pravinchandra is wonderful, the readings are compelling, class discussions are provocative and important, and the workload is manageable.",
    "If you are interested in reading great literature, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You'll read lots of second-rate paperbacks and ignore major figures like Rushdie, Coetzee, Walcott, and Naipaul.If you are interested in postcolonial *theory*, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You will read very brief, semi-representative excerpts of theorists without enough depth to really understand them and in conversation with mediocre fiction. Major theorists are cut down to five pages (Bhabha) or left off the syllabus entirely (Spivak), and the class does not give a clear arc of the critical historiography in question.If you are a feminist, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Just one of the novels taught was by a woman, and despite glaringly major gender themes in much of the material, discussion of it consistently takes a backseat and is left to five minutes at the end of class where we acknowledge that \"the text's relationship to women is also problematic.\"If you are interested in rigorous analysis of texts, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Buzzwords and talking points are rewarded; textual evidence is optional. Occasionally you'll say something you believe and Professor Pravinchandra will say \"exactly!\" and then \"re-state\" the opposite of your claim.If you are on the Left, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It is almost impossible to read what we do in this course intersectionally with other studies or political concerns because the systematic lack of rigor - and the sometimes explicit argument that fact-based analysis is oppressive - makes it impossible to seriously evaluate any of the ideology that is presented.DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.(It's not very hard, though, so that's something.)",
    "TAKE IT! If you are interested enough to be reading these reviews, you should just take the plunge! A thorough and thought-provoking cannonball into Postcolonial Studies, from the field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s origins up to the present. The syllabus is thoughtfully designed and modified each year. There is a beautiful balance of complementary theory and literature in the course.",
    "Professor Pravinchandra mediates discussion with ease, and seems to have a distinct goal for each class. Often, however, the discussion will consist of one person and the next agreeing that \"yes, this motif is problematic,\" without much forward movement. It can tend more towards politics than towards literary analysis.",
    "The syllabus will tell you much of what you need to know about this class. You'll read some great works and have great conversation. The discussion can definitely be run better and I didn't particularly enjoy writing the papers. But it was otherwise a great class!",
    "Really great class. Excellent syllabus and Prof. Pravinchandra leads very thought provoking discussion. I'd especially recommend this class to English majors. It'll really make a difference in the way you think about the canon and the structure of the major.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Overall, this course was terrible! And a waste of a Yale College credit. Many past reviews have said that it provides a valuable set of critical skills for critiquing the \"Western Canon,\"\/the cornerstones of a Yale English Major's education. This is certainly true of Postcolonial Studies writ large, but Pravinchandra leads a biased and irresponsible class that isIt focuses on pieces of Postcolonial literature that remain largely disconnected from each other as well as an overarching disciplinary theme. Professor Pravinchandra seems to step back and let students explore the course's material and seek answers themselves, but does so in an environment of, basically, indoctrination -- she handpicks the works from the syllabus and dismisses major postcolonial writers such as Rushie as \"problematic\" and expects students to engage with these assertions as premises for the course's literature without ever permitting them to read Rushdie, or providing them with any substantial critical evidence.Furthermore, her way of leading class discussion, supposedly in order to prompt students to come to their own conclusions, is actually an evasion of imparting any concrete knowledge; Professor Pravinchanda frustratingly refuses to say whether or not anything is on the right track, but nevertheless keeps the discussion within her arbitrarily established limits, defined by, for example, how problematic Salman Rushdie was, for example.",
    "Take the class, take it especially if you are hesitating between this class and one of those ten other courses on Shakespeares. You'll open your eyes to a whole new world... but do not worry... it 's not so much that you'll become uncomfortable about preconceptions... there aren't that many postcolonial courses.",
    "YES!",
    "absolutely. a must take as an english major"
