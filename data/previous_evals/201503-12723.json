    "I enjoyed this class a lot, and thought it was set up in a way that makes it interesting. You get to read things that talk about each other and critique each other, so you can see different points of view on topics.",
    "A great introduction to the field of modern epistemology - and to analytic philosophy in general. Prof. DeRose is fantastic - a good lecturer, and a solid syllabus, although we sometimes spent too much time on material and thus got behind on the readings. Definitely not a small amount a work - I probably had more work (with reading, short essays, a midterm, final essay, and a final exam) for this course than some of my seminars. But definitely take it if you're interested!",
    "Epistemology doesn't admit of the BSing that some humanities classes do. It's hard to just do off the cuff original analysis.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! This is a brilliant introduction to philosophy that takes interesting views of knowledge, and by the end of the semester, one has a comprehensive knowledge of various viewpoints that engage in conversation with each other. The class can be both funny and frightening, with regard to the things we cannot know, and I cannot speak highly enough about this class!",
    "This class is (as the title might suggest) a good introduction to epistemology. Definitely take if you're a philosophy major, or a non-major with a legitimate interest in the subject area. This probably isn't a good bet for somebody looking to take their first philosophy class.",
    "I felt that the material was both tedious and difficult to understand. The TF was infrequently helpful and more stressful than anything. The class was not fun, it was stressful, I did not enjoy it, do not take it.",
    "This is a good class to take after some basic introduction to philosophy but which is not at all overwhelming. The readings really make you think, and although sometimes the class could feel a little bit abstract to the point of frustration, I think the process is good for future careful thought. I would recommend the class to someone looking for a good lecture course that isn't overly demanding but which is intellectually demanding."
