    "I would recommend this course to any student who seeks to understand not only Durkheim's sociology but also his broad impact on various, seemingly unrelated, branches of the discipline. The course is not an easy one, and requires considerable preparation for each class, but this effort is rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a peer presuming they are interested in Durkheim's work and Durkheim-descended sociological paradigms--the course is rather narrow in its focus, but it delivers what it promises."

    "I am very glad to have taken the class given that I am interested in a subfield that draws heavily upon Durkheimian sociology."
