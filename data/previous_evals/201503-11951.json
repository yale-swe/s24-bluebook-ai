    "Good environmental engineering class. Not too much work, great professor.",
    "It was fine. If you need an elective go for it. Very relevant, everyone drinks water. Some concepts very basic and boring. Usually get a break in the middle when you start falling asleep. Overall: 7\/10",
    "Take this class with Professor Kim! He's one of the best professors at Yale - not only is he good at explaining concepts and making sure his students understand everything, he also cares a lot about his students. Problem sets and exams can be kind of challenging at times, but everything is pretty fair and doable. Also, there's no cumulative final exam - just three midterms, which was great!",
    "Prof. Kim is the greatest and this class is a good overview of water treatment processes. It's not a completely enthralling topic in my opinion, but Prof. Kim makes it worth it.",
    "If you're an Environmental Engineering major, you need to take it, but if you're in another major and can take it as an elective, I'd highly recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't interested in water quality, though, or if you're unwilling to do lots of math.",
    "Slightly below average amount of work for an engineering class, average for a general class, good breadth and depth. Expect to spend 2-6 hours a week on the problem sets"
