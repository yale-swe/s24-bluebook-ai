   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Long-form narrative structure, character development and arcs over the course of a feature length story, and improvement on collaborative work and giving notes to peers.",
    "I have learned the technical aspects of reading and writing scripts. I have learned to at once think creatively but also to translate that creativity onto the page in a succinct and practical manner. I have learned how to dissect good writing in films themselves and differentiate the screenwriter's influence from the director's. I have learned general storytelling structure and technique. And I have gained knowledge about real world aspects of screenwriting and hollywood.",
    "I have definitely grown as a screenwriter through this course. The exercise of planning and writing a feature-length screenplay is a challenging but very exciting and stimulating one, and that alone is a big point of growth. The advice provided by Marc and the rest of the class is helpful also and reveals flaws in both the specific script and in my general screenwriting. If you want to write screenplays, take advantage of the chance to workshop with motivated, intelligent peers while you can.",
    "This course will not give you a handout on anything more than formatting. You will not get lectures on how to become a better writer, and there is no golden path to an A. What Marc does help you do, though, is find out what you truly care about, how you can build a story from that, and how you strike the balance between flexing creative muscles and putting passion into your writing project. The class teaches you how to balance the thin line between these aspects of writing through workshops and curated reading assignemnts. Because there are a limited number of necessary submissions, it is certainly possible to scrape by with only a few edits, but Marc inspires a passion in you where you would submit your pieces to be edited every week if you could."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Advanced Screenwriting is a natural progression from the intermediate course. Our class by extension very tight knit and works as a strongly bonded unit.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in opportunities it presents for you to grow as a writer should you so choose to do so. If you are willing to put in the time and the effort to really take advantage of the knowledge and resources that Marc makes available to you, then your growth curve will be extremely steep. One way that the course could be improved is perhaps for a library of scripts to be made available for senior thesis students to be able to reference and study for their own screenplays. Marc provides us with a wealth of screenplays, however, I think it would really help if we as students were able to access specific screenplays that relate to the type of story that we are writing about in much the same way that we have access to DVD's in the film studies center.",
    "The seminar style is a strength, Id say, since its nice to get lots of feedback from the other students and its really neat to see what theyre doing, follow the journey they take with their script, and learn from them. And having a whole year to write the script is huge, its such a different endeavor from the previous levels of screenwriting and really fulfilling. And Marc is of course plenty of fun and has good advice and anecdotes to share. In this, the first half of the year, when we all dont have as much to share, it can be a bit slow, but thats how it goes. And sometimes the class time could be used a bit more efficiently (Marc doesnt need to read aloud his specific typo notes when hes marked them in writing for someone).",
    "The course is very strong. Marc treats his students not like college students who are dumb and need to be shown the path to greatness, but like developing young writers. The classroom feels simultaneously like a professional writers room and a writing club, in that our time feels productive and professional but with an open atmosphere conducive to the spread of honest ideas. Marc's notes are excellent and he has definitely improved in terms of the distribution of time among his notes and notes from other members of the workshop. His guidance is also excellent, and he balances directing us in a professional way with allowing our creative visions to come through in an effective way. One area that could be developed is the occasional downtime where nobody is prepared for edits. This only happens once every so often, and Marc usually fills the void with useful screenings or lectures, but some more hands-on assignments would be great. For instance, in one of his earlier seminars, we were paired with a writing partner and, in total silence, passed a notebook back and forth every few minutes and wrote a script. That was an amazing lesson in the way things get lost in translation on paper, the importance of writing in a way that's easy for others to read, and the challenges of being flexible with your ideas. More hands-on learning opportunities beyond edits would not only be helpful, but would be an excellent way for the class to bond.",
    "Being able to write a feature length screenplay and workshop it with my peers is so important. I'm really grateful that I get to take this class, and that I get to check-in with my instructor and peers about my work as I write something longer than anything I've written before. It's helpful to have Marc bring in former students, as well, talking with Chris Peckover was invaluable. I think having more page deadline after the first 10 pages would've been helpful, though, I appreciated being forced to write 10 pages so early on and would've benefited from having to write another 20 before November break or something."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you've made it intermediate, definitely continue on to go the distance.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in storytelling and is interested in working on creative pursuits in an academic setting. Screenwriting presents a different form of writing that will make all of your other writing more succinct. It will teach you how to 'show' with your writing rather than 'tell'.",
    "At this point, if youre considering taking this course, youve presumably taken Intro and Intermediate with Marc, so you have a sense of his style and how this will work. Except now youre spending a whole year on a feature length script, which at least I think is really neat and much more meaningful than than the shorts of previous courses. Its great to work through ideas with your peers, most of whom you probably know by now. Their feedback is really helpful, and its also awesome to follow their journey over the year as well and watch their scripts evolve. Definitely try to get ahead of the curve so you can get feedback on a solid draft as soon as possible. Things are a bit slow in the middle of this semester, when everyone has embraced an idea and started work but no one has a real draft to share, so its nice to get out of that. And it enables you to get more feedback. But yeah, its a good time, and its a great experience for anyone who wants to write screenplays after college.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I feel that I've grown immensely as a writer, I've bonded with a number of my classmates, particularly those in my writing group, and with three semesters under my belt, I feel prepared to try to write for a living. Marc has been an excellent guide throughout the entire process, and it's not surprising that he has a much larger-than-average number of successful students."
