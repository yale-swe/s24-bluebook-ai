   "comments": [
    "If you're really interested in public health challenges and AIDS, you might like this. But it's not really a political econ class, and sometimes doesn't feel super coherent from class-to-class. The final project is also a lot of work and involves complicated modeling software.",
    "Great senior seminar for econ majors who don't want an econometrics heavy class and who are interested in policy or health. Nicoli Nattrass is a super knowledgable and laid back professor--class was always interesting and often entertaining.",
    "I'm not sure I'd highly recommend this class, but it's fairly easy so if you're looking for a lecture with light reading then it might be fine. It's just two 4-5 page papers and one final paper, which you can do as a group. That being said, unless you care a lot about AIDS, this class probably won't excite you. And also I find Nicoli a little bit scary, although I think she means well.",
    "Absolutely! I loved this class!",
    "If you're interested in health around the world, this course should be interesting because it focuses on HIV\/AIDS through a variety of lenses (i.e. conspirators of AIDS denialism, witch doctors, etc.). The breakdown of assignments is quite fair, and you will learn through the work.",
    "YES, TAKE IT.",
    "This was a thoroughly enjoyable course with a manageable workload covering interesting and diverse aspects of HIV\/AIDS on the African continent. The final project was an interesting way to learn about country specific cases and is an effective way to learn how the politics of HIV\/AIDS plays a massive role in managing the epidemic. Professor Nattrass is an expert in her field, an open and amusing Professor. I would definitely recommend this course to people interested in African development\/health issues.",
    "This class was not anything like I expected it to be, but I loved it. The class looks at the issue of AIDS from nontraditional angles, focusing specifically on conspiracy theories and witchcraft. It's a unique opportunity to learn about these topics from Nattrass, who has done lots of work in both areas. Overall, fascinating class.",
    "It's alright. If you're an Econ major who likes stats and Econ things, you might want to look elsewhere. If you're into public health or are an Econ major who is now regretting being an Econ major, this might be the seminar for you. Nattrass is nice and not a harsh grader, and the semester is fairly low-key, which is nice. That being said, I didn't feel like I got as much out of the class as I do out of most classes, but it was still enjoyable. Also, the final project is kind of a pain. You use this weird program called Spectrum. If you like Stata, you will hate Spectrum.",
    "A pretty solid class that teaches you less about political economy and more about the anthropological basis of AIDS denialism and other current issues in AIDS treatment and prevention. The readings were all extremely interesting and the workload was fairly light for most of the semester. That said, Professor Nattrass didn't give very much direction at all for the final paper assignment, which left a lot of students confused and flailing around with the Spectrum modeling software (which is really of dubious value to begin with). I would recommend the class to anyone strongly interested in global health and the anthropology of AIDS beliefs. If you're looking for hard econ, I would look elsewhere.",
    "Definitely recommend!"
