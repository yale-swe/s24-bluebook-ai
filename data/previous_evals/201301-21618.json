    "One short book a week to read. Very manageable. I'd say half the books are great, the other half pretty bad. We talk about general themes of Brazil in modernity and Prof. Jackson does a great job intertwining history lessons into the literature that we read. Essays are also manageable, but make sure you speak clearly in them, he prefers good writing to good ideas. This class will be a snore if you don't read the books and do some background googling on themes you found interesting while reading the novels. I would recommend.",
    "It was great, interesting, laid-back. Fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it introduces you to Brazilian Literature in general. More specifically it introduces you to several themes\"Internationalization of Brazilian Literature post 1985\", \"desire\", \"love\", \"sex\", \"social criticism\" etc.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this class, as the novels chosen are sometimes surprisingly poorly written, and the discussions are not led well."
