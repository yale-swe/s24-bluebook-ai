    "This course helped me think a lot about the relationships between postcolonialism, Asia \/ Asian diaspora, and literature. It was by far the most interesting class I've taken at Yale so far in terms of the subject matter. I think what I gained from this course was a deeper understanding of the political stakes of postcolonial literatures and how the texts we read fit into larger conversations about globalization, third worldism, etc. In the end this class generated more questions for me than answers, which I actually think is the best sign of an excellent class.",
    "Postcolonial Asias was particularly interesting, especially to English majors as its one of the only English classes that focuses on Asian literature.",
    "Critical thinking regarding close reading and analysis of narrative and literary styles",
    "This class is cross-listed English and ER&M so it was great to read both novels and academic papers about Third Worldism\/postcolonial material. Professor Xiang made us write outlines for each essay and her feedback actually helped me become a better writer and develop original thoughts.",
    "Prof. Xiang's course helped me think about literature, and the ethical considerations that go into reading a work of literature, in ways that were new, humbling, and extremely fulfilling. Even though I've taken theory-heavy literature courses before, Prof. Xiang structured the readings in such a way that I felt for the first time as though I was really able to synthesize and incorporate secondary sources with primary. The content of the reading list was also fantastic it exposed me to so many new strands of 20th-century and contemporary literature, as well as a good mix of critical-theory classics and newer works, that I think my summer reading plans, in the wake of this class, have undergone a drastic shift. Overall, a wonderful, exciting, and deeply challenging course.",
    "Professor Xiang really helped me improve my paper-writing process. She broke both papers down into smaller, more manageable deadlines, where we turned in theses, essay plans, and an annotated bibliography (for the final paper). We also spent time in class workshopping each other's essay proposals. This was so, so helpful Professor Xiang's method really guided people like me who often have trouble writing essays and do not know how to start or finish. The structured plan also made finishing the essay so much faster: the final paper felt like a breeze because we had planned it out so well, and that was a great relief from the other classes' papers! Additionally, the primary texts and secondary readings were all incredibly well chosen. Professor Xiang taught us how to read dense, difficult scholarly articles and locate the essence of their arguments. In general, this class really expanded my idea of Asia where is Asia, or where are the Asias? Does Asia exist in the continent, in the Pacific, or beyond in the diaspora? These are difficult questions, but this is the perfect class to help you try to come to answers."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - this class facilitated a really lovely classroom environment, in large part due to Professor Xiang. I always felt very supported by the rest of my classmates and genuinely loved hearing their thoughts and ideas about the readings. The texts are all unique and extremely thought-provoking, especially paired with the secondary readings we did throughout the semester. It was an extremely rigorous course in the best of ways. Some of the readings we did were incredibly difficult but I really appreciated that Professor Xiang took the time to work through things with us very slowly and really break down the various arguments that were being made, especially with readings like Spivak and Homi Bhabha. Weaknesses - I would suggest cutting one text out and adding in more secondary readings that are mandatory, rather than optional. Some of my favorite readings from this class were actually optional secondary readings, but they helped me think about the novels that we read in conversation with other bodies of scholarship. I think students would also benefit from the reading pace being a bit slower and having more time to digest a novel\/book alongside other readings. I think the theoretical framing for the class also could have benefited from being a bit more clear - the course was broken down into various demarcations (years and themes) but often times I wasn't clear on how the books we read fit into those themes. Sometimes it felt like we were just going from book to book and not situating the books within the larger framework of the course, which I would have been more interested in thinking about. All of these are just suggestions - I really loved the course as it was!",
    "Strengths: e v e r y t h i n g Weaknesses: I think we probably could've used longer class meetings, felt like we rushed through stuff a little.",
    "While the course was a welcome challenge to traditional Yale English classes, I found a disconnect between the professor's critical thinking and that of the students. I do wish the professor had slowed down a bit and worked more on guiding students toward her unique way of thinking.",
    "Two of this course's greatest strengths were its reading list which I've already mentioned and the amount of support Prof. Xiang gives her students. She was always willing to meet for office hours, even if it was outside of her normal time slot, and I loved being able to work progressively through a paper idea with her over multiple meetings something I've never been able to do with a professor before, and which helped my thinking achieve new levels of complexity. And her essay feedback oh my goodness. I got an entire page of brilliant, typewritten comments on my first essay, which not only gave me the sense that my professor was invested in my success, but also that my work really mattered. (Also, she gave us mini self-care packages when we were writing our essays! With personalized quotes! Who does that?!) The one criticism I would have of this course and in some respects, it's hardly a criticism is that Prof. Xiang's reading list was initially WAY too ambitious, and so over the course of the semester the syllabus kept getting updated as we realized what would be manageable and what wouldn't. But she was always prompt about getting the new syllabi posed, so it was never really an issue.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Xiang. She is AMAZING. Kind, thoughtful, caring, and deeply brilliant. Under her tutelage, the class developed a real sense of camaraderie and we had really great discussions. Generally, I come away from a seminar with one or two new friends, but after Postcolonial Asias, I felt like I had a whole class of new friends. This was capped off by our really fun, perfectly planned trip to the Whitney Biennial in NYC it happened at the start of reading week, and it was absolutely the best way to end the semester. Professor Xiang just put so much effort, thought, and care into everything she did for the class, and it really made a difference, elevating discussion, helping us tackle complex and difficult subjects, and fostering respect towards each other."

   "comments": [
    "This is the best class I've taken yet at Yale and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interesting in thinking through postcolonialism and Asian American \/ Asian Anglophone literature. The course covers topics such as national independence, third worldism, globalization, and futurity - both on a global scale and on a more local scale of Asia. The course is rigorous but in the best of ways, and I learned a lot from each of the readings. Professor Xiang is FANTASTIC!!! So kind, warm, and supportive, and so so intelligent. Highly highly highly recommend taking a class with her if you are lucky enough to.",
    "Professor Xiang is an amazing teacher who would bring snacks to class for students, who would make care packages for them when they were writing their midterm papers, and who would prepare a bingo activity to keep us engaged in a text.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Sunny is a brilliant radiant beam of excellence in the dark tunnel of the Yale English department. She is an actual genius and pushes us all to think on an incredibly sophisticated level. It was manageable and enjoyable, the readings were exciting and readable, but it was also the most intellectually rigorous English class I've had at Yale. Sunny also really pushes you as a writer in a way I haven't been pushed in three years of this major -- she doesn't accept bullshit, she wants papers that are taking a stand, and she has no time for sentence-padding fluff. But again it seriously is actually quite manageable even though it's a lot of work -- reading good novels isn't a chore. Also part of what makes this class amazing is that it attracted a really broad cross-section of majors who all approached the material differently, so if you're not in either department still take it. The people in this class were some of the brightest people I've encountered at Yale and I often felt content to just take down reams of notes on what they were expressing. But if you are an English major, this class is the one that made me believe in this major as a worthwhile pursuit again.",
    "I would definitely recommend Postcolonial Asias to a student looking to read more Asian literature and to expand their topics and literary scope to ideas that revolve around Asia, postcolonialism, and globalism.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students but caution them to take this course with an otherwise light courseload. While I gained valuable intellectual thinking skills in ways that the Yale English department hadn't offered me before, the course is challenging particularly because of its ambitious speed.",
    "If you're still around after Prof. Xiang gets back from leave in a year's time, you'd be absolutely nuts not to take a class with her. This course expanded my mind and my ways of reading more than I thought possible it was easily one of my favorite classes so far at Yale. Prof. Xiang is a intellectual badass and powerhouse; don't go in expecting an easy A, but do go if you care about literature enough to have all your assumptions about it shaken.",
    "Absolutely take this class. There are very few professors at Yale as committed, inspiring, creative, and caring as Professor Xiang. This class would be worth it just for the chance to meet her and be in the same room as her twice a week, but on top of that, the books that she assigns are so wonderful to read, and the discussion that follows and the questions she asks is really thought-provoking and enriches the experience of reading. We read canonical scholarly texts as well as more idiosyncratic ones, and the mix keeps things interesting and also deepens our understanding of the varied work surrounding postcolonialism and Asia."
