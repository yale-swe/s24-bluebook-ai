    "A lot of verb tenses, greater comfort speaking\/listening\/writing\/reading Spanish.",
    "I learned how to speak Spanish with a greater level of fluidity, to write in Spanish with better grammar conventions, and to read at a higher level.",
    "I improved my Spanish and learned a lot about the history of Latin America.",
    "I learned about the relation between Spanish culture and language and how to increase fluidity in speaking and writing.",
    "I learned a lot about speaking Spanish and improving my grammar within my previous speaking abilities.",
    "I learned the final grammatical structures that I had yet to learn, and sharpened previously learned structures. I also learned a great deal of helpful and practical vocabulary.",
    "It's the last core Spanish class - if you've taken 130, you should know what to expect. Like 110-130, it goes grammar topic by grammar topic, so we covered things like conditional clauses, various types of perfect, pluperfect, and progressive forms, and so on."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Compared to L3, there is a bit less structure\/organization to the course. It'd be helpful if the emails for exams contained more detail on what will be covered, such as page numbers for lessons, and more specifics about grammar, etc. The course gets a lot of material in and definitely leaves you feeling like you can do a lot more with the language.",
    "The course curriculum was very conducive to learning but the workload was very heavy.",
    "I think that the course was taught very well and had a good structure, but some of the Supersite assignments were time-consuming. I really enjoyed how the course incorporated history and culture into learning the intricacies of the language.",
    "The exams were inconsistently difficult sometimes but opportunities for help were plentiful.",
    "Variety of assignments was nice as was the professor. Well organized course.",
    "I think the only weakness I would report is the inclusion of a letter from Cristobal Coln, which seemed completely out of context in the scheme of our other material and used an archaic form of Spanish, rendering it not very useful for learning and familiarizing ourselves with forms and vocabulary.",
    "It's very strong in grammar - I felt that it helped me understand the grammar topics in an intuitive way. It's also not bad for developing conversation skills, although I feel that it depends on your professor and the personality of your class as a whole. Weaker areas of the course include cohesiveness (especially towards the end, although scheduling was probably hard this semester), and feedback on written assignments. It might help to have a few more manually graded assignments, since the SuperSite assignments aren't always in sync with the class and don't provide any useful help for errors."

   "comments": [
    "It's a solid course. Not a lot of fun, but a solid course and you get out what you put in.",
    "For anyone truly interested in learning and improving their Spanish, I would definitely recommend this course. Any less, and the workload is probably too much.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because the material is entertaining and useful. It is a lot of work, but the expectations are reasonable. The class does tend to get repetitive as the semester goes by.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who hopes to improve comfort in Spanish",
    "Yes to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "Yes! I think the course well organized and helpful for my Spanish learning.",
    "It's not bad. I found it to be better than 130, but like I said, that depends on your class and professor."
