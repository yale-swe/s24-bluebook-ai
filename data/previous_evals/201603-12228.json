    "This course is great for older anthropology majors. It's interesting, and it doesn't just teach you a lot about the world around you; it also tells you a lot about the subject you are studying in and of itself, then challenges you to think about how to best go about studying it. It can be dense at times, so it's not for people who have never taken an anthropology course before, but as long as you have a little background, it's really a great course."

    "YES! As long as you have taken a few anthropology courses before, go for it. This class will help you get a better grasp on various social theories that are vital to anthropology, as well as think about how the discipline itself operates within political systems. Also, one of the highlights is that Professor Siu is able to assign a manageable amount of work without losing any intellectual edge; the readings are rich and stimulating, and they're doable because there aren't too many assigned. The written assignments are the same way. This is really an amazing course and I highly recommend it.",
    "This class was really great. Discussions are fun and Siu knows her shit."
