   "comments": [
    "Post-WWII social theory on Modernity. Good class but make sure youre VERY interested in the subject already.",
    "Professor Eyerman is SUCH a joy, and makes the material accessible to even non-theory people.",
    "An excellent introduction to contemporary social theory (post-Marx, Weber, Durkheim). The reading is interesting and not overwhelming, and the professor is on-point and incredibly supportive. I highly recommend this class, especially if you're already familiar with the classic social theorists.",
    "If you're a sociology major, you have to take it. If you're not a sociology major, just be prepared that theory analysis is different from something like literature analysis.",
    "Great course for anyone interested in learning about modern theory. It's definitely more interesting than classical theory because a lot of the concepts are relevant to today's events. The workload is not overwhelming, but the course is heavy on reading so plan for that.",
    "SOCY 152 is a great broad introductory course to modern theory, and is the second half of a two-course combo (the first is Foundations of Modern Social Theory). I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning about some foundational theory (you get this from both classes), and then a more modern approach to theory, which is the focus of this class.",
    "You will read well a wide range of writing styles, argumentation, and topics, but you will leave with a unified understanding because you'll be forced to write on each book as you read it because eyerman assigns a 2 page reading response each week. this is as tough as you make it, but at its best can help you integrate the reading into your preexisting understanding. you may come to class thinking you've 'got it', yet you'll be surprised by the ways the other students interpreted the same text in order to make it relevant to their lives. eyerman is the most down-to-earth teacher i've had and he makes discussion leadership look easy",
    "This was a very interesting course that really helped me build a foundation in contemporary theory. I appreciated the opportunity to read so many different kinds of theory and to discuss them in class, but sometimes I felt like classical theory should have been a prerequisite (or, at the very least, recommended preparation), since it was often used. I really enjoyed this course though! Also, Prof. Eyerman had an excellent grasp on the material, and he led very interesting discussions in class. One-on-one, he was very helpful in discussing out-standing questions about the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It really opens up your mind to things youcoulnd't notice before. The discussion gets more and more interesting. Be prepared to talk about some good amount of social theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend Socy 152. As a freshman majoring in MB&B, all of my other classes were either science or math. I was looking for a non-science class that would be interesting, not a ridiculous amount of work, and would expose me to a new field. This class was all of the above. It's a great way to get exposure to social theory (social and sociological philosophy), which I never would have had without taking it. It's definitely permanently changed the way I see the world, and it was just a \"fun class\" I took on a whim."
