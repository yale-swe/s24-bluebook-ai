    "I would definitely recommend this course! I learned so much more from this lab than I ever did in any other lab or lecture course. Barry is great. You don't have weekly lab reports. Instead, there's an intro paper due a few weeks in about your organ ~10 pages; and a presentation and paper (25-30 pages including intro and 10 pages of your EM images) at the end. Make some informal internal deadlines for yourself though. Maybe near the middle, have a sample micrograph or two labelled and the discussion written up, and ask for some feedback on it.Also, you get to use EMs, which is pretty much unheard of in undergrad setting. And you really get to see what cells look like. When you're in lecture, they look perfect and organized, but the truth is, they're so much stranger than that, so much madder. And so much better.PS, email Barry or Mark Mooseker early on to geta spot!",
    "This course is interesting in an infinite, cosmological sort of way. You get to look at the structures that you learn about in other bio classes with your own eyes. Basically, you get an organ at the beginning of the structure from a mouse, and then you spend the semester preparing sections to analyze by light and electron microscopy. Along the way you write a 10 page intro physiology paper and a big final paper at the end. It's truly remarkable that we were given this opportunity. The grading is pretty standard in that if you are a good student (unlike me haha oops) you should get an A. But take this course because getting to study cell structure in this way is one of the most unforgettable experiences.",
    "This is by far the best course I have ever taken, so I recommend it to everyone who is interested!The lab functions more like independent research than a typical Yale lab course. But, don't let that make you feel too pressured, because the course is set up masterfully so that everyone has the opportunity to produce excellent work and understand everything that is going on.Barry guides you through all the necessary concepts and techniques necessary to produce great work at the end. You start by learning how to actually use a light microscope, which I know for a fact the majority of you were never taught. Then, you learn about how EM works, and the basic process. Next, you start with a mouse, and week by week run through the first part of the procedure, which includes fixing your tissue, embedding it in plastic, and cutting ultra thin sections of it. A few weeks in, you will take these sections to the electron microscope and start the real work of the course. This is the pointat which the extra time commitment comes in, but know that it is a ton of fun to master this scope and collect real data!As for the time commitment and workload, don't let that dissuade you! In most lab courses, you will have to produce at least one report every week. In this class, you will have a 2 hour out of class commitment for roughly half of the weeks and one longer report and a presentation due at the end. So, if you stay engaged throughout the semester, and do a good job on the first paper (a basic overview of the anatomy and histology of your tissue, written using the histology textbooks available in the lab), you will be absolutely fine.Also, because of the nature of the course and the report, what you produce will be something unique, that you are actually proud of, not just some cookie cutter lab report like with other classes. It was a great feeling to put everything together and present my work, so in my opinion, any extra difficulty conferred by the non-cookie-cutter thing was absolutely worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the lab. I learned so much. It is quite a bit of work at the end, but overall the same amount of work as any other lab.",
    "A great stand-alone lab course. It can be an overwhelming amount of work if you don't keep up with it weekly, so keep that in mind. It requires 2-3 hours of outside lab time\/week to use the scope for the first 2\/3 of the course. And you get to use an electron microscope! Barry is a great instructor (but a strict one, there is no coddling in this class) and is usually available to help. If you're looking for a stand-alone lab, or any lab really, I highly recommend this one.",
    "This class is quite a bit of work, but if you take everything very seriously you'll be okay. Just work very hard at the beginning of the semester and you'll be fine, since a lot of the time is independent work. BE ANAL. You'd be surprised how the little details, like making your glass knives ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY will be essential for getting quality sections. It's actually amazing when you finally sit down at the TEM and get images, it's a different world at this magnification. Highly recommend.",
    "In EM lab you are assigned an organ and look at tissues samples of it for the rest of the semester. It's an amazing class in the sense that you see the whole process through- from the mouse dissection, staining, sectioning to viewing on the microscope. How much time you put into it really reflects in the quality of your samples, so be forewarned!",
    "In this class, you get to nerd out about cells. Looking at tissue at such high magnification is way more fun that you might think. Barry is very positive and helpful throughout the process but he lets you figure out stuff on your own. If you like project-based learning (which you should, because it's the best type of learning) you should take this class."
