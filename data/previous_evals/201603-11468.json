    "I learned so many things while taking this course, as we covered very large range of topics in Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, from Heat Engines to Bose condensation, from Phase transitions to Blackbody Radiation... The list goes on. All the stuff we did in the class taught us how to approach studying systems that are way more complex, than the idealized systems with massless springs or large objects in classical mechanics or a single particle in a box which you learn how to solve in Quantum mechanics. In PHYS 420 you have to integrate all these different laws that you have learned throughout your physics studies into understanding large systems such as seas of electrons in a metal or crystal solids using the Debye model and of course ideal gases, bose gases and fermi gases. In this class you learn that the way to approach these complex systems with many particles is to define macroscopic quantities that characterize them and dive into the relations between the macroscopic quantities using statistics and quantum mechanics. You get a sense of how the great physicists approached these problems of systems with many particles.",
    "I learned a lot of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, for sure. I learned how to Taylor expand, what the links between quantum mechanics and stat-mech are, and how Einstein was the smartest guy out there.",
    "Basic thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and quantum gas treatment. However, this treatment varies from any that I have seen in that it prepares you to analyze any system of interest and teaches general principles of analysis which is a level of abstraction that I deeply appreciated. The connection between stat mech and thermo was made amazingly clear and their interconversion and I have now internalized their relation to one another.",
    "The class was very useful for developing intuition about how certain systems and particle aggregates should behave, as well as for forcing students to override their intuition in certain situations (such as the derivation of negative temperature for the spin-1\/2 system). Also, I much better appreciate the importance of approximation and combinatorics in the physical sciences.",
    "I learned how to scream into a pillow between pset problems and hold back tears during exams!",
    "Before taking this course I only thought of myself as a physics major. After taking this course I am beginning to think of myself as a physicist. I learned the techniques of statistical mechanics, which are central to so much of modern physics research. Technically, I learned several new (pretty nifty) techniques of integration as well as how to handle multi-dimensional differentials. My greatest insight from this class was in applying the knowledge I learned to my own experiences. Thermodynamics describes almost everything, so almost everything can be looked at from its perspective.",
    "Learned a ton about thermodynamics and stat mech and how those concepts are applied to systems.",
    "I gained a great deal of physics intuition and feel like a more legitimate physicist. I learned intro stat mech and thermodynamics, and feel prepared for more advanced courses.",
    "a lot about Taylor approximations. Learned how to correlate equations and what they mean by taking limits, etc much better"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was poorly taught. The explanations were cursory. The mathematics was not rigorous. The intuition was not presented. One of the weakest aspects of this course, however, are the problem sets. For every problem set, approximately one problem was reasonable in the sense that it reinforced and gave good intuition on the physics. This was good. Other problems, however, simply reinforced the ambiguity of the math and maintained arbitrary notions of rigor, without providing any good insight to the student.",
    "The strength of the course is that it has a good mix of being challenging and interesting. The challenge of learning the material is very rewarding. You feel like you understand so many things you've always wondered about but never really understood such how a refrigerator works, why the greenhouse effect happens how why we have phase transitions when we change temperature and pressure etc. The main weakness is the Sturge textbook. It is simply very difficult to learn from. There are some errors and also very confusing notation (such as n for both density and occupancy). When studying for finals, I found myself having quite a few ahah moments while looking through statistical physics books that were not required for the course, that had much more enlightening figures. For example one figure I saw had the Dulong petit law plotted on the same graph as the Debye model (when assuming a maximum frequency), and a graph of the Debye model when integrating over frequency from 0 to infinity. One recommendation I have for the course is to include more diagram drawing on the homework (even if it is simple and graded for only 1 point). The question could even be to mindlessly copy a graph drawn in class onto the homework. I think these exercise will help students easily capture a lot of material in one memory. For example in one of the homeworks, we were asked to chemical potential versus temperature for both bosons and fermions and to plot f(E) for a fermion at low temperature. Initially I thought, what a silly question and just copied the exact diagram from my notes for the former graph onto the my homework and copied the diagram for the latter graph from Sturge. This homework problem proved to be one of the most useful exercises come finals period when I was learning the material. I remembered the graphs so clearly and as I could constantly refer to that mental image to pull out so much material such as: chemical potential is always negative for bosons, bosons chemical potential approaches 0 as T approachs 0. At T=0 for a fermion the chemical potential is positive and is E_f, zeta=-kTln(n_q\/n) for n",
    "The strength is that it is a very rigorous course that MAKES you learn the material (or else you fail - there is no sliding by.) That being said, I think it's unnecessarily hard. There should be more of a correspondence between lectures and problem sets. The problem sets and exams do NOT need to be intentionally made super-long and super-hard to make the curve be the only hope for the grade. The Sturge textbook isn't all that great, and your TA becomes your lifeline by week 4. This class has a reputation for being the hardest and worst class of the physics major. Of the ones I have taken so far, I would agree. I think, though, that if the class (and by that I mean the psets, and the tone of the lectures) had the focus set as the students really learning the material, rather than the course being very hard, it would be a lot better.",
    "Strengths: Content. All of the material is fairly interesting and well presented. The overarching arc of the class progresses nicely and is thematically consistent. Weaknesses: Some of the PSets are unnecessarily long and provide tedium rather than rigor. The class cannot be decoupled from the professor and thus Prof Stones someone whimsical lecturing style and inability to answer questions both count as major weaknesses of the class. Also, an abysmal text that I could not continue to read half-way through the semester.",
    "Strengths - good pacing (i.e. beginning is fairly slow, but it speeds up appreciably), homeworks were difficult but usually solvable in the end, exams were very well written - tested material from a novel perspective. The TA, William Sweeney, was great, as were Professor Stone's lectures. Weaknesses - problem set during reading period was unpleasant, the textbook is riddled with errors (but other than that usually helpful), class being at 9 AM was rough sometimes. No major weaknesses though. Just remove the problem set due during during reading period and the course is fine.",
    "Doug Stone is a really great lecturer (with a lot of interjected pleas of \"Just bear with me, this makes sense I promise\") and his selections of problems are mostly very satisfying. A few complaints: Sturge is an indecipherable tome*. I can sit through lectures and listen to material, but I know that I personally learn best by reading after lecture and garnering a deeper understanding of the material. This wasn't really possible with Sturge, which made me feel like I only halfway understood much of the material. Exams. Exams. Wow. I've heard that the exams this semester were actually friendlier than in previous years - despite this, I have to say that the two midterms and the final had a few things in common: 1) all three contained problems that stemmed from material but involved derivations for unfamiliar models (polymers, magnetic fields, etc in place of gases) that would mostly be intuitive (and based on more familiar models) but have components that felt very up in the air (where the answer could not be deduced and had to instead be recalled from memory or simply guessed). 2) These problems were actually very interesting. I liked them but feel the exams would have been just as rigorous even with more clear problem statements or with instructions that aided us in finding the right way to tackle the problem. 3) Nobody finished on time. I often sifted through exam problems to find the ones that I was most likely to ace, simply because I knew that even though I could put down an honest answer for each I wouldn't have enough time to dig into them. *this is an exaggeration but it's just very dense and often ambiguous or unclear.",
    "Strengths: I appreciated not needing to walk up to SPL to attend lecture at 9am. The professor's background knowledge on the subject (e.g., its development) AND that he actively works with it (moreso than an ordinary physicist) The detailed pset solutions. Weaknesses: The textbook by Sturge takes some getting used to. I have to think that there is a better alternative. I didn't appreciate Professor Stone canceling and making up lectures as frequently as he did. I am sure that they were unavoidable, but in my experience most courses meet more regularly. The course could be improved by emphasizing the mathematical preparation in the first few lectures.",
    "This was a very challenging course. Teaching it at a more reasonable hour (not 9am) would make it much more palatable",
    "Douglas Stone is a good professor, the material is great, the problem sets helped with learning. Some of the problem sets could be more clearly phrased to avoid confusion. The textbook can be obtuse at times, and features a few mistakes in key formulas. A change of textbook would be wonderful.",
    "I would have liked a workshop with the Prof. or TA at the beginning of the semester outlining best practices for Taylor expansion and finding self-consistent answers. On later problem sets, when we were given questions with three different quantities rated as much, much greater than each other in different arrangements, I would not have known how to make proper assumptions if not for the TA.",
    "Think there could have been more done to contextualize topics\/add qualitative information, especially the thermodynamics. The problems sets were really cool though, and the discussion of the canonical ensembles was well done"

   "comments": [
    "You learn a ton of things in the class. I would recommend the course if you are strong in math and physics and want to put in the effort to learn a ton of things. Be warned the class be a bit stressful because as professor Stone says, \"In this course I pack 1.5 semesters worth of material into 1 semester.\" It does feel great coming out of the course though, knowing how much you have learned. This is a hard class don't get me wrong, but I think its difficulty is a bit over-hyped. The exams are definitely hard and there is too much material to learn, but I heard coming into the class that the p-sets would be around 20 hours a week, and that the class would consume your semester. The problem sets were most definitely not that long. They were long and took perhaps 8-12 hours, and I am glad the class didn't live up to the hype of having an obscene workload.",
    "Um, well, if you're a physics major on the intensive track, or if you're tryna go to grad school, you pretty much have to take this. If you feel like you don't \"need\" this course, go take 401-402 instead! ALSO: MAKE SURE YOU TAKE QUANTUM 1 BEFORE THIS CLASS! It's super misleading to have this course numbered lower than 440 but without quantum you will neither understand nor appreciate stat-mech.",
    "Yes. I believe that I gained a valuable perspective on the connection between stat mech and thermo and am fundamentally better prepared to use both in my analysis of novel systems that I come across in my academic career. I am glad I took this course and would take it again (some that I very rarely say).",
    "If you're ok with approximating a lot to get really nice answers and don't mind spending a large amount of time each week on problem sets, this is a great course that will introduce you to an entirely new side of physics from the mechanics-style courses you've presumably taken so far.",
    "Phys 430 is the real deal. It's a hard class but it's not hard without reason - you learn a lot. Problem sets are difficult but surprisingly manageable, especially if you can hash them out with other students. Stone is a great lecturer, and class is worth attending given that the textbooks are not great. Hold onto your butt come midterms and finals.",
    "Would recommend. Types of People Who Take This Course: Intensive physics majors, Physics majors You have to take this course. You will inevitably dislike some aspects of this course, but if you take it earnestly, it will benefit you. Other physics majors (e.g. astro, geo) You don't have to take this course. If you plan on going to the \"harder\" side of research, then go for it. Otherwise, you can do without. Chem Majors Many of the topics covered obviously overlap with P-Chem and taking this course would probably help a chem major broaden and deepen their understanding of these concepts. Math Majors Beyond the fancy integration techniques which are nifty, there isn't much \"deep\" mathematics. This course however does prepare you for deeper results, like the Spin-Statistics Theorem. If you want to be a cool cat like Ed Witten, then you need to take this course.",
    "Stat Mech is a lot more fun than rumors say. The material (especially the stat mech part) is fascinating. I actually thought Doug Stone was a good professor too; he was unrigorous and unorganized at times, but overall an enthusiastic teacher who cared a lot about the class. I think he might have gone easier on our class in terms of workload, but while the material was hard and took time, I found in manageable. Be prepared for terrifying exams that are impossible to finish, and you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend it. It's an intellectual gym, and while there was a lot of pain, I feel that I got a commensurate amount of gain. Any student wishing to take 420 should know that the problem sets will take 15-20 hours per week.",
    "I'd say the material is really interesting, especially the statistical mechanics. I suspect the thermodynamics could be covered more clearly in a chemistry course. However, the workload and especially the grading is pretty tough, so while good for a physics major, I'd hesitate to recommend it to someone outside the major"
