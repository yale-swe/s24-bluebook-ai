    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in order\/conflict\/violence stuff. If you're not doing a senior essay, the option to write a research proposal is incredible. The class attracts a really cool group of kids and Prof. Wood is amazing -- don't miss taking a class from her.",
    "This class is amazing. You will learn a huge amount about theory and case studies. Don't take it if you aren't willing to put in the work, though--you won't get anything out of it and Professor Wood will know. If you're considering writing a senior essay in it, do. She's a great advisor.",
    "This is a really great class, well worth the late-night hike up to Rosenkranz. The subject matter is interesting, though difficult, and Professor Wood is clearly invested in each of her students.",
    "This course was excellent - much more methodology-focused than many other classes I've taken in the department. Professor Wood is terrific. She is extremely knowledgeable, leads discussions well, and offers thoughtful and extensive comments on written work and class participation.",
    "If interested in the topic of violence, take the course. Warning, though: this class is about violence and NOT about civil war onset. If looking to write a senior essay on the topic, definitely take it. Professor Wood is the best advisor out there.",
    "Yes, take it."
