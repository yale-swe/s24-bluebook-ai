    "Great insight from a career diplomat. Great class to get outside of the academic bubble while still gaining valuable insight into Chinese foreign policy. Great way to apply what we learn into practice through simulations and scenarios.",
    "US foreign policy to China. How to think, talk, write and ask like a diplomat.",
    "I learned how to draft policy memos and get to my point quickly and clearly.",
    "How a policy maker thinks and acts. Dave Rank was an excellent instructor with important insights.",
    "Better understanding of U.S. foreign policy toward a rising China",
    "I developed a very good foundational understanding of how Chinese history is playing a critical role in today's Chinese issues. Overall, I found that I could have a very informed conversation about current challenges as it relates to U.S.\/China relations.",
    "A knowledge of the Chinese society and Chinese foreign policy.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: very informative for someone who is not actively thinking of foreign policy . Dave is very knowledge and helpful, he is also great at giving feedback. Weakness: not the best class for having critical discussions.",
    "Discussion of the course is lively. Lecture is informative. (I wonder if it'd be also helpful to learn more about the development of American's foreign policy in other parts of the world outside of China and Asia.)",
    "Strengths: Dave Rank. Weaknesses: the historical portion of the class was too long, in my opinion. We should have gone straight into contemporary issues on the third class or so.",
    "Prof. Rank brought in some phenomenal and very interesting guests to speak with us, which added to the substance of the class. I also appreciated the different assignments we were asked to complete and the detailed feedback from Prof. Rank, which helped to improve our policy writing abilities. However, the work load, particularly the reading, is a little heavier than normal courses and could be calibrated better. Lastly, if offered in the future, I'd highly recommend avoiding the Friday afternoon slot!",
    "Strengths- the professor, David Rank, was awesome. So unbelievably knowledgeable and insightful on the topic. Improvements- none to speak of.",
    "The reading load and assignment load could be more evenly distributed.",
    "Fun and engaging discussions. Interesting speakers. Great professor!"

    "Yes. I think David Rank is an excellent instructor. Anyone who wants to know about American's foreign policy in China (or Asia) will benefit from taking this course.",
    "Absolutely. I left more aware of the challenges facing U.S. policymakers as China continues growing and developing into a superpower and the myriad of issues stemming from its rise.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "If they were interested in global issues and especially China, absolutely.",
    "Absolutely. The best course I took this semester.",
    "Yes"
