    "I never know if people actually read these evaluations seriously.. but anyway.. this class will be difficult unless you have a high level of mathematical intuition. The truth is that the math never gets above the level of basic algebra and MAYBE some derivatives, but you'll be surprised how involved the algebra can get. That said, don't be afraid of taking it.. I've taken some higher level math classes that supposedly dealt with regression more 'rigorously' (matrix math and whatnot), but in truth I learned much more about regression in Econ 136, even though we dealt in very simple examples of 1 or 2 variables the entire time. You will leave this class truly feeling like you understand what regression is on a fundamental\/theoretical level.",
    "Required for econ\/math...",
    "This course is HARD. I came into the course thinking that with my math skills I could breeze through the assignments by churning out pages of algebra like in intermediate micro. But while a good math background is essential for success in the course, econometrics doesn't quite work that way. There are a lot of qualitative details you have to keep track of, and there are a lot of traps. Prof. Tartari is always very prepared for the lectures and really makes sure that you know your stuff. You know how when you talk to most people and say something technical that doesn't really make sense, they just nod and forget about it? That's not Prof. Tartari; she will make you clarify the confusing parts of your argument. She knows econometrics inside-out and you cannot fool her.The assignments were of greatly varying length, from the single-page STATA exercise that took 20 minutes to the 18-page monster (which required reading 20 pages of a dense journal article) that no one figured out completely. The longest ones are also towards the end of the course, when you also have to prepare a presentation and essay on an assigned journal article, so the workload really intensifies in the last 3-4 weeks. Prof. Tartari is really upwards biased in her estimate of her students' mean ability, and it's especially evident on her absurdly long exams. Nevertheless, I really gained an appreciation of econometrics by the end of the course and it's probably my favorite economics class that I've taken.",
    "Lots of derivations! So you have to be comfortable with that. Also the exams and the problem sets can be very long. Understandably, econometrics is a dry topic, but very useful. If you are considering advanced graduate economics or statistical research, this is the course to takeThe Psets, are generally doable, since we are allowed to work in groups. However, time was a constraint on the midterm and the final exam was also difficult to finish in under 3 hrs. So stamina is a must for this course.If Tartari teaches it, be prepared for a very thorough fast paced course where a lot of concepts are covered in depth.",
    "While this course was a TON of work, I thought it was completely worth it. Not only do you learn practical and applicable topics (which is kind of rare at Yale), but you also get to read through and attempt to understand actual econometrics' papers. While it IS a very difficult class, it is by no means not doable.",
    "First half is mostly statistics (linear models). Moves on to other statistics topics, then finally we read journal articles that show how econometric methods are applied. If you are interested in the statistical aspect of economics, you should take this course instead of ECON 131\/132.",
    "Wayyyy too much work, tartari is a bit unreasonable. But you do learn a lot",
    "This class is HARD. Everyone is an Econ\/Math major or applied math so you have to tough it out - most likely this review doesnt matter very much, and many don't make it out alive. I was one of maybe 2 who didn't have prior experience with STATA, so that was a nightmare (it's on the psets and midterm but not final). The psets and exams are long and hard, this is in no way Econ 131 or132. However, Tartari is a good professor and cares, she's not out to screw you over. There are some people in the class that are obviously overqualified, but don't let that discourage you.",
    "Econometrics 136 is the following: VERY HARD, AN ENORMOUS WORKLOAD, CHALLENGING, FAIR, AND ENLIGHTENING. It gives you a great foundation to read economics papers, and also to understand linear models in all forms of statistics. This class is basically a linear models\/data analysis class from a theoretical perspective that only uses economics examples. No prior knowledge of economics needed -- not even intro micro\/macro, though those are obviously helpful, and intermediate micro would be even more helpful. There is A LOT of work, and at times an unfair amount of work and an unfair amount of knowledge to cover (in fact, it probably is unfair for students who aren't naturally a genius like me). But just work hard and youll do fine. Good luck.",
    "Material is VERY technical (even if some parts are practical), it gets boring after a certain point if you're not genuinely interested in econometrics. On the other hand, grading is very lenient (very generous partial credit) and there's no reason somebody would not get an A if they do their psets and solve the practice exams the professor posts before the midterm and final. (Hint: she brings all her questions from the practice exams she posts) I'd imagine that if the questions weren't same as the practice exams, grades would be MUCH lower. Due to the difficulty of the material and the questions on the exams, if those questions were unseen grades would be catastrophic.",
    "I recommend this course to not only Economics& Mathematics students, but also to anyone who is willing to put in the effort but desires to really grasp Econometrics. At the end of the course, I feel I can actually read and understand economics papers, and I think this is a fundamental asset for anyone interested in the discipline.Be prepared for a lot of work though: even if grade segments are fairly distributed, there's still an incredible amount of homework and other assignments to do.",
    "This is an excellent course in introductory econometrics. However, it is much more difficult if you don't have certain prerequisites. Calculus and basic statistics are essential, and linear algebra is extremely helpful as well. If you don't have these it can be hard to keep up.",
    "Yes, you learn the material much more fully (and in a more interesting way) then in the 131-132 track. Taking 135 can be a bit painful, but it's worth it once you get to 136. You feel after taking this course that you can actually read the papers economists write for other economists--and understand not just their results (or even the commands they typed into STATA), but how their methodology worked and why they did what they did. This class deserves and requires a lot of work.",
    "Definitely take it!!!.... if this is the only course you plan to take for the semester. The class is definitely challenging. It's a lot of work (like, ridiculous amounts for one class)--during reading week, we had at once a final report, discussion presentation, a final presentation, and two psets due. Few of our psets were 10+ pages by themselves, and required reading\/understanding\/deconstructing journal articles that were often 20+ pages. Only take if you must, or if you're REALLY interested in the material.Prof. Tartari is very helpful, though and she really cares and tries her best, especially if you go to her office hours. What I liked about this course versus ECON 132 is that this class goes in depth on the theory behind the models and the math, so that you're not getting a shallow knowledge of \"econometrics\" where you just plug and chug into models. You really understand why certain models work for certain datasets, and it gives you the ability to read peer-reviewed econometrics journal articles and actually understand what's going on.But I want to remind you that it is SO MUCH WORK. Our final exam review packet, though very grateful that we had one, was 70 pages, plus five journal articles of which we were supposed to have a thorough understanding (total of ~120 pgs).TLDR: Really difficult but the material's rewarding. Don't choose just based on the lenient grading curve because it won't really matter.",
    "recommend to a student seeking to do econometric analysis for their own research.",
    "Definitely take this course with Tartari! Although it is a hard course,you will learn a lot and it definitely worths the effort. Prof Tartari is always very helpful, posts class material online in a very timely manner, and prepares great exam review exercises which are the absolute best ways to study for the exams. Although this class is a little difficult, it will be very helpful for your studies later- certainly a class that I was so happy to take at Yale!",
    "It's complicated. I'd say don't take it if you don't have to. I don't know how useful the material would be to you if you're not going to amathily rigorous field. But do take it if you're going to graduate school in Economics, or if you'll do something mathy later. It's far away from a gut, but it's doable.",
    "Econometrics is difficult but extremely worthwhile. It was my favorite course this semester. Professor Tartari teaches extremely well, is extremely thorough and clearly cares for her students. She works so hard for this class and it clearly shows. The concepts taught in this class will amaze you. They are so beautiful and sometimes seem almost magical. By the end of this class, you will be able to read research papers in economics and you will recognize how amazing economics is as a subject of study. This course is truly inspirational."
