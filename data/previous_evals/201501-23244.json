    "Spanish L2 is a hard course, and very dependent upon your instructor. Thankfully Jose Simonet was a wonderful instructor who made the course manageable and enjoyable. But be sure to do your homework on the instructors beforehand, as it goes a long way. The course is much harder and faster than L1, so be warned. With that said, the nightly homework load (usually 30 minutes, but on weekends closer to 90 minutes) wasn't terrible, especially if you find yourself good at the language.",
    "If you want to continue towards your language credit, take the class...",
    "Definitely more intensive than SPAN 110, but still manageable work. If you have the option, take it with Jose!",
    "This is a pretty basic textbook-heavy run of the mill Spanish class. The advantages are that it meets every day, so you get consistent practice, but the class itself isn't particularly interesting, inventive, or inspiring.",
    "It's pretty difficult, with a lot of busy work. But you will learn lot of spanish. Just don't think it will be easy at all.",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, take it! L2 is a decent amount of work. I took this because I'm Hispanic and never learned the language. L1 was a breeze but they have exams in some form or another almost every week. But now I can have basic conversations with native Spanish speakers and tell employers I can communicate decently. So if you have to do a language requirement, it's a good way to do it (way easier than the French department from personal experience) and if you actually want to learn Spanish seriously jump on this.",
    "Spanish 120 is the next course in the Spanish track and builds extensively on the skills learned in Spanish 110. However, the work required increases exponentially, and this course demands much more time than 110, so be prepared. Even so, it does a comprehensive job of teaching Spanish, and involved much more hands on and engaging projects and activities."
