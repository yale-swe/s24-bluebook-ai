    "I would recommend it as it is necessary to know relevant ethics codes and legal statutes. After taking this class, it made a lot of sense to me why this is an APA recommended class. Although I'm not sure there is enough material to take up a whole semester of class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in clinical psychology, but it is actually really helpful when the course is restricted to those of us for whom the class is actually required. Additional students with different levels of experience or different goals can lead discussions in directions that feel less useful.",
    "yes, definitely. It allows students to grapple with some really important and relevant ethical issues that will undoubtedly come up in clinical practice and in academic research."

    "I think this course directly related to our clinical work, but was not entirely relevant to my research, other than how to handle potential suicidality. However, I think that this course did contribute to my understanding of how ethical issues can be difficult to resolve.",
    "To practice psychotherapy, I will definitely need a good understanding of the code of ethics under which I should be operating, so this course was invaluable.",
    "I have a deeper more developed insight into ethical issues that I didn't have before taking the course. This course provided an ethical framework to avoid ethical pitfalls and offered helpful approaches to find solutions to ethical dilemmas in clinical practice and research.",
