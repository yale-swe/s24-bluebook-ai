    "Jay is a very clear lecturer and did an excellent job crafting the topics of lectures and teaching. Some of the homework questions near the end of the course seemed to be more busy-work and it would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on\/expectations for the term paper.",
    "The regular homework assignments of this course were interesting and provided an excellent personal assessment of my understanding of the material."

    "Yes. This course was a really applicable to geology and much more relevant than other general classes in thermodynamics would have been.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in processes that form and deform igneous and metamorphic rocks. These topics are vital to understanding the 'why' of metamorphism."
