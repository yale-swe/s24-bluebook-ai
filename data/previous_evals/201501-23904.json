    "This class was very challenging for me. I was permitted to take this class even though I was nominally a \"first year\" student. I was glad for the flexibility that the Sound Dept. showed in allowing me to take the class as I learned a great deal. All of the assignments pushed me greatly which is what I wanted.",

    "My knowledge of the technology required caused some issues as I used multiple software systems to solve issues and was a bit less familiar than my colleagues with some of the software that might have been helpful. This was not a fault of the class but rather was my own shortcoming.",
    "For me, the main issue was, for projects that needed studio access, it was really hard to find time that the studio wasn't booked. It was pretty impossible to get there most of the time."

    "Small group is better because we can discuss more.",
    "David's teaching method is excellent. Each class reviewed and critiqued the project or assignment of each student. There was plenty of time for comment and critique. He then had handouts for each assignments and discussed not only the background of the assignment but the expectations for completion of the assignment. This approach was very complete and a good model for others.",
