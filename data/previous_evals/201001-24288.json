    "This is the 2nd semester of 130 Chinese. it's good preparation if you are planning to go to China on a Light, which a lot of people are. The written tests are all earlier in the semester, and an emphasis is placed on a skit that occurs at the end of the semester even though it's only worth about 3 percent of your grade. The texts are not too difficult, and if you've taken 130, you might as well continue.",
    "If you have already made it this far in your Chinese language education, then onward march. Everything gets a lot easier as the year progresses. It is the same routine as Chinese 130 but the teachers relax a bit and I found the environment to be more supportive. If you have the option to continue with Chinese, even if first semester leaves you discouraged, I highly recommend it.",
    "It is a great class to build your Chinese skills. It gets rather repetitive at the end, but it certainly continues to make your Chinese better.",
    "If you've taken one week of Chinese 130 or Chinese 140 then you know exactly how the rest of the year is going to go. I would recommend it only to someone who is truly committed to the language and has great patience.",
    "My speaking, listening, reading and writing ability improved. It would definitely recommend it. It's a lot of work, but it's manageable.",
    "Chinese 140 is an intermediate Chinese course. You meet everyday, and always have some form of homework due whether it be a listening exercise, written essay, dictation, etc. As a result, you must constantly review what has been learned the day before and always come prepared to class. I would absolutely recommend Chinese 140 for another student who wants to improve both in writing and in speaking\/listening. However, be aware, that you do need to work hard in this class and cannot get by merely \"coasting.\"",
    "Same as chns130. I found that I had gotten so used to the rhythm of the course that I could complete the assignments without learning much Chinese... It's a good course but watch out for that.....",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. By the time you finish, you will not only be able to have real conversations with native Chinese speakers, but you will also be excited about furthering your Chinese studies in L5 next year.",
    "Coming back from PKU I really wanted to jump to 150, but that is only offered in the fall. As a result I knew a lot more about some things but a lot less about some others, so it was a recipe for trouble at times! As always, this is Chinese, so you should know what to expect if you have taken it before - things are a little less time-intensive in class. Classes are often 'call and response' - anyway, just be prepared for a big grind and learning of more Chinese.",
    "It is the continuation of CHNS 130 and David and Helen's Adventures in China. I would definitely recommend the course (continue taking Chinese!) to another student.",
    "yes. If a Yalie is interested in learning Mandarin, this is the way to go. A strong course and a positive experience.",
    "Depends... its not very intensive",
    "It is a good class, you don't really have a choice though at L4 level. I feel like my Chinese has improved significantly, but honestly, class is not that fun or engaging..and it wasn't that challenging either. Should try to skip out the year by Light. But teachers are all very great!",
    "Great class- take it!!",
    "Absolutely take Chinese! The instructors are wonderful, the TAs are wonderful, and thecourse is structured well. Chinese is a hard language and accordingly the class is demanding, but it makes learning Chinese not only manageable, but fun. The textbook for L3 L4 is pretty fun as far as textbooks go. Although you will have Chinese homework every night, it ends up actually making the course easier because you cannot really fall behind.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this. Don't just stop at 130. 140 is not much different from 130. For Chinese, basically you get what you put in. So if you're willing to do about an hour or two of work a day to get a great grade, then I'd say do it!",
    "It is similar to Chinese 130 but the tests are harder. If you want to continue Chinese to 150 level, you should keep it up.",
    "Working from David and Helen in China is basically the course. If you can work through it, you might be able to teach yourself.Take it for credit or for futurecareer ambitions, otherwise, it's not worth the B."
