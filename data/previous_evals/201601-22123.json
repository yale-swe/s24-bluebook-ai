   "comments": [
    "Take this course! It's a cogent synthesis of psychoanalysis, visual studies, and important theorizing on race",
    "A survey of several key psychoanalytic concepts and an exploration of how these concepts might be deployed in anti-racist, anti-heteronormative, feminist, etc. critiques of art, produced predominantly by artists of color. A must-take for anybody interested in the intersections of psychoanalysis, race, gender, and sexuality studies.",
    "This course is highly recommended across the board.",
    "The course is an application of psychoanalysis to questions of race and identity expression in visual art, with a focus on artists of colorFanon's Black Skin White Masks is a central text throughout the course, and the course draws on the critical texts in the field of psychoanalysis as well as recent innovations. It is not necessarily meant to \"convert\" you, per seProfessor Mercer is especially interested in questioning whether the strategies of psychoanalysis hold up over time, and looking at some of the recent scholarship and media that has been influenced by those strategies. I would recommend this course to any graduate student who is interested in questions of race, identity, sexuality, and a broad range of aesthetic expression.",
    "I would definitely recommend HSAR 790 to another student and in fact think it ought to be a required class for all History of Art students."

   "comments": [
    "This course added critical depth to me understanding of psychoanalysis' role in race studies, which I think is a dimension sorely lacking from other courses at Yale that use psychoanalysis.",
    "This course really helped me get comfortable with reading critical psychoanalytical theory and gave me many texts to consider engaging with in my discipline. I especially appreciate how the course syllabus traced out developments in psychoanalysis across time, which especially helped me understand the discourse at large. I feel that I will certainly be revisiting many of these texts in my research and exams. I feel as though I have a very useful kit to begin using when thinking about race, identification and visual representation.",
    "Reevaluating psychoanalytic theory--which I had imagined as a narrow and biased theoretical framework--and asking what it can add to our discussion of contemporary African and black diaspora artists is not only a novel way of examining art, it invests familiar ideas with an exciting agility. The course didn't attempt to resuscitate an aging concept, rather it asked us to engage differently, which is something I hope my own work will be able to do.",
    "This course contextualized art and history in terms of race and how racism functions and will now allow me to approach all of my work and thinking from a place that takes this into account"
