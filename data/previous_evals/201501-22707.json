   "comments": [
    "Take it, if you want to know which area of science you are interested in. As someone with very little background in science, this class definitely helped me learn what I was interested in. I really appreciate the curriculum and the relaxing atmosphere of this class because I was too intimidated to jump right into an Intro science course that I have no knowledge in. Also, this class tends to be very supportive and non-competitive. Take it if you want to explore various topics of science! It's really relevant to your everyday life as well :) If you work diligently (which is not hard at all), it's really easy to get attention from visiting professors (who are the authorities in their field) and possibly ask for an internship or a research or lab visit opportunity.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR YOU. THIS IS THE BEST COURSE ON CAMPUS AND YOU WILL NEVER EVER HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE EVER AGAIN.",
    "Take it, so much fun. Unless you know all of science this is a mindblowing course that doesn't get too technical but still reveals super interesting facts about our world. Take it if you're a bio major or if you're a literature major. Except it's for freshman so you don't really have a major yet. Just take it.",
    "You spend the whole year learning about a lot of different and very interesting topics.",
    "SCIE 031 is an overview of few specific topics in science. It will give you an interesting perspective on many contemporary scientific and even moral and political issues. The classes covers topics ranging from geoengineering to dark energy to cloning. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was my favorite class of the year. It felt that in this class the primary concern really was learning and not just getting the grade.",
    "I recommend this course. Just trust me. Shop the course, look at the syllabus, and know that at the end of the year, you'll be glad that you took this course. That is all!",
    "SCIE 031 is a class that should be taken by every non-science major. It will introduce you to many relevant and applicable areas of science that you have no working knowledge and almost certainly did not study in high school."
