   "comments": [
    "I would recommend 559 if the student has great interest in independent research",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend it because it didn't add a lot of value to my time here at Yale. I expected it to help me write my final paper, be more oriented towards making me ready for a job.",
    "If you've taken ECON 558, take this class. The panel data topics covered are an incredibly useful addition to the skill set of anyone interested in pursuing quantitative research in the social sciences.",
    "Learn a lot if you put the effort in",
    "Is helpful",
    "For most of us this was a required course- for the others that took it, I think a lot was learned",
    "I would say that it is worth taking if you have a research project you'd like to pursue.",
    "Yes. This course is useful in developing fundamental skills in econometrics.",
    "Excellent graduate course in econometrics, teaches you the theoretical background for the main tools in modern econometrics, and the paper requirement gives you the opportunity to apply that knowledge to your own research interests.",
    "Yes if they are interested in econometrics.",
    "If you're a maths and metrics natural, you should take this course - you'll get a lot out of it and become a more sensible and well-rounded economist as a result. But if that's not your natural skillset, you may struggle.",
    "Would not recommend ECON 559 to another student. ECON 558 is more than sufficient (even though it should be taught at a faster pace and cover a lot more basic econometric concepts). ECON 559 should be scrapped and allow IDE students to take more electives - classes that would be more beneficial and which students would be more passionate in."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The research paper requirement deepened my knowledge about the profession a great deal. It was the best possible introduction to the life of a PhD economics student.",
    "The course didn't particularly help me in wiring my paper. While our TA made efforts to give us practical knowledge in the sections the lectures didn't seem planned and structured enough to meet the needs of the IDE students.",
    "This course has definitively changed the way I approach research. I'm sure that, even in the future, when I think of the most significant quantitative methods training I've had, this will be the course I think of.",
    "The course provided me with a detailed understanding of econometric issues that helped with my project and will likely serve me well in later applied work.",
    "I learned a lot in this class.",
    "To some extent it helped with the research paper (more so access to the TA). It won't help with my future job.",
    "I think it was very helpful to get a sense of the different research techniques used in the field.",
    "Very helpful",
    "This was one of the most important courses I took at Yale. It taught me how to conduct credible research which will be of great importance to my future career and academic ambitions. A great complement to all of the other courses I took at Yale also.",
    "Definitely helpful for context\/familiarity. Psets would have helped reinforce concepts and some opportunity to use the methods with Stata practice would also have been helpful",
    "Made me far more sceptical of empirical work but at the same time appreciate the importance of doing it accurately whilst emphasising the caveats.",
    "It's deepened my knowledge in some areas, but not as many as I would have liked, partly because of my own limitations.",
    "Did not help deepen my knowledge. Course is not relevant to my profession because it was too technical and theoretical."
