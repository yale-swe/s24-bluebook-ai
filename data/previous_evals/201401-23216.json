   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to any fellow student who was interested in gaining further knowledge in the traditions of Asian hagiography.",
    "This course provides a critical lens for reading \"sacred biography\", that is, texts that have been written about and by religiously affiliated and often seminal figures in their traditions. We compared texts from different traditions and scholarship related to them, especial the Christian hagiography and Buddhist auto\/biography. We had the opportunity to discuss how a tradition constructs itself, and how a particular figure might construct him or herself, using narrative. We engaged in textual analysis, critical how a text is constructed - it's sources, it's production, and it's potential reception. I would heartily recommend this course to anyone who would like to get a deeper understand of how to read and understand literature in religious studies.",
    "Biography in Asian Religions is about the construction and development of biographical\/hagiographical texts over time. It is a rich and deeply complex subject that can determine much of the way that people view themselves and behave in the world. This is a hugely engaging class, a unique opportunity at Yale or anywhere, and I would recommend it very highly"

   "comments": [
    "This course has been particularly useful to me as it introduced me to literature and a topic area with which I was not overly familiar.",
    "I was able to explore a new literary genre that is directly related to the religious world view. It brought into focus a great deal of the work I've done over the course of the program and made me realize how important it is to focus on the literature for what it is.",
    "I am in the MAR concentrated program in Asian Religions, which is through the Divinity School but is a joint effort with the Religious Studies Department. I found this to be essential to understanding how modern critical scholarship engaged with religious texts. We read the work of cutting-edge academics and also contextualized within the history of such scholarship. The source texts were also genre-making for my own interest, Buddhism. I am sure that what we covered in this course will provide a good foundation for future PhD work.",
    "I suspect that this field of study will factor centrally into my research going forward. The tools and knowledge that this course afforded me was invaluable. The material that I read and the perspectives that I learned to bring to it were major innovations in my own thinking. I feel my work in the future will be greatly indebted to this experience."
