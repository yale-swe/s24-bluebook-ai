    "Take only if he re-arranges the course where each week student presentations are not 90% of class time spent reviewing readings. The readings are super interesting and the class would be great if it were actually a seminar where most of the time spent was discussion based. However, the student presentations are the vast majority of the class time and just review the readings in such a way where it is a complete waste of time if you have done those readings.",
    "I would not. Unless, you are interested in social science and research methodology. You will learn very little, besides from what you can already intuit, about what drives political violence. Class discussions are borderline nonexistent, and it certainly was not worth doing the reading."
