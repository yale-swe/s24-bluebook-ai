    "This course forced me to interact with the New Haven community and with great results. I learned that people are much kinder and more willing to let you into their lives than one would think. I think that this is a great way to engage with New Haven, learn about yourself, and learn a bit about camera angles and the work that goes into good ethnography.",
    "Take this class!! It's small, which makes it awesome and is taught as a seminar. You truly get to know your fellow classmates on a deeper level because you get to chose your lab subjects and your final media project. So you discover what is important to each of them and yourself as the semester continues. The class starts a bit slow, with not a lot of effort from you prior to each meeting. But labs take forever (especially the radio show clip!). And you will spend hours hunched over your computer editing film and cursing yourself for missed shots. It all pays off though, I swear. Karen is a great professor who doesn't take everything so seriously, she is down to earth and always willing to talk out an issue that you think is developing within your project. Her enthusiasm on the topics only add to her in-depth knowledge. The homework each week (discount the readings) is a documentary. Seriously, if you can: TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Very chill course with a very big time crunch towards the end of the semester. The final project is very lax in theory (Karen lets you do almost any type of media project on almost any subject of your choosing), but people without a filmmaking background often underestimate how long it actually takes to shoot footage, sort through it, and piece it together into a coherent story. Because the course doesn't really teach how to make films, the end projects are usually pretty rough, but the expectations are also not very high. Would recommend if you have a lot of time and interest in making ethnographic films, but not otherwise.",
    "In summation this course was a great experience that taught me a lot about the film making and general ethnographic experience. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to take an entertaining class or to people who want to improve their film making skills. It was incredibly fun and rewarding and I wish I could take it again and do another project.",
    "An awesome practical course! Ethnographic filmmaking heavily emphasizes the final project, a short film, throughout the semester. Although it may seem daunting, Professor Nakamura is extremely helpful and the small assignments throughout the semester help prepare you for the final project. This was my first film and I had a great time making it. I now feel more comfortable using audio equipment and conducting interviews. The editing process was a learning process, but one I am really glad I went through! A chill class, but make sure to get started on your final project before the end of the semester!"
