    "Very fun, informative course! It was very enjoyable.",
    "I wish the class was more structured around grammar, and learning to speak using different grammatical forms. Even though there were lots of advanced learners in the class, I think we would have all found it helpful. Loved the friendly atmosphere of the class - looked forward to coming each day.",
    "It was difficult to learn the vocab before reading our lesson materials because vocab, especially highly specialized vocab, has nuances for specific usage, which we would not know until we knew the context for the lessons. That was one weakness. Another weakness was disorganization, though it was never bad. I wish schedules would be finalized on a specific day (Sat, Sun, etc) so we would know when to check in order to plan our week accordingly. Knowing an assignment two days before its due date made it difficult to balance course workload with my other courses. A strength was the intimacy with our class and our professor, which became stronger as we worked on group projects and had lunches together throughout the semester."
