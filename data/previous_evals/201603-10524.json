   "comments": [
    "Understanding randomized algorithms and various analysis techniques.",
    "I learned lots of applied probability and how to use randomness to make algorithms work much faster and more reliably in the face of an adversary.",
    "A lot of randomized algorithms! We mostly learned about concentration bounds, random walks, martingales, coupling, sampling, probabilistic method, etc.",
    "I was able to get a survey of what circumstances\/contexts in computer science are places where randomness is a relevant concept to be considering. I saw examples of randomized algorithms and learned a lot about the mathematical tools used for evaluating\/analyzing randomized algorithms.",
    "You learn many approaches to analyzing randomized algorithms, with most of the semester focusing on probability bounds on polynomial-time algorithms. Not as much about coming up with algorithms yourself, which was a bit disappointing for me. I found the probability bound to be a bit dry and too mathematical.",
    "Decent understanding of how randomized algorithms work and their applicability to various types of problems.",
    "I got much better at statistics, stochastic processes, and algorithm analysis",
    "Sigh. What a disappointment. In many ways, this course is the epitome of Yale CS: the material is fascinating, as the various algorithms and approaches are so cool (probabilistic method, Markov Chains, lots of analysis of expected runtime, etc). Q: How could you possibly make that material boring? A: Yale CS. I'm sorry, but it's true. Aspnes is not the worst offender, nor are the problem sets as incongruous as in other courses. But at the end of the day, it's still a bad class. The lectures are the same exact thing every time: Aspnes stumbles into class 3 minutes late, asks the class if there are any \"questions from last time\" (there never are), then launches into his lecture. And the lectures just aren't great. He just reads from the online lecture notes. The only difference is his occasional drawing (which are hilarious, I'll give him that) and the usual mathematical error (expect him to forget how to prove a theorem at least once a week). And that's it. No questions, videos, activities, slides, ANYTHING that asks for genuine engagement in lecture. It's just bad teaching. The problem sets are fine, albeit pretty tricky. Aspnes responds to emails lightning fast, which is nice. The exam was not terrible but still stressful after a class that did its best to keep you from authentically engaging with the material.",
    "Great material, ok lectures, tough course, take as Credit D."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: Hard to follow the lectures. Strength: Useful material",
    "Great set of notes but lectures are hard to follow and I stopped going. Really a course on concentration bounds that was less interesting than I thought",
    "Problem sets and exams are relatively short (but hard), which I would say is a strength. They really require an understanding of the material. Notes for the class are really good.",
    "Strengths: Super interesting materials; some of the algorithms and analysis you learn will be pretty recent, close to the most recent research progress. Prof Aspnes' notes are great - i didn't need to read the textbook and was studying based on his notes. Some of his explanations are really helpful with the intuitive understanding. Weakness\/Room for improvement: Sometimes Professor Aspnes was confused by the algebra in class and everybody was confused too. A lot of class time was spent on algebra\/derivation (which he was confused about), so some people stopped attending lectures after a few classes. Homework takes time because they are interesting and challenging, but having once every 2 weeks, in my opinion, is not enough to motivate students to constantly put effort into the course. The problems however are very interesting and not impossible (usually an application of an algorithm\/idea from the class). The class also assumes quite a bit of background on probability, stochastic processes, linear algebra, etc. If you know about the stuff\/have heard of the stuff before (e.g. martingales), then you'll do fine. Otherwise you might be confused.",
    "You don't have to go to class; the notes are online and are excellent.",
    "Overall, material itself is a strength - there are a lot of surprising ideas and novel approaches to thinking about problems. Aspnes' teaching is OK. I think he certainly cares about being a good teacher, is not intimidating, and shows his human side. He is pretty good at explaining a concept in general but does not always give the most illuminating or easy to follow examples. Some of this may be related to him often trying to \"improvise\" a solution to a problem mid-lecture. The homework assignments are a strength. While sometimes Aspnes has not fully considered a particular detail and the resulting problem can be much harder, they overall are a good test for whether you have a basic understanding of the class material. Since the material is interesting, the problems are interesting. 6 problem sets, averaging maybe 8-10 hours each. Final exam is fair. I think lecture could be improved with a more definite, stated commitment to a particular level of mathematical rigor. As a math major, I appreciated the occasional forays into measure-theoretic world, but not sure how well it fit with the sorts of problems we actually considered. I would be fine with there being either more or less rigor, just think it should be consistent and explicitly noted.",
    "Professor Aspnes is very good at coming up with interesting homework problems to challenge students, and his textbook is a great synopsis of the course. I thought the grading for the course (particularly how it is curved) were too arbitrary.",
    "Classes are very fast paced and it might be helpful to slow down slightly.",
    "Well, to start, Aspnes could learn how to teach. Not even joking -- there are myriad ways to improve the instruction in this class.",
    "Strengths: Online lecture notes are generally very good, pragmatic approach to inequalities and proof techniques (spend more time learning to use the math than proving the math, which is cool) Weaknesses: This course flies through a ton of topics, which is something of a double edged sword: I liked it because it showed me practical applications of things I had seen before (in stochastic processes or discrete math), but I think it would have been incredibly difficult if this was the first time I had seen these topics."

   "comments": [
    "Only if you need a CS elective.",
    "No, it's boring, you won't want to go and probably won't get that much out of it. The notes he produces are really good but he just lectures straight from them. Find a group to work with if you do take but its really not worth it.",
    "Would recommend to all CS majors who want more algo theory. The material is interesting. Aspnes is a funny lecturer, and the online notes are great, but when he tries to go off-notes he confuses himself. Problem sets are short but really hard, just because material can be confusing. Exam is relatively easy.",
    "Yes. Absolutely (because I like algorithms). Tips: Having a study group will help. I got through CPSC 365 with Dan Spielman without a study group because the class was more or less an intro to algorithms, but some of the analysis in this class is more sophisticated, so you should start making friends from the beginning. Also Prof Aspnes doesn't really give hints for his problems, so good luck if you don't figure it out >\".",
    "It's a pretty solid computer science elective if you're not too scared of theory. If you like probability theory, this class has some cool applications.",
    "You have to be a really math-oriented person to take this. A majority of the class is proving inequalities about probability bounds, which I found the math majors were much better at than the CS majors. So you'll probably like it if you're either one of those math majors who takes a bunch of CS classes, or a CS major with a strong math background.",
    "Yes, if you have a very strong math and CS background.",
    "Yes! Absolutely, yes! This course is incredible and Prof Aspnes' unique insights and perspective are invaluable. Take this if you are a computer science student who enjoys (practical, even!) theory or a math\/stats person.",
    "Solid course. Problem sets similar to CPSC 365 but harder. Lectures could be a little rambling at times, but the material is very useful. Watch out for the grading distribution though!",
    "Here's the takeaway: if you can deal with boring lectures and teachers who don't ask much, go for it. If you want more out of your experience, don't major in CS at Yale.",
    "Randomized was a good survey of some cool applications of probability stuff covered in other classes. I'm happy I took it as a senior, because I think taking it before taking stochastic processes or having a decent grasp of probability would have been more difficult and potentially frustrating, but it's pretty common to take it after algorithms so you'd probably be fine. Keep in mind that the work in this class often feels more like an exercise in applied probability than a super practical algorithms course (more often \"show happens with a given probability\" than \"invent a polynominal time algorithm for \"), which was really cool in my opinion but might bother someone expecting it to be algorithms part II or not so excited about probability. Psets aren't can be tricky but usually aren't too much work, as they're due once every two weeks. The final wasn't too bad, but was pretty different from past finals, so be careful."
