   "comments": [
    "Noise is an excellent freshman seminar - the work is light and the reading is interesting. Although the course focuses on avant-garde music, it's very much possible to explore whatever you find interesting in music and aurality. I strongly suggest this class as a highly worthwhile, yet easy course that introduces you gently to work at yale.",
    "Easy WR. Take it to learn about something you'd have never thought about before.",
    "This class is really just a study of the music and theologies of twentieth-century avant-garde noise composers (yes, they exist). Class involved lots of readings of the writings of these composers, and discussions about the readings, with (very) occasional short writing assignments (plus a substantial final paper).I probably wouldn't recommend this to another student unless the student knows that this is what they're interested in and is very motivated to read all of the (very long, VERY thick) readings. There are some redeeming aspects to the course, though--hands-on projects, talking to a real contemporary noise composer, discussion of soundscapes, etc. But for the most part discussions were just tiring (the class is pretty long) and professor-dominated because students had trouble interpreting the readings.",
    "Yes every musician or person interested in society, sociology or art should take it.",
    "Really interesting - gives many different perspectives on noise and how society, technology, and music have changed because of the way noise was viewed. Good class.",
    "Take this class if you're ready to go a little outside the box in terms of music. You'll be able to have smart-sounding conversations about static, muzak, and silence.",
    "\"Noise\" was an interesting course, although it slowed down in the middle. As this was the first year that it was taught, it will probably change a bit when taught for the second time.I would recommend this to students who already find the topic interesting, since they may get more out of the readings.",
    "If you are interested in contemporary and experimental music, I would absolutely recommend this course. It will allow you to think about music in so many different ways (i.e. economics, politics)."
