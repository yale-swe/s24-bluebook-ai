    "This was my first experience with a long form, solo research project. The skills are very different than those required by a seminar.",
    "Though the class itself is not much to speak about, the obvious value in writing a senior essay is a very singular experience at Yale. I absolutely improved as a writer and a researcher of literary work in the process, I finally figured out how to use Chicago style citation, and I put together a 30+ page senior essay. If you're an English major and have an idea for an original research topic, taking on this project will be a very valuable use of your time in your senior year. I wouldn't recommend stumbling into this course, however. You should really consider what you're writing about thoughtfully if you're going to devote a semester of your own time and your advisor's time to it."

    "It would have been interesting to have contact with the other students who were writing essays the same semester as I was. It's such solo work, and I would have loved to learn about the awesome projects that my peers were undertaking. It would have helped to give feedback to each other, to ask each other questions as we hit particular challenges throughout the process.",
    "The course itself would benefit from something like a weekly dinner chat for everyone who is working on a senior essay. (At the very least the students and maybe one advisor at any given week) The exchange of ideas would be very helpful in giving one another feedback on our continuing work. Otherwise, since I didn't really engage with ENGL490 itself, I can't comment on the strengths of the course. Writing a senior essay is its own reward."

    "I have also taken senior seminars in the English department, and I think those classes are wonderful and a great alternative to the senior essayit makes sense to me that the department doesn't require everyone to write an essay, since Im sure it can quickly become an unwanted burden for students and faculty (and produce some not-so-great essays) if you're not excited about the project. But all that being said, I think more people should write a senior essay! I am halfway through mine and have loved it thus far; its given me a more defined archival research agenda (I had a wonderful summer fellowship) and a stronger sense of my intellectual direction for graduate school applications, and there's nothing like reading and writing for a project of this scale. If you decide to do it, my advice would be to not feel you have to include everything that has ever interested you in your magnum opus; I think Ive realized at a certain point that my project couldn't be about all the things I've ever thought about and remain coherent and persuasive! You'll write other things, and it's totally fine to bracket some interests for a future project.",
    "If you are considering grad school, if you are interested in this type of project, if you have an idea that you're excited to write about, then I would absolutely recommend the senior essay. It was intensely challenging and rewarding, and a wonderful capstone experience to my time in the English Department.",
    "If you have an original research project in mind for the senior essay and have found a professor to advise you, definitely go on and take this class. I would caution those thinking about taking this lightly, as the senior essay is not a walk in the park. You'll find yourself scrambling to discover the documents you need to defend your argument while juggling the looming deadlines of as many as 15 pages at a time. This will be the most rewarding class you take at Yale, hands-down, if you put the time and effort into your essay."
