    "Yes, yes, and yes. Have I said it enough yet, let me tell you again, yes.Yes, take this course if you are interested in the region. Yes, take this course if the only thing you know about South Asia is Slumdog Millionaire. Yes, take this course if you come from the region.You will learn a lot about all the South Asian countries. You will learn a lot about social issues facing the world. And you will learn a lot about anthropology. You will think about society differently and you will learn how to analyse and think about the lives we live.The readings are the best thing ever! They are engaging and you will find that you are awake at 2am wanting to read even more. What elsedo you want from a course?Your class will most likely be a seminar. You will get to know the professor. She is amazing!. You will have people in your class who are from the region and can themselves be valuable resources. And you will have people who are not from the region and provide an interesting insight into the region.The final essay is daunting but you can pick whatever topic you want about South Asia.Take this course if you are willing to learn about one of the most diverse, politically unstable, economically rising, corrupt, and beautiful regions of the world!",
    "Fantastic course that everyone should take. It is great for all backgrounds. You'll learn a ton, the readings, assignments, and discussion are all enjoyable. Prof. Shneiderman is relatively new but a rising star at Yale. She'll quickly become one of those professors everyone wants to take a class with.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to any student. It requires a lot of reading and quite some writing, but it is extremely rewarding and well balanced. It engages the students with a variety of issues concerning South Asia and Anthropology without losing depth of those studies - reading specific texts and ethnographies is extremely helpful and fascinating. An amazing course!",
    "ANTH 276 is a great course for students who want to learn about South Asian social issues. We had three response papers, a take-home midterm (more like a paper than an exam) and a final paper with presentation. Because the class starts at 9am, there were only 6 people taking the course. This allowed us to discuss social issues in detail. Even as a science major, I enjoyed the course!",
    "I definitely recommend this seminar! It is essentially a broad introduction to the anthropology of South Asia, covering at varying degrees all the countries of the region (including Bhutan and Nepal, which is the professor's country of expertise) and also themes including gender, caste, religion, class, and others. However, it is a survey course, so you definitely don't need prior experience in anthropology, sociology, or anything similar. Though the class has a fair amount of reading and writing (over 75-100 pages of reading a week, 3 short responses, a simple but long midterm, and a longer final paper), Prof. Shneiderman has chosen the topics and assignments carefully so that the work is interesting and relevant. Also, Prof. Shneiderman is great about inviting guest lecturers, showing films, including novels as readings, and even taking us out to an Indian restaurant to really engage us in the coursework! I think most students appreciated that she added some variety to the class. Prof. Shneiderman is also a great professor; she's friendly, accessible, and not a harsh grader, and discussions run smoothly because of her. Overall this is a great seminar, I totally recommend it!"
