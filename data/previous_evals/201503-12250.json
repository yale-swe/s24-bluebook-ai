    "A general overview of coastal African societies during the era of slave trade: focused on Africa not America at all.",
    "The tragedy of this course is that Prof. Harms is an amazing scholar and a caring professor, but the course does not provide him with an audience. The students seem to all take it for a pre-industrial, and since there's no evaluation of knowledge, no one is incentivized to do any of the work.",
    "An interesting course that analyzes the nature of slavery in Africa. It certainly changed my perception of the slave trade by showing to me the different forms of slavery took in Africa and the role that Africans played in the slave trade.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student with reservations. It's a manageable amount of work and Prof. Harms' is very knowledge and helpful. That said, your experience in the class is definitely a product of how much effort you put in, and at times the weekly readings could get a bit dry. This kind of history is very different than other subfields you may be experienced with... at times it's so oral history-heavy that it can feel like anthropology!",
    "If you are even remotely interested in understanding what happened in parts of West and Central Africa throughout the course of the slave trade, this is a great class! I would definitely recommend it."
