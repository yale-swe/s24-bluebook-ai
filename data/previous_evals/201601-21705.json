    "This is an amazing class, but with a fairly large, front loaded workload. I don't think about the world in the same way and I don't think about sleep in the same way.",
    "The class is fun, the material is interesting, Guy sure is a character, and you learn a few things about humanity, identity, and the role of science fiction in the world.",
    "A class mostly about analyzing texts and understanding gender identity, and human identity. Would recommend if you find these topics interesting, but if you are looking for a course generally about Science Fiction, you may want to pass.",
    "The topics of discussion weren't what I expected when I first signed up for this class, but the class was still entertaining and insightful.",
    "If you love scifi. Otherwise, don't bother. As a not-huge-fan-of-scifi, it was hard to motivate myself to read these works and to care. Prof Guy is hilarious and fun though. Also beware that there is a lot of reading, and the assignments are annoying even if they aren't too long.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this if you want to actually read about science fiction.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. I wasn't sure whether I would love the texts, and I can't say that I would choose to reread any of them, but Professor Guy is such a fantastic professor that it's worth it even if you think the syllabus is not your cup of tea. The work is structured in such a way that's impossible not to get anything out of it, and Professor Guy is very flexible about it. 10\/10 would recommend - if you have doubts, shop the first class and you'll get a good idea of what it's like.",
    "Yes take this class! Professor Guy is a really engaging lecturer and the reading list is pretty great.",
    "Take this class no matter what your major may be- it's amazing, the texts are wonderful, and the lectures are an actual joy to sit through.",
    "I have recommended it to everyone. Mostly because I want more people to talk about Neuromancer and Cloud Atlas with.",
    "Course material is fantastic. Alfred Guy is a great professor. The class is designed as a writing credit for sophomore English majors, so there will be a lot of writing involved (especially if you are a non-English major just interested in the subject matter). That being said, the class it definitely worth it.",
    "Science Fiction. Yup. If you like to read SciFi already, I would just like to confirm your excitement for this class. My favorite part of this class was the books we got to read. They were a little more focused on gender and sexuality than I expected, but I still really loved all of Professor Guy's choices. I wouldn't call this an easy A class. I personally had never experienced the kind of writing that the class required, but I loved it all the same. If you're looking for a Writing Credit where you actually learn about writing and read some awesome books, this is the class for you. That's all ignoring the fact that Professor Guy is an awesome lecturer. All the more reason to take this class if you can get in (mostly focused for sophomores, but I definitely knew juniors who got in). The work is about a novel a week (they weren't too long) and 5 papers (2 short and the other 3 ranging up to 8 pages).",
    "Sci-Fi was an okay course. I took this course because I needed a writing credit. Out of the 6 books we read, I would say 4 were very good and 2 were not. The readings are not too difficult to keep up with, and there is not an overbearing amount of writing. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed the course, but it definitely had its rough patches when we were trudging through the books that I did not like.",
    "Take it if you like science fiction for sure. Essays and section really open you up to new ideas more than you would think.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S SO GREAT. The lectures are energetic, interesting, and thought provoking. Sections are strong and the TA's all have different, probing styles that really help you get the most out of the material and also have a good time. Additionally, the course is very focused on writing, and pushes you hard to become a better writer, and to more adeptly tackle difficult and complicated prompts. I'm an engineering major, and I took it Cr\/D because I didn't need another WR, but the damn course was so good that I ended up working really hard on it and learning a ton anyway. The readings are quite good for the most part, and even those that I didn't like could be made interesting by Professor Guy. PROFESSOR GUY IS AWESOME. I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone in any major. It is especially a great mental break from STEM stuff, and reminds you that writing and reading is the best and can be super interesting and challenging.",
    "By far the best class I've taken at Yale. If you are remotely interested in science fiction, science, or fiction, you should take the class--especially if you are a science major. It will make you think of the interplay between science and real life",
    "This was a great course, but not exactly what I thought it would be. You spend a considerable amount of time (basically half of the course) discussing gender identity in the context of technology, which is super cool but not what you'd expect if you signed up to learn about robots and space travel. There are about 20-23 pages of papers total spread throughout the semester, which isn't a crazy amount to write, but you need to demonstrate a really deep understanding and a high level of thought about the books to get good grades on them (so yes, you do have to do most of if not all of the reading).",
    "You will not regret this course, although you may not know what you are getting yourself into. This course is not about aliens and space travel etc.. This course is about understanding human identity. The core idea is that science fiction allows us to explore what humanity is when anything can be changed.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course! The reading list for this course is fantastic, and even hardcore sci-fi buffs will find books they haven't read. Professor Guy is a great lecturer and is obviously really into the course material. I think the general demographic for the course is STEM majors looking for an easy course or a writing credit, which can make the sections frustrating if no one has done the reading (I was part of the problem, but I would have liked section to be a little more involved than it was). But overall it was a highly enjoyable class, would definitely recommend.",
    "It's fun, it's thoughtful, take it!",
    "Great class!!! The professor and TA's are great, lecture is fun to attend, the workload is manageable, and the science fiction pieces are really interesting and thought-provoking reads.",
    "Science Fiction and Identity is a phenomenal course that I think everyone should take at some point in their Yale career. The material is fascinating, the lectures are awe-inspiring, and it's one of those courses that makes you ask the big questions about what it means to live in the world and have a great time doing it.",
    "If you're taking this course just because you think science fiction sounds like fun reading material, you may not get what you're expecting. The course is also meant to be an intermediate english course, so there's also a fair amount of discussion regarding close reading and literary analysis, which I think takes away from the science fiction aspects. The lectures can sometimes feel kind of rushed and pointless.",
    "You read science fiction books and short stories covering a range of topics from gender to artificial intelligence. I would definitely recommend it. The assignments - 5 writing assignments varying from 500 to 2000 words in length - were quite manageable, and additionally, there was no final which was an added bonus.",
    "Alfred Guy lives up to the hype 100%. Great class, fantastic reading\/viewing list, wonderful TAs (Alfie knows how to pick 'em!). Lectures are broad, mostly consisting of Alfie riffing brilliantly on whatever interests him, while most of the in-depth discussion of the texts happens in discussion section. This class is not worth taking if you don't do the readings or go to section, but if you do both it's an amazing journey (I believe another student described it using some picture of rainbows and skittles). Only take Cr\/D if you'll go to section and do the readings but don't want to put effort into the papers.",
    "Do not take as an English major. You will be forced to recalibrate everything the rest of the department has taught you. And when you're not doing that, you'll have to sit through \"how to write an essay\" lectures once a week that insult your intelligence and writing skills. Great books, though. If not an English major, swing away, great class, if a little below college level.",
    "ENGL 132 is a course that uses science fiction literature and film to explore ideas of identity, especially gender identity. I would recommend this class to students that want a break from classic literature. I would not recommend this class to a fellow student if conversations about gender identity make them uncomfortable, or if they hold true to traditional values. This class does not tolerate anything but the most liberal ideas of identity and to contribute in section or lecture you would need to echo these ideas. It is an incredibly interesting class with a very fun syllabus.",
    "Absolutely recommend.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the world of science fiction. It helps you see that science fiction as a genre has been a blank slate of sorts for imagining other ways of being, and this applies equally to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and sexual identity.",
    "The course covers a large number of very interesting books. I learned a lot from section, and from just reading the books on my own. That said, I did not learn that much in the lectures, unfortunately. Professor Guy is an amazing person, and has a really terrific lecturing STYLE, but I felt as though the CONTENT of his lectures was rather lacking. We cover a ton of different things, and he clearly has a sense of what he wants to cover, but it felt as though we flitted lightly between a dozen different topics, with no particular relation between them or great meaning to any one of them. I unfortunately did not learn that much in the lectures, as much as I loved Professor Guy as a person, and loved the readings. I probably would only recommend it to another student if you are willing to get most of the meaning from the readings on your own, and don't expect to get it from the lectures themselves. People rave about the class as though it is god's gift to man, but I think they are getting confused by how great the man teaching it is, rather than considering what they actually learned from the class. It is also worth noting that the grading is rather difficult, such that several students and myself were unable to improve our grades at all from Bs over the course of the semester.",
    "Definitely would recommend to anyone who loves reading fiction and wants to read more books over a semester.",
    "This is not an English class. This is a Women and Gender Studies class masquerading as an English class. Prepare yourself to discuss race, class, and gender in every work. Some of the authors were chosen because of their race or gender, not because their work is particularly good. If you are interested in lesser known authors who use science fiction to explore themes of feminism and race, go ahead and take this class. If your interests lean more toward the old white male icons of sci fi like Isaac Asimov, Orson Scott Card, and Frank Herbert, be aware you won't be reading them or anyone remotely like them. That said, you still might enjoy this class. Professor Guy is an outstanding lecturer- he wins teaching awards for a reason. He gives the most sensitive and balanced discussion of feminism I've ever seen in a class. Like most liberal faculty he believes in the full equality of the sexes, but presents ideas in a way that doesn't blame or alienate people with more traditional views. And there is such a diverse offering of novels, short stories, and films covered in this class that you are sure to find a few you really love. Assigned topics for papers are really flexible, so you're guaranteed to be able to write on a topic you're passionate about.",
    "TAKE IT. Science fiction isn't about science, it's about projecting who we are and who we can be as a people. It's incredible! You will never regret it.",
    "Science Fiction has a lot of wonderful, interesting reading, but it is definitely not an easy WR! Totally worth taking if you want to have fun reading great books though!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student, and I hope that Alfred Guy continues to teach it. I like that the works we read gave a broader taste of science fiction works while still feeling like an intro course that hit many of the \"main\" works.",
    "Fun course, really fun reading. Be ready to talk about writing papers a lot in lecture, but otherwise, be ready to have your mind blown. I definitely appreciate SF more than I once did, and Cloud Atlas and DADES are stellar books.",
    "Okay, but nothing special. Read it if you love science fiction, don't if you don't--this class won't convert you.",
    "This was an extremely good course. The lectures are thought-provoking and very engaging, and incorporate participation from the students. The stories you read are incredible and absolutely worth your time. On the whole, they are fascinating and contain ideas that are challenging in both a moral and intellectual way. The assignments are not easy, but can be very rewarding if you put a lot of thought and effort into them, which is made easier by the quality and richness of the texts. The one reservation I have about recommending this class is due to its intensity. This was by far my most time-consuming class I took this semester. The readings, though enjoyable, are quite long (although I do not know how they compare to other literature courses). Furthermore, the essays require a lot of time and effort to do well. At times my work in other classes would suffer because of the volume of work that this class consistently demanded. Being both the most interesting and the most demanding course I took this semester, it often eclipsed all my other classes, which was not ideal. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic course that is definitely worth taking if you have the time. Even if you aren't especially interested in science fiction or gender studies, I definitely recommend this class, as it will most likely make you especially interested in both of these things.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if they are only interested in taking an english class, I would if they are interested in more of the cultural and political context around the 20th century and science fiction genre.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody at Yale, especially if interested in science fiction.",
    "Overall a very thought provoking and philosophical course, perfect for someone like me. It taught me to think less in terms of boundaries and more dialectically. However, it is sometimes too abstract without a sense of overall direction. My writing skills have seriously improved after taking this class!",
    "Prof Guy is an amazing lecturer and the readings are interesting although some of them are a bit difficult to get through. My section was a bit painfully awkward at times. The essays can be graded badly initially but you are graded for improvement. There are a lot of essays.",
    "A fun English class that focuses on Science Fiction as a genre and how it relates to today's world.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE!!! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Keep up with the reading and have your eyes opened.",
    "This is a standard English class, with a few papers and a great professor lecturing. The grading isn't too bad, but at least for myself there was a bit of a jump from the first writing assignment to the first paper that was hard to adjust to. The class overall was great, and the topics that we explored through the awesome books were really interesting, especially towards the end when we started getting into some of the more abstract books. Professor Guy is a great lecturer that really strengthens the readings of the novels and makes the class excellent, and the readings are for the most part very good, making this class a very good class. Grading is pretty standard among Yale classes and isn't too punishing for students, but isn't the easiest either.",
    "It's a lecture that covers a variety of science fiction texts, with a few films thrown in as well. It is a fantastic course that everyone should take -- highly recommend.",
    "Sci-fi is amazing, as you may have guessed from the subject matter. Professor Guy is outstanding both as a professor and a person. Don't expect the lecture to a summary of science fiction or anything like that--it is definitively geared towards the discussion of specific social\/philosophical topics through sci-fi. But it's always done in a really interesting and relatable way, so don't worry if that's not your specialty. I'm just a generalized geek who loves to read and talk about sci-fi, so this is tons of fun. Professor Guy definitely qualifies as One of Us, so it's a great time all around. Not a gut, but not particularly difficult if you do the reading and are willing to put at least some time into the papers.",
    "I highly, highly recommend that you take this course! Don't be intimidated if you aren't an English major, it's a great class to take for all majors. There is a lot of reading for the course, but I found it to be very enjoyable- it's not often that you get to relax and enjoy a science fiction novel for homework. Professor Guy is also a wonderful professor, and encourages a lot of class participation and engagement during the lectures.",
    "Science Fiction is a good course overall. Prof. Guy is awesome, and if you like SF, you'll probably find most of the materially really cool. The first half of the course focuses pretty heavily on sex\/gender identity and feminism (as in, 2\/3 of the critical readings, 2\/3 of the essays, and 3\/6 of the novels deal directly with the topic), which personally wasn't my cup of tea, so if that's a deal-breaker for you I'd look elsewhere. Whether or not you take this course, I'd recommend reading Neuromancer and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.",
    "Take this class and live forever. Proven fact.",
    "Great class if you love science fiction and want to explore both blockbuster and non-blockbuster works in the genre. Alfred Guy is an excellent lecturer. As a senior, I could tell that this class was made for underclassman because the lectures don't engage the material through close readings as upper level classes would. The workload is frontloaded."
