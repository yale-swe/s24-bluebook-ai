    "I learnt more about development and the politics of development; it was great to read deeply into the subject (starting from the extraordinary book by Ginzburg, through the momentous work by Ferguson, and also the incredibly thought-provoking articles by stalwarts such as Conklin, Li, Mosse and Professor Dove himself!). I would be happy to take this course again!",
    "The most important are the capability to do political ecology research and developing critical analysis on development program",
    "I learned a great deal of analytical and critical thinking skills as I had read many technical literature relating to environment and social systems, analyse and present a view on them. This really pushed me to think critically about the text, opinions and nuances in some technical terms on weekly basis. This was extremely helpful.",
    "In F+ES 520, I learned how to think about environmental issues from the perspective of political ecology.",
    "I learned a lot of the practice of Environmental social science, mostly concerning promising routes and possible mistakes",
    "Appreciation of new (or more in-depth, critical) perspectives on development Writing from an anthropological perspective Self-appraisal of role in previous development practice Greater appreciation and critique of the origins and continuation of relationships (promoted and veiled) between environmental problems, development practice, ruralscapes and poverty"

   "comments": [
    "Incredible faculty teaching the course, and an excellent reading list to go with it. My classmates were also great, and the joint presentation assignments were a lot of fun, and also provided an opportunity to build friendships with my co-students! On occasion, especially when full-length books were prescribed (such as Let Us Now Praise Famous Men), the reading load became a bit heavy, and almost undoable. I wonder if it may be useful to prioritise sections for such lengthy works when the reading time is limited to just a week.",
    "Strength: great reading materials, thought-provoking classes, great curriculum structure Improvement: the discussion session is more about a presentation about reading than discussion --which is at many times quite repetitive. I think it is better to trigger discussion session solely by throwing out question to the class than explaining commentators' understanding on the reading",
    "The readings for this course were interesting but I think the student presentations were not helpful for student learning. The reading responses were good for synthesizing readings, but presenting them often felt like unnecessarily repeating professor Dove's lectures. The student presentations often felt unstructured, tangential, and deadening and killed enthusiasm for discussion if there was any time at the end. It would have been much better if each presentation group had simply prepared discussion questions and had facilitated class discussions. I would have liked to see more time for the class to discuss material rather than being talked at for almost the entire three hours.",
    "The only downside of the course is that the duration of a class session was too long. I really like the student presentation sessions--where a group of students had to lead a class discussion on selected topics on three occasions during the semester. Writing of commentaries on the selected topics were also very useful, it reinforced understanding of concepts of the topics in question.",
    "I often engaged quite thoroughly with the assigned reading, which was often extensive, but felt as though there wasn't enough class time to think through the strengths, weaknesses, and ideas presented in the assigned texts as a class. We got to this at the end of class, but the period often ended right as the conversation became interesting. I loved professor Dove's lectures, but I often wished they were balanced more evenly with discussion time. I'm not sure the role of weekly discussants always helped spur the conversation, though that role certainly was incredibly productive and thought provoking for the designated discussants that week.",
    "It would be better if the lessons at the theoretical level could be related more clearly and explicitly to practical experiences",
    "Covered a range of discourse on topics related to environmental problems and intervention, development practice, rural livelihoods and poverty and systems thinking in relation to these topics. Small class allowed for productive discussion between students on topics of interests and reading responses. Readings were appropriate for topics."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Make sure to do your readings before coming to class. Professor Dove's lecture often build from the readings, which he has selected with great care.",
    "Be prepared for the long reading --but it'll all completely worth it! Also try to keep a note on the takeaways from reading materials",
    "This course might be best for students already interested in political ecology. If one did not come in with and interest in this topic, it would be hard to sit through long lectures.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class",
    "If you're interested in debates about resource use, culture, and societies, absolutely take this class.",
    "To reflect on your daily experience of engaging with the environment and society in relation to what we learn from the course and not only at the professional level",
    "Strongly recommended for everyone. The class offers much-needed perspectives on some of the environmental and development challenges that most students aspire to help solve; but perspectives that students are often far-removed from because they are underappreciated: critically assessing development policy and practice, institutional and systems approaches, looking at development failure, perpetuation of poverty and the extensive rural\/urban or wealth-poverty divide, exploring definitions (or lack thereof) of conservation, sustainability and development - and who benefits most by influencing or controlling narratives, examining how problems of environmental degradation are defined and by who, and why these seemingly insignificant considerations actually have major implications for environmental management."
