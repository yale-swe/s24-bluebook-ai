    "This class is awesome. Definitely take.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you\u0092re an urban studies student looking for another class related to your interests. That said, if you\u0092ve taken other urban studies classes at Yale, especially other Rubin classes, the material will be familiar and no more rigorous than what you\u0092re used to.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is interested in a survey of the American city through the 20th century through examples of specific examples of urban development or phenomenon. In particular the field trips into New Haven, which are closely related to the readings, use New Haven as an example of these aspects of urban history. In terms of the class structure, the assignments are manageable and enjoyable and the seminar is a great forum for people from many different backgrounds and generates some very interesting and relevant discussions.",
    "This is a fun class! It's not an enormous amount of work, but it opens your eyes to the city around you and gets you to think about public space in a more conscious way. In some ways, the class is beholden to the whims of Professor Rubin. If you like him, it's great. We went on several fieldtrips and have interesting assignments that take you out into the city."
