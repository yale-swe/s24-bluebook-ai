   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to students that have some background in STATA and enjoy reading academic papers on inequality. The papers can be a little bit dry sometimes, but the discussion is always good and Professor Lange always goes on interesting tangents. It's a decent senior seminar.",
    "Yes, this is a great course. You get the chance to discuss a number of important topics in labor economics related to inequality (how to describe inequality empirically, what is driving it, economics of the extremely rich, economics of discrimination, health economics, etc.).The workload is very reasonable: 2-3 econ papers to read per week, 4 short reading responses, an in-class presentation of one of the papers, and an final empirical project.Professor Lange is a great guy; he's really friendly, very helpful in office hours, and in general seemed to care a great deal about the course.Additionally, having some knowledge of either Excel or Stata would be very helpful for the empirical project.In conclusion, this is definitely a great Econ seminar to take!",
    "I would recommend this course to all economics majors looking for an interesting seminar that doesn't have an extremely heavy workload. A strong background in Econometrics would definitely be useful for both class discussions and the final project.",
    "It was a good course to read actual econ papers and discuss them during class. Overall, not too stressful, and I learned how to write a econ research paper.",
    "Economics of Social Inequality was a read-a-paper then learn-the-discussed-model course. It was edifying with regard to econometrics but not a normative course.",
    "It's basically reading 2 papers on social inequality \/ labor economics per week and then discussing them in the seminar; slightly technical& quite statistics oriented. There's one paper in the end (group project) and 4 reading responses. Discussion hovers more around numeric \/economic aspects than around ethical considerations.",
    "great course! amazing professor -- Prof. Lange is very approachable and genuinely interested in you learning the material. He modifies the course according to the interests of the students in the seminar. definitely would recommend this seminar."
