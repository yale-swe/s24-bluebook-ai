   "comments": [
    "Fren 130 is a comprehensive French course. You will come out of this course speaking French, and you will learn a lot.",
    "I learned multiple grammatical structures for french. I also learned a large amount of vocab and context from our reading.",
    "Prior to taking this course, I was very confident with my grammar skills, but not very confident with my speaking skills. Throughout the duration of this course, I became much more confident in my speaking ability.",
    "I became acquainted with new concepts in French grammar, developed my writing skills, and became a better speaker.",
    "My high school French curriculum did not emphasize speaking and listening, and so the French L3 program at Yale was quite refreshing for me. Since the vast majority of homework was based around audio programs which required auditory comprehension and written or oral responses, my speaking and listening skills greatly improved over the course of the semester. Combined with encouragement in the classroom to participate orally in discussions, this type of homework has truly made me more confident in the abilities I would need to hold a conversation with a native speaker.",
    "Proper pronunciation, listening comprehension, extensive reading comprehension, various tenses and their conjugations, proper grammar.",
    "My French was pretty rough due to lack of practice, and this class really helped me get back into the swing of the language. I feel more confident with my French, especially my grammar. We learned how to use expressions that are common and eloquent. More than anything, my ability to string together words has greatly improved, both when speaking and listening. I do want to note that this has a lot to do with the laid-back, we-learn-from-each-other approach Madame Pernet took on. I think a strict classroom is detrimental to learning a language, so Madame's methods were very helpful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest weakness of this course, I believe, is how much it depends on the professor\/instructor you get. There is a very large disparity in quality of learning and engagement between professors. Also, the tests\/evaluations are not well done and are often designed to see you fail. You can get around this by rote memorization of vocabulary and phrases, but overall they don't really test the knowledge you have ascertained. Also, the curriculum is very sexist and made me feel uncomfortable at times. There was not a good selection of literature we had to read.",
    "This course had a very good progression of material. The films and books that we read were increasingly difficult, but each one prepared us to move onto the next and more challenging one.",
    "I think the course should depend less upon the audio exercises. They're slow-paced and boring, and I think there are more engaging ways to learn the material.",
    "I truly found the structure of this course to be excellent. I especially appreciated the pacing of the different texts that we studied, as well as the variety of these texts. I found it to be an effective and engaging way to interact with the material. If I were hard-pressed to recommend a change, I would ask that the professor answer any lingering questions about the homework in class as a structured element of each class meeting.",
    "Could use greater emphasis on conversation to encourage speaking practice. I feel that the vocabulary sections on exams are not truly representative of what was learned: one may know fully well the meaning and usage of all vocabulary words, but may struggle to site the particular word prompted for (may cite instead a synonym, and receive no credit). More class time could be spent preparing for the \"Identification\" sections of exams as well. As one progresses, the audio programs help tremendously in listening comprehension (may be rough at first if one has little experience with this).",
    "The discussions we had in class were interesting and I had a lot of opinions; I wanted to participate, so I felt motivated to practice my French outside of class so that we I spoke, I sounded confident and eloquent. I felt the material was well paced. We learned things I didn't know before and always wondered about using. Meeting every day is kind of rough, though, and the audio assignments did not help. At all. I skimmed through them to see what topics they brushed up on and then taught myself them. We reviewed the grammar lessons in class and that was enough for me to feel I understood the material. The actual audios stretched up to 30 minutes at times, and more than one can be assigned per night. Having an hour of class daily AND having a taped instructor nightly was overkill.",
    "Strengths: Designed for personal research and inquiry, plenty of grammatical and literary work that can be reviewed for extensive practice, exposure to idiomatic expressions and varied patterns of speaking\/pronunciation Weaknesses: Some days had far too much homework for an average student to handle along with their other course assignments, so, in consequence, many students fell far behind in their grammatical programs. As a student who did in fact complete all the programs, I finished the class wondering if so much practice was even required for proficiency. Mainly because many grammatical rules were not introduced with clarity (instead designed to be discovered by practicing examples). This was incredibly counterproductive for me, since I ended up learning incorrect rules and ideas that hindered my learning experience. Instead of supplementing the rules we were meant to learn in our dorms, the teachers would instead spend precious class time re-explaining rules to the students who didn't understand. In addition, the literary texts used to support the course were incredibly interesting and useful. However, I felt like we didn't analyze and utilize the texts to their full ability. Oftentimes, we only needed to understand the general context and summary of a book and then its vocabulary for an exam (rather than its artistic merits and deeper connections to French culture and life as a whole). My main gripe with the French exams itself were the vocabulary portions of the test. Instead of testing our familiarity with the terms, we were instead tested on rote memorization and our ability to somehow recall chosen words in context form a list of around 85 or more! Instead of the current format, I would propose the section to be, instead, to write a paragraph using 10 given words in the correct context (or something similar to this effect)."

    "If you are serious about learning French and willing to put in the work, this is an excellent course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Although I felt insufficiently prepared to take an L3 course by certain aspects of my high school language education, I am significantly more confident now in the skill areas that I was most concerned about when beginning the course. I believe that the placement test assessed my skills and knowledge correctly and that this course was the ideal level of difficulty for me. I often felt challenged but the work level was manageable and I understood the concepts after a reasonable amount of effort.",
    "I would recommend this class to kids who actually want to learn French because they make you do a lot of annoying things that are only really worth it if you're trying to be fluent."
