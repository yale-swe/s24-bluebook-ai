   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it. I originally took it hoping to prepare myself for college-level writing and I think it helped with that greatly. The digital childhood theme was interesting, though I think by the end of the course we had deviated a lot from just talking about childhood to talking about a digital society in a broader perspective, whether it was the impact of social media on political culture or technology on human relationships. The amount of work (if you do all the readings!) was substantial but not overwhelming, about an essay or rough draft of an essay due every other week.",
    "A writing course on a particular area of study.",
    "Yes",
    "It was a lot of writing but very much worth it",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but I would also tell them the workload is a lot for a first semester class.",
    "I would highly recommend Digital Childhood to anyone interested in ENGL 114. The subject material is fascinating and relevant because it plays such a big role in our modern lives. The readings are interesting and provide many interesting discussions. It may be a little more work than most ENGL 114 sections, but the professor is great and I think it is well worth it.",
    "You look at childhood in the digital age from a variety of views and entry points. The material is really interesting but it's a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody. I think that any individual who takes this course will see improvement in their own writing, regardless of what the state of their writing is starting off. If students want an introduction to writing about research topics, this is definitely a good course to start off with. The workload is manageable, even though it can seem to be a bit much at times.",
    "ENGL 114 03 was a great introduction to scholarly essay writing. It applies essay writing to the topic of child development and challenges the conventions of thinking about child development. The class is instructive and formulaic, but also creative and guiding. I would definitely recommend the course because the class is instructive and challenging, and the professor is amazing.",
    "Professor Klemann's ENGL 114 is one of the best sections of the course. The readings are fascinating, and the Unlike some other ENGL 114 sections, the final paper for this class is a TED talk. It's a wonderful opportunity to improve your public speaking skills and learn how to translate academic writing into oral presentation."
