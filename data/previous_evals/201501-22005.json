    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS. This was a very relaxing and engaging class.",
    "Great course. I would definitely recommend it with Prof. Sexton. He may not seem as charismatic as some of the other English profs, but he is witty and great at explaining all of the elements of craft required to write good fiction. He runs good workshops, better than most of the ones I've been in. He does it in such a way that all feedback, positive or negative, is constructive, and the workshop atmosphere feels neither harsh nor mushy. Very appropriate for the intro level. I was a little wary at first that Prof. Sexton assigned us to read a book he had written (\"Master Class in Fiction Writing\"), but it's actually quite good and complements lecture well. Even if you don't take this course, I would recommend buying his book. This course is great for someone who has never written fiction before (or not since middle-school, at least) and wants to learn how to do so. Having taken this course, I feel like I have a good grasp of how to write a short story, and I am proud of the final product I wrote for this class.",
    "Take this course if you have the opportunity; the workload is light, the writing and readings are fun.",
    "At the beginning you learn how to construct a story from starch. It's the basic's, but it's very helpful basic's. The end of the course you move away from learning by reading for example, and actually start working on stories. At the end of the course you will have written one complete story. It's not a lot, but it's highly workshopped. I would definitely recommend this course. It was hands down my favorite class I've taken at Yale. You'll have to work hard on your story; he's a hard grader. But other then that the work is not particularly difficult.",
    "The basics of fiction writing. I would recommend this class."
