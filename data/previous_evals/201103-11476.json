   "comments": [
    "DON'T TAKE IT. Even if you think its a gut, it's not worth it.",
    "A great course to take credit\/d, but that's probably unnecessary.",
    "Gut, don't bothering going to class as anything important said is on the lecture slides.",
    "No. The only reason one would take this is for an interesting gut, which it isn't.",
    "I would recommend this to students who are really good at memorizing disparate facts, but not for those who want to go into depth about these themes.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Bracken is so cool, he'll blow you away. The only thing that's frustrating about this course is that there are so few evaluations to apply the awesome subject material to.",
    "I would summarize by telling you not to take it unless you want to get a C in some \"gut\" class, and largely avoid any other class Bracken teaches since he'll have you waiting for the semester to end every time you open his powerpoints.",
    "Great course",
    "Great course for anyone interested in learning about war and the military. The midterm was very annoying-- it had about 12 term identifications and two short answers. The first section felt like it was asking about random bits of information from lectures.",
    "The tests are graded really hard, the lectures are pointless to attend, and I've never done a reading. That being said, if you know somebody who's taken the class in the past, you can get a study guide for the final that will be all you ever need.",
    "I would take it.",
    "Very interesting and detailed course about the military in today's world and the changes occurring now.",
    "if you're looking for a gut, this is not it. it could be a great course if it were organized better.",
    "If you're interested in global politics, business, or national security, this class might interest you. There is a heavy focus on nuclear weapons and their impact on global politics. Take the course!",
    "I recommend the class for anyone interested in what the course title actually describes. As long as you show up in class, listen to the lecture, and do the readings (which are not many), you should be fine.",
    "I would not take this class unless you need to. Professor Bracken's lectures are frequently off topic and full of irrelevant comments that make it hard to understand the point of the lecture. Overall, I did not understand what the class was about at any point in the semester.",
    "Yes I would but I would say be prepared for the final.",
    "Strat tech was low commitment and low workload, however grading ensures it isnt a gut. The conceptual framework and relationship between military and business strategy was very interesting. Final exam ended up being significantly more difficult than the midterm, so be prepared if taking for a grade.",
    "yes. if you go to class youll do fine. ignore what people say about him trying to make it not a gut. thats for people who never went to class",
    "Terrible. You won't actually learn anything. The tests just ask you to regurgitate stuff from readings and lectures (4 of McNamara's \"lessons\" from Fog of War? Really?), and the grading tends to be incredibly petty. Bracken expects you to do very little original thinking.",
    "I would recommend this class for those who like to look at things from the big picture perspective. I found it difficult to keep up with class sometimes since there isn't really structured presentations for lecture.",
    "Yes, take it. It's a great class that depicts interesting aspects on how strategies, technologies and wars are tied to each other. The work load is very manageable and thus if you engross yourself in it, you probably would learn a lot with not that much of an effort. Although proper studying is a must for the mid-term and final.",
    "Interesting course. If you're interested in war\/nukes\/organizational behavior at all, then definitely shop it.",
    "Not a Gut, exams are hard",
    "Take it. No section 1 homework the entire year. Just make sure you prepare for final because it's 55% of your grade.",
    "Interesting material, but there is a lot of it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It's a cool class, but you have to study a lot for the exams.",
    "A free fifth credit some semester",
    "Basically epitomizes why business school is a load of dung. A class made for athletes hopping on the gut bus",
    "If you are interested in how militaries organize and the relations between the nuclear powers of this day and age, I would recommend the class.",
    "Ehhh if you want an easy poli sci lecture, take this. But you don't learn that much. I guess it'd be a good 5th class. Doing the reading isn't really necessary...having good class notes is all you need",
    "If your are interested in the topic and can keep up with the studying and reading then it would be a good class to take. The tests are very hard so make sure you are prepared because its not easy to know what will be on the test and what will not.",
    "Pretty interesting class if u actually listen. Harder than year's past. Would reccommend only if you are interested in topic.",
    "It's a good 4th or 5th class if you're looking for one.",
    "It is no longer the gut class of year's past. The structure of the second half of the class focuses more heavily on the rise of certain powers. Take it if you have an interest in global issues especially military ones.",
    "Easy course but the topics are actually very interesting if you choose to attend lecture",
    "Although I'm sure a lot of people will say no, you SHOULD take this class. This class is not a difficult class. That being said, if you don't come to class then you won't know anything for the tests, which will then make this class into a very hard one. The reading isn't difficult, and if you are willing to go and listen in class twice a week then you will get a good grade. I know a lot of people who never came to class and got grades ranging from an 11-59 on the midterm. The material is not hard however, and the tests are very straightforward. I learned a lot about the military and how complex the strategies and framworks have become in the recent technology era. Take it!!!!",
    "If you are interested in this subject take it",
    "Too bad i had to write this review before Ive seen my grade. Very little work, rarelly have to go to class if you have notes but tests we very confusing and often strayed away from class material.",
    "Take this class if you want to do anything about strategy and war! The professor obviously has the right experience, and most of your friends are taking it, have taken it, or will take it.",
    "Good extra class to have. A little heavy on jargon",
    "Strategy, technology and war is a very straightforward class (1 homework, midterm and final - no section). It's not very difficult if you study for the exams and the material is interesting - good amount of theory of organizational structure, but then focus on nukes and other countries (China, India, US-Russia in cold war, etc.). Take it.",
    "Good class.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for some dry, unfocused lectures.",
    "Pretty cool class- I wound up liking it a lot. Lectures are actually fascinating and the reading is pretty light. Tak it if you want an easy class but are willing to go to class and pay attention. That part is crucial, but if you actually do it, you'll have an interesting and relatively easy class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is amazingly useful material. It teaches you not just facts, but true skills to be a leader and to organize things on a macro- level, with consciousness of the micro details. Especially take it if you plan on being engaged. If not, you won't get anything out of it and it will seem pointless and stupid to you. It is the opposite. It is the best class I have taken at Yale because it teaches skills and not facts-- and real life skills, not just math and economics. Professor Bracken is also so experienced and would love to interact with the students. He is really smart and a good lecturer. Take this class!!",
    "It was easy, a lot of memorization. A lot of interesting information was included in the course, but not presented in the most enthusiastic way.",
    "It's ok. Definitely not the gut it once was; tests were pretty hard only because they were often on stuff not taught in the class! To be honest, take a class you're more interested in and you'll do better and be more motivated to go.",
    "Depends on a student's interest in the material. I would not recommend it as an easy course. It's not difficult either. My feelings are neither bad nor good.",
    "This class is actually pretty difficult, but if you have any desire to deepen your understanding of the American military, you will enjoy doing the readings. I reviewed the readings in preparation for the midterm and the final and I did fine on both of them.",
    "In all honesty, I would not recommend this course. Prof. Bracken seems more interested in name dropping and speaking about committees he has served on then actually teaching what appeared to be an interesting course. The readings and videos assigned were the best part of this class. It's a gut, but probably one of the most irritating one's you will sit through.",
    "this class is NOT a gut. He curves it including the grad students so the undergrads get screwed. There are only two exams and a written assignment but the assignment is pass\/fail (fail is a 0, not a 50) and that is 10% of your grade so if you make a mistake on that you're already in the hole. Your answers on the exams have to be very precise, there is no room for BSing answers you don't know. The information is interesting but hard to follow as there is no overall idea or theme in this class. Bracken isn't a great lecturer. On the whole I would not recommend this class. It's not interesting, engaging or easy.",
    "very small workload although mid term and evaluations can be quite intimidating as it's sometimes difficult to relate questions to material covered in class",
    "I would recommend it to any student interested in the defense department, military technology, and business.",
    "This class is confusing and useless.",
    "recommended, take very good notes during class, not all material on slides",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to learn about organized war.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It sounds like it would have a lot of potential, but it does not. The grading system is very unfair, and your grade depends on which TF grades your exams.",
    "Yes, the class is an interesting course on how organizational strategies are created and shaped.",
    "Poor course that attempts to meld business school themes with military trends unsuccessfully. I would not recommend this course to another person actually trying to learn anything about the topic. However, if you need a 5th course to take credit\/d that requires minimal work, this is where you should look.",
    "I would. If someone wants to learn more about military strategy, this class would be a great starting point.",
    "Not a gut. Boring and dull lectures.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE! It is extremely boring and there is absolutely no structure to it.",
    "No. This course is boring, you don't learn that much, and Bracken is awful to listen to. He is possibly the worst lecturer at Yale.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. It might seem like a gut since there's so little substance to the lectures, but that's just because the teacher isn't good at lecturing. The exams are pretty hard. Everything was really disorganized so I never really knew what I was supposed to be doing and what I was supposed to be learning. I wish I had taken it Credit\/D, at least. To sum up, I didn't really learn anything and the exams were kind of hard.",
    "Interesting course, content... tests are vague and lack structure. Would not recommend.",
    "Political Science 172 01 is a course about military strength and foreign relations. I would recommend this class to anyone interesting in the US government or the military. Also, the course is useful to those who might want to go to business school following college. Professor Bracken incorporates elements of the business world into the course and demonstrates to the class how to discuss issues intelligently."
