   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take it if you are looking for a gratifying course that provides an in-depth context for discussions of race in America. It should not be taken as a 5th course -- it is a considerable amount of reading, although not too much writing for a WR course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There is a lot of reading, but it is worth the effort. Professor Rugemer is really interesting and really knowledgeable about slavery.",
    "This class provides a great, comprehensive view of slavery and its legacy in the U.S. The books are really interesting and allowed students to view the progression of slavery into abolitionist movements, the Civil War, post-slavery systems, and the present. I would highly recommend this class, but only if you're willing to put work into doing the readings!",
    "This course is an in depth analysis of slavery and its impact on America from as early as the 1700s up to modern day. I definitely recommend taking this course, especially since it is an incredibly interesting freshman seminar. There is a good amount of reading (a book a week), but all of the books are very interesting and the conversations led by Professor Rugemer are fascinating. The research paper that we work on throughout the semester seems daunting at first, but Professor Rugemer really guides you through the process and makes it seem very manageable. With all that occurred on campus this year, especially in regards to Calhoun, I greatly appreciate all the knowledge I gained about slavery from this course in order to better understand American slavery's significance and legacy in today's world.",
    "It is a history class on slavery and its impact through to today. I would highly recommend it because of the reading on the syllabus and the professor.",
    "This class offers a great overview of slavery from a very academic standpoint. While we read Harriet Jacobs' and Frederick Douglass's narratives, I would have liked to see more focus on everyday life under slavery and the realities of the institution. However, the course was still invaluable in seeing the significance and legacy of slavery in modern society, and I very much enjoyed the chance to learn about mass incarceration and convict-leasing. I very much recommend this course.",
    "This class is a good introduction and study of slavery and the origins of racism and structural discrimination in America. However, it would benefit from being taught by a black professor who would could empathize with enslaved people instinctively, and bring better, more insightful perspectives. In terms of workload, I spent a great deal of time doing the readings each week and working on my research project. It was the most demanding course I took this semester.",
    "This class is not about the significance of American slavery but about the institution itself. If you want an extremely detailed account of the inner workings of slavery, this is a decent class for you, but dont expect to talk much about its implications. I would likely recommend his lecture over his seminar due to his teaching style."
