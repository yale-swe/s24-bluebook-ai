    "A philosophically\/aesthetically based reading of 19th century American literature, including Melville, hawthorne, emerson, thoreau, H. James and W. James among others. If you are at interested in American literature and\/or aesthetics I would highly recommend this course. However, you have to be willing to do the readings and actually think about them, otherwise discussion will be useless. The class is almost entirely based on discussion, as Professor Schirmeister basically never lectures. Therefore, the benefit you get from the class is equal to the work you put in.",
    "Take it, take it, take it. If not because it's a great overview of 19th century America, than for Prof. Schirmeister.This is primarily an English course, but it has that Humanities cross listing because it dives into Emerson, Thoreau, Lincoln, Lewis, Clark, William James, and other non-novelists. Ways of Knowing means looking at the place of fiction amidst the thought of the century.",
    "Yes! The English\/Lit departments don't offer too many courses on American authors, so it's a great opportunity for undergrads.",
    "Only if Professor Schirmeister is teaching it.",
    "Dean Schirmeister is a friendly and intelligent professor who clearly cares about her subject. But this course is a mess. The syllabus is questionable (a class which purports to deal with 19th Century American literature, particularly that which was of socio-historical import, has no excuse for excluding Whitman; nor does it have any purpose for including Wieland by Charles Brockden Brown, apparently America's first novelist, a literary footnote often overlooked for thoroughly sound reasons.) The class description is misleading (examining the way in which early America used literature as a privileged sphere for resolving social, political, and religious national traumas sounds interesting, doesn't it? What you actually end up doing is arbitrarily picking two or three images from the text and then nitpicking them into irrelevance.) The wrong questions are asked about the right topics. And the \"writing\" aspect of the class is a joke, as ever raising questions about what goes through Yale's head when it assigns those to some classes and not others (most of the difficulty of the papers comes from figuring out how to answer complex, involved questions within a strict TWO PAGE length limit, and you then have to go through a tedious peer-editing process guaranteed to bring back unsavory memories of high school). Avoid."
