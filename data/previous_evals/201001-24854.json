    "Korean 120 is awesome, because of Lee-sungsangnim. Take it take it take.",
    "YES YES YES! Take it if you're at all interested in learning Korean at all! Even though the class met at 9:20 every morning, taking this class was beyond worth it! It was so fun!",
    "Well, duh, you should take Korean. If you've been wondering about it, I honestly don't know why you are still reading this. I put it off, but that's because I'm not as smart as you are, right? Be smart.",
    "This course is basically a continuation of Korean 110. It maintains the same pace, which may start to feel a little slow toward the end of the semester, but with Lee Seonsengnim teaching, it is sure to be the best class of your day, every day. Also, you'll be amazed at how much you progress through the semester.",
    "Korean is fun but, as with many intro languages, a lot of work. I would recommend the class to someone really willing to put in the time.",
    "I would recommend this class; it was a lot of fun. The curriculum still has some kinks to work out, but I definitely enjoyed it.",
    "Professor Lee is ENTERTAINING. She cracks Korean jokes all the time and picks fun of each of her students out of adoration. Her exams are repetitions of exactly what we learn in class, so they're very straight-foreword to prepare for and fair to grade. After learning a new grammar form, she assigns written homework and gives us lot's of opportunity in class to practice orally, so (again)the repetition and cumulative learning helps a lot. The pace of the class was highly manageable. And her dynamic humor, her love for teaching Korean, and her constant efforts to make her students as interactive as possible made this my favorite subject."
