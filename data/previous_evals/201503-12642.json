   "comments": [
    "This is a great course about the problems facing government attempts to regulate global corporations. It's a joy to learn from Professor LaPalombara, a manageable workload and a very relevant\/applied course. If you get the chance (and if he teaches again) you should definitely take this course.",
    "EP&E 245 is a course that explains the role of multinational firms, why they exist, what they do, what constraints they face, and with whom and how they interact in the countries in which they enter. You learn about FDI, the origins of multinational firms, global firms and their relationships with developing countries. You write three 1000 word papers and can take a final exam or write a final paper. I would recommend EP&E 245 to another student because the course is very interesting and you learn a lot.",
    "To be perfectly honest, I don't know what I learned in this class that I couldn't have learned on my own just by going through the syllabus and doing the readings. I feel like the quality of this class depends a lot on the other students who are going to take it. I'd maybe recommend this course to a fellow student if they're very keen and eager to take on a lot of the learning burden on their own. I took this class really hoping to learn something, but am not sure that I did.",
    "Great course where you work in groups with other students and do cases. Great way to meet some incredible minds at Yale while delving into fascinating material.",
    "The first half of the semester is a little slow, but the case studies in the second half make it all worth it. A reasonable amount of work, and Prof LaP is a total legend.",
    "Yes--the course helps students get a grasp of the intersection between government and private interest\/MNCs interactions. The case studies described were extremely interesting."
