   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic course! I learned a huge amount about VIchy France. It was a bit confusing at first because Prof. Merriman assumes that you know the traditional narratives about Vichy, but it's not a big problem. There is a LOT of reading but you can skim some weeks if you need to. Definitely watch the movies though. The only grades are class participation (including a presentation of the reading one week) and a final paper, 15-40 pages. The final paper is intimidating but actually very enjoyable if you choose a good topic.",
    "Take it! Great seminar, and you get to engage with one historical period in France in depth. Does not get old, you still feel like there's so much to learn and talk about.",
    "Great class, lots of in-depth reading and fun discussions.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Take it! It's only offered every two years, and Bruno and John are a marvelous duo when they teach together. That said: do the reading! Seminar discussions get bland if you don't read all of the assigned reading. And the professors aren't entirely experts on Vichy, so don't expect them to dominate the discussions.",
    "Yes, absolutely!! wonderful seminar on a part of WWII rarely discussed. It will make you think about France in a different light. both professors are awesome. take it if you can!",
    "Definitely. No brainer. Professor Cabanes and Professor Merriman are arguably some of the best \"personal\" academics at this university who make the subject matter engaging and active. Do not pass this course up, only a manageable workload of interesting books and films.",
    "YES! Maybe take Merriman's lecture first. A background in French history would be very helpful. I didn't have it, and I felt like I was struggling to catch up the entire semester.",
    "intense focus on the Vichy years in France.",
    "Collaboration and Resistance is a great class that relies heavily on the readings and student-led class discussions to form the curriculum. We had a great class that really cared about the material, so I feel like I got a lot from the class. I'm a French major, so this was especially relevant to my studies, but I think anyone interested in French history will find this class enjoyable and even fun!",
    "Yes absolutely, any history student. You should be interested in that period because you will spend the enitre semester on just 4 years of history but even if you dont know much about it, its a great way to really dive into a topic."
