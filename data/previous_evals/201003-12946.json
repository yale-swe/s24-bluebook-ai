    "I would recommend this course for sure. Plus, it's a writing credit.",
    "If you are interested in American Indian history then yes take this for your seminar.",
    "This course is laid-back for a history seminar. The first half is spent on reading histories of tribes and the American Indian Movement in the 70s, and the second half focuses on preparing paper topics. Professor Blackhawk is very genuine and caring, and -- at least this year -- the course ended up being especially cool because he was able to bring in guests who happened to be on campus.",
    "Good class, and you have lots of time to work on your final project. Its got a very manageable workload, especially for a seminar!",
    "Yes. Interesting readings, welcome atmosphere, mostly good discussions, and great help if you ask for it.",
    "More than in any other history course I've taken, the exposure to primary sources and their contextualization within the syllabus was an inspiring introduction the types of history we could write. Unfortunately, getting excited about such materials is pretty difficult in a 9:25 am seminar; consider that before enrolling. Also, the last month is basically a research roundtable where you talk about your progress on your final progress. These discussions suffered from a lack of advance preparation on student's topics and desire to participate in a conversation about the topics of others. Could be different with different people, but it's a gamble leaving the content of the course up to the combined energies of the students (at 9:25 am). If you are serious about interdisciplinary historical methods, ethnohistory, tribal histories, there is no equivalent class at Yale though. Take it and make it what you want."
