    "English 114 is a great course for every students who wants to improve his or her writing skills. There are four essays throughout the semester, and each one has a first draft, so students can actually improve their essays between the first and final drafts. There is also some reading that is discussed in class. It is a class I recommend to anyone who has issues in writing papers, and especially to all international students (take it first semester freshman year!)",
    "Terrific class! Macdonald is a great instructor.The scope of material is good, feedback from instructor helps a lot without spoon-feeding you, class discussions are interesting. The amount of reading is very manageable and gives us the leisure to explore related texts.",
    "I would recommend it. Professor Macdonald is great and he really helps you improve your writing. However, this class is pretty tough. It takes a lot of work and effort to get a good grade on an essay.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It's a terrific transition into college-level writing. And since writing is a pretty important area, this class would definitely prove to be useful.",
    "I would recommend this course because it elevates high school writing to college writing. Try to get a section you are interested in, because otherwise, it will be boring and the research paper will not be fulfilling in the end.",
    "I had Professor MacDonald -- take it with him if you can!Professor MacDonald is such a great professor! Every single person in our class loved him. He's always there to help, gives detailed feedback, and really cares about his students' success and development. He's willing to meet with students practically whenever possible if needed -- he truly cares!I really do feel that I've become a much better writer -- college paper standards are much different than high school. The class is very fair, although you do have to put in the work if you want to get that high mark. Also, the readings are pretty interesting.The longest paper was an 8-page research paper and the other three are 4-6 pages.",
    "YES! Especially if it's on \"Minds, Groups, and the School,\" then YES! If James Ross Macdonald teaches it - YES! He's superb. Your writing will get better, and you'll learn a lot about something very important in the world - education!",
    "Take English 114 if you high school writing career consisted mainly of 5-paragraph essays. This course is the perfect transition to 8-page research papers :p",
    "It's awesome. Very easy. Take it. Easy writing credit. only four essays, what?",
    "Definitely. If you are interested in education and want to improve your writing this is the course for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking for an introduction to college style writing.",
    "This is a very good class. I would recommend taking it with Professor Macdonald. Professor Macdonald is a great person and a great teacher. I feel like my writing improved a lot over the course of the semester, because Professor Macdonald has provided a lot of feedback on my writing. The class, itself, was interesting.",
    "English 114 is a very good class for students who need that last extra push to improve their writing. The topics are very interesting, the content is relevant, and you will leave the class a much improved writier than when you entered it."
