   "comments": [
    "Network analysis.",
    "I learned how to think critically about uses of big data in many different sectors.",
    "A deeper knowledge into the intersection of sociology & big data.",
    "Data cannot be trusted all the time!!! I have learned to analyze the numbers and institutions around me with a more critical eye. We blindly put faith in mathematics, statistics, and computer science but should constantly challenge their authority to ensure they are being used for good.",
    "I had never taken a sociology course at Yale, and this one was a great survey into an extremely topical subject area. It was a great perspective from which a non-coder\/non-STEM person could approach the amorphous idea of Big Data. This is essential knowledge for the time in which we live, whether you intend to be a data scientist\/engineer or not.",
    "Sociological analysis, reading and writing sociology format. Understanding the sociological impacts of big data and its effect on the social sciences.",
    "A great course that explores multiple facets of sociology from a big data perspective.",
    "I definitely got a better grasp on how statistics and big data fit into the realm of social sciences. If anything, this class helped me expand the ways that I understand big data being used to ask questions that were previously impossible for us to ask. I appreciate taking this class for the opportunity to see the intricacies of a new medium of social science research.",
    "I gained critical thinking skills and knowledge about trends in big data science and sociology--just as promised. Gained an important vocabulary for engaging with the field.",
    "This Class gives an overview of the power and pitfalls of Big Data. It both debunks the buzzword but also gives some powerful knowledge about what is possible in this new age."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was really good!",
    "This course was great! I loved the different papers we read, the option to write a research paper on any topic, and the presentation that we did on one of the class topics.",
    "Good selection of articles - also manageable so all students have read all articles. It would be improved by more facilitated discussion between students; Prof. Legewie did a good job of not inserting his opinions all the time and allowing students to ask questions to the class, but discussions never really flourished.",
    "The course material was fascinating and we had meaningful conversations in class. However, the quality of the discussions varied week by week, and I wish engagement was consistently high.",
    "The class is a lot of fun and provides a wide perspective on big data, its uses, and its weaknesses. I honestly wouldn't change anything about how the course is run--it is low-pressure while still engaging, and helped me learn about a topic with which I was extremely unfamiliar.",
    "A fantastic course that I was delighted to have the chance to take. Engaging discussions and lots of fascinating topicsthe professor knew his material well, and the classroom environment was very supportive. The only thing was that it was the professor's first time teaching the course, so the grading was a little inconsistent. I wish I could have gotten more feedback on some of my assignments.",
    "The real strength of this course lies in the other students that are taking it. The class is structured to allow for a wide variety of applications of big data to a number of different subject areas. The projects and presentations allow for each individual student to apply the material from class to a topic that is personal.",
    "Overall very good; would have been nice to have assignments returned in a more timely manner.",
    "Overall, I think this course and the material was very strong. I liked the interactive elements with class presentations and some of the pre-class exercises. And there were numerous opportunities for feedback. Also, the end project was a great way for me to connect my own interests and potential life plans to course material! I liked that we had a guest visitor as well. Weaknesses....very few. Sometimes the lecture style format dragged on annoy long and it was clear that people disengaged.",
    "One great strength of the course was how many different fields we touched upon. We looked at many different aspects of big data to get a pretty comprehensive understanding of the field. Obviously we do not know how to analyze big data as this course does not cover that. However one thing that is worth considering is that this course does not have to be a 300 level course this could easily be an introduction level course or changed into having a technical aspect and become a methods course."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend if you want to learn about big data!",
    "Yes! This is an awesome course. The material is so interesting and relevant to the current day. You get the change to write a paper on any topic of interest, which is really cool. Joscha is really knowledgeable and very engaged. Highly recommend.",
    "Big data is becoming a huge part of our lives, so learning about it from a sociological perspective is important for everyone. You learn about many different topics in big data and discuss their feasibility, strengths, weaknesses, and ethics. I came in already knowing a lot about sociology and big data but I felt l deepened my knowledge in these areas.",
    "Data cannot be trusted all the time!!! We blindly put faith in mathematics, statistics, and computer science but should constantly challenge their authority to ensure they are being used for good--numbers can perpetuate inequality and conceal human bias in unfathomable ways. Take this class if you want to learn how to analyze the numbers and institutions around us with a more critical eye.",
    "I think this is a great class for a non-STEM\/non-sociology student to gain insight into an essential topic. It's fun and pretty easy if you engage with the material.",
    "Yes, amazing class super relevant no matter your field of study.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in applications of data in the social sciences. If you are looking for more of a comsci\/math course, this probably isn't for you, but great for humanities\/SS majors!",
    "Definitely! I think it is very accessible from people from all backgrounds and most people can learn how to apply the use of big data to their topic of study or interests.",
    "If you're interested in the future of sociology and data science, take this course. It's very laidback but super interesting. Joscha is a great professor who gives useful feedback and is very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. Useful for sociology majors and people of various other disciplines as well!",
    "If you are interested in big data but not from a technical perspective then this class is worth a look! It is a very accessible class with no prerequisites but gives an understanding of big data."
