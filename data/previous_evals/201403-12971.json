    "I would definitely recommend to any student who is interested in Roman life and in learning through object interaction. Unfortunately the course will not be offered again as it centered on a rotating exhibition that will no longer be at the YUAG.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for the unique opportunity to examine the incredible collection of ancient art at the YUAG and in the exhibit on art in the Roman Provinces. The incorporation of material culture with relevant readings connected the disciplines of art history and archaeology and offered a valuable perspective for people from diverse academic backgrounds."
