    "A good introductory biology course.",
    "It's a necessary intro class. The exam questions are extremely tedious at times, but once you figure out how to study for the exams, you're in the clear. Might be a little boring if you've taken AP Bio.",
    "Molecular, Cellular& Developmental Biology 120 is definitely an important fundamentals-of-biology course for the aspiring pre-med student. I would definitely recommend it, as you will most likely be lost without it as the material covered forms the foundation of many later more advanced science courses.",
    "Yes, this is a good introductory biology class. It does not make assumptions about one's prior knowledge, so the lectures are very accessible. At the same time, the book provides many details that can supplement those students looking to learn more about a specific topic. I would recommend that one does all the suggested readings if at all possible.",
    "it's a bio class -- it is what it is. it's not too hard and it doesn't have psets, which is beautiful.",
    "yes, but only if he\/she needs to",
    "I would recommend MCDB 120, but there are only 3 tests and a final, and the tests can be tricky.",
    "I recommend 120 if it's necessary for you to take it. You get 2\/3 good lectures, which isn't that bad in the end...Be wary of the exams. Pay attention to detail or the TAs who grade them will mark you off mercilessly.",
    "MCDB 120 is a good class, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs the credit.",
    "If you are pre-med and need to take it yes, but don't take it just for a science credit.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it.",
    "Great class. You should definitely take it. However, be prepared to be terrified by the curve.",
    "This course is a general overview of the basic concepts in biology. It's a prerequisite for basically all biology classes after it, so if you're considering taking it you probably need it for that reason. It's a lot like AP Bio. Most of the things we learn, we only learn the basics of, which gives you a general understanding of the way things in biology work. I found the class to be interesting and not too much work.",
    "It is a very basic and fundamental course. Take it if you need to.",
    "The midterms were stressful to study for but the class was good overall. Great introduction to biology. Professor Carlson is absolutely AMAZING. I also liked Professor Slack and Carol. The developmental biology portion was really interesting.",
    "Unlike a lot of people, I did not take MCDB120 because I 'had to' - I took it because I was interested in biology and wanted to see what a large biology lecture at Yale was like. All in all, I thought it was a decent class. There are three lecturers, the second of which (Professor Carlson) was by far the best, although because this is his last year teaching MCDB120, I hope they find a decent replacement for him. All three lecturers have different styles, which can really affect how well you learn the material (it did for me). The only grades are three midterms (one for each unit) and a cumulative final, so you really need to keep up, pay attention, and read along in the textbook. The exams are all pretty tricky, so you need to be careful if you're shooting for that really high grade. Basically, I felt that I left the class with a pretty sound understanding of the fundamentals of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, but that my grade didn't necessarily reflect this. If you need to take it, it's not the worst thing in the world. If you are just curious, I don't really think there is another comparable option which is as thorough, but do realize that the class covers a LOT of material and that the tests are difficult, so keep your GPA in mind if it's really important to you.",
    "I came into this class not having taken any biology in 6 years. However, I came out of the class feeling like a had a very well-rooted fundamental understanding of many basic biological concepts. It wasn't too hard, yet I still learned a ton. A very solid intro class. Also, Professor Carlson is one of the best professors you'll ever have. If he's still teaching, take this course!",
    "Very easy if you've taken high school biology. Exams are mostly lecture-based and reading is not required. Section is not required.",
    "If you are just looking for an easy class for a science credit, there are better options out there. However, if you need this class for premed, your major, or etc, take this class. It's not too bad, although the materials can get confusing at times and monotonous\/boring at others.",
    "Recommend. I hadn't taken a bio class since freshmen year of high school, and I thought this class was a really good intro class. I'm considering the bio major now. A lot of memorizing for the tests, but besides that, no other work. Lectures are helpful and it is easy to stay on top of the material.",
    "Fine introduction to MCDB. The lectures are not necessary to attend and section is completely unhelpful. The workload is not bad, with three midterms and a final. Carlson is by far the best professor, while the Slacks' lectures are uninspired and monotonous. Overall, not a bad course if you are required to take it, if not, find a more engaging way to get your Sc credit.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in bio and want an overview of the subject. The material is pretty easy, but the tests require a lot of memorizing. Bascom-Slack is the worst professor of the 3, so don't be put off by that.",
    "This class is a very useful intro course for Biology. If you do not need to take it, however, I strongly advise skipping it. Hard grading and boring at times.",
    "I would go to a more advanced bio class if you can.",
    "I thought this class was pretty boring, but it does go over most of the bio fundamentals. If you haven't taken bio in high school, it's definitely worth taking, but it's pretty difficult to pay attention..",
    "I learned so much! I took AP bio in high school but didn't retain much of the information. Now I feel like I finally have a great understanding of how things work. Definitely useful, great class if you're premed -- I'm so glad I took this class. Carol and Frank's lectures aren't bad at all; very informative. And John Carlson is as charismatic as expected. Lots of information though, so definitely stay on top of things and study hard, since your grade is based entirely on the tests.",
    "A great course! really interesting and worth it",
    "Great intro bio class that is not too demanding. It's nice how tests are split up into 4 exams. I recommend it, but it's too bad this was John Carlson's last semester teaching the class because he was great!",
    "Good intro bio class. There are three professors, each one doing a different section of the course. Some of the lectures are more engaging than others. I personally enjoyed the Developmental part the most, which is lucky because it is the largest portion of the course. There are three hour exams, a final exam, and section is optional. There are no assignments, although there is reading. The professors sometimes weren't clear on whether the reading was suggested\/required. I would suggest doing the reading, just because otherwise when it comes to test time you won't have had any other exposure to the material. And let's face it -- it's a class with no assignments, so most people are just going to lecture and not looking at the material again until its time to study for one of the exams. And the professors say that they test off the lectures, but some of the questions on the tests pertained to information that was only in the reading. But otherwise a generally easy class, as long as you go to lecture& study.",
    "This is a fairly boring and elementary class. I had not taken biology since freshman year of high school (6 years ago), yet i remembered most of the information. Having three teachers made this class way more difficult than it should have been as you have to learn three separate teaching styles. Worse, is that you have to take three different types of tests. Two of the tests focused on very specific principles and went into them in depth without testing whether you had learned the full breadth of information, which seemed a little unfair. Ultimately, you will just have to take this class if you are premed. Sorry!",
    "I do not recommend it if it's not your pre med req. Very tough intro course for grades.",
    "Take it if you like biology or want a fun science credit. Don't take a GUT science, take this instead.",
    "It's a good intro to bio course. Be warned that many kids have taken AP or advanced bio and if you haven't you may struggle to keep up in comparison. Carlson is a wonderful lecturer, and the other two are good at explaining their topics.",
    "I would recommend it as a solid introductory Bio course for anyone, whether having taken Bio in high school or not.",
    "An interesting class. Material that is extremely relevant and that I am happy I studied. I would recommend it.",
    "It is a good class, there is not really any work except studying for the three tests. But there is a lot of material for the tests so unless you really keep up, its a lot of studying the days before. I would recommend the class to another student as a good way to understand the basics of molecular, cellular and developmental biology.",
    "No problem sets, just lecture that you're recommended to do the readings for. Standard intro bio course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if intended for the biology major track. There is a lot of material covered and a lot of terms to memorize.",
    "MCDB120 is basic biology. It has a range of students, which makes it hard to interest everyone or to test people fairly. As a result, tests sometimes have unpredictable questions, but if you study well and go to lecture, you should be fine.",
    "MCDB 120 was alright. You learn a lot, but it's not a particularly stimulating or exciting class. It was a good introduction to a lot of material. Two of the lecturers were mediocre to above average, but Professor Carlson was phenomenal. I'm not sure whether he is teaching again, but if he is, definitely take it for him.",
    "I was pretty disappointed in how this class was structured. It was my first time taking a course in which professors changed partway through the semester, and it was disorienting having to adjust to three different teaching and testing styles--especially when those styles weren't in any way articulatedat the beginning of the course or their time teaching. Furthermore, I felt the way the material was presented to us was needlessly cluttered and disorganized. The professors relied to different degrees on the textbook; whereas one professor wasn't a fan of the text, another directed us to specific pages that his lectures were covering and taught experiments extracted from the book. I would have liked it to be one way or the other--either all professors relying to the same extent on the text (and telling us what they expected us to be doing, i.e. reading this, skipping that, etc.) or excluding the text entirely\/using it ONLY as a reference or a guide. It made the exams unnecessarily difficult to study for. If you're pre-med and\/or considering a Bio major, consider taking MCDB 200 instead--it'll count towards the major and, from what I've heard, seems like less of a headache.",
    "I would only recommend this class if it is required. Otherwise, it is not the best. Not very inspiring. Just a standard bio course.",
    "Pretty standard intro bio course. Carlson was a great lecturer, but he won't be teaching this class anymore. Midterms were fairly straightforward. There are no problem sets, so you just have to stay on top of the lectures. The book serves mainly as a supplement to the lectures, and it probably isn't necessary to do all of the reading that is assigned as long as you take good notes during lecture.",
    "I suspect most people taking this class are freshmen or sophomore pre-meds or prospective bio majors, but I'm a senior econ major who decided to take this for fun. And I think I made a good decision. I found the class very interesting, especially the part on developmental biology, and I think I learned a lot. This class is definitely a lot better than most of Yale's intro subject area classes (like econ). The three professors teaching this class are all good. Also, there's not really any work for this class. I mean, there's readings, but it's not required, especially if you go to the lectures, since only what's covered in the lectures are what's on the exams. So I definitely recommend people in my position to take this class.",
    "It's a great Intro to Bio course. It teaches you how to think critically, the work load is minmal (only study for tests), and the lecturers know what they're teaching and how to teach it. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Good introductory biology course. Covers a lot of material, but this is a good way to set a foundation for the field and get a feel for the department. You have to be willing to put the work into this class. Like I said before, there is a great deal of information to keep track of throughout the course.",
    "It's harder than you think. If you have to take it, you have to take it. I wouldn't recommend for non-majors though.",
    "It is basic biology class. If you have not taken AP bio, it will be much harder than if you have taken AP bio.",
    "If you're interested in biology. YES.",
    "Yes - take it. It is intro bio but it is interesting and the workload is light. No homework just three tests and a final. You will learn so much that you didn't already know (if this is your first experience with bio) that is interesting and relevant but not hard to grasp. Just go to lecture and take decent notes and you will do fine.",
    "DEFINITELY. Whether you need a science credit, are just curious about biology, or are premed (or vet!), this class is a great introduction to biology and will give you a great foundation for future classes! Take it!",
    "I would not recommend this course if you could avoid it. The tests cherry-pick knowledge and it can be very hard to do well. There is no transparency throughout the course about grades, and only one professor provided practice tests, so you go into each examination unsure of how you will be tested. If Prof. Carlson does not teach next year, it will be totally not worth it.",
    "Take it if you need an introductory biology course. I took it because I did not take AP biology in high school. It was not always the most exciting course, but it refreshed my biology from freshman year of high school. Reading the book is unnecessary, but I found that skimming the readings before the test was useful. All in all, it was a fine class, but nothing that special.",
    "If you need it for the major, take it! I actually learned A LOT. I would recommend this as one of the best intro courses I have taken. Grades are fair, go to class, take the tests, you'll do fine.",
    "You learn a lot from this class, especially if you don't have a strong background in bio. But the way it is taught is not designed to help you get away with much except a hatred for the MCDB department. Just know this:Write everything they say down and commit it to memory. Don't need the textbook. Section is helpful if your TA makes handouts, so shop the sections for a good one. The lectures are boring with the exception of Prof. Carlson's. Not a lot of work overall except when it comes to exams, whose wording is so offensive and unfair, you will never be able to study enough. Also, stay away from Frank Slack.",
    "If you must take it, then do so, but if it can be avoided, then don't take it.",
    "I took this course after taking AP Bio, because I went to a so-so high school and didn't feel ready to jump into higher-level courses. I'd heard a lot of bad things about this course, but I was pleasantly surprised. Carlson's lectures are the most fun, because he has this amazing, infectious passion for science, but Slack and Bascom-Slack were great too -- you could always count on having a clear, well-organized, well-presented lecture. I found the tests to be relatively straightforward. There's a lot of material to be learned, so you can't blow it off, but if you study you should be fine. Take it if you're interested in the material!",
    "This course is a good overview for students who have not just finished taking high school AP biology. While most people will have learned much of the molecular and even cellular components of the class, the developmental component provides an interesting introduction to anther facet of biology.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 120 to a student who hasn't taken AP Biology and who needs an introductory biology course. Otherwise the material is interesting, but nothing that hasn't been said before in a high school course and it would serve you better to go onto something more focused. There is a lot of memorization and learning from slides, but overall the course was not too stressful and definitely manageable.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if they have not mastered the material in AP Biology. It provides a solid biology foundation and does a good job of exposing the students to a little bit of everything in biology.",
    "Yes",
    "If you have not taken AP Biology, tread with caution. The majority of the people who take this course have and much of the material is review for them. It is a little more than irritating because the professors also go through the material as if it's review. That being said, I did not take AP Bio. and I enjoyed this course. I just had to work much harder and did not do too well on the first 2 exams.",
    "I'd recommend it. While not that exciting, it gave a good introduction to bio, and taught stuff that everyone who is interested in bio should really know.",
    "General basic biology class. Can jump around a bit, but overall pretty interesting. Study for the tests and you'll be fine.",
    "A general overview of the principles of MCDB. If you've taken the AP then you probably can place out of it, which I would recommend, if you need an intro to Bio, this is the class for you.",
    "I took this class because I had enjoyed biology in high school and was considering pre-med. However this class was my least favorite class at Yale so far. It is very test-centered and it's very difficult to guess what material is important to study for the tests. Don't take it unless you have to. It will probably make you dislike biology.",
    "Lots of interesting stuff. Good class.",
    "MCDB 120 is a very challenging class for someone without the proper background. It's difficult to be in a class with people with all different levels of experience. Study hard, go to section, and definitely go to the review sessions. That being said it's interesting and you get to learn about the different fields of biology. The professors are also very approachable. If you can take a higher class, definitely do.",
    "MCDB 120 is a great introductory biology course! The separate molecular, cellular, and development sections of the course really lent to a deeper understanding of each component of biology. I would recommend this course to a potential bio major or anyone interested in bio. It builds a great foundation for a career in the life sciences!",
    "Decent class, super interesting",
    "I would recommend this as an introductory bio course. The material is very interesting. The easiest way to succeed in the class is to attend the lectures and study your notes well. If you put in the effort, you should do well in the course.",
    "MCDB 120 was very reasonable in terms of work load. Reading for the class was unnecessary because the material was covered thoroughly in lecture. The lectures tended to be somewhat dull except for when Professor Carlson was teaching, but unfortunately he won't be a part of the course again next year. If you have taken AP Bio before then this course is really just a review and should be relatively easy. I know some people that hadn't taken AP Bio that struggled though because it is relatively fast paced if you are learning it from scratch. The midterms and final were reasonable and I never found them to be particularly hard. Overall, it wasn't my favorite course but I'm glad that I took it.",
    "The class was, as I said earlier, your typical intro to bio. Big lecture, lots of students. If you are interested in the sciences, or would like to gain a basic understanding of biology, than this would be a good course to take. It is very interesting like many of the other courses offered, but it does cover a lot of important information. There is not a lot of work and would probably be less stressful than most of the other science courses available.",
    "Not terrible.",
    "It's a good class overall. It's not too difficult if you keep up with readings and make sure you understand material; as you go, rather than waiting to cram before the midterm. Take it if you need, but do not bother if you have taken and done well in AP biology. The class i2 over 200 kids, and as long as you keep on top of things, you should be able to beat the average. The section and peer tutors are helpful, so I would advise taking advantage of them.",
    "Good intro to basics of biology so if you're interested in that, take it. Be wary of pre-medical students.",
    "The course is a pretty thorough introduction to biological concepts. I took biology AP in high school and did a 9-week cell biology research program over the summer, and I still found the course somewhat difficult. It's a good foundation for higher-level biology classes and worth taking even if you have a good background in the subject. I think the amount of material covered in the course is perfect, but the tests were poorly graded. I got back about 10 points on one test just by going to the professor and having him look at my answers. The TAs seemed to mark questions wrong if they did not match the EXACT wording of the key. I definitely would not take it just to fulfill a science distribution req.",
    "A course that delves into the details of the biology taught in high school. You will most probably have heard of most of the topics, but you will go deeper into them than you thought possible. The exams are quite tough.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 120 to pre-med students or science majors. This course is an excellent \"introductory\" lecture-based class. Discussion section was helpful and course materials interesting. Preparing for exams was a challenge, as they were primarily based on lecture materials, not the accompanying text book. I would recommend this class to students in search of an introductory biology course, I would also recommend taking the laboratory course at the same time; the intentional overlap gave a laboratory context to the lecture material.",
    "I would recommend this course to prospective bio majors.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It can be dry and dense at times but for the most part the information is straight forward and can be interesting.",
    "Most people take it as a requirement, just get it done.",
    "In MCDB 120 we went over some introductory molecular biology material, interesting cellular biology information, and key concepts in developmental biology. There is NO HOMEWORK, but there are three exams throughout the semester and one final. NO EXAM GRADE IS DROPPED. All of the material covered in LECTURES, NOT THE BOOK, are on the exams. I recommend this course if you're interested in general biology and thinking about being premed. If you took the AP Bio exam and got a 4, then go ahead and take this course. It's similar to AP Bio. If you haven't taken AP Bio or any other real biology course in high school, then be warned that this course will be difficult. To be successful, you should read the textbook readings before class (yes, actually READ THEM), get a TA that speaks great English, go to section, ask that TA questions about things you don't understand, and most importantly, GO TO CLASS. This is vital since the exams are based on lecture material, and not textbook material. Study way before exams because cramming doesn't help much in this course. Also, take good notes that you'll actually look back on."
