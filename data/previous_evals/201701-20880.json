    "I learned how to effectively write a research lab report",
    "This course taught many fundamental skills in terms of scientific writing, error analysis, and the engineering process. In particular, I really improved on analyzing data in real time during an experiment and adjusting my control parameters to ensure a wide, representative sampling based on those initial results. Many lab courses say that they aim to teach scientific writing, though I think this is the only one that I actually feel like that has been the case. I already have experience writing for peer reviewed publications, and it's certainly a different kind of writing than that, but it was much closer and still felt like the skills I gained were applicable more broadly. I don't think I learned a great deal about fluids\/thermo topics, however, in this course. For the experiments covering topics from 361, at best it just reinforced my existing knowledge. For experiments not from this course or 211, however, I don't think I ever fully grasped the theory behind the experiments. Instead, I just understood enough to write the report and do the analysis. This was unfortunate, however, I think the scientific writing skills I learned are more broadly applicable, so I would not change too much about the course.",
    "I developed a better understanding of how to write scientific reports on experiments.",
    "I think my writing genuinely improved, and I learned about technical formatting and style.",
    "I became a better technical writer and learned how to use igor",
    "I learned how to process data for a goal\/objective quickly and I gained a much better understanding of how error analysis actually work. This was the first lab where propagation\/standard deviation calculations actually felt like they represented some real physical errors, not just poor procedure.",
    "This was really helpful in learning lab procedures, error analysis and writing a technical report.",
    "I learned how to write technical reports and present data in an effective and concise way. I also learned how to do error analysis on different sets of data and operate various type of measurement equipment.",
    "I learned a lot, primarily, about data analysis, namely how to analyze lots of data in an organized fashion while under time constraints. Many classical principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics were reviewed and made more salient through experimentation. I learned how to write concise lab reports.",
    "I learned a lot in this class about how to write a good scientific report. Writing a lab report every week seemed like it would be a pain, but it was not too bad by the end of the semester. I think my writing improved significantly"

   "comments": [
    "The class portion is mostly useless. Going in to get specific individualized feedback on written reports was much better. You are often left out in the storm to figure out how to analyze the data.",
    "The lab sections were well run, the experiments well designed for the time allotted usually, and the reports greatly improved my skills as a scientific writer, I believe. That said, the once-a-week lecture on error analysis, writing practices, and other miscellaneous topics felt extraneous. I would always attend these sessions as the group for the class was small, but I never felt like I got anything out of them, so it felt like a waste of time.",
    "The course's requirements could have been more clearly specified in the beginning of the course. The professor and teaching fellows told students particular ways of handling the work of the course while reacting another when their advice was used.",
    "The labs were generally interesting, though the data capture REALLY needs to be automated for most of them. I don't think i got very much out of using a stopwatch to time simple things that an Arduino could have done.",
    "I can't imagine how much this course would have sucked if my lab group and I didn't meet for 5-10 hours outside of lab to do analysis\/error propagation\/discussion about the lab. The TAs and professor were all around a lot and helpful. Please don't teach Yale College juniors about what a paragraph is. It was silly and a waste of time. :)",
    "Does a great job of teaching student how to do scientific writing. The experiments were fun, interesting, and engaging the majority of the time. The teaching was also very consistent and well organized. The only weakness is the inconsistent grading standards with technical reports.",
    "The labs were well structured and pretty easy to follow, but the data collection could be a bit monotonous. Data collection\/lab performance was best if the spreadsheet for taking data was completely set up before class. The course also taught me how to write effective and concise lab reports. The lab reports were very difficult to write at first, but with time and practice, they became more doable. The grading system for the class is the best and allows one to focus on growth and development as opposed to doing well on each and every report.",
    "Evaluation 363L One of the TA's has ruined the experience for me. You switch from one to another halfway through the course. Half on the class looks like it has improved which the other either stays the same or actually looks to have gotten worse. But other than that, this class is very time-consuming. Lab reports and experiments are weekly.",
    "The report writing and the feedback were very good. The class was well-organized, but the professor struggled to communicate his expectations and desires with the students at times."

    "This class is going to teach you how to write a very concise and clear research paper, and analyze a lot of data using equations from other classes. I personally have no intention of being a researcher, so this class had low applicability for me. This class is a technical report every week. You do the labs as a group but you cannot collaborate on data analysis or writing. You must cite everything or you will be sent to the honor board. Professor Brown's empathy level is non-existent. Do not underestimate how hard they are to write well. This has to be up there for writing credits in the difficulty of writing. Data analysis will take the bulk of your time. Seriously, don't take this class unless you have to. And be careful what you take with it. I took Mechatronics (MENG 390), this class, thermo (MENG 211), and Materials lab (MENG 286L) the same semester and it was terrible. And that is only 3.5 credits \\.--.\/",
    "If one wants a rigorous lab course to get a writing credit, I would recommend this course. It was a lot of work, so maybe I wouldn't suggest it if you didn't need to take it, however, I did learn a lot, and the workload was manageable at all times, albeit heavy.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but was totally worthwhile. I really couldn't care less about fluids (sorry Eric!) but learning how to take data for an end without someone telling you how to do everything along the way was a great experience. Labs are v e r y long to write up - start your analysis before the weekend and talk to your group often. I enjoyed this class because my group was fun and supportive to work with. Make sure you are happy with your group!!",
    "I would definitely reccomend this class. Yes it was time consuming and challenging but the experiments were very interesting and applied knowledge from the fluids and thermo classes. It also really helped teach how to write a lab report well.",
    "If you're lookin at this course, chances are you're an ABET mechE major who is required to take it. Brown is a good professor but what really matters is who you have for your TA. That basically determines how difficult or easy this class can be. This class really boils down to how well you can collect, analyze, and effectively present data. If you're good at error analysis and writing concisely, it'll all be pretty easy for you. But it's imperative that you talk to your TA and find out EXACTLY what by want on their technical reports. If you stick to what they say, go over your reports with them, and do your data analysis and graph preparation the night after the experiment, you'll be fine.",
    "The course is a lot of work and the lab reports can be tough, but it is a very educational and intellectual course which will reinforce scientific principles with tips and techniques focused on writing style. Take it with Professor Brown! He is the best!"
