    "This is a great class, taught by a very dynamic professor. The material can be a bit daunting but with a little work, not impossible. A background in genetics and biochemistry would be helpful, but having neither, I still survived. I'm not sure I will use the information in the future but if you are looking for a background protein science, this isn't a bad way to get it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course for ENAS students interested in biotechnology and related fields.",
    "I would summarize the course as a survey of the direction that biomolecular engineering is going, at the cutting edge, with a lot of valuable background information that could help with many other courses. Iwould definitely recommend this course to another student because it is so widely relevant, considering the impact that the topics have already had on the chemical industry."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very useful for extending my knowledge in areas directly related to my dissertation and in closely neighboring areas as well",
    "The course exposed me to a large body of seminal papers relating to biomolecular switches and catalysis, among other topics, that make up the major current research thrusts in biomolecular engineering. Also,most of the key concepts that are needed to successfully engineer a protein were discussed in class, further enabling my research. Finally, we each discussed, to a small degree, our research in class and alsonew potential directions for it, which probably helped all students think more critically about their research."
