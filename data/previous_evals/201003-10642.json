   "comments": [
    "Wonderful course. Both Prof. Pessar and Prof. Joseph are forgiving, kind, and incredibly personable. Not to mention well-versed. Class with them both was a genuine pleasure. The material was great, and the writing was great practice. I still have a lot of improvement to do, but this class helped me out a ton. I don't know that much about Latin America, as the Middle East is my specialty, still this was a class I would highly recommend to someone willing to put in the time and effort because its treatment of resistance, social movements, memory, and the marriage of the disciplines of anthropology and history is enough to push any budding scholar to think about issues in a new way. Loved it.Only weakness was the overly critical outlook of many of the students -- I know they want to critique certain parts of the works, but I feel we'd do well to talk about the good we can take away as well... But I hear it comes with the territory in graduate school.",
    "Definitely recommend it. You will learn a lot about the subject matter and, equally importantly, about historical and anthropological methodology.",
    "Anthro 510 is ideal for a student interested in learning more about the research process with regard to the history and anthropology of modern Latin America. The course is impressive in both the breadth of research it covers as well as the depth in which each case study is analyzed. For someone interested in a typical history course focusing on dates and concrete events, I would encourage them to look elsewhere. However, for a student seeking to deepen their understanding of the methodology behind the information they learn in a history or anthro course, Anthro 510 is a wonderful opportunity."

   "comments": [
    "This course's emphasis on methodology was very helpful in thinking about and conducting my own writing and research.",
    "Although I am an undergraduate and not completing a dissertation, I feel that this course will be extremely valuable as I develop my senior thesis. It definitely deepened my understanding of the research process, and feel that it helped me to grasp what kinds of questions a researcher should be asking as well as the methodology behind acquiring the information."
