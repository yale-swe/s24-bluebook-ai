   "comments": [
    "I developed the skill of thinking critically about the minutiae of language that I had not thought to even consider before. I learned that sometimes thinking small and literally is the best way to go.",
    "The Mental Lexicon genuinely helped me to think more critically about language and the production of thought and ideas. Prof. Piango says it well during the first day of class: you will think differently about language by the end of the term. We delved into complex academic papers by the end of the term that I personally had never had exposure to, and I came out slightly more confident in my abilities to read and engage with them. The concepts gone over in the class, though very academic, are applicable to real life, and you will find yourself thinking about them in your interactions outside of class.",
    "I learned basic concepts of linguistics, as well as viewing language as a tool instead of a concept or a thing in itself.",
    "I was able to gain a deeper understanding of what a language is and what it means to really know a language."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course for me were the interesting subject material and the small class size. The weaknesses were that we did not really come away with a lot of concrete linguistic knowledge. I wouldn't really change anything about the course though because the things we discussed were incredibly interesting even if they weren't completely tangible.",
    "Prof. Piango is a brilliant, thought-provoking teacher who guided us through many complicated issues; however, her teaching style is not for everyone and was frustrating at times. Piango is very conceptual in her structuring of the course and often ends up far from her original point. Since our class was so small (5 students with 1 prof and 1 TF), the class often devolved into conversations about tangential concepts, and at the end of the day you didn't really grasp what the main point of that class was. Sometimes we were tested or asked to write about concepts we hadn't gone over in class, and it seemed like there was always a loose end somewhere. I think the conversational style of the class was great and we really learned a lot from each other and our specific questions, but it's definitely a class that's all over the place.",
    "The course is frustrating at times, because the students can feel like their questions are left unanswered, or that there are no direct answers. But, in the end you are able to approach research papers etc. in a way that you wouldn't be able to at the start. I really liked to second half of the course especially where we read and discussed research papers and methods in linguistics.",
    "This course engaged students in discussion and allowed each person to actively participate. It covered a variety of topics related to language, such that each topic was related to the other."

   "comments": [
    "Yes definitely! If you're at all interested in linguistics or thinking about how the mind interprets language you'll come away with a different understanding than when you came in. Also it's a lecture that feels like a seminar which is great.",
    "Maybe. I think the course matter and the readings were very interesting, especially as someone considering a linguistics or cogsci major, though the structure of the teaching and the class were rough at times. I'd recommend it to others who want to learn the basics of linguistics, engage in cool (but disorganized) discussions, and learn to read linguistics papers, but be warned that you really have to put in a lot of effort to engage with the discombobulated structure.",
    "If you are interested in Linguistics, don't want to get too technical, and want a small class environment, yes.",
    "If you want to learn about different perspectives about what you think you know about language, you should take this course."
