   "comments": [
    "This was a great class if you've taken many other science classes (biochem, orgo, etc.). It gives you a better understanding of bridging all your science classes together.",
    "Might have to take it as an upper level elective. No work really except a few psets and take home exams. Exams are a lot more tedious than expected",
    "Take this course! It's a really great course to take for your MCDB upper level requirement. The midterm and final are both open book so as long as you went to lecture and know where in the notes various concepts are covered, then you're set! Some of the lecturers write everything in the notes\/slides, some don't so you should try to make it to lecture whenever you can!",
    "Course is ok, and definitely your go-to if you need a lighter 350+ course. Four p-sets on which you can collaborate with other students and take-home midterm and final (which you can't collaborate with other people on). It's very difficult to motivate yourself to go to class since 1) it's at 9:25am on Hillhouse and 2) instructors often forget to show up to class (since it is a team-taught course). The concepts themselves are pretty interesting, especially the ones Boulpaep teaches since they start with a real-life clinical case, but just keep in mind that if you decide to take the course, you'll have to either force yourself to go to class (not all of the classes are taught so well that you'll want to go) or you won't go and you'll have to just teach yourself the material for the midterm and the final (not impossible but just something to look out for).",
    "MCDB 415 is a very low workload upper level biology class (four problem sets, one take home midterm, one take home final). I took this course because I wanted an easy upper level science elective that would look nice on my transcript. The class is a mix of undergraduates and graduate students. The lectures are given by a number of different professors, primarily Fred Sigworth and Emile Boulpaep. The lecture topics were fascinating, but the content was very challenging and difficult to follow-- especially if you have not taken Physiological Systems or Cell Biology. Because all of the assignments were take home, I found it difficult to motivate myself to actually learn the material in this class. Also, the class as a whole felt very disjointed (there were even two classes where the lecturer for that day did not show up) and there wasn't a lot of support from Professors or the teaching assistants. Overall, I regret taking MCDB 415 this semester; I don't feel as though I learned much from this class, and I believe my time could have been better spent taking another MCDB or MB&B course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Just don't take it. It sounds interesting but it will just be a total bore. Only 4 psets at start of course, then take home midterm and take home final.",
    "This class was very interesting, though some of the lecturers were not my favorite. All of the course material is available online and the exams are take home, making the class really easy for self-study if you want. TAs are very helpful and understanding."
