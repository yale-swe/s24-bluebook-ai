    "Yes, try to get into Profesora Safille's class!The hw is quite elementary but graded very strictly!I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking to brush up on high school spanish, but not to someone who would be learning the material for the first time.",
    "If you have to take this class, do it with Barbara.",
    "Pretty much a standard language class, which you probably need for your language requirement. The work is very manageable as long as you keep up with it.",
    "It is what you expect. The way the course and department are structured makes your learning of language a little formulaic which is also easier sometimes. A nice teacher will make it fun. Some readings are silly, some are excellent, some videos are silly, some are great, movie is great. Take it since you need to and if you want to learn more Spanish, because you will probably do that.",
    "SPAN 130 is a great course, at least with Professor Safille! She is so energetic; you'll never get bored in class. She really wants her students to do well and is quite a character too!",
    "Good review of old topics and new material that is bought at a quick but manageable pace. Good if you want to sharpen up your conversation skills.",
    "If you are taking this class it is probably because you need it for distribution. The course is not easy but you will learn a lot and enjoy it immensely if you take the class with Barbara Safille. Another recommendation don't fall behind on the martial, this class moves right along.",
    "Good class.",
    "It was a good class and covers a language requirement. I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Take this course with Professor Safille\u0097she couldn't have been more engaging and passionate at 1030 in the morning and really made this course for me. The class will be much more enjoyable if you don't fall behind on daily assignments. My one complaint about the class itself is that the majority of the semester felt like a review of level 2, then we were introduced to two or three more relatively difficult concepts and few weeks before the exam.",
    "Take spanish with Barbara!!! She\u00b4s awesome and crazy and loves all of her students with all of her heart and will let you get away with murder because she loves you so much. Every class is like a crazy theater performance. Do it."
