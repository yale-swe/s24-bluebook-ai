   "comments": [
    "This answer depends on the student. The class was open-ended both in assignments and discussions. This works for some people, and doesn't for others.",
    "As I stated before, this class is only for those with absolutelyno prior experience in the WGSS department. Anyone who has ever taken any kind of WGSS or AFAM course at Yale (or in high school) has almost certainly already read most of the texts for this class. However, everyone has to start somewhere, and this is a valuable introduction for those interested in starting to think about the issues of racism, sexism, etc. In the future, I hope that the course can be taught by a professor more willing to dedicate time and energy to the class, as this would highly increase my likelyhood of recommending it to others.",
    "If you're interested in both gender AND race studies, this course is great for you! Depends a lot on student participation and discussion, although Professor Allen also speaks at length about the topics.",
    "Do not take this course, it is a colossal waste of time.",
    "The material and readings for the class were excellent - they pushed me to think about the way in which my identities impact my interactions with the world. That being said, however, I found most of the discussions to be a bit misdirected and anti-climatic. Most of my thinking about the subject occurred when I was writing my weekly reading response and the professor is fairly wishy-washy in terms of directing discussions and giving feedback.",
    "Take it! You will read a lot of things you might not have read otherwise, and it will change the way you view yourself in the world.",
    "If you're genuinely interested in the ways that race, class, gender, and sexuality intersect and influence feminism, take this class. You'll come out knowing much more about society, and much more about yourself, than you would have ever thought you could learn in a semester.That said, Professor Allen has a very unique style of teaching. In order to enjoy this class, you'll have to be comfortable with him changing the syllabus on a weekly basis, grading assignments loosely or not at all, and sometimes devoting class time to whatever strikes him as interesting that day. If predictability and clear-cut guidelines are very important to you, you might really struggle in this class.",
    "It is kind of a hodgepodge of readings on different feminist\/sexuality movements and ideas. it is hard to explain because I don't think the reading was very organized. The final project was very open-ended and fun.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class to freshmen - male and female alike. Especially for those females who would not call themselves \"feminists\", but would like to learn what it really means to be a feminist. Take this course, you won't regret it.",
    "This was one of my most enjoyable classes at Yale so far. If you're at all interested in women's LGBTQ issues, this is a must take. The professor is a little scatterbrained when it comes to assignments, but it's well-taught, the readings are interesting, and class discussions are enlightening. There's a decent amount of work, so don't take it expecting it to be a gut. But if you're interested in the topic, it's an excellent class and the work doesn't feel tedious at all. Highly recommend!",
    "If you can deal with Professor Allen's unorthodox scheduling and having no grades and are VERY interested in spending the semester trying to learn A LOT of theory in a short amount of time with no specific checkpoints to see if you actually are learning this stuff, then go for it. You get out of this course what you put into it."
