    "We had some great field trips, especially the one to York which enhanced our learning experience. Reading primary sources like the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Beowulf was interesting and helpful. Most of us didn't come into this course with a lot of knowledge about this time period\/these people so more lecture\/instruction on the subject would have been helpful before diving into our own discussions.",
    "Strengths: Exciting topic, given the hype from the TV series Vikings. The course is very illuminating about the culture and long-lasting effects of the Viking age in England. The course also helps hone critical thinking and strong analysis of primary sources. Weakness: The structure of the course is quite messy."
