    "Solid freshman seminar, but tons of work and don't necesarily get a ton out of it.",
    "This was an amazing course and was easily one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale so far. I'll admit that I first came in only looking to fulfill one of my distributional requirements and also wanted to have the experience of a freshmen seminar, and this one had such good ratings that I thought maybe I'd give it a try. I see now why the ratings were so high, the take-away that I got out of this class really blew my mind. Having taken mostly STEM courses, most of my previous classes would certainly teach me new things, but this is the only one that actually taught me new ways to think, not just about books, but about life in general. I'm really sad to be leaving this class, and I hope that I'll be able to take other courses at Yale that show me how to (as clich as this sounds) really live my life more fully, as this one did. Furthermore, Professor Campbell is wonderful both as a mentor and as a person. She always had really insightful comments and really listened to what each person had to say. The readings and films she chose for the class were all (and I do mean every single one) interesting, and they can really change your perspective on things. 100% would recommend this course. TAKE IT. SIGN UP FOR IT RIGHT NOW. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I originally took it because I wanted a freshman seminar experience and it also filled my writing requirement for the year. It is fantastic if everybody is on board, which for us was the case. Our seminar group became very close and had some incredibly insightful discussions about all sorts of topics. The class has a very broad curriculum and we studied everything from scientific studies to Owen Wilson movies, making the discussions relevant but also refreshing. Professor Campbell is super nice and she let our most hotly debated topics extend a bit farther than planned, which was cool. She does occasionally talk too much, and thus cover up some students' thoughts, but for the days when you're not really feeling it, this actually helps immensely.",
    "This was an English Freshman seminar on intimacy and communication. It was heavily reading and discussion based. We covered topics such as technology, letters, silence, and food. In this class we also tried new things such as meditation. There were two critical essays and a final project of our choice. There was a lot of reading which was very time consuming, but the topics were always very interesting so it was easy to get lost in it. We also watched several movies as supplementation to our curriculum. This class was a lot of fun and allowed you to get close to other freshman! I would recommend it to any other student.",
    "It was a great experience as my first seminar at Yale. It was very discussion-heavy with Professor Campbell facilitating discussion and letting students carry the conversation.",
    "Would recommend for a writing credit to improve one's writing but to not feel overwhelmed with writing. There is a lot of reading, most of which is not dry and is very interesting, so be prepared for that.",
    "Take this seminar if you are lucky enough to get in! All of the units are interesting and super relevant. The readings come from all kinds of sources and are engaging and comprehensible, and you get to watch a ton of entertaining movies that actually connect really well with the topics you talk about in class. Class discussions are lively and everyone builds upon each others' ideas, although sometimes Professor Campbell can spend a little too much time expanding on her own thoughts. The workload is definitely manageable and the papers and final project can be fun to write and work on. Overall, LOVED this class-- it has really made me think about my own relationships and ways that I communicate with myself and others in this world!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS if you can get in. If you don't get in at first and are on the waitlist, stay and do what you can to get off the waitlist.",
    "This class is just amazing. Definitely take it if you can get in. The material is fascinating and the books and movies you watch (for the most part, minus like one movie) are really interesting and not too difficult to understand. You write two essays, and on the first one you get to revise it, which the whole class agreed was a really helpful experience and helps you get the best grade you can manage. The final project is also so much fun to create, but at the same time you learn so much from it if you put effort into it. I feel that was the overall experience of the class. If you care about this class, you can learn so much about communications and intimacy, not just between other people, but also with yourself in your own life. I felt like I came out of this class with new ideas and knowledge that I can actually use; rather than just information that will be helpful in a job. This was my favorite class that I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "I haven't taken another English class but I can't fathom a class that is better than this one. She developed me greatly as a writer and as a person."
