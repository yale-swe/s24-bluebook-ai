    "I wouldnt recommend it even though it is a science class for non-science majors and had minimal workload. I just didnt enjoy the class very much because of the weird layout of the semester and how we got settled in the textbook style learning, only to turn it around and start discussing novels that related to immunology.",
    "Take it for a good fifth class and science credit. Prof. Kavathas is a little scatterbrained but the TA is awesome. Also the class is pretty interesting and the books are great.",
    "EASY TAKE IT. You learn a lot about the immune system and autoimmune diseases.",
    "I highly recommend the course if you are a non-science major. It covers tons of important information on immunology and how microorganisms infect and interact with hosts. I understand disease much better as a general concept (such as ways that microorganisms circumvent the immune system and immune system functions). Again, highly recommend it if you are at all interested in disease and don't care to compete against pre-meds in bio courses.",
    "Great way to get a science credit. First half of the class is tough--all science. But once you're past the midterm, you will be happy you took this class for a SC credit. You read a couple of novels, give a presentation and write a final paper (for a science class!). Not a bad deal.",
    "The beginning of this class is tough, and you really have to learn your basic immunology for the midterm. Sometimes it seems impossible to understand lecture, and you'll have to pull the threads together for yourself. But, after that dastardly midterm, this course is simply great. You read great books and talk about them. It's not stressful after Spring Break. You learn a bit about different microorganisms and write\/present on an interesting topic of your choice. Just pick something you like and it will be great, and it doesn't have to be too scientific. So, if you can get through the first half (which is legitimately interesting, but also challenging and frustrating), then it's worth it for the second half!",
    "It was overall a good course. The first part of the course was very biology heavy but manageable. The professor is very engaging and makes an effort to know her students. After learning about the key concepts of immunology, we were able to better understand scientific readings and non-fiction works. The two books we read were Polio:An American Story and the Immortal Life of Heinretta Lacks. They were both good reads. I learned",
    "This course gives a good introduction to basic concepts in immunology but falls apart when it comes to the portion of the course on diseases. A very doable science class for non-science majors. AND BY VERY DOABLE I MEAN REALLY EASY. So easy that if you are looking for much more than the nitty gritty basics of immunology and an hour on a smattering of diseases choose a different science class. After taking another more challenging science credit for non-science majors, this one got embarrassingly easy because the second half of the course there was no quiz.",
    "This is a fairly easy science for non-science majors kind of class. The lectures aren't always incredibly coherent, but since you're not tested on any material after the midterm it ends up okay. The topics are fairly interesting.",
    "If you really are not into the intense science classes here, then take this class. I came in knowing basically nothing about science and immunology and came out of the class with a pretty solid basic foundation of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you're interested in just learning about the immune system, take it.",
    "Good course for non-science majors. The work is really front-heavy, but if you survive the midterm, you're in the clear.",
    "This class is wonderful for people looking to learn a lot but not be in an intense environment. The first part of the semester is a lot of memorizing and science based material, but the second part is more case studies, novels, and analyzing disease from a socioculutral perspective.",
    "Take this class. You will not regret it. Very manageable workload: two problem sets, one midterm, final paper (NO final exam). Amazing material too. But be warned - this is not a gut class. You need to study to take the midterm and if you haven't been listening to lectures your final paper experience will be torture, since you will need to suddenly pull concepts and a general understanding of the immune system out of your ass. If you stay on top of the work you will be just fine. Take it especially if Edward Schmid will be TF-ing it again. He MAKES this course.",
    "Yes if you want an easy science cred. No if you're gonna major in the sciences cuz you have other sci classes that you need to take, don't waste your time with this one.",
    "Yes!"
