   "comments": [
    "I took this class because I wanted a fundamental understanding of the topic while not planing on majoring in it. The class was often very frustrating because in class examples are not explained fully and answer keys aren't always correct. Professor Peccia is a fun professor though. At the end of this semester, I'm glad I took the class, but it was mentally and academically challenging and I feel like I didn't need to go through so much frustration.",
    "I enjoyed it as it is related to my major. Not a gut so probably wouldn't recommend for someone just trying to get Sc or Qr credit",
    "Want to take a chill class but also learn something interesting and useful? This is your class. It's easy, I mean the easiest class I've taken at Yale by far, but also I learned more than I have in some more challenging classes. Like I never though that water treatment could possibly be interesting, I thought it was definitely the most boring thing possible. Now, every time I turn on a tap I think about where the water's coming from and where it's going. It's kinda cool. So have an open mind. Even if you're not super interested in the environment or engineering, this class might be pretty sweet.",
    "Definitely take it if you have any interest in environmental engineering. If you're already good at basic inorganic chemistry this class will be a breeze. You get cheat sheets on the exams so you don't really have to study and can do very well. Homework does take a fair bit of time but there were only really 5 psets in the semester.",
    "Ah, environmental engineering. A class to give you the bedrock to address harrowing issues of climate devastation... Nope, the class elides \"environment\" with just unit conversions, glorified ratios, and contrived standards for how to write these ratios. \"2+2, but it's different because I'm telling you it's 2 Arsenics and 2 Agent Oranges, in units of ppm-- and oranges. Combine them.\" You'll pretend that lakes function like water tanks so you can just use a natural log. This class could be greatly improved by having students engineer some product or write an EIA, but as of now you don't. On the redeeming side, you will get a great-out-of-class and nice professor in Dr. Peccia, who actually cares a lot about the environmental disasters that aren't really in his curriculum. One day he may digress to cover Flint, Mi, and you'll find yourself fascinated by how a standard E.Coli clorination effort caused pipe pH swings, both releasing trihalomethanes and leaching out lead. You'll wish that was on the test. It won't be.",
    "Recommend for anyone interested in chemistry but not majoring in the sciences",
    "If you're looking for both a science and a QR and you don't mind doing chemistry (like me), you'll overall enjoy this class! It's a good broad introduction to environmental engineering (although it's mostly just chemistry applied to environmental issues). Professor Peccia really made this class for me--he was just so down to earth and helpful and willing to engage with the students. Material is at times dry, just AP Chem. Not a difficult class, but not quite a gut.",
    "Great introductory course. You learn about the different topics that surround environmental engineering, such as water treatment, air pollution, chemical reaction rates and mass balances of substances in environmental systems. A lot of times it feels like applied chemistry and focuses a lot on specific problem solving methods. Manageable workload and very enjoyable if you take it with Peccia. Even as an outsider to the major, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend ENVE120. I think that it was an interesting learning experience. Even though it made me decide not to pursue environmental engineering as a major (because of the content, not this class), I still learnt a lot of valuable problem solving skills. So, while I don't think that the content is particularly useful for non-environmental engineers, the skills are.",
    "Good course. reasonable workload. Engaging prof. Cool material. I took it for a science credit and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the course.",
    "Yes, If you like science and math. I would recommend taking the course.",
    "CENG 120 is a survey course, and at times resembles more chemistry than anything else. The psets might at times be murky, but group work is encouraged and Professor Peccia will provide help when necessary. It seems to me that while you will be exposed to topics in engineering, you might need further courses to know whether it is truly of interest to you.",
    "A wonderful class, a fun requirement to fill for the ENVE major, but also a great class for anyone looking to fulfill a science credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I would say that this course seems like a good introduction to environmental engineering and it covers a wide variety of topics. The course is engaging and an interesting application to many real life problems.",
    "Good course. Pretty easy going, but technical enough that you generally aren't bored and will learn some worthwhile stuff. I recommend it.",
    "Take it if you're in Energy Studies, or ENVE, or want to learn about this stuff with a chill science credit",
    "ENVE 120 is a pretty solid intro to environmental engineering, but it is pretty open to non ENVE majors. Of you need a QR and want a guy this may not be it, but it is very interesting.",
    "Would recommend - it's a good overview with not much work.",
    "Intro Environmental Engineering was an interesting course, and it covers a broad range of topics in environmental engineering. We covered topics as diverse as acid\/base chemistry and water treatment systems, and I feel that the course has given me more of a feel for the field. I would recommend the course to another student, especially one who is interested in the environment. It helps to have a basic background in chemistry. Overall, it was an interesting course and I learned a lot!",
    "Do not take this class if you are not interested in the subject or do not have a good background in chem. Psets are confusing and hard and take a lot of time to complete, the class is very math\/chem based and you dont learn much about the applications of what you are doing. The class is poorly taught and uninteresting.",
    "Good intro class, not too big of workload but pretty hard if you're not math\/science oriented. Prof. Peccia really wants everyone to do well though and will help if you're struggling.",
    "It's a lot of intro Chem review. Kind of boring. Good class if you're looking for something easy and moderately interesting",
    "Good class, homeworks are really hard but if you get help they're not bad. Tests are MUCH more straightforward (Peccia does it on purpose), and the class is good. Peccia is cool and a fun professor. Take it for a science credit, but it's not a gut. Overall would recommend.",
    "It's a very introductory course, but you will hit a lot of the main points of what environmental engineering entails. Professor Peccia is kind and approachable, and the workload is neither too heavy nor too dependent on past STEM knowledge if you're someone who wants to take the course, but isn't necessarily an engineering major. The lectures focus on solving engineering problems, though some focus on some real world pressing environmental engineering issues. There are lots of interesting applications to take away."
