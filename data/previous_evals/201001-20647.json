   "comments": [
    "This class demands a lot of study, particularly of kanji. There is some conversation, but it is mostly helpful if you are hoping to improve your reading speed, comprehension, and comfort level.",
    "This class is a good chance to encounter and explore several genres and forms of cultural output from the postwar period in Japan. Because the weekly assignments included novels, short stories, films, essays, and photographs of art, there was a lot of variety and the discussions really moved across a wide area of the cultural field.Based on the content of the course, I would recommend it to a fellow student as a good way tocover a lot of interesting ground in a key period of Japan's modern history.I can't make any recommendations based on the teachr because Chris Hill is leaving-- it would depend on who was teaching the class.",
    "I highly recommend this class, even for people with no background in Japan or Japanese history. The readings, though at times challenging, are applicable to several fields.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. While I had previously taken a course in Postwar Japanese Literature, this course offered a very different perspective on Postwar Japanese Culture that incorporated literature, film, intellectual history, economics,and art history. I have a much, much better grasp of the subject matter because of this course."

   "comments": [
    "As a graduate student in East Asian studies, I need to be able to perfect my ability to read long selections in Japanese with accurate comprehension, so this class was key to my development. It is enabling me to start gaining access to scholarly articles and novels in Japanese.",
    "This knowledge attained in this class will be very helpful for my future research.",
    "This course may have very well altered my intended dissertation topic. It was a major turning point in my graduate student trajectory."
