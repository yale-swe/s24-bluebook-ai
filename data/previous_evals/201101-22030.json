    "In this class you learn how to conduct an orchestra. However there is no orchestra to learn on, so the members of the class (about half of them School of Music students) fill in on whatever instruments they can play, over and over again, as kids take turns conducting. This makes for good hands-on experience, but I imagine it was a bit tiring for the wind players. By the end, I felt comfortable in front of an orchestra, though it was unclear if that was due to this class or to other experiences I had during the semester.",
    "I would recommend this as a fifth or even sixth class. The work load is entirely dependent on the individual. Some people took it upon themselves to memorize scores off the bat, others hadn't seemed to look at them until they were on the podium. Avoid taking this class if there are upwards of ten people in it... with conducting, individual attention is important (it also holds you to account).",
    "This course is a gift to Yale musicians who should be very excited by the opportunity to study conducting with a master. The practical format of the class is probably unique in being a workshop or conducting lab, as the students are mostly musicians, it is possible to form a small orchestra which is then conducted by each student individually at least once a week or more."
