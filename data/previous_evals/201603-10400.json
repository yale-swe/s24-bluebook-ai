   "comments": [
    "This course definitely pushes you to think about every little thing critically: every design choice is expected to have a purpose. While tedious and frustrating at times, this does benefit you in the long run and teaches you to think about things in different ways.",
    "This course taught think creatively and in a way that, since I'm not an art major, was very different from what I was used to. It was at times difficult, but rewarding to get out of my routine with something different.",
    "I learned how to critically evaluate works of graphic design. In addition, I learned how to create a book and use InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. The computer programs were primarily self-taught.",
    "Aside from learning the basics of graphic design, I was happy to learn about the way my other classmates thought when approaching a project, and it's taught me new ways to view an assignment. I've also learned that an assignment cannot be perfect in the first go; it takes time and multiple revisions and even then you might still not be completely satisfied with the end result. In addition, peer reviews are extremely helpful when figuring out how to revise your first draft.",
    "A student, regardless of their background, learns so many things throughout this course. From representing a word through form or the other way around, to typography and the details involved in it, and to creating a visually striking design, a student will be able to become more graphically fluent. I learned to visualize my message in an efficient and aesthetically pleasing way while at the same time keeping the design interesting. I also learned that the simplest of designs can take multiple tries to perfect, and that simplicity sometimes comes from 100s of tries."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Yeju is incredibly knowledgeable. The projects offer a broad exposure. Weaknesses: Crits can be very long, and some projects get talked about for longer periods of time than those towards the end.",
    "You have the opportunity to do many different projects, and that's good, but the software is barely taught (one tutorial in the beginning of the year is not enough) and you're expected to be able to use it well. For those of us who had never used InDesign or Illustrator before, we were at a significant disadvantage during the second half of the course, and I feel my creativity was limited to what I could do in the software. So it would be very helpful to have more class time devoted to learning it, since it is a big part of the course.",
    "The class consisted almost entirely of critical reviews of our work and others. Although this is extremely beneficial it can get boring and unproductive. I wish the class spent some critiquing and analyzing other famous works of graphic design or learning about fundamental principles of graphic design.",
    "The pace the course was taught at was a good pace for an introduction class; I felt at first that we didn't do enough projects and too many revisions, but then afterwards I realized those revisions were necessary to complete the previous project. Though, I think dedicating the entire class time to solely peer review at times is a little too much, especially when it comes to reviewing a 3rd revision.",
    "Strengths of this course is of course the content itself and how the critiques are formatted. By having each peer comment on your work each week, you are able to take note and improve every week throughout the course. I also thought that the fact that unless asked, no one really knows their grade in the class allowed me to really focus on producing higher quality work rather than just \"doing it for the grade\" Being able to learn the software and the design skills through application was also another strength of this course, and being in a small class of motivated individuals helped me a lot to improve. A weakness may be the fact that sometimes the class went over, but that's such a minor concern."

    "This course can be difficult and frustrating at times if you experience \"design block\". This course definitely pushes you to think about every little thing critically: every design choice is expected to have a purpose. While tedious and frustrating at times, this does benefit you in the long run and teaches you to think about things in different ways.",
    "I think this course is suited toward a specific type of student. The Professor expects many hours of work to be put in to each project, and the reality is, if you want to become very good at graphic design, you're going to need to spend lots of time doing it. Also, you're expected to use InDesign and Illustrator for projects, but neither software is actually taught (beyond one extremely basic InDesign tutorial- but you're expected to go beyond what is taught there). So if you're not already familiar with the software, know you will be at an extreme disadvantage. I would say only take this course if you have previous graphic design experience and the time to spend hours each day on it.",
    "Absolutely",
    "If you are very interested in graphic design, this is a great course to take. Ms. Choi is extremely enthusiastic and will give great advice on your pieces, and the overall learning experience will not be a waste at all.",
    "Yes. Even if you have not taken a single art course (I had taken none prior to this), this is a STRONGLY recommended course not just for art majors, but anyone who would like to be more attentive to the design that surrounds them EVERY DAY. It makes you appreciate the work that is put into any kind of serious design and helps you become more visually fluent. The skills you learn here will not be enough to make you the best graphic designer in the world, but it will certainly get you interested in a design language and allow you to look and aim for the right things when you design in the future. That being said, this is a serious class, and everyone is expected to put in the work. No work means you get nothing out this class and you basically waste 4 hours of your week listening to people talk. Some people may be under the impression that this course will consume your life, but it really doesn't if you plan everything out well and you work on each project and hour or two every day (unless more is needed). Anyone who is looking for an intellectually challenging yet REALLY fun course, take this class."
