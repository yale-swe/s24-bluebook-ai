   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for anyone interested in the history of the early republic. As a masters student, I thought it was an ideal way to familiarize myself with the major historiographical developments in the field.",
    "Great course, even if early republic is not your time period (particularly the perfect way to gain a background basis if you're working in US history in the 19th or 20th century). I would definitely recommend this course to anyone working 18th or 19th century US.",
    "Readings course in the early national period, constitution to 1830 or so. Readings cover social, intellectual, cultural history with themes of race, gender, religion, geographic space and more; very comprehensive view of the field and literature in it; assignments are relevant and important to further academic development, historiography, book reviews, class discussion, facilitation; Excellent course for all American history grad students. Highly recommended.",
    "An excellent introduction to the debates and issues surrounding the field of early American history. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject."

   "comments": [
    "The early republic is just barely after the time period I'm planning to work in, so it was perfect interms of overall material. More importantly, I would not have done the same research paper in another course if it had not been for an idea\/methodology I got from this class.",
    "Extremely useful to overall knowledge and my future teaching assignments, further study.",
    "Although not directly related to my dissertation, it deepened my knowledge of my country's history and introduced me to ways of historiographic thinking and research which will be useful to me in the future."
