    "Definitely use this opportunity to explore a field of research you are genuinely interested in. It can be very rewarding",
    "I mean, this is the senior research requirement for MCDB. You're probably only doing this because you have to. Try to find a fun lab, that could make or break your experience. The requirements themselves for the thesis are fine, just try to spread out your presentation from your poster and the paper or you might struggle trying to do it all at once.",
    "It is the second half of a necessary class for the MCDB major. Not a bad class depending on the PI.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 486 to an MCDB student who may not have enough hours in the week to devote to research, as necessary in MCDB 495, which requires 20 hours per week.",
    "You have to take this course as a senior or the other intensive research course.",
    "good",
    "The second half of a normal \"research for credit\" experience. It is very work heavy at the end with the sequence of presentation, poster, and paper, but it encouraged a good progression of compiling information.",
    "As someone who joined a lab senior year, I have to emphasize that the experience of this senior course varies drastically from student to student depending on how long they've worked in their lab, how much lab experience they have, and the relationship between the student and mentor\/PI (which depends heavily on the characters and work styles of both individuals). If you have found a lab that researches material you are deeply interested in\/fascinated by, pursue it. One thing that seriously determines the quality of the experience in lab is who your mentor is inside the lab. If you and your mentor get along well, a great experience is promised to you. If not, you will learn patience throughout the course (and know you are not the only one.)",
    "This course is a great way to get credit for laboratory experience, something a science student should be conducting anyway.",
    "Great chance to do research as an undergrad. Be prepared to put a lot of effort in this class, but you will earn a ton of practical experience which I think is invaluable.",
    "Definitely take the class if you're interested in research!",
    "This is a senior project for MCDB.",
    "I would suggest doing the intensive major because if you want to get any work done in lab, you kind of HAVE to spend about 20 hours a week there. This seems more relaxed and doable, but it's really hard to find a balance. Otherwise, it's a nice requirement and research is fun.",
    "Senior requirement. Make sure you enjoy your lab and your research and just stick with it. Very rewarding if you do!",
    "If you want a BS in MCDB this class is required. As long as you keep up with your own lab work throughout the year, give a good effort in your experimentation, and show your PI that you care and are interested in the science, then you will be fine.",
    "Good way to fulfill the senior requirement, unless you really want the credits from the intensive research version. For 486 you'll need to do a mid-year grant proposal, an end-of-term research manuscript, a poster presentation, and an oral presentation. Not too bad."
