    "The lectures in class are a bit boring, even if you're, like me, really into Roman History. The readings get a bit heavy at times if you try to read every single page and word assigned.",
    "The TA John Lee is great, and the class material is interesting. A good understanding of classical history is important in a liberal arts education.However, Prof. Metcalf cannot be less inspiring as only five people decided to take this class. Not only the students, but the professor himself fell asleep three times this semester, once while the TA gave a lecture on Roman slavery, once when he attended section to hear us to give presentations, and once during the final exam and snored loudly.But Roman history is an a great subject. You get to learn things like Servius Tullius's head spontaneously combusted like the Danish flag at a cartoonist convention.",
    "Material is great, professor is awful. Only take this class if you really love the subject matter. Do not take this class thinking it is an easy writing credit."
