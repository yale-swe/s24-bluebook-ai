   "comments": [
    "Great course- fun, interesting, informative, and overall very enjoyable. I highly recommend this course, whether to count towards a major or just for the chance too look at the world in a new light! It is the best way to really listen and discuss the ideas and viewpoints of fellow students.",
    "A lot of majors find this class sort of dry, but if enjoy debating and discussing theory, you will love it (I did). Even if you don't, you will like the professor and appreciate the workload (weekly reading responses 2-3 pages in length and no final of any kind).",
    "Yes because it helps broaden your views of art.",
    "yep",
    "Excellent! The format is interesting, the ideas are fascinating, and the variation in class discussions always kept things fresh. If you can take it with Professor Cooke, ABSOLUTELY DO IT. Professor Cooke is the best teacher that I have had in my time at Yale. He is thoughtful, kind, intellectually rigorous, and an amazing discussion leader. He made the class a joy every single week and his paper comments really pushed me to think more deeply. He's a gem and this class is incredibly fun.",
    "Yes. It's a helpful course even for non majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend Critical Approaches to another student! I loved the class, especially because of Ned Cooke, and it helped provide a great base of knowledge. I also loved going around Yale and finding art in unexpected places.",
    "Take it definitely, it completely changed the way I see the world, objects, and human condition. I was completely lost and desperate first few weeks, but it soon got better, with rhythm kicking in and all. You read very important materials that are extremely useful, and stretches your mind\/thinking skills. You also get to visit all these unconventional places each week to write a paper, and it's actually quiet fun..and Yale campus starts to look different....",
    "It's a seminar where we look at different perspectives and methods of approaching art objects, and then apply these perspectives each week by going to the galleries and to different public art pieces on campus. I would definitely recommend it, even if you're not taking it as as a required art history major course."
