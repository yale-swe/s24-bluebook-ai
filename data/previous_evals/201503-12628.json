    "Would definitely recommend",
    "Take this course, for Marta and for the material. The military dictatorship in Brazil has so much to it: literature, art, film, music - you name it a discipline, and there's something to it. The workload is light, as the focus is on talking in class, and the content-based nature of the course makes the in-class focus of the class even better. A great L5 option for Portuguese.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you want to be in a class that is the literal embodiment of Brazil. Leave everything you knew behind and learn to love the order of disorder. This class was a breath of fresh air in a stuffy university. Marta is hilarious, brutally honest, and incredibly cool. Don't expect to be pampered, but expect to learn a lot about Rio and Human Nature.",
    "Treat this class as a representation of Brazilian culture- no deadlines, random grading, random off topic conversations, but fun."
