   "comments": [
    "It's a great class, you learn things without even realizing you're learning.",
    "Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. I would recommend this course to anyone vaguely interested in Biology, it's so good.",
    "I would summarize MB&B 730 as the best graduate class you will take during your first year. You will get to know everyone in your group and you get to dive in and read all those papers that you hear about in textbooks.",
    "Perhaps the most enjoyable, helpful, and pertinent course I have ever taken.",
    "You are assigned three papers to read and understand each week. The papers are grouped thematically and are generally highly cited, important work. You meet with other students one night to discuss the papers together and work through points that you don't understand. (This is important because the papers are often difficult.)Later in the week the group meets in a seminar with the instructors to discuss the papers in detail. The discussions generally focus on what the data in the paper are, how it was obtained and why the authors drew the conclusions they did from it.",
    "I would summarize it as a primary literature based course that will equalize everyone's ability to pick apart papers. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, this is a unique class in which you can learn to read papers critically and discuss issues with colleagues. Can be time consuming reading all the papers thoroughly, but the class is definitely worth it.",
    "I would summarize this class as an interactive discussion on the techniques and methodologies of biochemistry. I would strongly recommend this course to another student because it covers interesting topics and the interactive nature of the course allows for discussion and debate.",
    "Read a lot of papers and evaluate the importance of the experiments and how they relate to the big icture",
    "You read a lot of papers and talk about them in depth. Intense, but totally worth it in order to improve your ability to think about many different aspects of the the scientific process. Take it if you can.",
    "Would definitely recommend to another student, in any biologically related field. It was a very useful class not only due to some of the subject matter discussed, but due to the mind set and way of thinking developed, which is more universal across the sciences.",
    "One of the best classes I've ever taken. Absolutely essential to learning how to think like a scientist.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that it is a lot of work but that it's a really good learning experience, and it also gives you the opportunity to become a lot closer with the rest of the BBSB students.",
    "Absolutely. My favorite class thus far.",
    "This class is a lot of reading and critical thinking, but I would definitely recommend it. It teaches one how to approach scientific readings with a critical eye.",
    "BBSB students have to take it...so yeah.But be prepared for the most intellectual fun you've ever had (I think). This is a chance to get to know your fellow students, and it's really the first chance you'll have to feel like a scientist - able to assess and question ideas like never before.So take it - but not only that. Participate - make an effort. You'll be glad you did.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "Read many important papers and better understood foundations of the discipline. I do wish there were more early biophysics papers",
    "Helped teach me how to think about approaching a problem, what needs to be considered when designing an experiment, etc.",
    "It very much helped deepen my knowledge of my discipline by making me read some of the fundamental papers in the field. So it helped me understand how the discoveries were made, what the methods used were, etc.",
    "This course taught me a lot about how the field developed. This significantly contributed to my dissertation and research in that it taught me how to better read the primary literature.",
    "I learned a lot in terms of how to read papers critically, which is crucial for a career in science. I also learned a lot of the history in molecular biology and the vast numbers of possible experiments and methods that are available for biochemists. In the final proposal presentation, I feel like I got a taste of what qualifying exam would be like.",
    "The focus on critical thinking and limitations of methodology on results helped to deepen my understanding of how scientific experiments can be interpreted and how thorough science must be in order to explain what the scientist hopes to convey to others.",
    "This course helped me to develop skills at becoming critical of experimental results.",
    "This course really helped me develop the proper ways of approaching scientific problems and evaluating primary scientific literature, both of which will be incredibly useful in the future.",
    "Dissecting historic papers is incredibly useful to learning the logic behind experiments and publications. In addition, it was very useful to see how experiments changed over time and the consequences of each new experiment.",
    "It helped me to be a lot better at reading papers and actually discerning which information is important from papers.",
    "I wouldn't say that the course deepened my understanding of science - it actually broadened it. Now, I realize that there's a lot more work to be done - but because it's kind of the work that I've been longing to do, I'm not too worried about that.What I'll take away from this is a quotation from Mark (or maybe Tony) - \"In science, think more - experiment less.\"It's a bit of a yoke to bear from now on, but one that will make me a better scientist in the long run (I think)."
