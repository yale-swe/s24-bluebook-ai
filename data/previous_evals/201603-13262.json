    "The journal club and seminar series throughout the semester is a good way to engage with other students within EHS. The readings this semester were much more manageable than previous semesters, which is appreciated during heavier weeks during the semester. Every other week during journal club, two students present a research article and the rest of the cohort discusses content, questions, and suggestions for future research.",
    "Great",
    "I love having the opportunity to discuss papers and topics freely, to ask questions, and hypothesize about things. I also appreciate having the opportunity to become familiar with different kinds of work in environmental health. I think that the primary weakness of the seminar is that discussion is often hard to sustain. I wonder if discussion might receive a boost if we read two papers for each seminar, which would allow us to discuss the papers in conversation with each other.",
    "I felt like the discussions needed more structure, or perhaps something we should learn from each article (a statistical method?). I also think that the discussions were hampered by the number of students who did not do the reading each week, but I also understand that they're under a huge workload from their other coursework and have to prioritize the readings about which their knowledge will be evaluated.",
    "good to read amazing papers together with my classmates",
    "I think that the instructor did a good job in trying to foster a discussion between the students in the course. However, I think that this goal was impeded by the apathy of the other students. I am not sure if there would be a way to build more excitement from the students. A course of this nature is reliant on the participation of the students. Otherwise, I would say that it was a good course.",
    "good",
    "I understand why first year EHS students should be required to take this seminar, but there is no reason why 2nd year EHS students should have to take this seminar. Other YSPH concentrations do not require their second year students to attend weekly seminars. As a second year EHS student, we should be extended this same privilege as second years in other concentrations. This ZERO credited class takes time out of our week, when we could be putting that time towards things of more importance like writing our thesis or searching for jobs."

    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0I have especially appreciated when Dr. Chen provides additional context to the articles we are reading for the seminar, as in the background about the paper which was retracted and later published in a different journal. I think she could pose more questions to the group to get discussion going, but has done a good job of creating an atmosphere that, at least to me, feels like a nonjudgmental space for discussion.",
    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0Very passionate about the subject and very helpful!",
    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0Prof. Chen is good",
    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0I think that Dr. Chen did a fine job with the course. I do think that it would be nice if there were ways to build more excitement about the papers. I found the students to be very apathetic. However, it is not Dr. Chen's fault. I wonder if there are techniques that she could employ to build more discussion around the topics.",

    "Yes. Very useful",
    "This is an occasional seminar where we discuss papers written by authors who give talks the following week. It's an opportunity to get a sense of current research in the field of environmental health.",
    "You get more out of it if you do the readings!",
    "yes, very interesting and can broaden our horizon in environmental health fields.",
    "This course is a discussion on the current topics in the Field of Environmental Health Sciences. I would recommend this course to another student because it forces us to connect with ideas in the field that we otherwise would not have connected with. It also forces us to understand the research of guest lecturers. This can create better discussions with these guests.",
    "good",
    "This is the most pointless course ever, especially since it is ZERO credits. Zero-credited seminars should be optional and not required."
