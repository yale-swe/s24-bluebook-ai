   "comments": [
    "This source\/ seminar is a good way to be introduced to different fields of geology and geophysics and get acquainted with the different avenues of research in the same. It is not always easy to understand everything that is discussed in a seminar, but even hearing different technical terms or being introduced to new concepts is a good learning exercise. It made me more familiar with fields that I did not know much about. For me, this course served as a means to expose myself to ongoing research in different fields in geophysics and related controversies in the validity of their results. I did not know about most of those topics so it served as a good introduction to these new concepts. Moreover, listening to logical reasoning and discussion between people more knowledgeable than me was a very good experience from which I hope to learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to any geophysics student as it helps to polish your presenting skills and learn new material.",
    "Good seminar. learned a lot!"
