   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who ALREADY has interest in the topic. It is definitely a class where you have to have some drive to stay engaged in class discussions and keep up in the reading. It is a lot of reading though!",
    "I cannot recommend this class enough. Take this class if you have the chance to. Professor Levin is an amazing professor and is gifted at leading thought-provoking discussions. I have come away from this class with a new appreciation for epic poetry, in which I only had a cursory interest in prior to taking the class. What you will learn in this class is not limited to the classroom, because the readings and the class encourage you to think about greater questions in life. The readings are enjoyable and the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "Yes, absolutely--you'll get an in depth study of several important works in the Western tradition and it's set up in such a way that you can appreciate how they have built off of one another.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, regardless of experience level in the humanities. The works you get to read are almost all fantastic, and Professor Levin is brilliant and incredibly kind. We only had six students in our class, and discussions were always interesting. Overall great course!",
    "Absolutely! Take the class."
