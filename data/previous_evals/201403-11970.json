   "comments": [
    "If you are slightly interested in latin american literature or magical realism take this course, you will not regret it. Prof. Gonzalz makes it very enjoyable, even though some of the texts may be difficult at times. We cover great authors of the 20th century such as Garca Mrquez, Borges, Rlfo, but also from colonial latin america such as El Inca Garcilaso and Pan.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student, primarily because of the quality of the professor and his high status as a scholar of Latin American literature.",
    "Great class, every lecture will be very entertaining and you will actually learn quite a bit. Professor Gonzlez Echevarra wants everybody to get out of the class with a good understanding of what magical realism means and of how Latin American Literature evolve into it. The work load is very manageable, and fun!",
    "Amazing readings. Bad lectures. He spent the latter half of the course name-dropping and telling stories about his connections to various authors. Take it credit\/d\/fail and it's not a lot of work.",
    "Magical Realism is a cool class, probably good for a 5th class. The readings are interesting and weird, and you wouldn't read them in any other class. They also aren't that long. The papers are all really short, and the midterm and final are not tricky. Prof. Gonzalez is nice, and not a hard grader. But if you really want to read only Magical Realism, this probably isn't your class. We read some, but a lot of the class was talking about how Magical Realism was shaped by other works.",
    "Would not recommend. Prof Gonzlez is incredibly well read and knowledgeable, but does not prepare enough for his lectures and instead spends the entire time either asking for class participation that isn't useful or musing on his own personal interactions with the authors we read for class. You won't come away from this class with a comprehensive understanding of 20th century Latin American literature and the various methods of analyzing it -- in fact, barely any analysis exists in the lectures at all.",
    "This was a good class. The professor is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter, and he is friends with many of the authors which was fun to hear about! He focuses a lot on the history of the authors\/stories and I wish we had spent more time on literary analysis. You go through a lot of material in the class and I feel like I have a good overview of the history of Magical Realism in Latin America now. The workload is very manageable.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT! The course is enough work to keep you engaged, but not enough to overwhelm you. The discussions are interesting. Professor Gonzlez Echevarra will say some mindblowing things about the literature in lecture. You'll be grateful to have read all the material in the syllabus. In terms of workload, the class is two tests (midterm and final) and four two-page papers. It never becomes overwhelming and you get to choose what stories you write about. If you want a survey course on the most important literary movement in Latin America, you need to take this class!",
    "Recommended for anyone intewrested in literature or latin american literature.",
    "Don't recommend. Professor Gonzalez spends most of class leisurely talking slowly about the life of the writers (sometimes literally reads from their Britannica article) and then about what a great friendship he once had with them. If you're lucky he'll say one or two insightful things about the text at the end of class. He knows certain texts quite well, Marquez for example. But the majority of the course can be gleaned from wikipedia pages and your time is best spent just doing that.",
    "Take this class. It's really magical. Puns always intended. Professor Echevarra is a complete treat, and not to be missed. And these texts should be read, and read again. Start now.",
    "If you are interested in Latin America, hoping to read some phenomenal literature, or looking to learn from an excellent professor, this is the course for you. Professor Gonzalez Echevarria is the expert in this area - he knows many of the authors personally, and created the anthology the course follows - and his stories in lecture are as entertaining as those you will read.",
    "I thought this was a very solid course to introduce someone to Latin American literature. The books solid are incredible, the professor has a deep and thorough knowledge of the material, and the class itself is light and always new and intriguing. Don't take this class, however, if you're solely interested in Garcia Marquez, not that much time is spent on him."
