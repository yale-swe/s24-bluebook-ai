    "English 114 01 is not only an excellent introductory writing class for freshmen, but also an opportunity to expose yourself in fields you never got to know in high school.I would definitely recommend English 114 01 to another student because I'm sure he or she will enjoy it just as I do.",
    "English 114 is a great class to start writing at Yale. This class is geared towards freshman and should be taken advantage for as such. The class teaches you how to write and teaches a new, higher standard for writing. I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "English 114 is a writing intensive course which focuses on critical analysis of different subject matter. The Sight and Seeing section focused on visual science. The course if very helpful. It will enable you to write in a concise and orderly fashion in other classes throughout your Yale career. Take the course.",
    "I AM: Freshman, computer science (and maybe art or psychology) major. English was my second language but quickly became my first by the time I was 8. Longest academic thing I'd ever written before this was a ~1300-word, very simply structured essay in high school. Longest non-academic thing I've ever written is a diary entry or blog post, I guess, which probably runs up to 2000-2500 on a regular basis. I was pretty much \"what is a paper???\" before this class.THE GOOD: Reading is never a chore because the material is very interesting. (114 is a class you should only take if you get into a section that you're interested in.)THE BAD: Class is slow-paced, kinda boring (these depend on your classmates though) and too long...and in the afternoon right...after...lunch...zzz (this also depends on your section, obviously)THE WORK: It's all right, only four papers over the term. Start your papers early; don't be like me and write everything literally the night before. (Perfectionism is your enemy. It makes you procrastinate.)TAKE THIS IF: 1. You've never written a paper before and are freaking out. 2. You feel like your writing could use some work. 3. You're an awesome writer, but in creative writing, not academic writing. 4. You're an international. This class helps familiarize you with all the weird formatting\/stylistic conventions used in American colleges.THE PROF: Prof Janice Carlisle - very, very nice. Too nice sometimes. But if you're struggling with something, email her and things will almost definitely be okay. She was very understanding when I couldn't hand something in on time, and I really appreciate it.PARTING WORDS: Writing tutors\/partners. Use them. USE THEM!!! I actually feel a bit like the writing partners were of more help than this class in teaching me about coming up with my arguments.",
    "I would recommend English 114 because it solidifies your writing and prepares you for future college level papers. This course is very science oriented so you have to be prepared for that. The readings are very scientific and they are about sight and vision. The readings can be very long at times. The paper topics are interesting but only if you are interesting in visual and cognitive science.",
    "A course worth taking.professor Carlisle is very nice. A no of workload, though",
    "English 114 will give you the tools to succeeding in any course. Not only does it help you to become a better writer, you also learn how to tackle any course through this class. Also, while you are working on improving your writing, you are learning about a variety of things (for there are different sections)."
