   "comments": [
    "This class helps students maintain and develop their German skills.",
    "I learned many new grammar structures, including Passive constructions and the Subjunctive. My speaking skills greatly improved, as well as my listening and writing abilities. My vocabulary is much broader now, and I feel that I have a deeper understanding of German culture due to our cultural work with cities during each unit.",
    "I feel like my German speaking and writing abilities greatly improved in this course. Also, because it's a small class size, I got to know my classmates really well. I also like the material and the textbook we used, which was centered around different German cities and the relevant culture.",
    "I actually gained so much more from this class than what I expected. It wasn't anything like my language classes in high school in that I felt that the practice exercises we did were actively building my language skills. I also feel like I struggled greatly with speaking exercises at the beginning of this semester but I have significantly improved in that area. I also felt that the daily routine of going to class and learning and having consistent nightly work was very beneficial to become a habitual language learner. Now I'm at the point where it feels weird if I am not studying German for a long period. This is absolutely a testament to the strength of this class that I feel so confident that I've felt not only my basic skills increase, but also my will to see those basic skills improve increase as well, which is just fantastic.",
    "I learned how to use all of the specific grammar knowledge from L1 (GMAN110) and L1 (GMAN120) in a context where I was speaking more and using it practically!",
    "I improved my German",
    "I enjoyed learning about different cities in Germany and significant german people. I also improved my german speaking and writing, as well as my knowledge of german grammar.",
    "More german skills!",
    "This class helped reinforce grammar and vocab from previous semesters as well as improve speaking and listening a lot. There is more city-specific culture and history woven in too"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The grammar in this course is a review of L1 and L2, meaning that if students don't have a good understanding of the concept prior to the course, it will be difficult for them to fully understand the concept in L3. Feedback on essays was also sometimes variable and difficult to understand, requiring in-person follow up and discussion to fully understand.",
    "The course is great, and I think its structure is optimal for improving student's German ability.",
    "It is fun! And there is definitely a bit of work, but it is chill at the same time.",
    "One strength of the course was that the class size and range of people in the class made it a very dynamic learning environment. It was good that most of us were all in about the same place skill-wise, so there was never really any sense of isolation based on skill, it was a very communal feeling. The final project was a very effective exercise and the textbook had a lot of useful insights. One weakness I did notice was that the Quia homework often felt superfluous at times, or felt like the benefits of completing it did not way the effort of completing all the tasks. This made keeping up with the work a bit of a challenge. But that is a minor complaint in the context of how great all the time in class was, especially with fun activities like Jojo sprinkled in to keep all the students engaged, which we definitely were.",
    "Strengths: very engaging professors, great collaboration amongst peers in terms of class activities Weaknesses: QUIA online is so hard to manage and didn't help me at all in learning",
    "Reviewed grammar we had already covered in the first two levels. Improved speaking and comprehension.",
    "Sometimes I found it difficult to understand the grammar points because we went through them quite quickly. The online homework did not help me learn these grammar points very well. The online homework service was very annoying at times. However overall I enjoyed the course and loved the different types of activities we did. It meant that the classes didn't seem repetitive.",
    "A really good course! Learned a lot of german",
    "The homeworks online are pretty terrible. Some of the work feels like busy work. It is hard to come into this class after a summer of not speaking german, but Im not sure if there is a way to fix that. The instructors are all so helpful, so that makes up for it."

   "comments": [
    "This course grades students on the quality of their German, not on their levels of improvement. This is not to say you will not learn in L3, but rather that the amount of German learned is relative to the background and prior experience of the student. Some students have the prior knowledge to ace exams, while others have to study very hard for the same marks. At first this can be jarring lead to frustration. However, if you are aware of this going in and are comfortable with your own language ability, then the class is incredibly fun and enjoyable.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in German, and those seeking to fulfil the foreign language requirement. It is a fun course, and your German will greatly improve.",
    "Yes! The german department at Yale is so much fun and generally relaxed.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to another student. I find the German language to be particularly fascinating because it is not particularly difficult for English speakers to learn, but you will also never be bored with the material. Once you're at L3, you have gotten to the point where discussions about the world's problems, complex issues, and other trends can actually come into play. The textbook is very helpful and the size is just right. Just be prepared to handle some works that feels redundant at times, but who hasn't been there before, right? Long story short, this was a great class.",
    "Definitely! You truly learn so much German in such little time in a very engaging way - the professors are always great in the German department. The tests every 2 weeks on Fridays gets to be really annoying, but you get used to it.",
    "Yes German is a very fun language to learn.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student who wanted to learn more about German and is interested in German culture.",
    "Yes! If you want to continue learning german"
