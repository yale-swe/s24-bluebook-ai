    "I learned how to think more analytically about writing, how to make setting reflect theme and character, how to write good dialogue, and how to revise my writing. Most importantly, I learned to think ambitiously about what my writing can achieve.",
    "I learned how to improve my fiction writing through workshops and reading published fiction. I learned how to be better at revising my work as well.",
    "I developed both a better writing style and a better appreciation for ways to approach editing and commenting on short stories.",
    "I learned a little bit about the various elements of craft-plot, perspective, characters, etc. I also learned, mostly by trial and error, some of the components that make a good story (harder than it sounds)! Overall this course was more creative than anything, and really gave us a lot of freedom to explore writing in whatever way we wanted.",
    "My fiction writing improved immensely, but more importantly I learned a lot about writing in general and the creative process."

    "Strengths: wonderful workshop atmosphere, which really helped me improve my writing. Prof. Choi is fantastic. Weaknesses: I wish we had continued to read published fiction throughout the whole semester because I found it really inspiring and helpful in my own writing.",
    "Intro to Writing Fiction was a fantastic class, and nothing needed to be improved. I thought the workshop format was very helpful and the way that Professor Choi began the class by having us read published short stories and writing short pieces was interesting and helpful.",
    "This course was great in that it really offered us a lot of creativity and freedom to write whatever we wanted. The class was workshop-based, and we workshopped each other's work every class. I think the workshopping was great but also it got a little old after a while. While I appreciated my classmates' feedback, and I definitely did learn stuff from reading their work and from hearing their feedback, I think I would've liked maybe a little bit more of a constructive approach with more input\/guidelines from professor Choi. I think there could've been more of a focus on craft\/how to write, since I'd never written fiction before. The craft instruction was a little weak.",
    "Strengths: the teaching, the format, the readings Weaknesses: I think Prof. Choi is too easy on us sometimes!"

    "This is a fantastic creative writing seminar. It's more of an intermediate course rather than an introductory one, but don't let that scare you because Professor Choi makes the transition to writing regularly if you haven't written much before (though you have to have written something to have applied...) as smooth as possible. The class is workshop-based with weekly assignments throughout the first half that focus on different facets of storytelling (plot, theme, setting, character), which gives you the best of both worlds: you get to enjoy and learn from the writing of your very talented class mates while honing and refining your own mastery of the many different parts of telling a good story. Professor Choi also has you red some great works of fiction in the first half that you can draw inspiration from. The class really hits all the marks, keeping you immersed and engaged with creative writing. Professor Choi is a wonderful presence in a classroom and the best kind of English professor you can hope for. She appreciates and acknowledges the inherently subjective nature of writing, and as such doesn't try to impose her preferences on your work when evaluating it. She's able to facilitate vibrant class discussion by encouraging everyone to share their interpretations of other's work, no matter how different. The variety of perspectives students bring to the table, even when they class Professor Choi's, allows you to learn a lot. Most importantly, Professor Choi just so passionate and excited about the class, and that sets the atmosphere for seminar. In a Creative Writing class you want a professor who pushes you to think creatively to fulfill your personal vision for your story, not the teacher's, and Professor Choi delivers in spades. If you get in, take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it if Prof. Choi teaches it again. The classroom environment is constructive and supportive, and it really helped me learn to be a better writer.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I walked away from it as a better writer and a better reader. Professor Choi is an absolute gem. One of the best professors I've had at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this if you can get in. Professor Choi is fantastic, and the course follows a workshop format that is very helpful for learning. It is relatively low stress (you submit two workshop pieces over the course of the semester and make significant revisions on one, along with reading and making comments on other students' stories each week) and incredibly fun and helpful for anyone who loves writing.",
    "This is truly the best seminar I have taken at Yale. Susan Choi is a DELIGHT. She leads seminar very effectively and, most importantly, goes above and beyond to help each of her students grow and get feedback that is both helpful and supportive. I cannot recommend this class highly enough.",
    "This course was great in that it really offered us a lot of creativity and freedom to write whatever we wanted. The class was workshop-based, and we workshopped each other's work every class. I think the workshopping was great but also it got a little old after a while.

I think there could've been more of a focus on craft\/how to write, since I'd never written fiction before. The craft instruction was a little weak. If you've never written before like me, just know that you kind of will be given a lot of liberty to write on your own, and the class will provide feedback for you. If you're looking for a rigorously constructive kind of class, probably not for you. Also note that you're allowed to bring pieces you've already written to workshop, which I didn't really appreciate because I wanted the class to be about writing new things. Still, the class was overall so fun! Would definitely recommend if you want to explore your writing side.",
    "If you have ever been interested in fiction (writing or reading), take this course! It will push you far beyond your limits, and Professor Choi is deeply kind and generous instructor."
