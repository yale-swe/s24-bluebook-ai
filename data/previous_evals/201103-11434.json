    "TAKE THIS CLASS. A combination theory\/movement class every week you are asked to read a few articles relating to the body and then engage with the work through a workshop in class. An extremely unusual course I'm not sure how exactly to describe its benefits in words....The course work is extremely manageable and the short midterm paper can be on ANYTHING to do with the body. Lastly, the final project is very low stress and can bea presentation, film, paper, performance piece, whatever. Jessica is a fantastic, fantastic teacher. TAKE IT!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. No matter what your major is, if you're at all interested in the body in any way you should take this. You'll begin to look at everyday interactions and situations with newfound perspectives and a critical eye. Don't be mystified by the title of the course; just know that the readings are really interesting, you get to do movement exercises in class, and you'll explore perceptions of our own bodies and how we perceive those of others, bodies and institutions, body normativity, and how science is affecting the way we engage with our bodies (among other things).",
    "This is a fantastic course that fuses together dance, philosophy, sociology, theater, and the physical body. There is a lot of class discussion, so the quality of the class is highly dependent on who you are with, but in general, you will really enjoy your experience. I recommend it to everyone, from WGSS majors to Neuroscience majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested, especially those interested in either the arts or social science.",
    "This was a great class that really bridged the gap between theoretical discussion and active practice and experience in a way that is so infrequently seen here at Yale. Class was a mix of movement exercises and seminar discussions, with both elements equally waited and equally important to understanding the class material. You need to be fully invested in this course and not self conscious to truly get everything you can out of it, but if you come to it with an open mind it is a truly great class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Theories of Embodiment to another student. It was an absolutely awesome class, very interesting, and the class dynamic was unbelievably good - I met some seriously cool people.",
    "In Theories of Embodiment, students read essays on certain subjects regarding the body and come to class ready to embody them. I would highly recommend this class to anyone at all. It's a dance studies class that has little to do with dance, and it therefore exposes students to information about the body - and movement - that they don't get in any other discipline. It's probably among the most important classes I've taken here, and I hope Yale considers implementing more like it.",
    "THST 444 is a movement studies class. Most of your time will be spent on your feet or on the floor. It was probably THE BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE with a GREAT PROFESSOR. Definitely recommend it for anyone interested in analyzing people in terms of bodily movement, gaining a historical perspective on learned techniques of the body (including your own) or understanding how our bodies and their movements are shaped by and result from the institutions they inhabit. An AMAZING class."
