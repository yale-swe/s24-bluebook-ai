   "comments": [
    "I'd say that this class isn't too tough, but you need to make sure that you get a good TA to make an easier time of it.",
    "Math 112 was the bane of my existence. I would never have put myself through it if I weren't pre-med. Don't do it unless you have to, or unless you love math enough to enjoy teaching yourself how to differentiate equations--and if you do take it, try to get into a section that has an actual professor. The grad students are often less-than-stellar.",
    "Introductory math courses at Yale are not great. Part of the reason is because you only have one semester to digest calculus and as a student took stats in high school and not calc, I suffered. It's a requirement for many so just beat through it.One note of caution: shop TFs. It will make a huge difference.",
    "Make sure to choose a good teaching fellow. Makes a huge difference.",
    "unless you have a very good background in calc, i would advise getting a tutor from day one.",
    "Do not take this course if you've taken a calculus course before (unless you are unsure of yourself and plan on taken higher level math courses)",
    "It was a little disorganized, tests and hw took awhile to be returned, but I still learned what I needed to\/what I expected to so i got out of it what I thought i would!",
    "No, but try and give it a good amount of focus if you do take it",
    "Math 112 05 is a challenging course. I had not taken calculus yet, and felt that by taking Math 112 05 I would attain a solid foundation for the subject, which is exactly what happened. It is really important to keep up with the weekly problem sets (not only for your grade, but also for understanding the material), and I highly recommend going to your professor's office hours.",
    "Plain and simple, don't take the class with Mr. Huang. It doesn't matter how close to campus or how nice the time slot is, just don't. Find a professor who actually cares about the class, the students, or the subject matter.",
    "If you have no prior calculus background, it's going to be tough. If you have taken Calculus AB before, you'll probably find it a breeze. The classes are poorly taught. I recommend thoroughly reading the book and doing practice problems on your own rather than actually attending lectures. The exams are all VERY similar to the practice exams given (though usually a lot tougher). So if you make sure you understand how to work through each problem on the practice exams, you'll be fine for the exam.",
    "Take the class but definitely with a different professor. However, only take the class if you have to. I wouldn't do it for fun."
