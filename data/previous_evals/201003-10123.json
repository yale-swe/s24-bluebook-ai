    "The best. Really fun, interesting, and engaging. Take this class!",
    "Highly recommended. For everyone. It's cool to learn how to put together a radio piece and about the radio journalism field, but especially how to listen closely and how to tell stories in a new way. Talk to some great radio journalists (like Ira Glass!) on Skype as a class. Jake is a great instructor and fun to get to know.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It is really fun.",
    "This is a good introduction to radio journalism. However, I don't think I got anything out of this class that I couldn't have learned on my own. This class is also a lot of work for a college seminar.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. If it's offered again, take it. Fascinating mix of technical, journalistic, theoretical and academic skills.",
    "Yes! Even to those who do not think they will become radio journalists -- it is great to explore a new field, but even to go explore New Haven or your Yalemates!",
    "I would recommend this class. I had no prior experience in radio and I learned a lot. I was definitely out of my element, which made the class very challenging and sometimes quite time consuming.",
    "If you have a preexisting passion and talent for radio journalism, this is a good course in which to express it. If you're more of an amateur, and are looking for a grounding in the fundamentals of the field, you are unlikely to receive it here. Classes are somewhat disorganized, and revolve around individual pieces instead of larger lessons of journalism. Conversations with well-known NPR reporters are exciting, but offer only scattered pearls of wisdom. Professor Halpern is certainly enthusiastic - but if you ask me, he's awfully self-congratulatory. In short, take it if you want to create some stories, but not if you want helpful instruction in that art.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Its a really cool class if you're interested in contemporary radio and how to ACTUALLY produce your own work. You get pretty good at interviewing a subject -just basic lessons but also really interesting stuff that is particular to radio.Most of the homework for each class is easy -listen to a few radio pieces, read a couple pages of an NPR book. So its fun. But all of the projects -4 in all -are a TON of time. The first are a huge time commitment if you have never made your own radio piece before, and the final project just takes a lot of time for finding your topic, scheduling your interviews, planning your piece, editing your interview, writing and editing your narration, etc. Do NOT take this Cr\/D\/F.Overall, a really cool experience. Jake is nice and he had a BUNCH of NPR All-stars skype in. Ira Glass is AWESOME and so is Jack Hitt."
