    "TAKE IT WITH MADAME BURTON! I can't recommend her section highly enough. Madame Burton is what an exemplary language professor should be. She obviously has a lot of experience teaching the language, but what makes her such a great instructor is her genuine love for her students. Always understanding, enthusiastic, and helpful, Madame Burton makes each and every class a delight. Walking into the classroom knowing almost no French at all, I was amazed at what a great communicator Madame Burton was. She also prepared us so well for the weekly tests, which was great because it significantly reduced the amount of study one has to do every week. In short, you'd never regret having taken the course with Madame Burton, so try your best to get into her section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn French. You'll learn a lot of French and you'll have a lot of fun while learning.",
    "Definitely. I've taken a few languages at Yale, and I've progressed the fastest in French. French in Action is an amazing program designed to get you to speak and understand rather than get stuck translating things in your head over and over. Caveat: be really prepared to do a lot of regular work. It's not as much work as they tell you it is, but in order to get an A you'll need to spend about 30 minutes on homework each day and then 1-2 hours before the weekly Monday tests reviewing. I didn't do quite that and I'll probably end up with an A- (I started doing my homework sporadically and probably did it while listening to music too often). Maybe consider CR\/D if you just want to learn French but not work crazy hard, and you can easily convert mid semester because you constantly know how you're doing.",
    "If you are serious about learning French and are willing to put in the effort, I would definitely recommend this course. It is easy to fall behind, however, so I would make sure that you have the time and motivation to put in the effort.",
    "This class is wonderful. There are weekly tests (oral, audio, and written comprehension). You need to do the homework daily in order to do well and actually understand french (i.e. not just doing enough to get by\/get an A).",
    "It's a great course if you are ready for the intensity of doing it everyday."
