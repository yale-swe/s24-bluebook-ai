    "Students came to the class with very different levels of background knowledge and very different interests, which sometimes created challenges. This was true with respect to both the primary readings-- it's a shame that we couldn't discuss them in the original-- and, I got a sense, some of the critics and theorists amongst the secondary readings. The halting nature of the discussions at times was I think in part a result of this fact. The syllabus, however, also helped to create common ground that worked to liven up the conversation, and I think that we came away feeling that the class had enriched our understanding of the field, even if creating a dialogue was at times challenging."
