   "comments": [
    "A good overview of the fundamentals of pharmacology followed by a whirlwind tour of every class of drugs imaginable. Good material to learn, but if you're not interested in learning the mechanism of every major drug used you'd probably be better served just auditing the first unit (out of three).",
    "I would summarize this class as: frustrating. Lectures would be cancelled on very short notice. Studying was always a guessing game because there was no continuity between tests or even between question on the same test. Each professor expects you to learn their material at completely different levels of detail.",
    "I would recommend Phar 504, because after this they hopefully will get more organized and it will be a much better course.",
    "I enjoyed this course but it was frustrating at times how poor the communication was between the lecturers and students. Also the exams were graded extremely slowly (over a month to grade).",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. The course is extremely disorganized, forcing students to effectively blindly memorize slides without having a good understanding of the concepts. There is little conceptual understanding in this course.",
    "overall a good course to take, but could be more organized",
    "Overall, this was a pretty interesting class, which covered a wide range of topics under pharmacology. Some lectures are definitely more interesting than others, while some are a bit of a struggle to get through. The workload is very fair, just five 2 hour Merck online modules and the 3 midterms.",
    "The course contains much knowledge about the drugs targeting different diseases and also the mechanisms by which the drugs exert their effects. So if you are interested in learning how different drugs intervene in the progression of different diseases, this course is your choice.",
    "I would recommend only to those students who had great interest in pursuing pharmacology."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It was a survey course, not meant to teach you about areas so much as expose you to them. As such, it contributed little to my research as a whole.",
    "I'm not a pharma student so this is N\/A",
    "I gained a better understanding of pharmacology as a whole. I learned about different fields that are important to pharmacology and how drugs are developed against these pathways.",
    "it do provide us with basic knowledge of pharmacology, but since it is an introductory course, it is providing us with the most fundamental knowledge:)",
    "The pharmacokinetics portion of the course was the most beneficial. Other topics were introductory, and served their purpose in giving a general scope of pharmacology. I would suggest assigning more publications to provide some in-depth knowledge. I would also like to learn more about different drugs and their MOA.",
    "To some extent, this course deepens my understanding of the logic of drugs: how they mediate the pathways that play critical roles in different diseases and how we design the drugs based on the pathology. So in the future, if I find out some mechanisms underlying a certain disease, I may have a way to treat the diseases based on the mechanisms."
