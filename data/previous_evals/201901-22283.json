    "This is a very useful and interesting class! I definitely recommend it to motivated chemistry students (undergraduate and graduate) who are interested in the topics covered in the course. It can be described as a \"spectroscopy class\" in which you learn about various different spectroscopic techniques in inorganic, bioinorganic, and organic chemistry. The material is very high-level but Prof. Holland's lectures (as well as his guests' lectures) are clear and easy to follow. The problem sets are difficult, but you learn a lot by doing them. Prof. Holland makes himself available to help with the material as well as the research proposal; his intention is to make you a better scientist."
