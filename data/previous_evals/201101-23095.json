    "I would recommend it for the above reasons, but it is a lot of reading each week, so students should be prepared for that.",
    "Reading realist, fin de siglo, and modernist novels, highlighting the connectedness between the movements and the role of genealogy as a creative force in them. I would recommend it, because it is a unique take on the books, and you read quite a bit.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in literature and teaching. Although the scope of the course centers upon Spanish authors I think it is useful for anyone interested in literature and\/or art."
