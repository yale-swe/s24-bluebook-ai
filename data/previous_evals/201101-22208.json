    "I would not. But, you have no choice. Enjoy.",
    "This class is extraordinarily boring and yields almost no useful information. She hands out the massive packets and then proceeds to right down every word (although they average about 10 words per page) making class hard to bear. Class has nothing to do with the problem sets and there is almost no organization. For the final, she handed it out, left the room and came back a half hour later with food and two dogs that sat in the front of the room for the entirety of the test. Very professional atmosphere...not",
    "You're taking this class because you have to. The concepts that are taught in this class are actually pretty interesting but if Prof Pferfferle is teaching it, I would recommend not having high expectations for the class.",
    "This class is very manageable. Roughly weekly problem sets a few tests and a final. Lecture is helpful but not necessary. Overall, this class is what you put into it so as long as you try, you'll be fine. One learns a lot of useful information about kinetics and reactors as well as residence time distributions. You probably have to take this class but I would recommend it if one is interested in learning about what principles govern the choices chemical industry makes.",
    "If you are thinking about the class, you probably have to take it anyways, but the class is very manageable overall. 2 Quizzes and 1 final (+ homework) make up the grade for the class, and Pfefferle teaches via handouts and some book examples. Sometimes the class can be slow, but overall it teaches you a lot about kinetics, chemical engineering, and chemical reactors.",
    "You learn about a couple different types of reactors, catalysis, that ditch fires are bad, and that SELECTIVITY is the name of the game.",
    "It is a great introduction to some of the underlying concepts in chemical engieering.",
    "This is a must take course for Chemical engineering majors. At times it may seem as though the course can get somewhat unorganized but one ends up learning and gaining much more real-life experience from Prof. Fefferle!",
    "Not good. I'm not sure any teacher could make this course interesting, but bad teaching certainly doesn't help. An unfortunate course for ChemEs at Yale",
    "You'll probably take this to fulfill your Chem E requirements.",
    "An overview of chemical reactors, kinetics and brief discussion of reaction engineering. It's required for ChemE, otherwise, don't take it unless you're really interested and Pfefferle is not teaching it.",
    "Recommend it if you want to be ChemE. You learn surprisingly little for a course that should be at the foundation of a ChemE degree. Study together for tests!"
