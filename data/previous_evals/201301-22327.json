   "comments": [
    "This course provides a good, solid overview of Nigeria. Take this if you want to learn about Nigerian people, culture, and influence. Professor Adesola is a lot of fun, and you will find lecture enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class because you get to learn more about Nigeria as a whole and aspects of it's culture. It is also pretty easy to keep up with the work required for this class.",
    "If you are looking for a course that is super-structured, in-depth, and challenging, this is not for you. If you are looking for a relaxed course with interesting reading and not a great deal of work, this course is for you.",
    "Great introduction to African History w\/o too much work.",
    "No I would not recommend this course to other students unless they are really interested in Nigerian culture.",
    "It is a great way to learn about Africa and especially the African Diaspora of West African descent. Seye is a great professor, with a wide knowledge of the material as well as funny",
    "I would definitely recommend AFST 180 for a fellow student. The class details the diaspora of Nigerian people. While it focuses on the diaspora, it also discusses the history of Nigeria. For instance, we discussed the history of Nigerian people in the United States. The combination of learning about the diaspora and the history makes the class very interesting.",
    "I think its a could introduction class for those interested in Africa, but its lack of structure and repetitive lectures can make it a frustrating class.",
    "The class offers a great overview of Nigerian history and culture, as well as how it has changed due to migration abroad. Though it is late in the afternoon, it was a chill way to end the day. Professor Adesola is always extremely entertaining and you will be guaranteed to laugh by the end of class. The weekly reading responses are a grind but not overall the class isn't too much work depending on how much you decide to put into it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. IT is a fun way to end your day after the harsh math and orgo classes. We could all use a laugh sometimes and this class helped me do just that.",
    "YES."
