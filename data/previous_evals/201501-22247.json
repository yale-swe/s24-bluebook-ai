   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Did you take Civil War with David Blight? Do you want to continue learning about this fascinating period? Do you want to get some of the best feedback you have ever received on the paper writing process? Do you want to read great books and have fascinating conversations about them? Then you should take this class. Professor Rugemer expects a lot from you, but he also give you a ton of support. If you give him 100% he will give you 100%. He is a great research advisor and discussion leader. I think this will become one of those seminars that is impossible to get into.",
    "This was a great class. The professor is very helpful with the writing, you can write about pretty much anything so even though its antebellum America it can still be interesting. High standards, dont expect a solid A but expect to learn how to take a project seriously. Rugemer is a nice guy.",
    "This is a solid course--take it if you have an interest in the time period. The research paper is a good chance to write about a topic you are interested in--anything is a go as long as it focuses on Antebellum America. Readings were somewhat of a mixed bag--some were a little dry and tedious, but others were genuinely interesting.",
    "This course surveys the antebellum period through economic, political, social and international lenses. This course is great for taking a closer look at what the United States was like before and leading up to the Civil War. It is important to note however, that this is not a survey lecture course and therefore little time is spent on developing a chronology and background information. During the course of this class, students are also expected to do research based on primary sources on a topic of their choice for a 20 page research paper due at the end of the semester. As long as you don't wait for the last minute to do the paper, the class will not be too overwhelming and will be good practice for future research papers.",
    "Yes, I would recommend taking this course. Sometimes discussions were a little dry, but that mostly was due to participants in the class, not Rugemer's leadership. Rugemer gives great feedback, and he will help you become a better writer."
