   "comments": [
    "I have learned more in this course than any other course at Yale. The readings are particularly salient and enlightening, as I have never encountered such an in-depth analysis of propaganda and the black and feminist philosophical traditions. Professor Stanley is brilliant and funny, and though he can be a bit unorganized at times he is very receptive to student feedback and thoughts. He is very invested in his work and the literatures that are taught in this course, and you will leave the course viewing the world differently.",
    "An interesting course, but extremely disorganized. If going to class twice a week and hearing a really smart professor ramble about things that are of interest to him, by all means take it. If disorganization\/lack of structure bother you, this is not the course for you. That said, the readings were super interesting and the subject matter is awesome. It's just a weirdly executed course because Professor Stanley is so disorganized.",
    "The course is absolutely worth it for the readings and class discussion. Jason Stanley is a well intentioned professor who allows students a lot of input into his teaching. As an international student, I found it incredibly helpful to understand racial dynamics in the US and on campus, as well as see the biases in my own thoughts. However, lectures will be a disappointment as Stanley seems to be unstructured and undirected in his comments.",
    "I would definitely reccommend this class to other students. The class is interesting, covering important topics from the perspectives of authors who often don't appear on the syllabi of other classes. The class isn't too mich work - there is technically a lot of reading, but the class is fairly disorganized, so you definitely don't have to do it all.",
    "I'd highly recommend the class actually because it was so valuable to learn about perpetuated ideologies and what contribute to them staying in place, how they operate in democracy, etc. Hopefully next year, the course would be more polished (I believe this was the first year of it), so readings wouldn't be so hard to manage. If readings remain the same, it's really all about knowing which readings will help you most on your papers and to understand the class. My section was pretty fluid in that we could just discuss what we thought Stanley missed during lecture to get a better understanding. Overall a great class and great concept, and with more organization it will be even better!",
    "I would recommend this class, but go in knowing it's going to be overwhelmingly unorganized and crazy. There's going to be so much reading that you definitely won't be able to do it all - and honestly you don't have to do any of it. You can scrape by with reading one or two pages and having enough for the writing assignments. I would do some of the reading because it's all very interesting and will make the class a little more meaningful, but it's not totally necessary. This is a good class to take if you're fed up with the typical lecture - but it's literally unexpected and crazy each time. I found this frustrating at times, but mostly just refreshing. (We actually convinced Jason Stanley that we shouldn't have a midterm - how crazy is that??)",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student. I would suggest that they hold off on taking this course until it is more organized and structured. If anything, I may suggest that interested students look at the reading list and try to find some of those texts to read on their own. Given my overall experience in Professor Stanley's course, I feel like they would gain almost as much information from doing those readings on their own, than they would doing them in this class.",
    "AFAM 198 is a course that examines how various sectors and aspects of society, case in point, the education system relegate African-Americans to America's lowest social stratum. I would recommend the course to another student because the materials that were were amazing.",
    "Don't even think about it. Everyone should take this class. Classes don't get much more *Yale* than this.",
    "A fun and enlightening philosophy course that suffers from being a little disorganized. If you're willing to put up with that, though, you'll be rewarded with a fascinating course with a wide array of smart readings. The workload is more than reasonable, the essay prompts are fun and informative, and the sections are wonderful avenues of discussion that will really push your understanding of concepts covered in class to new places. Professor Stanley himself is a wonderful lecturer, and his offhand humor and obvious passion for the material covered makes for a pleasant class experience that is both relaxing and insightful.",
    "Very disorganized class. Bad lecture. However, important material and can change the way you see both yourself and the world.",
    "YES I would recommend phil 177 to another student! Propaganda, Ideology, and Democracy is an incredible class that was really eye-opening to me. It was a subject that I had never engaged in before, and was surprised at how much I learned about ideology and rhetoric of America's history. Overall an excellent course with excellent reading selections, an incredibly passionate professor, and a strong section group. Section especially was enlightening for me, as our topics of conversation were things I had never thought about before, and it was interesting to see the variety of strong opinions in the group."
