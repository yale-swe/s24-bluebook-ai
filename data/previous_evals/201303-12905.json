    "I would recommend everyone who wishes to understand the Earth's interior dynamics, to study this course. The fundamentals taught in this course are very important and must be understood by all students who wish to study the dynamics of the Earth's interior. It is not an easy course since Earth materials seem to behave very counter-intuitively at high pressure and temperature but the knowledge is imperative to all those who want to carry on research in the field of mineral physics\/geodynaics atleast.",
    "I'd recommend it to students studying earth materials, whatever aspect it may be.",
    "highly recommend for geophysist",
    "G&G 650 covers the numerous deformation mechanisms detected in experiments and describes how they are relevant to the Earth. It covers both concepts and mathematical details but also puts an emphasis on creative thought and analysis of actual studies. I would recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "Since I wish to study mantle dynamics, convection and thermal history of the Earth, this course was very helpful to me. Convection depended on how Earth materials deform inside the Earth (rheology), how temperature profile changes with depth and how rocks respond to high temperature and pressure conditions. These govern how heat is transferred inside the Earth and what conditions support convection and plate tectonics. This course covered the basics that I needed to understand.",
    "Very intuitive understanding of material properties was presented and helped us understand their importance to geophysics.",
    "necessary for a geophysist",
    "This course has been immensely helpful in deepening my understanding of material behaviors in the Earth and has only made me more excited to continue learning!"
