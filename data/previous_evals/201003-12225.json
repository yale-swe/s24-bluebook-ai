   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, it is helpful for history writing and for learning about China.",
    "Yes because it was one of the best classes I have ever taken. I learned so much about China from a different perspective than other history classes. My writing improved so much as a result of the attention\/help the professor and the teaching fellows.",
    "I would recommend it as a good survey course, and a good course to take in order to practice analyzing primary sources (Professor Hansen is very keen on that). I would also recommend it to someone looking to explore new material -- I had never studied China in my life, and I loved it, and got a ton of practice in dealing with new information and drawing conclusions from only the evidence in front of me with no influence of background knowledge .If you want to understand modern China though, don't take it.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want an overview of traditional Chinese history. Be prepared to do a decent amount of reading (particularly about religion, women, art) and write some strange but thought-provoking essays. During the first class, Professor Hansen told everyone not to worry because this class will not kill your GPA. This is true \u0096 if you work hard, do the readings, and go to class\/section (even miss a few here and there), you will get the grade you want.",
    "I would definitely recommend HIST 315 to any student. I took the class as an East Asian Studies major looking for a writing credit. The work was manageable, I improved my writing skills, and I learned a lot from the text and doing the 3 papers.Professor Hansen puts a lot of effort into this class and she is a great teacher. The material is accessible to anyone, whether or not you have studied anything about China.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who has an interest in pre modern Chinese history.",
    "I liked it a lot. I think that it's an interesting and well structured class, and that the design of the writing credit is an interesting one.",
    "Take it if you need a rest of the world credit. Take it if you're really interested in China. Don't take it for any other reason. The workload is reasonable - not too much reading, and you really don't have to do it all. One 500-word paper (don't be fooled, it's a doozy), two 1000-word papers, and a takehome final.",
    "The course was an engaging survey of Chinese history. The writing component is quite helpful and not too difficult. The professor focuses on a dense informative and succinct writing style. Great for history majors.",
    "Hist. 315 is a good class for those strongly interested in either China or looking at history in a fairly primary method.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student interested in improving their writing and also learning the basics of ancient Chinese history. This course does not go too in depth into the actual figures and events of ancient Chinese history but instead studies the transitions and major changes over the time period which are just as valuable.",
    "A survey class of 1600 years of Chinese history. A huge challenge for everyone involved, and yet, not your typical history class. The grand scope of the time period makes it difficult to do anything. Nonetheless, Prof. Hansen combines sources from a wide range of disciplines, which perhaps makes the material less obscure and more engaging. Prof. Hansen is also very approachable, and gives great feedback on papers!"
