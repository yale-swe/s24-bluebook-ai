    "I would tell a friend that this is a helpful and rewarding class. I was introduced to a lot of nanotechnology and device concepts that I was unfamiliar with before, and I also learned how to perform a literature review. I learned what to look for when doing literature searches, and I learned many skills on how to organize collected publications (via endnote etc) and how to use tools on the computer to make things run more smoothly. I think this course is beneficial and I would certainly recommend it to a friend."

    "The course definitely helped focus and specify my knowledge, and opened my interest to new technologies that yes, I am definitely interested in pursuing further research in.",
    "This course introduced me to various search engines for journals and publications. I also learned how to use these search engines in an efficient and effective manner. In addition to learning how to search for information I learned how to better decipher information and how to discern high impact publications from others. I now have experience wading through a large amount of information and reducing it to the most important parts and reporting it. Aside from all the skills I acquired about literature review and how to conduct searches, I was also introduced to so many fabrication techniques for energy conversion. I learned about capacitors, fuel cells, solar cells, bulk metallic glasses, electro-chemistry, and many more technologies that were previously unfamiliar to me."
