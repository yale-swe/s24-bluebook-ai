    "Question 2 - we usually just have a group discussion so there is no formal presentation of the material covered.Question 3 - we have not had any out of class assignments yet.",
    "It is a bit hard to evaluate this course since it is still ongoing and experimental in set up as a 1 credit and 3 credit class. One credit students are only responsible for one reading but that can make discussion with guest lecturers is a bit difficult.Video conferencing seminar was very cool. This course will be easier to evaluate in the spring when full series is complete.",
    "Declined to answer questions as I felt they were not very relevant to this particular class, being a speaker series and discussion session.",
    "Hard to rate this class as it is primarily attending lectures here and there.",
    "(1) There are a lot more readings than we were told there would be, so it's hard to finish them all before class.(4) The workload gets heavier in the second part of the class, which takes place next semester.",
    "Given that this course is mid-stream, I am trying to reserve judgment. In a very complex and multidisciplinary field like urbanization, the balance has been generally great. It is a unique format for a class, and I wish that we had more class time and substantive discussion time, but I hope that these will coalesce in the second semester.My full evaluation will be completed when we finish in the spring; I've left all the other questions blank.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "More in-depth analysis of problems.",
    "The course was extremely disorganized at the beginning and students had little understanding of what to expect - even in terms of days\/times to meet, work load, credits ,etc. I understand that it's a new class but there were a lot of new classes offered this semester and this was the least organized kicking off. Now it seems fine and things are running much more smoothly.Maybe ask the lecturers to really anticipate\/know the audience. Some of the presenters covered basic info that they did not need to cover. Maybe the professors could tell them ahead of time what the basic level of understanding is in the class of certain issues (ie pop growth, climate change, water etc)",
    "connections between lectures",
    "I take very little away from the discussions. Many organizational elements are lacking. For example, student work expectations were emerged unexpectedly as the course progressed. For example, 1 credit students went from being expected to attend class and do the readings to facilitate and record an interview and then edit the footage. Little details are overlooked; despite repeat requests to the TA, the updated syllabus was never posted to the class server.",
    "I understand that this is the first year of the class, but I felt it needed more structure, especially in the discussion sessions. The class so far has felt very broad and rather vague.",
    "CommunicationFiguring out assignments prior to semesterVideo editing and interviews take time to make them good....worth more than .5 credit.",
    "Organization needs improvement. It is clear that it is being put together as we go. Information needs to be clear and available and not decided on during class time.The guest speakers should challenge us more, show us the guts of their research, not the \"public interest\" version.",
    "lack of continuity between lectures, or integration of reading materials",
    "The amount of time given to student discussion of the material could be increased. The level of student discussion might be improved if done in the absence of the guest lecturer and professor, with just the TA, to allow students to unselfconsciously dig into the material.",
    "The various lectures are not tied together. I do not feel like I am greatly enhancing my knowledge of urban systems because there is no way to tie all the lectures together - ie a paper, test, presentation, etc. This is greatly needed.",
    "More regular reminders about what time the course is meeting each week (since it changes, quite confusingly, each time) and which articles are most important to read (the revised syllabus with reading assignments still has not been posted).",
    "A lot about new development and mega-cities. Nothing about urban slums or environmental problems associated."
