   "comments": [
    "The broad scope of the class -- ranging from classical to late-Renaissance epic -- meant that not every text was deeply examined, and that not all of them were useful to my research. Still, I learned a lot about the discipline as a whole by Professor Quint's constantly engaging teaching.",
    "This class, by focussing on reception and on comparative reading, has helped to strengthen my knowledge of the tradition in which early modern epic poets were writing. The critical essays we read each week were always apt and important, and the structure of the class, in which one person responded to the readings each week, gave attention to the secondary reading, which I really enjoyed and appreciated. This class has improved my knowledge of classics as read by early modern poets, an area of interest for me and one to which I will hopefully return."
