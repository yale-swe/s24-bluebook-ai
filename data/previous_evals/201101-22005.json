   "comments": [
    "Fast paced, brutal, learning experience. If you've got a bad musical ear, take it Credit D or audit. Do it if you want to get better, but this class is not a grade padder.",
    "TAKE THIS. It is more useful than the theory classes for a performing musician, especially for singers. You don't even need to be planning to major in music. Take it with 205 or 210 (or honestly take it instead of 205. You learn the important things faster and more thoroughly in 218)",
    "You become a better musician by practicing dictating melodies, harmonies, sight singing, and keyboard skills. If you've taken AP Music Theory, you'll probably find the dictation and sight-singing easy. Megan Kaes is a really great teacher though and somehow always manages to keep the class upbeat, despite everybody pulling their hair out over strange melodic embellishments.",
    "The course is very good, but it can be pretty hard. If you want to get a good grade (if you're not doing it Cr\/D\/Fail), you may have to spend a lot of time working on your intervals, melodic dictation skills, sight-singing, piano...For one thing, the class meets thrice a week, one of them being the keyboard lab, which has its own midterm and final.The class gets hard veryfast, and each quiz (there are four of them, plus a midterm and a final) is much harder than the previous one. So it's important to keep up with the work. In terms of homework assignments... well, there are none, but practicing is homework.If you're already very good with ear training stuff, then you may not need to practice much, but if you just sing a cappella, glee club, and have done ap music theory (etc) then you may think that you're very well prepared, when you may not be, really.Sarita is great, but Megan Kaes's combination of charm\/beauty and talent was what motivated me to go to class every day. She is wonderful.",
    "Music 218 is an introductory ear training class. Melodic dictation, harmonic dictation, two-part dictations, and rhythmic dictations are all material covered in the course. I would recommend Music 218 to anyone who wants to improve their listening skills in terms of music, but if you are a Music major, it is a required course.",
    "I would recommend musicianship to anyone who wants to improve their practical musical skills. Very useful!",
    "If you want a low-pressure way to improve your sight-singing skills, dictation skills, and ability to appreciate music, take this class. I highly recommend it.",
    "This is a great, low-stress class that actually helps you learn a lot. Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in musicianship. The course is basically all dictations, so it might not be the right course for someone who doesn't like dictations. The keyboard lab was fairly difficult, though my skills greatly increased over the course of the semester.",
    "The practical portion of music theory; a great way to enrich your skills and develop a \"seeing ear\" and a \"hearing eye.\" A lot of practice in class, but a relatively light homework load; as long as you practice where necessary, you'll be fine.",
    "Music 218 gives you an hour twice a week to work on your listening and dictation skills. It's a great class, one that you look forward to each day; who wouldn't want to spend an hour listening to music (and trying to write it down)? There is almost no coursework, and the work that is assigned is really fun (e.g. transcribing melodies of Beatles songs). I definitely feel as if I have improved as a musician, too, which is a testament to the course's quality."
