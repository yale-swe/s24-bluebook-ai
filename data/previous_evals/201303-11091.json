    "A wonderful, incredible, beautiful course. Plus the professor is incredibly interesting. You will be excited for class every day.Only reservation is that this course does not discuss much theology despite the subject matter. I.e. do not expect that this will 'deepen' your faith. What it will do is take passages of the bible you have likely never read (or never appreciated) and reveal beautiful meaning.Work 'load' is totally manageable (readings\/papers) but work 'quality' is rigorous ... these essays are relatively short and yet will demand a lot of time and attention on your part.Tl;dr - Take it",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. A hundred times yes. Just do it. The Bible is brilliant, and so is Brisman. This is probably the most intellectually satisfying course I've taken at Yale \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I feel like my critical thinking skills have shot through the roof. I'm agnostic, but there were people of different religions in the class and they all felt comfortable. Don't be put off if Brisman is a bit quiet the first day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he picks up quickly, is absolutely hilarious, and truly cares about each of his students. You don't have to do the reading, but DO IT, as you'll get much more out of the class that way. I will tell my grandkids about this class.",
    "Take it!! It's not a lot of work, it's fascinating, and you will learn so much. Seriously take it. You'll love it, no matter your religious background.",
    "Take this class! I went into this class pretty skeptical, but Professor Brisman is so smart, so dedicated, and so enjoyable to be around. We got lucky because it was a pretty small year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only 12 people \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but this enabled us to get to know everyone's unique perspectives. It is structured as a leminar, with Professor Brisman doing an introduction and then interspersing his perspective with questions from and of students.",
    "This course represents some of the harshest grading and evaluation I've ever received at Yale, both from the professor and, to an even greater extent, the TF (Christopher Hurshman). I recommend this course only if you feel you have the stomach for scrutiny."
