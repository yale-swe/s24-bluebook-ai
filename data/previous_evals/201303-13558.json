    "Re: the work load. I have never been assigned so much reading in a class in my life. It was quite burdensome at times. That being said, the work load makes a certain sense to me. It is all too easy for courses at FES to be superficial, and not get into depth. This is not one of those courses. This is a deep course about theory.",
    "Class was heavily theoretical and students ranged between advanced PhDs to undergrads. This made the conversation very inaccessible at times, but also a great challenge as well. Some additional framing and contextualizing of material would be helpful. Perhaps less readings would allow for more in depth discussion -- smaller class size might also be better to promote quality discussion.",
    "I found it really helpful when Karen or the discussion leaders summarized the main points of the authorsat the beginning of the discussion. I always did the reading, but since they were complex texts, making sure I did understand them correctly was helpful.Karen is great, really so generous with her students and has such impressive knowledge\/recall of so much literature. She was also very available to talk about term projects.",
    "This class was extremely challenging for me. I learned a lot but it was not a fun experience. It was very difficult to follow the subject matter and I always felt I was lagging far behind and desperately trying to catch up, but could never quite get there. That being said, looking back the theory I learned was fundamental and very necessary and I don't know if I would have been able to get that kind of grasp elsewhere."

    "Getting a solid foundation in social theory.",
    "Concepts were theoretical but extremely relevant for larger context of my work and studies. Class discussion was often at a very high level, so much to learn.",
    "The reading choices were awesome and the course was great exposure to them. The weekly write-ups were challenging, but it did make me pay close attention to the readings (which I'm sure was the objective!). Being around really well-read, smart people (including Karen) was also really inspiring.",

   "comments": [
    "Discussion could be facilitated better. People have amazing things to say, but for some reason there was an atmosphere of restraint.",
    "More framing would be helpful in pulling together different aspects of the class. More structure on the reading responses would be useful to build analytical skills and set goals to improve throughout the class on writing.",
    "Weekly readings need to be reduced in order to make the course manageable. A workload over-load often resulted in poor reading by the many class members which meant that conversations were easily dominated by a selective few who were already familiar with the material and, therefore, could get through it in its entirety.",
    "I'd say that the role of the discussion leader wasn't as consistent from week to week as it might have been. It was great that people had freedom to try different approaches. But the amount of leeway they actually had kind of varied depending on whatever other topics, themes, or questions came up before they really got going. This occasionally seemed disappointing if the leaders didn't have time to get to everything they had planned.",
    "It would be better if Karen did more to involve students that do have have such a background in the major theoretical texts."

Class challenges many of the base assumptions and thinking common to environmental management and is extremely helpful in thinking about the root causes of the problems many of us are trying to solve.",
