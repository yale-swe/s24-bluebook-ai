   "comments": [
    "Yes. Very interesting course. Good instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student regardless of whether or not they are majoring in religious\/Asian studies. I think this course would be interesting to anyone, as it examines everything from ancient Tibetan traditions to popular Western culture and media. The workload is definitely manageable and I felt that I learned something new in class every day. I never realized how much I didn't know about the Dalai Lama and the situation in Tibet, and this course made me more globally aware.",
    "A fantastic class. It covers a variety of topics, including religion (obviously), history, politics, the idea of celebrity, media representations, film, etc. The course title is \"Who is the Dalai Lama?\" but you'll also learn so much about Buddhism in general, Tibetan Buddhism in particular, area studies, culture, etc. I think the class was maybe 60% lecturing from Prof. Quintman and 40% discussion. Two cool things: the guest lecture series and guest lunches (how can you resist eating at delicious East Asian restaurants on Yale's dime?!) Also, there are a few required films. The workload is totally reasonable. There are three papers: one close reading, one media analysis, and one research paper. Hopefully, by the end of the class, you'll be exited to write the paper anyway. Professor Quintman is awesome - engaging and generous. Take this class (or his other classes)! Also, the man is practically BFFs with the Dalai Lama - how can you pass up being one degree of separation away from His Holiness?",
    "The class is a solid look into the history of the institution of the Dalai Lama. We were very fortunate to have many guest lectures, which really added to the course. Overall, great class!",
    "Great class, would take again",
    "I would definitely recommend this for another Yalie whether or not they're knowledgeable of the Dalai Lama or Buddhism. This class embodies the idea of a Yale education - one for learning and not for grades.",
    "If this course is offered again, I would greatly recommend it to a fellow student. It was the academic highlight of my freshman year.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in learning more about the Dalai Lama or Tibet. Professor Quintman is fantastic and does a great job getting everyone excited about the material. The class gives a survey of the historical and contemporary significance of the Dalai Lama as an institution and as an individual. It assumes no prior knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism, so don't feel intimidated if you don't know much going in!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take any class with Professor Quintman that you can. He's a phenomenal professor who really tries to connect with his students and teach relevant, interesting material. Not very much reading, and what was assigned was very engaging, not anything boring at all. Pretty light workload, but you leave the class feeling like you learned a ton. Very fair grading. The professor wants you to succeed and because of his huge network of colleagues in the Tibetan studies field we got to engage with experts from all over. One of my very favorite classes at Yale, even for someone who's not Buddhist or particularly interested in religion.",
    "Offers in-depth knowledge and analysis of a religion and region that we normally do not bother to look into. A wonderful class altogether.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was a fascinating and specialized course that death with a range of themes and issues pertaining to life in general and problems in the world today."
