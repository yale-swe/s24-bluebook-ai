   "comments": [
    "You are dropped into a space where you can examine through discussion how things like class, race, culture, religion and more function in society. More importantly, you gain an appreciation for the vivid imagination and clarity of purpose a mind needs for good critique. No one author ever has the entire picture, and you're encouraged to criticize their thoughts as well as simply demonstrate understanding of them.",
    "Through a close reading of various Anglo-American social theorists, I learnt more about the different lenses through which we can view the motivations and impulses that drive society; I was also able to more critically look at issues such as education and social mobility with these frameworks.",
    "Learned how to actually read a text. Mordechai is one of the few professors I have had who actually makes you read the book. He calls on people and asks them direct questions about the text. While its a little forward, it does actually force people to understand the text instead of just skimming it and then speaking off topic during class, which is what happens in most other seminars I have been in. Furthermore, he actually encourages you to engage with the text. Since his style of teaching actually gets kids to read the books, not all of class has to be spent explaining the reading. Instead we get to actually evualate the arguments of the authors, and he often encourages debate and discussion quite successfully. A reminder that when you read a book you are actually supposed to think about what it says, rather than just be able to regurgitate arguments.",
    "A broad knowledge of Anglo-American criticism. We immersed ourselves in the times and societies of the authors and engaged generously with their arguments. We considered each of the sources from a wide range of perspectives - critical, sociological, disciplinary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt like the choice of four texts that we read throughout the semester was very apt, since they circled around similar themes -- we were therefore able to put the texts easily in conversation with each other. I also liked that the course struck a balance between the overarching theories proposed by each writer and our personal responses to them.",
    "Strengths- good books, good readings, good classroom discussions Weaknesses- honestly one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Would like slightly more guidance on what he wants in a reading response, maybe with some feedback.",
    "This is a very strong course as it exists now.",
    "We read the authors with generosity and openness towards their ideas, which can be an uncommon occurrence at this university. Mordechai fostered a classroom environment in which students felt free to voice their opinions and interpretations. The class could have benefited from more writing assignments and more consistent feedback."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would. This course is challenging. Often you will get questions about seemingly straightforward things like \"What is religion?\" You very much delve into the assumptions and values that underline much of our cultural and social lives, a reminder that these things have been constructed with intent. If you like thinking like this, this class can be a treat.",
    "I would recommend the course to students with some foundational understanding or interaction with social theory -- while the course does a close-reading of 4 texts, much of the arguments raised were in response to or support of other intellectuals of the time. Having pre-existing knowledge of these thinkers would therefore better equip one to participate in discussions.",
    "Absolutely!! The selection of works was excellent, as all four books were important to read and fun to engage with. Professor Levy-Eichel did a fantastic job of facilitating class discussion and is always amazing at making sure that even tangents that the class may veer off too are extremely interesting and educational.",
    "If you want a one of those humanities courses where the professor says a couple \"deep things\" every class and otherwise you can scroll instagram on your laptop, don't take it. If you want to actually try and sit down and evaluate how you feel about the world, culture, and education while reading some texts you might not otherwise, definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely. Mordechai is perhaps my favorite professor and the texts read in this course are truly affecting."
