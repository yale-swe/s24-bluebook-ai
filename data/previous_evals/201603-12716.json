    "Learned exactly what I had hoped and what was promised--I now have a solid grasp of immune system structure and activity. It was useful information that helps make the biological connection to public health research I have done.",
    "I learned SO MUCH about the immune system. Like, everything we learned was the most current research.",
    "Learned about the basics of the immune system as well as a number of different perspectives from which the immune system and is studied.",
    "Before this course I merely had a basic knowledge of immunology. Now I feel that I know in depth how the immune system works. I've learned so much from this course.",
    "I learned the basics of the innate and adaptive immune systems and the basic language of immunobiology. It did not cover everything but I feel prepared for what I will encounter going forward in my studies.",
    "The basics and foundations of immunology. I loved this class so much",
    "I am interested in immunology and thought I should gain a stronger foundation in it after spending a summer working on immunology research at Yale. I definitely feel that I received that from this course, though in terms of skills I gained far more from research than the material of this course."

   "comments": [
    "The main weakness of this class was the multitude of guest lecturers. The quality ranged immensely from great (first half) to outright terrible (second half). Some of the material seemed extremely out of place and irrelevant (Legionella lecture). Having mandatory section was completely pointless, as I didn't really gain much from it. This wasn't the fault of my TA by any means, but there was just too much material in the course to be able to review it in section. I would honestly prefer if section had been optional because I learned the most on my own when I engaged with the material by myself. I also don't think reading the papers added to my knowledge at all as they were not tested on and they didn't clarify any topics better than studying would have. I also think there should be more consistency across grading. Some TA's (Lindsey) wanted extremely specific details and took off a lot of points while the other TA's were reasonable in their grading as the assignments had a one page maximum. Also, I sincerely grad",
    "Good coursebook for structure and organization. No complaints about any individual professor, but sometimes there was redundancy and a lack of continuity from lecture to lecture that made it hard to fit all of the moving pieces together.",
    "This class provided a good survey of many topics in immunology. I didn't like that the professor teaching each topic always changed. I'm interested in immunology, so I would have liked to be able to go to office hours to get to know the professor better and ask questions about the class.",
    "Strengths: each lecture\/topic was taught by the most knowledgeable person in that specific area, probably because it was their discovery which is so incredible Weaknesses: not many i can think of",
    "Really great course. Very nice of them to record each lecture, unfortunately the quality was sometimes too low to make out what was written on the board if it wasn't explained.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were recorded - it was a lot to absorb all of the information in one sitting and being able to go back to the lectures was so helpful. Having many teachers teach was exciting (most importantly, they mostly had a similar style of teaching - writing on the board, which makes it easier for students' learning.) The TAs were amazing. The material was very interesting. It was well organized. Weaknesses: There may have been too much information. I felt obligated to memorize everything from a lecture and it was A LOT. Maybe professors should make it clear when we're not expected to memorize something. 40% weighting for the final exam may also have been too much. It was so stressful to study for the final. Also the final was quite tough, much more so than the midterm. Finally, I felt very nervous about grading since it was with graduate students, and all of the undergrads were pretty smart.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the multitude of professors that came in to each teach classes for which they are experts. It makes a huge difference to have more personalized classes like these where professors aren't teaching material out of their comfort zone, and it makes the professors feel more accessible to students for questions. I believe the outline of material for the course could be changed to more chronologically follow the order of events of an immune response. It made sense to start with the innate immune response and follow with the adaptive immune response in the first half of the semester, but it felt disjointed and difficult when we had development lectures in the beginning, and then more development lectures at the end which focused on tolerance.",
    "The quality of lectures and lecturers was very inconsistent.",
    "The course invited leading researchers to lecture on their fields of expertise. Some were very strong teachers and were very engaging. That was most important, especially because these lectures are given without slides and chalk only. This is more demanding on the lecturer to be verbally engaging and draw helpful figures, but for this material it was the way to go rather than slides. If the rotating professors used slides, it would encourage them to just use slides from previous years or other talks and not prepare, whereas this way I felt all of the professors were very well prepared for their talks and more engaged. The teaching fellows were excellent and an essential part of the course to tie the topics together and help us while the professors were constantly changing. It was very important that the TFs attended class, so that they could help us effectively. The only thing that should be removed is the paper discussion. The sections were essential for reviewing class material, and the papers did not add much to the course but took away from valuable class review.",
    "Grade ranges and curves should be a lot more transparent!",
    "The biggest strength of this course was its superstar faculty. It was incredible being lectured on material by he people who contributed greatly to the discovery of that material and definitely made the course more interesting and the material easier to get a grasp of. However, the faculty was also the weakness of the course, as the many different faculty members specializing in their own lectures made the course feel somewhat disjointed. More communication between instructors on the syllabus would have greatly improved the course."

   "comments": [
    "Only take if you want to go to grad school for immunology.",
    "Only do it if you want to go to graduate school for Immunology. Otherwise, find a better upper level MCDB course.",
    "Yes--interesting and useful material if you can devote the time to studying it.",
    "Yes, you'll learn so much. But do not fall behind, seriously, and it's easy to fall behind, but if you do, the final will be a disaster since there are only 2 exams",
    "Yes. Not only is the immune system itself fascinating, but it is so important to understand because it is involved in many other branches of biological research and has many implications. All of the lectures are taught by scientists at Yale who are leaders in their field of research. It's an amazing opportunity to be able to learn from people who are making new discoveries in the field and also be able to ask questions directly to them during class. There is a learning curve in the beginning if you don't know anything about the immune system, but the professors organize the class and present the information very well and the TA's provide a lot of great support an guidance, as they have taken the class before. You have to study pretty hard for the exams, but it makes you really remember and understand the material and be able to use all you have learned to think critically.",
    "This class is one of my most favorite classes I've taken at Yale. The material was super interesting and it wasn't actually that difficult. There was just a LOT of material. But I definitely recommend it if you can devote time to this class. Strengths: Lectures were recorded - it was a lot to absorb all of the information in one sitting and being able to go back to the lectures was so helpful. Having many teachers teach was exciting (most importantly, they mostly had a similar style of teaching - writing on the board, which makes it easier for students' learning.) The TAs were amazing.

    "Fantastic course. A large amount of material, but exams are reasonable and most lectures are well taught. Highly recommend.",
    "Unless you have an incredible interest in immunology, do NOT take this course.",
    "Yesss!! AMAZING CLASS! Every professor is so engaging- they lead their fields and present work with expertise.",
    "This course is great and will provide you a basic foundation in a very difficult and complex field. It is very difficult and requires a huge time commitment to learn all of the intricate facts and concepts of immunology. While the rotating faculty were all incredible and experts in their respective topics, this also made the course a bit disjointed given that there were so many different lecturers. Nonetheless, if you are willing to invest time and effort into this class, it is well worth taking."
