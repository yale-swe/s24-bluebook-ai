   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in colonialism, orientalism, race and gender issues, or the history of the law, this is a great course. It would help to either know something about indian or 19th century british history going in. The readings are interesting, and you get a wide range of viewpoints which makes for interesting historiographical debate.",
    "This class is a lot of reading and information. It helps if you know a bit about the history and\/or culture of the region before the class, but it's not necessary. The professor is lively and knowledgeable, and the papers are straightforward, but the class and readings get a bit long.",
    "Yes, because it provides a very different perspective on Indian history while at the same time filling in historical gaps.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Rai kept the readings relatively manageable and discussions were always pretty interesting. As long as you do the readings before coming to class, you will be fine and get a lot out of it.",
    "Good class, interesting topics and not too much reading - and you can get away with doing almost nothing except for the final paper. But if you are looking for a good discussion, stay away - Professor Rai is great and very knowledgeable but talks for the majority of the two hours.",
    "YES. FIRMLY.",
    "Take this class! The professor is wonderful -- she seems to really love teaching and I thought she did a very good job of conducting discussions. The class focuses on the intersections of Anglo and Indian cultures during the colonial period, while economic and political events take more of a background role in the analysis.",
    "I would highly recommend this class given the very interesting content, reasonable workload, and very insightful professor"
