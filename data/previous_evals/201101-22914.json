    "Yes, altho at first the papers cant seem daunting. It was worth it",
    "I would recommend it so long as you have a lot of experience reading dense psychology papers.",
    "Definitely a great science course, accessible to non-science major but also rigorous enough to keep you challenged and interested. Also, you'll really learn a lot about scientific research, studies, the publication process, etc. Take.",
    "This is called Food and the Brain, but in reality, if you're in it for the \"food\" portion of the course, you shouldn't take it. It took me by surprise how heavily based on neuroscience this course was, which worked out fine for me since I have a strong interest in the brain, but if you're not so interested, I wouldn't recommend this course to you. If, however, you find neuroscience engaging, then this is a good course to take. We have weekly readings of at least one scientific review and two experimental papers which you then have to write a summary for.",
    "If you're interested in a science or research-based career, you should really consider taking this course! It taught me a bunch of really crucial skills you can't get in other courses at Yale, unfortunately.PSYC 323 helped me learn how to read a scientific article and not just blindly agree with whatever the researchers state, but analyze and critique their arguments and methods. I feel more prepared to delve into scientific research in the future now that I have this skill. Writing a review paper was also a great idea because I feel like this is yet another crucial skill a researcher should have and I'm glad to have had a chance to tackle this early on and see what it's like and how to go about doing it. Kristi was very helpful when it came to writing the review and you'll definitely receive guidance along the way if you seek it, so it's a wonderful environment in which to write your first review. A third skill this course taught me is the importance of looking at the figures and analyzing them. Overall, I feel like I walked away from this course with a set of tools that will help me in the future.The workload is manageable, though be prepared to dedicatea chunk of your time to reading the articles. It gets easier as the semester progresses but at the beginning (at least if you've never read scientific articles before), it can be a time-intensive task. That said, the professors are more than happy to help teach you how to read the articles and they walk you through it during lectures on Tuesdays and discussions on Thursdays. Since you do have discussions in-class, the dynamics of this depends on the class and if you have a vocal bunch then discussion will pass by enjoyably. Both professors are pretty good and approachable if you need anything. Attending a seminar at the med school is a lot of fun and really interesting! Overall it's a pretty good class. You'll come away with a lot of appreciation for how food affects your brain and vice-versa and you'll come out a much better scientist!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are a psychology major (especially neuroscience track) or have taken a lot of psych classes and are used to reading scientific papers. It was based entirely on scientific papers and there were reading responses ever week. That being said, I though it was really interesting.",
    "The lectures tend to be boring. This class would be a lot easier if I had background in neurobio. Some topics are interesting though, and the weekly discussions help solidify your understanding of the assigned studies.",
    "Not really -- very narrow focus",
    "A research-focused overview of the latest into the neurobiology of feeding.Definitely recommended!A great course for anyone interested in scientific research.",
    "Don't confuse this for a fun gut class. This class was very neuroscience-heavy and its format of Tuesday \"lecture\" and Thursday discussion was a little forced. I believe this was Kristi's first time teaching and it showed, which made the class a little awkward and jolty in its progression. Looking at the material, it seemed inherently fascinating to me, but the class just made it seem so much less so.",
    "Psyc 323 was a good course with interesting material. Each week was focused on a specific topic, such as taste or eating disorders. The first class of the week would be a lecture providing an introduction to the topic, and the second class would be a discussion of scientific papers relevant to the topic. The discussions followed the same format every week, which could get kind of repetitive. This was the first year the class was offered, though, and I think the professors are genuinely interested in looking for ways to continue to improve the course. The workload was very manageable. Each week stdents read ~3 scientific papers and write a one page response. These responses force you to engage with the papers and teach you to approach scientific papers with a more critical eye. There is a 10-15 page term paper at the end that the professors get you to start thinking about early, so it's not overwhelming. While the course wasn't everything I had hoped for, it was still a good class with very nice, approachable professors.",
    "This is not an equivalent course to Kelly Brownell's food psych course. It's still very interesting, though, and one of the best skills I learned was how to evaluate a scientific paper\/psych study, including reading graphs and brain images. Steady stream of work but never overwhelming (unless you procrastinate in the final project).",
    "I would suggest taking this class if you are interested in a more biological aspect of food and the brain. It was mostly just reading scientific papers (which you could do on your own - without the class - if you wanted) so it wasn't that different, but it was still fine. The work isn't too bad, just reading a couple papers and writing a 1 pg response every week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others, especially if they are interested in the biology of feeding. It is helpful to have at least some science background in order to fully understand, but regardless you will also learn a lot about critical thinking in science.",
    "It is a great way to get a science requirement out of the way. Take it if you are interested in psychology and food consumption. It is pretty neuroscience heavy so a background in neuroscience would be helpful.",
    "Definitely would recommend if you're interested in neuroscience... Much more of a science class than a psych class, and definitely a lot less about the more popular food topics (obesity, eating disorders) than you might expect.",
    "If you're really into neuroscience, take this class. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed. There's a lot of focus on neural mechanisms, and a lot of focus on discussing papers and their findings and assertions, and how accurate those are, but there's a lot less application to real life than I would have liked. Overall, this class had a lot of potential, and I don't think it lived up to it for me.That said, the profs are great, and if you like neuroscience, its interesting, and pretty easy."
