    "Egalitarianism is a unique and strange class. I think the greatest strength of the class was the dual-nature of the syllabus viz. the first part being purely analytical political philosophy, and the second part dealing with \"non-ideal\" life (including philosophy that endeavored to recognize the non-tangible\/non-\"distributive\" elements of an egalitarian ethos--e.g. focusing on \"respect\" or \"shame\" or \"equal power\" AS WELL AS film and literature. I thought this was a pretty great way to organize the course. The papers: there are two papers, supposedly 5000 words and 7000 words. If this sounds ridiculous to you, you're right. It is. The thing is: Lebron does not actually care\/expect you to write that much, or so it seems. He is quite un-transparent about this whole question. Lebron is also not the greatest teacher. He is very smart and somewhat warm, but he makes it very clear that he has little time for students. He often ends class early, which is maddening, given that this class is only 110 minutes per week. He cancels office hours regularly. It does not seem like he reads the papers closely, he will often only comment on the first paragraph and give NO substantive comments on the body of the paper. Does he read them? Who knows. He is a fairly easy grader, so maybe he thinks that will pacify students. Which, perhaps its does. If you are interested in issues of race, equality, distributive justice, social inequality, political theory, analytic political philosophy -- then it still might be worth it to take this course. The readings are fairly high level and pretty interesting. But definitely try to sample some of the readings before you take the course - look at the syllabus and find one or two of the readings online. They can be fairly dry if you're not into the subject matter. Its not a hands-down mistake to take this course....but please...proceed with CAUTION."
