    "Most seminars are good",
    "I enjoyed the chance to spend time with my fellow CDE peers and professors as well as being able to learn about interesting topics in the CDE realm. I wish there were a few more seminars, as well as more speakers from different sectors, or possibly even have a few of our own faculty give presentations. My favorite speaker was Dr. Cohen!",
    "This course is good but I think it needs to actually be a weekly seminar and speakers should be evaluated beforehand to prevent inappropriate presentations.",
    "These seminars are usually really interesting. I would simply recommend having more of them. The important thing about a seminar series such as this one is that there are a variety of topics covered within the field of CDE, so having more speakers throughout the semester would have been more helpful in terms of getting exposure to the types of work being done in the field.",
    "Overall, I felt that the quality of the speakers varied. Some of the speakers were great, while others lacked some quantitative evidence to support their work. My favorite speaker of the series was Dr. Sarah Cohen. I thought that her talk was the most interesting, relevant, and insightful.",
    "Gave a good overview of CDE research",
    "I really liked having the opportunity to get to know more about the fields, the possibilities, and being inspired with the speakers. I also really liked having an opportunity to talk to Epidstat working as an epidemiologist at a private industry since we don't really get much time to interact with people outside of our own academic field.",
    "I enjoyed all of the lunch lectures and liked that most of them were outside speakers.",
    "Strengths - we were able to see a variety of fields and professions where CDE concentration can be used Cons - the quality of the information we learned depended on the speaker.",
    "Strengths- it was great learning from individuals in the field of public health who would come and speak about their specific research areas. Weaknesses- Sometimes I did not feel as though the speakers were applicable specifically for CDE."

    "Good course but it's better to hear more about the industry.",
    "It's a good way to learn about the different kinds of work being done in chronic disease epidemiology, as well as the different career paths that people trained in epidemiology can take. I would recommend it!",
    "This course is a seminar series and gives you an insight to the field of chronic disease epidemiology. I would recommend it because this seminar also allows the students to get to know one another while learning about chronic diseases.",
    "The speakers are generally interesting.",
    "I would - it does show some interesting research. Perhaps next semester, there can be more research shown by faculty members as well!",
    "I would encourage someone with concentration in CDE to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, this was helpful for learning about how public heath is practiced in the professional world."
