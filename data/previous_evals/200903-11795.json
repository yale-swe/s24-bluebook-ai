    "I don't have a background in DS \/ philosophy like certain students in the class did - despite this, I somehow came out of the class with some sort of knowledge despite struggling (academically, theoretically, and personally) with the themes and discussions that were had. Jeffrey is a wonderful, wonderful teacher - the way he talks and facilitates discussion makes up for the long, hot afternoons spent in the dark seminar room. If you're into philosophy and theory and things like this, you'll get a lot out of the class. If not, you'll still leave having learned something.",
    "You have to take it, so do, but I would recommend not taking it with too heavy of a course load because the class is much better if you have the time to really engage with the readings.",
    "Well you're gonna have to take it for the major. So take it. Jeffrey's great. Staying awake is hard though. It's rather flighty and esoteric. Be warned, he likes to be able to use slides right away, so there's a lot of darkness.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Jr. Seminar to fellow students. It will not only expand how you think about art, but also make you feel a part of the community of art majors across disciplines.",
    "If you're an art major, you have to take it; but it's a great class. Jeffrey's awesome. You might find the reading challenging, but he's always willing to explain and take it slow, and it's really worthwhile in the end. Do the reading or you won't get anything out of the class. It will change the way you think and talk about art.",
    "I would recommend this class strongly; of course it's required (not sure how it compares to crit theory in the studio) but it's well worth it, despite the pain of some of the readings; Jeffrey is great and the majority of the topics are interesting!"
