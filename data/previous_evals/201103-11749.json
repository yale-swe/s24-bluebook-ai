    "It is a required course for theater studies majors. I would recommend this particular section for actors who really want to explore a unique method.",
    "THIS CLASS WAS WHACK. just like the biggest waster of time ever. The only reason I didn't drop it is because I need it for my major but I was still close to dropping even then. You are arbitrarily put into sections and an all powerful being decided to punish me. I was put in the earliest section with a teacher who (though nice) I just didn't enjoy as a teacher. I feel as if my semester was wasted working on things I'll never use. Our class did more work than the others. It just made me sad that all semester people were enjoying their thst210 classes while I absolutely loathed mine.",
    "InterestingFunChallenging(WISH it had not been at 9:25am!!!!)",
    "Sure, if you enjoy acting or want more time with it. But I feel like the same amount of time working on a show with a decent director would provide you with equivalent or perhaps better experience. It is somewhat a mute point considering its needed more the major.",
    "This class helped me a great deal as a performer, despite its unusual approach, because the skills were concrete and accessible. Like most classes, the more you put into it the more you will get out of it. Dominika is a knowledgable and skilled teacher. I would definitely recommend her class."
