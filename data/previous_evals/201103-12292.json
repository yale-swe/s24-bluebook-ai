    "This class is definitely a trial by fire. I'd recommend taking a different Arabic class if you're interested in improving your speaking or writing, but if you still aren't advanced enough i'd say it's probably better than not taking Arabic at all.",
    "I would. I grew by far the most this semester as an Arabic student. Getting up to speed was rough, as my class never touched al-Kitaab 2, which made doing al-Kitaab 3 pretty difficult, but once it got going it was very good. Lots of vocab, reading, and writing as you'd expect. In class was good, as you mostly just speak about the topics of the class, and almost no grammar (possibly the one bad thing about the class). Since L1, the best Arabic class I've taken here.",
    "Do not take this class unless it is seriously revamped. Unless you have assurances that the class will actually be evaluated by ability level, that assignments will not be too long to actually perfect, and that there will be helpful feedback instead of angry scribbles, stay away.",
    "Arabic 150 is a scaled-up version of Arabics 100-140."
