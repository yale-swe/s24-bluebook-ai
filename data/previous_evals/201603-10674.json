    "I learned more in-depth analyses of electronic circuit devices like MOSFETs and BJTS, with a focus on amplifiers. We also worked hands-on in a lab environment once a week.",
    "Got to know a lot about amplifiers, semiconductors, multistage, and an intro to feedback",
    "Simple and complex Microelectronic circuits!",
    "How to analyze basic amplification circuits.",
    "Awesome class! I loved it! Learn about transistors and eventually howamplifoers work",
    "This class teaches how to design various amplifiers using BJTs and MOSFETs."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course; the lectures were engaging, clear, and easy to follow, the homework problems really helped my understanding of the material, and the labs really helped conceptualize the material. The midterm and final were very fair.",
    "It wasn't very interactive and the PSETs weren't representative of what would be on the tests. The labs were fun though.",
    "The class does a great job with basic concepts. I feel like I understand how to use MOSFETs and BJTs very well now, and the basics of how we make amplifiers with them. However, the course seemed to me to accelerate unduly in the second half, to the point where I had a hard time catching up. Regular office hours may help.",
    "Very good lectures, very helpful TAs and an amazing professor",
    "The class provided a wide array of amplifier designs and gave us a lot of practice identifying the function of subcircuits, which was especially helpful in determining the overall functions of unfamiliar circuits."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in electronic devices who wants to gain a deeper understanding of them. I would not recommend this to anyone outside of a physics\/electrical engineering major though, simply because there are many topics that require prior knowledge and this class builds off of a number of prerequisite EE classes.",
    "It's still a good course, but there's a lot of material that you need to stay on top of because the course goes by so quickly",
    "Take it if you have to, or if you are REALLY curious about how to build an Op Amp",
    "Class is good! You'll learn about amplifier circuits and transistors and know how to analyze said circuits. Second half of the class gets quite a bit faster, but Prof Xia is very friendly and willing to meet with you outside of class if you don't quite get something. I'd recommend immediately asking for help if you feel you don't get something- it's pretty easy to fall behind and accrue a severe backlog.",
    "If you are an electrical engineering major you definitely have to take this class. If you are interested in advanced circuits also you are this class. Ee200 is a good prerequisite because you will learn the basics there.",
    "I would recommend this course; it was interesting, straightforward, and had clear applications to circuit design."
