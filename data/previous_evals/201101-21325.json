   "comments": [
    "A \"must take\" course for anyone with limited or no prior exposure to econometrics. Although there is still much to learn, I feel much more confident in my empirical foundations now",
    "An essential course that is demanding, especially in its early stages, but fascinating and rich. This provides a superb grounding for empirical work as well as further theoretical study of statistics. The use of matrix algebra isparticularly good for the latter purpose.The class genuinely made me feel excited about econometrics, and keen to learn more.",
    "Absolutely - ultimately, an incredibly helpful class.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course as a fundamental building block in being able to read and, in the future, produce empirical political science research.",
    "I would definetly recommend 503 to every student interested in statistics.",
    "Challenging introduction to regression",
    "Yes, this is an essential course that I think all students should\/need to take in order to understand basic quantitative methods. Would have been helpful to have more TA sessions that focussed on Stata. Also, I recommend that anyone taking this course spend some time before the semester going over the building blocks of linear algebra. At time the shifting between linear and basic algebra was challenging and so it is helpful to cover the basics up front."

    "Econometrics is an indispensable part of modern social science research, having good courses in it makes the work that much more manageable",

    "It was a good foundation course for quantitative work.",
    "A pretty good introduction to linear regression, important for quantitative political science.",
    "The course is essential for anyone who intends to remain in the discipline."
