    "heartily recommend.",
    "A lot of work. Attend office hours as much as possible and if you feel out of your element embrace it as a chance to grow. Really depends on the mix of RLST students in each year.",
    "Excellent course (although I'm sure most people take it because it's required for the major.) Professor Khawaja is an amazing professor who is able to parse what's going on in seminar and explain concepts very thoroughly but in an exciting way. I was a little taken aback by the amount of philosophy and metaphysics in this class at the beginning, but I realized the more abstract questions are essential to studying Religious Studies. The class this semester also wasn't too much work besides a ton of reading, a seminar presentation, and a final paper at the end.",
    "Ya gotta take it if you're a RLST major and it's taught differently by each professor. It was great with Professor Khawaja!I would say it's great for anyone interested in intellectual history and religion -- not just for RLST majors. That being said, check the syllabus as it changes every year.",
    "If it's taught by Professor Khawaja, I would highly recommend it. Of course, the syllabus and style will change from instructor to instructor - so decide based on that.",
    "If you want a methods course in the \"how to\" style, this is not the class for you. But if you're interested in thinking about how a variety of very intelligent thinkers have grappled with the problem of the study of religion and\/or used analyses of religion for their intellectual projects, this is a good class to take. Thesyllabus is strong, Professor Khawaja is phenomenal, and the final essay assignment is worthwhile. I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "The course really depends on the professor teaching it, even in structure...and you probably have to take it, so there isn't a whole lot to say. But Professor Khawaja was awesome, and her syllabus is so fun. Look forward to this class! It really grounds a lot of the other coursework available to Religious Studies majors in some pretty fundamental texts, and they are fun to read. Do the reading!",
    "Yes! Even if you are not a religious studies major, and this is not your required class, consider taking it anyway. It's thought-provoking and begs interesting questions even for people who might not consider religion a central feature of their life.",
    "Religious Studies 490 is mandatory for religious studies majors. That said, I would predict that everyone who took the course was very happy they did and found the course very rewarding. I would recommend it to non-majors as well.",
    "This class is for students in the major. Take it! It is wonderful. You will leave this class feeling like you are a true student of religion. I fell in love with religious studies during this class. I have a much better understanding of the theories of religion and feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gained great analytical tools for looking at the entire world. One thing to note: This class will have you read some philosophy and some anthropology. Please note that different forms of analysis are required for reading philosophy or anthropology. I think philosophy is best read closely while anthropology is best read against some other cultural artifact. For example, after reading an essay by Levi-Strauss, asking what would he say about X can be a useful way to understand his theories. I think this class could use more accessible examples to bring the anthropology alive."
