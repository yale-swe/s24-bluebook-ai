   "comments": [
    "Take this lab class. Very low key and so valuable. It will make you appreciate science so much more.",
    "One of the most relaxing lab courses at Yale - and you'll definitely feel like you've achieved something at the end of the course. Focus on one project instead of many helps with understanding in-situ hybridization very well.",
    "Of all biology lab courses, I suppose that this is the lesser of many evils.I actually came into the class with a lot of resentment against biology labs in general, but quickly Dr. Nelson's warm and caring manner won me over, and doing a project that had real relevance was great.On the other hand, it was annoying to have to spend a lot of time in lab and have less time to do my independent research project, my activities etc. It really is a big committment, 2x per week 1:30-4. But sometimes you get out early. And sometimes late. So it balances out.And no annoying lab reports or quizzes...just a final paper, 3 psets, sweet deal! And I enjoyed writing the final paper too, because it was very relevant, and I felt like I had accomplished something with my results!",
    "It's probably the most low-key environment of any science lab at Yale. You learn quite a lot, without the stress of possibly failing if you don't get the right data. I'd definitely recommend it if you need to fulfill bio or premed requirements. Most of the experiments are long, but you don't need to be fully engaged in them all the time. Also, it's great because it fosters a very collaborative lab environment; benchmates work together and help each other a lot.",
    "Awesome class! Best lab I've taken at Yale so far. The final paper is kind of difficult, but you learn so much that's applicable to current research.",
    "Great Lab, Wish I had taken it before working a Biotech internship. it would have given me a much better background in how to conduct and analyze controlled experiments.This is not a Lab, this is an experiment, where you are taught a technique, apply it, get results, and the write them for scientific journal publication (not really, but it is possible depending on the experiments chosen by Dr. Nelson).",
    "In MCDB 342L, you learn a molecular biology lab technique by working on a research project from a professor's lab; we worked on an in-situ hybridization project from Elke Stein's lab. It's better than any lab I've taken at Yale! There are weekly problem sets that do not take too long, and a 7-10 page research paper at the end. Though lab meets twice per week, we rarely spent over 3 hours in lab. If you have to take a biology lab, I highly recommend this one.",
    "Take it if you don't have any experience with research. Otherwise, I feel like it won't be as enjoyable and informative. Great professor and TAs and the projects we have are fun and interesting and clearly explained by Professor Nelson.",
    "yes, good way to learn research techniques.",
    "This class is great because in addition to learning your laboratory techniques, you are also doing real research that could have a potential contribution to science. This makes it different compared to other biology\/science labs. Given that the workload is very doable too, I would definitely recommend the class. It is capped at 20 students, so sign up early (at least 6 months in advance).The class consists of two weekly meetings in which you follow along with pre-established protocols. There are problem sets, as well as a final paper at the very end of the semester.",
    "I recommend this lab to anyone who wants to take a biology lab. You learn real procedures, conduct meaningful research, and is an excellent way to get to know a science professor.",
    "Great lab course--class twice a week for appox 3hrs, three problem sets and a paper at the end.",
    "This was the best lab course I've taken at Yale (I'm a senior). Instead of just doing the same old experiments that students have been doing for years, you actually get to work on a real research project, from start to finish. Prof. Nelson is amazing -- he explains everything in-depth, and he is so dedicated to his course and his students. Also you get a full credit of bio lab in one semester, so it's really easy if you need that for med school.",
    "It's a pretty unique lab course, because you complete an entire project during the class instead of practicing different techniques during each session. This way you get a real sense of how research is actually performed, and if you mess up, you won't have results (unlike other labs where you basically cannot fail in terms of getting results, ie the TAs do everything for you)."
