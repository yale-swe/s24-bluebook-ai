   "comments": [
    "I would suggest a different Middle East politics course, IF the student had some background in Middle East studies. Students without the background would be fine in this class, but graduate students would most likely find the pace and depth of the class frusturating.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the modern Middle East.",
    "Gem. This is a gem. Workload is gem, Emma is gem, etc. You should take it!",
    "Survey course of 20th and 21st century Middle East politics.",
    "I was introduced to this course by a fellow classmate in the Yale School of Management who highly recommended taking it. I would definitely encourage other students across all disciplines who are interested in the Middle East to take this course. It condensed a great deal of related material into one semester through an engaging format that ultimately leaves students with a much better understanding of major issues in the Middle East and how the history of the region has shaped what it is today.",
    "In short, take this class. You learn a lot about the region and a ton about how an individual country functions within the region. The presentations and discussions are very valuable and you get to hear some incredibly diverse students offer thoughts on this complex region. Plus, at the end of the day, it's a course with Professor Sky. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes. it is a good introduction to Middle East Studies."

    "This course really helped me understand the Middle East better, which will be essential for my further work and studies.",
    "Professor Sky was incredible. I would recommend this class to all those interested. Her first-hand experiences are par-to-none",
    "It did",
    "Not very much.",
    "This course was instrumental in deepening my understanding of the rentier state dynamic, how the history of the Middle East is deeply intertwined with that of the West as well as the political complexities behind many of the present-day conflicts in the region. My interest in the Middle East was further strengthened as a result of my improved understanding of key issues; I hope to build on what I learned in the future.",
    "I wrote my thesis in this class. It is highly informative and Professor Sky is an inspiration."
