   "comments": [
    "Architecture 345 gives a sweeping overview to Urban Design beginning with ancient Athens and ending in modern China. it discusses major themes in urbanism and follows trends over time. It has completely transformed the way I understand and experience cities.",
    "Good class for undergrads. It requires minimal work (2 5-page papers, 1 reading response, and 1 15-page research paper) and the readings are often very interesting. While the lectures are lengthy, it is nice that they are only held once a week. Overall, the course is well taught and a nice complement to more difficult courses.",
    "yes, only if you think you can wake up that early ** 9AM!",
    "With lecture and section only once a week, the class deceives you into thinking the workload isn't bad. However, a 1.5 hour lecture at 9:30 in the morning was difficult to attend at times. There was also around 100-200 pages of reading for section a week, but it was necessary to always read all of it. The 3 projects kind of ambush you and can call for a few all-nighters, but other than that it is perfectly manageable and very interesting.",
    "Arch 345 tries to cover a lot of material and appeal to a very wide audience, which made it hard to really grasp what the goals were some of the time. There was often little connection between the readings, lectures, and sections. I think this is partially the fault of the sections, which ideally should connect the other components of the course and allow the students to engage with the material. Instead, my TA (Amanda) often just asked questions based on the reading rather than trying to start discussions that students could engage with more. The lack of assignments was nice, but it also created very little incentive to pay close attention to readings or lectures. That being said, many of the ideas covered in thecourse are very interesting. As someone who had never taken any sort of architecture\/planning course it exposed me to many ideas that I had never previously considered. The final paper in particular was a really great experience delving into a topic on urban planning. If you're considering the course, go to the first lecture or two and see if you like the lecture style.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. The lectures and readings, though both lengthy, are very interesting, and the work is not difficult.",
    "A sweeping history of urbanism from Greece to New Urbanism. Pretty similar to New Haven and the American City, so I wouldn't recommend it if you've already taken it.",
    "Easy urban studies class.",
    "It's a good survey. The image \/ slideshows are good, and Plattus makes it interesting. Also the projects are very flexible and allow you take them wherever you are interested in.",
    "Three assignments spread out over the semester and a section - not bad at all. The lectures can get a bit long\/hard to pay attention at 9 am.",
    "i would, good class. interesting intro to architecture\/ spatial thinking etc. sometimes a little hard for an undergrad without prior art\/ architecture knowledge to follow though",
    "Great intro to cities and urban design. Loved the lecture. Take it I you're at all interested in cities!",
    "im not sure. probably not. too boring.",
    "This class was great, especially if you want to get to know the theory behind urban space better. I definitely recommend it. Not too much work, either (though by no means a gut).",
    "Excellent overview of the history of urban design and planning. Lots of big words.",
    "Makes me see cities in a completely different way. The difficulty with the class is that the lectures, assignments, and readings don't line up. It's definitely advantageous to have some architecture background for this class.I would recommend it if you're interested in urban design and architecture. I'm glad I didn't take it freshman year. One assignment requires InDesign. I had never opened InDesign in my life. I spent probably 20 hours on theassignment, because I had to figure out how to use the program on a Mac, then do all my research, then put it together. Be prepared for that if you're in my boat.Lectures are long and early and it's difficult to know what's important because you won't use the material again, basically. But whenever I COULD focus, it was totally interesting.",
    "The course has A LOT of dense reading per week. However if you are interested in architectural theory at all then you should take it. It was my first course taken in the architecture department as I wanted to see if I should consider completing the sophomore requirements next year. It's a good introduction to the field. As I said before a lot of reading but complete it, otherwise the projects will be impossible to do.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to get his or her hands dirty with a more design-oriented class, but who is deeply interested in urban design.",
    "Lots of readings",
    "I would recI felt like this course was a very good introduction to the broad discipline of urban design. The more classical models that are studied in the beginning can be a bit dull, but the course quickly picks up with more modern and exciting material. Missing a class period (meets only once a week) can be dangerous, and section attendance is crucial. The assignments were not too demanding, but watch the deadlines very carefully. I would recommend this for someone looking for a manageable additional credit.",
    "History of architecture class, pretty much, teaching you on different schools of thought in architecture and urban planning based on different beliefs of how people ought to be living their lives. Professor is amazingly brilliant and has a vocabulary that makes it necessary to look up words every two minutes in lecture. TAs are helpful and projects don't take up much time."
