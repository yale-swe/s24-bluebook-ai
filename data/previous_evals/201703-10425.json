   "comments": [
    "By taking this course, I learned a great deal about letterpress printing, linoleum carving, book binding, and the process of making a book from start to finish. Hands-on practice with the printing presses in JE taught me how to operate them, as well as gain an appreciation for the sheer amount of work that printers put into bookmaking. Further, I learned about the history of printing, beginning with the Gutenberg bible all the way to modern printing, and I found it interesting to connect these historical insights to the practice of printing today. Observing the work of past printers was also inspiring and helpful toward carrying out my own projects in the class. In addition to learning how to create a book, this course involved challenging but rewarding hands-on work that reinforced the value of paying attention to details.",
    "How to operate a printing press. How to evaluate small details and make adjustments to improve work. Gained a newfound respect for letterpress printing.",
    "How to use a printing press, insight into design and the relationship between content and form, and a greater awareness\/appreciation for all text I see now.",
    "Besides learning the super cool skill of letterpress and everything that comes with it (setting type, carving linocuts, binding books, etc.) I have also been able to learn a bit about the deep history of typography. I think a merit of this course was that I was introduced to the vast troves of resources available at Yale. This course required that I dip my toes into research with Special Collections and Beinecke - something that I otherwise probably wouldn't have discovered on my own until next year. Because of the project-driven orientation of this class, I've also learned a bit more about how to manage my time and make the most out of every free hour."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths of this course include a very tight-knit community, a new appreciation for the art of bookmaking, and a deep understanding of the process of printing. Struggling with the projects as a class brought us closer together, as did the sense of accomplishment once we all completed our final projects. This course also sheds light on how books were made before modern technology such as computers and laser printers were available, contributing to my appreciation of well-made books, as well as other printed material such as maps and posters. While this class was a hugely rewarding, I think that the major weakness was the time frame surrounding certain projects. It would have been less stressful to spend more time on the final project as opposed to extending the deadline of the second project. The final project was much more time consuming than the other two combined, so it would have been nice to plan out the time frame of the course a little bit better to accommodate for that.",
    "We got to view amazing work. We got to try to create our own work. But we were assigned a textbook and bought it, but never used it.",
    "Strengths- hands on approach, learn from mistakes, very independent in that you can have a lot of freedom to explore in design and help is only available when you ask for it but it is readily available Weaknesses- wish there had been a bit more formal instruction like lessons on the history of printing, general rules of design, and typefaces",
    "Art of the Printed Word is a class that lets you participate in a unique experience central to the history of Yale. This course is at the heart of what makes Yale special - it provides you an opportunity to learn a whole new art that you won't be able to fully appreciate through just a workshop. Now, I have access to the press for the next 3.5 years - something that only a handful of other students on campus can say. Plus, I have met some of my closest friends through this class. After all, when you spend all day in the press together, you're bound to get to know someone pretty well. The people that take this class are humble but have visions for their work, and it's so cool growing with them over the semester. Unfortunately, you do really need to know what you're getting into. This class definitely was the one with the greatest workload for me. As in, my suitemates didn't know where I was all day because I was holed up in the press. You of course don't need to do that to yourself - the class is less about getting a good grade and more about putting forth your best work for yourself. Professor Rose is not one to provide scathing criticism. However, I think letterpress is an art that has people err on the side of perfection - if you're detail oriented, this class is for you!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, because there really is nothing like knowing that you now have the knowledge to create letterpress art and make books from scratch. Despite the heavy workload (which is only a reflection of how well you want to do), the skills that you gain from this class in a niche art like printmaking\/bookmaking are worth it. This class would be ideal for anyone looking to spend a lot of time doing hands-on work and learning letterpress techniques. Be ready to spend a lot of free time outside of class working on projects, but also to come out of the class with a unique skill set.",
    "Yes, if you have an interest in visual space and different art forms.",
    "Absolutely. This is a rare skill you probably won't get the chance to learn again. It's a lot of fun and the knowledge of design can be applicable to other more modern modes of art.",
    "Absolutely. When else in your life are you going to do something like this? I'm not an art major at all, so my parents questioned my choice of taking this class a lot of the time. Professor Rose is so so so kind though and so knowledgeable about this field - he's spent his whole life doing it! I feel like in many other classes you can learn just through reading the textbook and get through class by taking exams and writing essays. Those are awesome ways of learning, but I think that being able to dedicate a few hours a week to just creating something was a much needed change of pace. The hours didn't feel so much like work because it was something I enjoyed doing. Even when it got frustrating, it fostered my patience and diligence, and the end result was so worth it. No one else besides the letterpress community will really understand the work you poured into this but it really is a community that you enter, one that's spanned centuries and continents. Plus, your work is held in Special Collections forever so you can show your kids your work decades from now. It's also a great opportunity to be introduced to rare books and really understand the magnitude of the work in front of you, not just in its content, but in its design and typographic elements.",
    "Yes, this course is highly rewarding if you are willing to spend significant time in the press doing work. This class is unique because it requires you to do work for it in a specific location using the equipment available in the Jonathan Edwards Press, making it a bit harder to do if you're an athlete and can't be on campus every weekend. That being said, it's still very doable to get work done on the weekdays despite the weekends being a prime time. Professor Rose and the student Press Managers are always readily available and are great resources to help guide students through the process, which is important because most students coming into this class have never used a printing press. While the work load is high for this, the 3 projects we're assigned are spaced out very well and the progressive difficulty of the projects seems daunting at first but is actually very doable. The skills learned in this class transfer over to other areas very easily, but what you take out of the class is entirely up to you and your experience in it. All of the assignments are about personal expression and about creating art that you enjoy; the guidelines for each project are very loose and open to interpretation and thus your work really becomes your own. I highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning a quirky skill that gives you a newfound appreciation for old books, typography, graphic design, patience, and the Beinecke Library."
