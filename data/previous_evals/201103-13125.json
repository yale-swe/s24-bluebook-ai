   "comments": [
    "I loved the subject matter, so I found the course very interesting. The field trips are alot of fun, as is the plankton lab. Lectures can be a bit dry at times, but overall are very interesting.",
    "If biological oceanography is something that interests you, I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is very manageable, although it does pick up toward the end of the semester, and you will learn a lot about oceans and fisheries. The individual presentations were also a great way to learn about a topic of your choice. Go on the field trips, too. They are always fun and are a great way to talk to the professor and other students outside of class. Most of the F&ES students there have done pretty cool stuff and are interesting to talk to. The midterm and final exam were definitely challenging, and Professor Decker's lectures can sometimes get monotonous, so, again, I would only take this class if you really care about the material.",
    "This was a great class! The material is really interesting. There is very little work all semester. However, this class killed me during finals period. We had a paper due the weekend before finals, an in-class debate during our final slot, a take home final that actually took 12 hours to do, and another short writing assignment. This was just unreasonable. I think in the past, two of the assignments were earlier so maybe this year was a fluke though."
