    "For fellow grad students - Do not take this course. Its a pure waste of your valuable time. For Yale FES\/SOM administration - There is only one fundamental course on Energy offered around campus, and it does no justice to expectations of students. It poorly structured, or rather I should say there is no structure. There are infinite diversions in lectures - which are many times not relevant. There is no essential skill building done in the course. Most concepts are explained in a semi baked far off view. Seriously, no quantitative model is that tough- that if the instructor will use chalk and board, and write few equation and use some graphs or flowcharts - then he can't explain it. My major is energy and hence I took this course - because I had no other option. But I did not learn anything at all. I just feel robbed off my essential time.",
    "Professor Grubler's teaching style is nonsensical and confrontational. He is extraordinarily patronizing to students, and his lectures consist of nothing but rambling diatribes. I have spoken with several F&ES classmates who have been repulsed by the concept that this course could possibly be representative of the next 3 semesters. Please, do not invite Grubler back to teach this course after his sabbatical. Though Grubler may have the resume, any of the current TA's could deliver the material far more effectively.",
    "TAs were not helpful at all. Problem set assignments were unhelpful and when asked, TAs were not supportive or helpful in helping to clarify. Very disappointing.",
    "I would recommend breaking up the three hour class -- that many hours in a row of powerpoint overloads the brain.",
    "Question 2. I feel that the core of the course (learning through problem sets) was left entirely to the Teaching Assistants who were not always available to assist. After receiving feedback on one particular problem set, I contacted the grader for assistance in reviewing the problem set, only for them to ask me to contact other students whom she thought would be of assistance. I hardly received any professional help from the TA's. I also think that the TA's method of grading PSets was highly inconsistent and not always clear.",
    "The professor knows a lot but the workload for this class is way to heavy when coupled with other classes. The midterm was very difficult and the problem sets require several hours. The number of hours spent on this class takes away time from work for other classes. It was a very difficult class for me.",
    "Thank you for the great class.",
    "Professor Grubler is not a great professor and does not run a very good class. Lectures often ran over three hours long, and lack all structure. There was no clear points that we were supposed to be learning or applying, and the lecture slides were impossible to understand without explanation (which often never came during the lecture). Taking notes was near impossible. The problem sets are epically long and full of useless time-wasting tasks like hunting down data sources for random things. I just don't know what I was supposed to learn, so it's impossible to say if I did actually learn anything.",
    "This class is unacceptably flawed. The professor's lectures are 3-hour long rants, using slides he hasn't updated since 2005. He doesn't bother to attempt to organize information or convey what is most or least important. You really don't know what's important and what isn't. Everything is called \"a basic concept\". The professor also likes to pick on people and mock them, in and outside of class. You can't ask a serious question if you don't understand- you will just be made fun of. The homework workload is absolutely ridiculous- at least 40 hours per assignment, with zero guidance or assistance from the professor or TAs. The homework assignments cover concepts we haven't even mentioned in class, and require you to do a lot of guessing as to how things might be solved. Most of the TAs were unhelpful. Jeevan and Stephanie were especially unhelpful for the individual homework assignments, and personally were overly cocky. The additional professional modules are just an effort to squeeze in more class time- how is this class only 3 credits given the fact that there were 12 additional hours of class time required?!",
    "This is a very valuable course, but it is very disappointing that FES has almost no other courses relevant to this subject.",
    "To call Arnulf Grubler a professor and to say that this class is taught is an insult to professors that actually possess those skills. Rather, this is a semester long monologue of Arnulfs opinions based on mostly decade-old slides, sprinkled with rants against FES and Yale from an ego that has been inflated orders of magnitude beyond his accomplishments. There is literally no point in going to class for the first half of the semester since the midterm is simply a scavenger hunt of facts from the textbook. It is an utter failure in evaluation of knowledge. The ramblings of class are generally at a 10,000 foot level, while the homework assignments are ground-level analysis where there has been zero training. They might as well be from a different class. Not only is the material barely, if at all, covered in class, the tragic part is that the topics of some the problem sets are actually worth learning, but they are so poorly worded, constructed and purposefully misleading that you dont end up learning any concepts. FES does a disservice to its students by having such a worthless class since the theory and application of energy systems analysis is something students want and is of tremendous value. If Mr. Grubler is aiming for a sort of academic hazing then mission accomplished. This is by far the worst class I have ever taken in any school.",
    "This course-load for this class was incredibly heavy - much more than all my other courses. The pace of the class was fine -about average, if not less than average. The level of difficulty of the problem sets was so high and did not even reflect the amount of material we learned. To offer some reference, the midterm and final exam were almost the same - covered nearly the same content with only a sprinkling of new material questions. This reflects that the amount of material covered was not that much yet the assignments and tests were extremely difficult -like some sort of problem solving puzzle. This did not teach me energy systems analysis - it taught me how to problem solve which is not what this course claimed to be about.",
    "Question 2: While out-of-class assignments were helpful to my overall learning, they were written in a way that most students, including myself, found incredibly confusing. I found that the TFs were not very helpful in providing adequate support for assignments and the assignments themselves were disorganized and poorly written. Most students in the course spent more time trying to figure out what problem set questions were actually asking than solving the problems.",
    "By the end of the course I gained valuable new ways of evaluating energy and thinking about how to transition to a clean energy future. That said, lectures could be disorganized and boring. Problem sets were long but useful. The grading on the tests was very poor, so it's undesirable for undergrads. Arnulf is flippant about grading concerns which is also pretty annoying.",
    "Professor Grubler is intelligent, kind, and thoughtful, but the ESA course does not deliver all it can. The course will benefit from moving from a single three-hour session to shorter lecture periods twice each week. This would allow lectures to be better compartmentalized. The three-hour lectures are often slow and result in few memorable takeaways. (Prof. Grubler's historical anecdotes and personal stories were very enjoyable, however.) It seems like Prof. Grubler's talents and insights are not fully utilized in the current ESA structure. Bill Ellis' guest lecture was enjoyable and valuable.",
    "Problem sets and exams were always scheduled to occur immediately after breaks. Problem sets were extremely difficult, with unclear directions and absolutely no preparation during lecture beforehand.",
    "Problem sets and exams for this course were less about actual learning or testing of knowledge than they were about tedious memorization and regurgitation of data. Course concepts were interesting and Professor Grubler is very knowledgeable, but the assignments and exams need to be restructured.",
    "I was very frustrated with this course. I think that the assignments were very confusing, first because Arnulf never taught us most of the material, and then because the actual questions often didn't make sense. We had to basically teach ourself all the material on the problem sets while sumultaneously trying to guess at what each question meant. The grading was very tough and arbitrary, especially on the exams, where we often had points taken off for not saying what Arnulf wanted us to say, EVEN IF the answer we provided was correct. The Professional Modules were not a good use of time, and then were included on the exam even though they were extra class time and were not presented as mandatory initially. This class took an enormous amount of my time and was not worth it.",
    "Overall a very intense workload, and you will not be spoonfed how to do the problem sets. I would avoid taking this class during a heavy semester; take it if you can prioritize it as your hardest (heaviest workload) class. That being said, this was an extremely valuable course that broadened the scope of my engineering background."

    "- Field trip - content for class : clear and structured.",
    "This is an extremely important subject that a lot of students are interested in. Arnulf teaches a way of thinking about it, as much as the material itself--which is crucial to understanding such a complex topic. It's an excellent survey of the energy discipline and it's many problems and opportunities. I feel that I now have a robust vocabulary with which I can talk about energy and a set of tools I can use to analyze it.",
    "The best aspect was being exposed to a different side of energy issues from a renowned professor.",
    "I bonded with my peers who were also just as bewildered and upset by the whole thing.",
    "That it's over. There were no good aspects.",
    "I liked the problem sets. At least in my case, a lot of the learning came through the problem sets. The readings were also very good, but it would be good if the instructor chose among the readings because not all of them were of equal quality.",
    "Bonding with classmates over how horrible the class is.",
    "The problem sets were pretty useful to the learning process, embodying the system analysis part of the class.",
    "I found the lectures engaging, and I commend Arnulf for his ability to inspire the class with his passion and breadth of knowledge surrounding energy.",
    "The best aspect of this course is that is a very good way to introduce yourself to energy systems.",
    "The problem sets",
    "I accidentally hit enter twice when the popup appeared asking whether I wanted to stay signed in. I don't have time to repeat my long answers that were just deleted so I will summarize. broad comprehensive introduction to energy systems opportunity to practice practical problem solving, critical thinking, and performing calculations through the psets",
    "That other students could come together and complain about how awful and the excessive the course was.",
    "Prof. Grubler is brings both technical knowledge and social science perspective to the course, and F&ES is lucky to have him. However, ESA may not be the best course for his expertise, and F&ES would benefit from finding another professor to teach ESA and allowing him to focus on more focused seminars. I did enjoy the professional modules (including student presentations) and found Amir and Becky to be excellent Teaching Fellows.",

    "Real life applications to the industry I am working in after I graduate. A new perspective to engineering principles I am already familiar with.",
    "As rough as they were, the problem sets were overall educational. I did enjoy Arnulf's perspective, breadth of knowledge, stories, and opinions. He was very accessible out of class. He reminded me of my favorite undergrad professor."

    "The structure of the lecture and problem sets",
    "Many things! lecture notes, class discussions, homeworks, exams, TAs, and so on.",
    "Focus on building skills for \"Energy Systems Analysis\" in students - and not on what they can learn themselves by just reading a set of 300 page readings. Structure - for god sake have a structure in class. Decide what you really want to teach and explain it. Either don't give the readings or tie the readings properly with lectures. And for godsake - don't just repeat what was in the readings (which happened in few instances) Give opposite views or controversial debates around the topics. Don't just propagate your views and ideas. Let students decide who they think is right. Nearly 90% of readings were IIASA material, which I think is very BIASED. Telling students how hard things and models are for 1\/2 the time and then explaining the topic poorly for remaining half DOESN'T help.",
    "Clarification of assignments, TAs who take more time to actually assist the students.",
    "Since I found the problem sets so valuable, it would be helpful to get them graded, with feedback, faster. I realize this is a challenge for such a big class.",
    "- TAs office hour and availability - Structure of the exam. - Organizing the materials posted on v2. - Clarifications on what's readings are required and what's optional or recommended.",
    "To major problems. First, Arnulf's attitude. It's terrible. He's constantly insulting FES, other faculty, our own abilities, Americans in general. It's just intolerable. I literally couldn't pay attention some times because he was just so hateful. Second, his teaching style is the worst I've ever experienced--in like 20 years of education. He actually tells us at the beginning of the class that he's just going to quickly go over stuff in class because he feels that students can't learn in class, instead they have to learn on their own time. But Arnulf gives us no resources to actually understand the material. He just stands up there and breezes through esoteric slides meant for someone with a complete mastery of energy statistics, then ridicules you if you ask a question. I've spoken with many people and this class literally puts you in a bad mood all semester. It should come with a warning on the class description.",
    "More assistance and clarity would be desirable to help navigate problem sets in future.",
    "The problem sets are almost impossible, and the slides Arnulf uses are terrible and hard to glean information from",
    "The way the material is taught needs to be improved. Everything is very vague and you are required to know everything for the exams which is impossible. The lectures are unclear and very vague. The readings are extremely lengthy. The lecture slides are based on the readings, but it is very difficult to read all of them because they are so long.",
    "- question opportunity for class material: some concepts pretty complex and we go over them rather fast. Because the class already has a very high additional work load it is hard to make time (next to other classes) to understand all the material in detail. More options for looking over some concepts would be helpful. --> offer not only for exam review session, but also in general.",
    "I felt that the pacing of assignments and the selection of due dates was inconsiderate to students. The midterm exam was scheduled for the first day of classes after October break, which is unfair to students, and easily remedied with careful scheduling. Similarly, the final problem set was due shortly after the Thanksgiving break, which made it very difficult for students to complete, given travels and other obligations. Again, easily remedied with more attention paid to the academic calendar, and consideration for students' time. Furthermore, the format of the exams was frustrating and not helpful to learning--they are a test of memorization. They should instead be a test of intuition.",
    "The problem set submission Excel sheets were not always set up well for answer submission. I know it was a large class this year which required multiple TAs, but a different TA graded every problem set which seemed inconsistent. Obviously I think this course would be much more beneficial if it were smaller in size and students could receive more individual attention. Since the problem sets were so lengthy, they often took a very long time to grade. This meant that students didn't have a clear picture of their standing in the class until nearly the end of the semester. I do not feel that class lectures prepared me well to complete problem sets. It would have been helpful to have a rubric for what TAs wanted for each problem set since at times it seemed like they arbitrarily deducted points. The three-hour lectures could most definitely have been condensed.",
    "Oi, where to start. Better slides would be a huge help. Like, just writing out clear definitions of terms and concepts (using complete sentences!), giving step by step, labeled explanations of equations and labeling axis would all help. Arnulf just wants you to think like he does, so that's sort of a fundamental issue that's hard to fix.",
    "All of it. The professor needs to actually TEACH, instead of ranting and mocking. His slides need to be updated, organized, and streamlined, and actually contain information instead of just graphs and tables. The TAs need to EXPLAIN concepts and ANSWER questions, instead of just telling you to reread the question and ask your friends. The homework assignments need to be much much more manageable, covering concepts from class or being significantly more limited in scope. The professional modules need to be eliminated.",
    "I think some example questions before the midterm (and additional practice for the final) would have increased my overall understanding of the course and ability to do well on the exams.",
    "Updated slides, a new professor, appropriate homework, knowledge-based exams (not scavenger hunts of facts and regurgitation of Arnulf's opinions). Mostly an actual professor that is invested in their students.",
    "Clarity about the problem sets. All the TAs and Professor included made it some problem-solving game. They would not be straightforward about the questions and approach to tackling them. Their attitude was terrible. This is all fine if this was not a graduate level course. This is a learning environment. I have no problem with exerting 110% effort, I have done that my whole life, but when the professor and TAs make it some cat-and-mouse game, I have lost all respect. The midterm was a race - not a representation of learning - it was a race to find answers in our huge primer. I have absolutely no respect or tolerance for the way this course was conducted.",
    "The problem sets need to be rewritten, with an eye toward clarity. Additionally, the course material would stick better if the class were presented with more, but less time consuming, problem sets and guidance along the way (unfortunately the TF review sessions were not very helpful)in this way students might actually benefit from the amount of time they put in, and have a better idea of what they need to work on. It is very difficult to gauge how one is doing in the course and where improvement is needed, particularly when provided with so little feedback. Being able to take the midterms home and learn from the mistakes made would have also been very helpful.",
    "In my view, I believe that this course would greatly benefit if it was scheduled differently. Instead of a one hour class of three hours just after lunch, it would be very interesting to have two one and a half hours classes during the week in the morning. The main reason of this comment is because the concepts of the class are complicated and not that easy to understand.",
    "Test grading, interestingness of lecture.",
    "Although I appreciate challenging problem sets, they were poorly worded and many questions were unnecessarily ambiguous. I wasted many hours because of the lazy wording of some of the questions. Additionally, the exams were not a test of our knowledge but a test of how fast we could look up information.",
    "The teaching style",
    "very very time consuming, especially with the workload of undergraduate engineering courses",
    "-The way the material is taught. -The professor's personality. -Problem sets were way too long and people cared more about trying to complete it than trying to learn the material.",
    "It would be helpful to have the Professor utilize some of class time to work through how to do the problems and a little less on tangential points.",
    "Problem sets were by far the worse aspect of the course. Problem set material was not covered in class or in assigned reading. Questions were repetitive, worded ambiguously, and often more a test of Excel skills than fundamental knowledge about energy systems or energy finance. Questions are posed so as to focus student effort on finding an obscure number rather than understanding key topics. It was wasteful to spend 20 hours on a problem set during which the student is completely uncertain if he is on the correct path; in this circumstance, no learning occurs, only frustration and fiddling with Excel. The problem sets should be reworked so that they result in a more iterative learning process (e.g., expanding the \"hints\" into meaningful lessons), starting Problem Set 1 earlier during the semester, and using more frequent (but shorter) problem sets aligned with compartmentalized lecture material. Under the current system, problem sets are returned more than 4 weeks after they are submitted, and despite each grader's effort, there is little meaningful feedback or additional learning that comes from grader comments. ------ In addition, extra credit was very confusing. At times, extra credit projects seemed like a de facto requirement, but the time requirement and the amount of extra credit available was never made clear.",
    "The once per week 3-hour lectures were not a productive use of time for learning the material. Students were not engaged and the professor would often go off on tangents. There must be a better way to teach the material that benefits both parties.",
    "Better communication around problem sets - more availability by TAs. More technical content in terms of energy system engineering, i.e. how does a wind turbine even work?",
    "Too fast. Not all course aspects are well organized. Not enough time allowed to work with new ideas and concepts. Course is really about a 5 or 6 credit course given what is needed to master the material.",
    "The lectures were hard to follow and often not helpful for the material on the problem sets. The exam questions were also not always about materials we had covered in class or even read about. In addition, there were often typos and elements of incorrect grammar usage in assignment instructions and descriptions. This made it difficult for students to understand the questions we were supposed to answer. To me, it was unprofessional and not up to standards to have this type of lack of clarity or attention to detail.",
    "Lectures are often riddled with rants. Exam grading was inconsistent (e.g. some students received full credit, and also no credit, for the exact same answer). Problem sets are extremely unclear and very harshly graded.",
    "Organization and redesign of slides; better organization of course material, tends to go tangents; improved relevance between class material and assignments (class material can emphasize more quantitative aspects)",
    "Learning tools and support resources",

Do you really need to know the total global biomass energy usage in 1990 in exajoules? No, no you don't. Some people really like this class for some reason, but even as an energy nerd, I found no use in it. Furthermore, I even did well in the class! It's just regurgitating positions that Arnulf wants you to hold, even if you don't think they're correct. Very little critique is welcome in the class, and the on tests are entirely an assessment of how fast you can look through your notes, not applying the material. I have never spent so much time on a class and learned so little from it.",

You'll spend the entire semester working on problem set after problem set, wasting entire weekends working on fake problems that you will never ever need again in your life. Classes will be extremely boring and irrelevant and you will learn nothing. The professor will mock and rant the entire three hours, instead of actually teaching in an organized, thoughtful way. The TAs will do nothing to further your understanding or learning. The midterm and the final will be absolutely ridiculous- how is creating a test with an average of 30% reasonable?!

Having said that, I did not gain too much from this class. We only learned a handful of topics. The problem sets, which could have been a positive experience, became problem-solving games that I felt were not connected to the lectures directly. However, now that I have taken this - everything else looks much much much easier and I appreciate all my other professors much more. I would like to stress that this course was NOT a conducive learning environment. You are never tested on your ability to understand the material. The midterm and final are open-book races of the same material. It is clear when a professor wants you to succeed and learn and I never once felt that here.",
