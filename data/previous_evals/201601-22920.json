    "I benefit from attending the workshop when possible because I am exposed to a variety of kinds of political theory research. I also enjoy the chance to see the subfield together and to have a chance for conversation with professors and older students that I might otherwise not see often. Thanks also to Hari and Clara for all of their work this year."
