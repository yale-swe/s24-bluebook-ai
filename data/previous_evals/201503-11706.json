    "Chinese 130 is a very structured course with a manageable workload in all disciplines of the Chinese language that is organized around the chapters of a narrative textbook. It has a small class size and is taught by two friendly, engaging professors, who alternate every chapter.",
    "Be prepared to learn a lot",
    "Take this class! Xu Laoshi and Liang Laoshi are great, you will enjoy yourself, even if you think you're too smart or not smart enough for this class, you will learn a lot, gain a deeper understanding of Chinese culture, have fun at your TA sessions, and will come out a lot more knowledgeable of China, Mandarin, and Chinese culture. NO reason not to take this class. 5 days a week with daily homeworks and TA sessions seems like a lot but it is very manageable and it is easy to get help at any stage of the semester.",
    "Definitely a rigorous course, which will force you to learn at least a little bit. This is a hard course though, requiring a fair amount of homework every day in addition to a significant amount of study. As somebody with absolutely no talent for languages, I often struggled with the constant feeling that I was falling behind, and unable to retain the vocabulary and fluency of my peers. On the other hand, if you do have a knack for language I'd say those same peers are a testament to how far this course could potentially bring you. Good luck!"
