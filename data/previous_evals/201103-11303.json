    "This was an excellent formal way to develop my research ideas further!",
    "Great class, great professor, very helpful for anyone who wants to do or understand research.",
    "The article readings were mainly focused on ecology-based topics, and without a background in ecology I found myself lacking an interest in these topics or struggling to understand them. The Honest Broker material was an extremely dull read. This book should not be required, but the topics could be discussed.",
    "I enjoyed this course very much and found it to be extremely helpful.",
    "This course is excellent for anyone wanting to conduct scientific research. The assignments for this course directly relate to each student's research interests, and provide a jump start for the semesters that follow.",
    "My main comment would be to reduce the number\/volume of reading required each week and choose a specificsubset of those readings to focus on. The readings were fine for the first part of the semester when courses in general were slow, however, when things became busier the consensus was that most students wouldn't even touch the reading since it seemed daunting.",
    "Question 7a: Os was great, but I wish we had had more lectures with him. I feel like I got a lot out of the lecture classes, but fewer than half of the classes actually involved him lecturing.Question 7b: Hannah was a great TA; she facilitated conversation without forcing or leading it herself; I feel like I got a lot out of the discussion sections.",
    "This course has no field trip so I decline to answer Question 9.",
    "Q8: This was the best course I had this term. It was the only course that had a good amount of discussion, which I view as one of the most important aspects of graduate education, and which was sorely missing from my other classes. I appreciated that the assignments were meaningful, and resulted in not only useful skills and new insights, but in something that could be practically applied to advance one's goals as a scientist. Overall, I felt the expectations of students were within reason, and that most of the readings were valuable. The new perspective I gleaned from taking this course was inspiring, and I felt that the instructor did an excellent job of guiding students to a space where they could make connections within their own work, and come to greater clarity on their roles as scientists. I fear that I may fall into old habits in my thinking and approaches to research, and would consider taking (auditing) this class again in the future to help rejuvenate critical perspective.",
    "The most useful course I took this semester - I got a polished proposal at the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I got credit for working on proposals that I would have written anyway and I got feedback on them.",
    "The buildup to the final assignment is well-structured and well-timed for helping the student stay on top of it and to understand the progression of the work.",
    "THe assistance of working through a real proposal for submission for funding, etc.",
    "Basic philosophy of science and how to be a scentist.",
    "The class was an exceptional learning tool for writing scientific grants and proposals. The tasks of writing proposals in steps forced a thought process which resulted in a complete understanding of the requirements. I also enjoyed the visit by the research office member. She was very helpful and explained our resources thoroughly.",
    "I was able to learn how to focus my research with valuable proposal writing skills.",
    "The top-notch instruction.",
    "The course forced me to start seriously reading literature early in the semester and get me thinking carefully about what I want to do for the summer.",
    "Learning the skills of writing successful research proposal. I like the way Professor divided the class lecture and discussion material for giving us a thorough technique of starting to ending the proposal writing.I think it would have been better if the course was geared towards all kinds of research but not just hard core scientific study.",
    "Discussing science philosophy with people who have a diversity of scientific interests.",
    "Working through the details of how to write a grant proposal, which I had never done before.",
    "Learn the right altitude to do science research.",
    "The best part of this course was learning to consider one's role as a scientist more critically than most of had before. While a portion of this course was preparing a research topic and working on grant development, I felt that the meat of it was really about thinking through how we interact with the world and our respective disciplines. In this way, I think this course would be invaluable for all FES students, not only those who are heading towards \"hard\" sciences or structured research. Other excellent parts of this course include numerous discussions, meaningful readings, and coursework that was front-loaded in the term.",

   "comments": [
    "I seemed pretty good as is, but it was a little annoying that only regular 2-year MESc students, not Yale College students or MESc5 students like me, were eligible for research funding.",
    "Instructions were not always clear.",
    "The instructor should be more explicit regarding what he expects in written work--either with an outright explanation of the grading rubric or, at the very least, a notice at the beginning of the course that not only what is mentioned in the assignment description.Some of the lectures felt too vague and or basic to be helpful.",
    "It was extremely difficult, and felt skewed towards ecologist. It would be nice to have variance in the research of the professor and TAs.",
    "The peer review board (mock grant panel) became a 'luck of the draw'. Depending on the audience reviewing the proposals, many were overlooked or not well understood, and therefore resulted in some strong proposals being thrown out. One review group felt forced to choose a \"strong\" proposal, while another group had many strong ones and had to throw out some that would dominate the other \"forced chosen\" ones. Maybe this process can be restructured; potentially by completing randomizing the papers reviewed by ALL students, rather than groups. Further, having the reviewed papers by anonymous. Unfortunately, there was some talk of advocating a paper because of friendships.",
    "I enjoyed all parts and do not think that anything needs improvement.",
    "None.",
    "I wish the discussions had been more like a workshop for ideas on what research projects we had. I felt like what we did do wasn't particularly helpful to me, but maybe if there was more one on one interactions (exchanging papers with people and talking about them in depth, instead of talking shallowly as a group about everyone's) might have been a lot more helpful. It's hard because we have a lot of different interests in the class, but maybe grouping people doing similar work (modelers with modelers, ecosystem services with ecosystem services, ect) would have been good.",
    "Addition of topics in course lecture and reading things related to science and policy. The recent trend of research such as something on modeling.",
    "The reading volume as noted earlier.",
    "More lectures with Os.",
    "How to write a scientific proposal.",
    "This course does not need significant improvement. One possible addition that could be nice would be to bring in students further along in their research to talk about their individual processes, thereby offering insight and perspective on the road to come.",
    "Perhaps a more structured approach for the annotated bibliography would be useful - instead of 15 papers due at once - perhaps 5 due on general background, then 5 due on papers related directly to your topic, then 5 due on papers that were conducted at your field site."

    "TAs were very helpful, quickly responded to all questions, and generally laid out what was expected. I think for the future, what is required of the assignments should be laid out more clearly for what the professor grades, because certainly I would have done better if I knew what the professor was looking for. Maybe this is just because some people have less experience with research and natural resource research than others, but the people with less experience could do just as well as the people without experience if they were told what sorts of things were expected.",

    "Even though I'm a MESc5 and finishing up my master's research, this was a very helpful class. I used it to develop my ideas for what I want to begin working on in my doctoral work (not at Yale) next year. Having a formal class to do this and get feedback was fantastic.",
    "Very important to have for research, and if you want to do research you need to take this class, both as curriculum but also because it's a really good stepping stone. I don't have much research methods background.",
    "The class was extremely helpful overall and a great learning experience. The course is vital for my overall program, because I hope to continue research over time. I have taken a research methods course during my undergraduate degree and did not receive the same quality and quantity of skills as I received from this course.",
    "It helped to guide my research for my program.",
    "This course focused and accelerated my research plans for the coming semesters.",
    "It was good that I started reading literature as early as this class made me, because it made me realize that I don't want to do the project I had in mind during the first halfof the semester. Now I have time to figure out a project that it more feasible and potentially useful before the funding deadlines in February.",
    "It will always give me the skill of writing proposal for any kind of work I do in my life. I had lacked this skill in my previous works so I plan to use the proposal writing skill in writing papers for other courses to make an impact on decision making by science, such as through science advocate approach.",
    "Clearly this course was necessary for my degree, however, it was probably most useful towards my career as it provided the forum by which likeminded, and sometimes dissimilar, thinking students to discuss important scientific concepts.",
    "Extremely important- required for MESc but also a useful class as grant\/ proposal-writing is a key skill for most environmental careers.",
    "This course provides me an introductory to science study, which is very useful.",
    "At the moment, I plan to conduct research during my time at FES and in future education. This course was an essential piece of that process in terms of developing requisite skills in grant acquisition. In addition, I have always felt that strong research skills are essential for all scientists, and knew that regardless of my current researchneeds, there would be value in thinking critically about the ways that I approach and think about science as a research-based discipline.",
    "Extremely helpful to my project development. I'm surprised that all the FES students aren't required to take some variation of this course. It was extremely useful in helping me to develop my interests and direct my focus for the remainder of my time at Yale."

If the assignment says \"use at least 10 sources\", always use more. Not only is this expected (but unsaid) but it will help you develop a more sound argument\/basis. Edit, edit, and then edit again.
