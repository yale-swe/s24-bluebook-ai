    "Professor Clarke can seem a little spacey, but she's a great professor, both passionate and knowledgeable about her field. A really interesting course. Her \"assignments\" look deceptively easy though, and the workload may be greater than you expect.",
    "Only if you're interested in the material because you can get a lot out of the readings.",
    "It's a great class and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the issues surrounding the topic of reproduction.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are interested in social policy. I like the first semester better because it has a more organized theme.",
    "Lots of reading, not all necessary, caring, friendly, but fairly inarticulate professor that holds students to a much higher standard of articulateness than herself. Last half of class was interesting.",
    "If you are interested in sociology and in reproduction as a social area then take the class."
