   "comments": [
    "The course is an introduction to research design in comparative political science. It does so by reviewing a variety of books and articles in the field or outstanding examples from related fields in social science.I would recommend the course to anyone in political science. It emphasized universal skills of research design and writing. Useful even if you are not a comparativist.",
    "This class is necessary for political science students who are taking comparative for a subfield, so it is required. It is a good overview of the literature and a nice chance to spend time with other students in your cohort.",
    "This is a pretty fun course, and a de facto requirement if you want to do comparative politics. Most of the books are very good, and the articles at the beginning and end are too.",
    "Excellent review of the key pieces in Comparative Politics. Very helpful for professional development."

   "comments": [
    "I deepened my knowledge of comparative political science markedly. I intend to use comparative research in my dissertation so it will contribute nicely. However, even if I did not plan to use comparative methods, I am sure it would be a good addition because of its emphasis on research design.",
    "",
    "This course was useful because it made me read texts that will be on the comprehensive exam and because it covered important issues pertaining to employment in the field, such as preparing papers for publishing in journals. However, I feel that detailed discussion of the text by students would have been more useful for helping me think about the text for the coming exam than just hitting the key points on research design.",
    "I learned a lot about political science.",
    "Provided excellent background of comparative politics! This course will aid in my designing my research studies in the future."
