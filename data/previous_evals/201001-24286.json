   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you're already relatively fluent in speaking and need to learn how to write, take this course. It also teaches you grammar and corrects the bad habits that you may have become used to at home.",
    "I highly recommend the course to another student with a heritage background in Chinese, but only if he or she is willing to invest the serious amount of time to get something out of the class. Liang Laoshi and Jiang Laoshi are very good professors, the class is conducted\/designed well, and you will definitely improve your Chinese, but it's 1.5 credits for a reason. A heavy class.",
    "122 is a great continuation of the Chinese language after 121 for a beginner with some background in Chinese.",
    "It's a great introductory course for heritage speakers-- as long as you have some background, the rest is very systematic and relatively easy (if you keep up with the work).",
    "good intro vocabulary chinese course with prelim background",
    "Yes, it's much the same course as 112.",
    "I would recommend taking this class, but know that it will require a good amount of work to keep on top of your daily characters and dialogues. It isn't exactly difficult, but a lot of time is generally necessary to do the best you possibly can in the course.",
    "Lots of work, but its worth it. Your Chinese will improve",
    "I would definitely recommend this class especially if you are a heritage speaker and wish to improve upon your speaking skills and learn how to read and write Chinese.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Chinese. It's effective and can be fun."
