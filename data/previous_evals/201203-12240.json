   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to someone who is looking to continue their study of Russian. The professor is amazing and the content of the class really helps move your language fluency along. This class is totally worth taking!",
    "If you have already taken 2 years of regular Russian, or 1 year of intensive Russian, this means that you really want to learn the language. It is not time to stop now after investing so much time and effort to get to this level.The third year is especially critical in this sense. I noticed that I was able to speak much better at the end of the first semester, and I believe I will have improved even more by the end of the second semester.Other than that, if you come from a Russian family not living in Russia, or if you have lived in Russia for a certain time, having obtained some skills in speaking and writing in Russian, but feel that there is room for improvement, this course will help you make that improvement.",
    "The course is a fairly fast paced review and refinement of grammar from past Russian courses, with a strong emphasis on developing more competent reading and speaking, with stronger vocabulary. I would recommend this course, because of the four-skill approach to the language and thoroughness of the instruction.",
    "This is the continuation of intro Russian. Emphasis is placed on participles and gerunds, use of different cases (especially as complements of verbs and objects of prepositions), and verbs. Grammatical material is accompanied by historical\/literary reading (which is interesting but rarely relates to the vocabulary taught in the rest of the course). Professor Muravnik gives brilliant explanations of grammatical complexities and tells fascinating historical anecdotes but can also be somewhat disorganized and scattered. The two textbooks for the course are not really meant to be put together and never fully integrate into a cohesive curriculum (they also are in places out of date or simply wrong, and Professor Muravnik carefully corrects all the ambiguities and errors).If you are simply taking Russian for the pleasure of the language, or if you are looking for a rigorous class that will hold your Russian skills to a high standard, I would probably not recommend this course, but if you are looking to keep up your skills and gradually grow your vocabulary for some other purpose, it is perfectly adequate."
