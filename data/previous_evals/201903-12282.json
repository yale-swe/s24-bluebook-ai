    "A very good understanding of Polish grammar, vocabulary and linguistic structure. We also learned about Polish history and Polish culture.",
    "Polish in past tense, future tense, vocab and grammar relating to geographic location, making plans with others, and a great amount of learning about polish history, culture, and art!"

    "Krystyna is an amazing instructor who clearly cares a ton about teaching. She is very patient at explaining complex grammatical points, but also strongly believes in having us speak and make mistakes and learn to hear which phrases sounds correct instead of getting too hung up on grammar.",
    "This is a tremendously interactive and enjoyable course. Professor Illakowicz is engaged, thoughtful, supportive and clearly very knowledgable. Her approach to teaching is to make students comfortable speaking out loud, allowing them to make mistakes.",
    "Very well paced and organized, students have ample time to learn material and ask questions, and submit\/correct homework on a daily basis for feedback"
