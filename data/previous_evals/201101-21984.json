   "comments": [
    "Pretty straightforward\/easy\/interesting class. Very broad survey of the time period - pretty cool. Merriman obviously knows his stuff very well but he enjoys ranting and raving about random things. It won't affect your grade because the TAs who grade your stuff don't seem to hate Republicans. Last I checked it was still constitutional to own guns. At approximately 11:21 am every Monday and Wednesday, I had a huge urge to go back the middle of this country, sing God Bless America, pack a lip full of skoal, clean my guns and joke about how, if it wasn't for the United States of America, spineless France would be speaking German today. If you're looking for that type of reaction within yourself - sign up.",
    "Use this for a distributional requirement, nothing else.",
    "The course (reading) is interesting. The class itself is brutally boring and pointless, making class optional. All you have to do is do the reading and go to the movie viewings. So, if you like reading History, and don't want to go to lecture, take this class.",
    "Great survey, though it's really broad and there's a ton of reading. If you get obsessive about the details, like I did, it might be an unfairly heavy reading load - but then again that's your own fault! Writing the paper was actually fun. If you're atall interested in history, this is a great place to start. And John Merriman is an excellent lecturer; you'd have to try really hard to fall asleep.",
    "The lectures seemed to supplement the readings, as opposed to the readings supplementing the lectures. Ultimately, it seemed one could just read the text book and never come to class.",
    "If you are a history major, take something more in depth. If you have yet to take a history course yet or if history isn't your best subject, you might want to consider this class. It isn't a lot of work and the textbook makes for good and clear reading.",
    "History 202 is fun. Merriman's hilarious, the course material is not that hard since, even if you haven't studied European History before, you already kinda know it from being a human being in the Western World.A good background class to have.",
    "Easy - don't take it Credit D like I did! The lectures are even online so you don't have to get up in the morning.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting and not so intense history class, this is a pretty good one to try out. The midterm and papers aren't so bad, and the workload overall is pretty manageable.",
    "I would recommend it. Interesting enough, fun reading and very easy.",
    "The lectures are basically A Survey of John Merriman's Mind, which is not necessarily a bad thing - he's a fascinating person - but make sure you are invested in the textbook. A lot of reading, more than I expected, but most of it very interesting. Very broad scope, quality of experience depends a lot on the T.A. you get. There's a fun paper to write (the fun depends on you)... WATCH OUT. FINAL IS 50% OF YOUR GRADE. Make sure you know that going into reading week. Overall, yes - I would recommend this course to someone looking for cool tidbits of European history, but only if you're willing to do the reading.",
    "You should definitely take this class, if you do not know much about European History. I never took AP Euro History in high school, so for me this class covered new material on a lot of topics. But if you do have a sound knowledge of European Civilization, you will probably find this class boring and redundant. Also, be aware that this class covers a huge expanse of time and therefore does not go as in depth as other classes at Yale probably would.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. As a non-history major who enjoys the subject this course was perfect. Merriman is entertaining and lecture was a joy to go to. It was a great overview of a large piece of history that was incredibly manageable. The reading is also manageable and interesting for the most part. A great history course for everyone to take!",
    "I would recommend this class to aother student if they want to gain a broad understanding of what happened in Europe in the last 300 years or so. There's a ton of reading, so if you fully invest yourself in it you might get more out of the course, otherwise doing the bare minimum (just some textbook reading....none of the novels) will get you by.",
    "A fun way to learn about European History. Not the most organized course, but somewhat of a light workload.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, actually.Sure, I learned a lot, but because it was taught in a rather uninteresting manner, I'm probably going to forget everything within in a couple of months. And the required readings are kind of ridiculous.Take art history with Nemerov instead - you learn about Europe through a more interesting lens.",
    "The lectures are not very helpful, but the textbook covers everything you need to know. So I'm not sure if I'd recommend this course.",
    "It's a pretty good course about this time period in European history.",
    "It's what it sounds like - a survey of Modern European History. There are two lectures a week, plus lengthy reading assignments (for a lecture), a few films, a midterm, final exam, and research-y paper. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are REALLY interested in European history - Merriman is too disorganized, and given that it's a lecture, it's too much work for not enough critical engagement.",
    "Definitely take it if you haven't had any exposure to European History or need a refresher course. I never took AP Euro in high school and felt like this was a gaping hole in my education, and I learned so much in this class. Professor Merriman isn't the best lecturer, as he goes on tangents and constantly inserts random French words into lectures, but his book is great and you'll get a lot out of the class if you do all of the readings. The extra readings and films are also quite good. Be prepared for a lot of stuff on war.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! Good class! I took this course because I wanted a good general knowledge of European history, and I definitely got that! Very similar to AP Euro, so I would only recommend taking it if you (like me) did not take AP Euro in high school.",
    "HIST 202 is a course for those interested in having a broad overview of European history.",
    "Basically a series of anecdotes from the 17th century to WW2. Not really much work, just read the textbook and you basically know what happened, and read the list of key terms he sends out before lecture as an idea of what he maybe talked about\/what could be an ID on the test. Don't really learn that much history though",
    "Yes, I would recommend to anyone wanting a broad European History survey course. There are 2 exams and a paper.",
    "Take it!",
    "History of modern Europe is a wonderful introduction to European history. I had never gotten to take ap euro in high school, but this was even better! Merriman is well informed, helpful, and excited about the material. Definitely take it!",
    "Yes - recommended - especially when you want to cover the loopholes in your knowledge of general European history.",
    "Yes, very interesting class.",
    "History 202 offers a good overview of the larger narrative of European History following the 30 years war. It looks both at small instances which capture larger themes and the connections which draw history on. It is a great class and I would highly recommend it if anyone was at all interested.",
    "Yes, take it if you are like me and never properly learned European History in high school and want a basic survey. You'll learn important knowledge that has shaped the world that we live in now in significant ways.",
    "History 202 gives you a great overview of modern European History. There is a lot of material to cover but its divided fairly well. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Hist 202 is a great survey course of European history, with an engaging professor and some great TAs. The textbook, written by Professor Merriman, is wonderful. Lectures, while very entertaining, are very scattered and lacking in clarity\/structure. However, because the professor wrote the book and most sections are great, it doesn't matter so much. Take this class!",
    "It's a fun class where you definitely learn a lot. There's a ton of reading, but you're not really expected to do all of it. If you've taken AP Euro, it's probably a bit of a repeat so you won't get that much out of it. But if you haven't that much experience with modern euro history, then it's wonderful.",
    "Covers a wide array of topics and does a great job with synergizing all the period and information"
