   "comments": [
    "Many of the readings were very enjoyable. The discussions were often semi-lectures given by Professor Wetters due mostly to the lack of participation from the students. Professor Wetters gave several interesting lectures, though. He is a caring professor who truly wants you to do well and learn. It is obvious that he puts in a lot of effort in the class and does not treat the class as a secondary priority to his own research.",
    "If you are interested in late 18th\/ early 19th century German literature then absolutely take this course! You are introduced to many important writers and thinkers, many of which you may not encounter in other literature courses.",
    "Yes this is a terrific course. Professor Wetters is great, and as a non-humanities major, I gained a ton from this course. Definitely take whatever courses Professor Wetters offers next year!",
    "I took this class as a requirement for my German major, but I would certainly recommend this class to any student who wants to learn about German Literature and Culture.",
    "This is a survey course on German literature of the Classical and Romantic periods. The class covers a large number of authors, some of whom you might take to more than others. During discussions, the occasional periods of eerie silence were probably more a function of the introverted nature of our class, rather than something that can be directly ascribed to the professor or Andrew, the TA. Prof Wetters is a generous and shrewd critic of written work, as well as a dedicated seminar leader; he always tried to make the scheduling of essay assignments as humane as possible. In any case, definitely shop the class and consider if its style's to your liking."
