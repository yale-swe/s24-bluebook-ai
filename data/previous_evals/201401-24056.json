    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. You will learn different theories of how decisions are made, and how to make better decisions.",
    "GLBL 724 looks at different theories about decision-making through the lens of national security. Examples of questions it examines include: How does a leader's style influence the decision-making process and choice of the group he\/she is leading? How do decision-makers act when they are supposed to be representing the interests of a certain group? How do decision-makers cope with uncertainty and time constraints?",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in taking a stimulating class that is widely applicable to a range of fields.",
    "100% yes! This class is extremely information, both because of the professor's unique perspective, both within policymaking and within the academic community, and because of the inter-disciplinary nature of the reading material. There is a lot of reading, but it is fascinating!",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to those who are interested in national security issues. Everyone should take courses from people who have worked outside of academia.",
    "The course touched on a lot of different disciplines\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093IR, political science, history, organizational psychology and sociology, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093but it didn't necessarily go into any beyond a surface level. This course was a good survey course and would be a good way for a student interested in the topic of decision-making to get an introduction to a lot of different aspects.",
    "I would recommend this course for those who want to learn the fundamental of American national security.",
    "Yes."

    "I was fascinated by how complicated decision-making, perticularly at the higher levels of gov't, can really be.",
    "This class gave me a better idea of the stresses a person would face as a bureaucrat, a member of the intelligence community, an advisor to the president, etc. It has given me a better idea of the decision-making pitfalls associated with each of these jobs.",
    "It confirmed my interest in pursuing policy work in the future. An amazing class!",
    "This class helped me to think of decision making in a new light, and to think of some of my preferred methods of decision making an analysis in a fresh manner.",
