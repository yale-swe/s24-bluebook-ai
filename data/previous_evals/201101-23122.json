   "comments": [
    "A solid introduction to the historiography of colonial America. Essential for students preparing an oral examination field in early American history, or for students who want to contemplate various approaches to historical narrative.",
    "Readings course on colonial America covering many different themes from religious history to history of emotion, to Native American studies, to Atlantic studies to race, to gender. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Professor Demos is fantastic. No matter what he teaches, take it.",
    "Readings in Early American History is a readings course that addresses many of the major historiographical topics in the study of early America. Themes include encounters between Europeans and Native Americans, the impact of European colonists on the land, the growth of slavery and racialized patterns of thinking, material culture, communication, emotional experience, and the origins of witchcraft. The course introduces students to these themes and how major historical works (both classics in the field and more recent scholarship) have addressed them. Students read one book and an additional article or chapter each week. Over the semester, students prepare one book report on an additional book, and prepare a report on a set of primary sources. The final project is a historiographical paper on an early American topic of the student's choosing."

    "I was lacking in colonial\/early American coursework - this filled a significant hole and was taught by one of the renowned masters of the field; what could be better?",
    "While I am not planning to focus on early America itself, I feel that the course gave me an absolutely essential grasp (or beginnings of a grasp) on major topics that are both important to know as an Americanist in general, and that have influenced the scholarship in my field. I feel that the course helped me broaden my scholarly reach and helped me see connections in American history that will be essential to my research, even if my research is not specifically in early America."
