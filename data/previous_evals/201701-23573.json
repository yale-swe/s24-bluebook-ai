    "Best prof at Yale in my experience.",
    "Great stuff!",
    "I appreciated that the course was geared towards completing a project of our own without any assignments that felt like busy work. I also appreciated that using different software packages was welcomed, this helped introduce me to several packages, which is very useful.",
    "Question 15: Some more focus on developing coding skills for beginners could be helpful.",
    "JR is an amazing professor... no one else could get students so excited about statistics. He made class so fun and engaging that I genuinely wanted to show up, even though he also videotaped all his lectures, which was also so valuable in learning the material. He was also readily available and responsive. In terms of the content, I think Jonathan did a good job balancing theory with applications. We learned the basic math\/theory behind the statistical tools we were using, but didn't go into unnecessary depth.",
    "Professor Scherer was great to work with.",
    "Jonathan was a great instructor. He was super helpful with the class when we needed help and her replied very fast on emails and making appointments were very easy. He was even helpful with general statistics questions that was not even related to this class. Great statistics professor! I was little worried before taking this class because it has been awhile since my last stats. class in undergrad but Jonathan was super helpful so I was able to catch up really fast. Would definitely take his classes again.",
    "I suggest review and improving the slides. There were almost a thousand slides, with no apparent order and some duplicated content. There was no consistent flow, as could be seen from jumping around back and forth frequently in class. I would like to see step by step to do each analysis. 1) do this test 2) do this test 3) interpret this value 4) etc.",
    "JDRS is a master lecturer, entertaining and erudite. But the material is extremely complex, and requires both conceptual underpinnings and software capabilities I struggled with--and I wish there were more support for this. I never saw, met, or heard from any of the TAs; I'm not even sure they were actually involved in the class at all. JDRS is very smart and, when you can pin him down, helpful, but it was hard to schedule my work schedule around his and so many students needed his step-by-step help; I wish there were more hands-on guidance from the Statlab for many of these concepts and techniques. Also, at the end of the course, JDRS taught Amos for SEM, and we were really excited to use it--only to find that not a single computer at Yale had Amos installed, and we had to go through a whole rigmarole to get that accomplished, which wasted precious time at the end of the semester. Frustrating that basic stuff like that wouldn't have just been communicated earlier."

    "The prof for this course, JRS, is amazing -- creative, energetic, and great at explaining things. The timing for this class (right after lunch on Tuesdays\/Thursdays) wasn't optimal, but he kept us awake with stories and inside jokes. He was also very available for office hours and incredibly patient if you went to him with questions.",
    "Clear, entertaining lectures that broke down difficult concepts with ease.",
    "Doing homework on our own datasets was an excellent call - especially for the final project, it was a lot more engaging and motivating to work on something where I was genuinely interested in the answer (and follow-up work might be publishable).",
    "The flexibility of the course, allowing students to watch lecture videos if they had another class with a conflicting time. I was able to take this course and fit it into my own schedule without having a conflict detract from my learning.",
    "The professor is very friendly and approachable. The topics discussed are very applicable to empirical analysis.",
    "The class itself ended up being as much work as you put in. If you put in the bare minimum (which was a decent amount of work but not overwhelming), the coursework\/problem sets were helpful enough that you still got to learn all the fundamentals of the course. If you wanted to put in more effort, the problem sets enabled you to do so, and the prof was there to help too. The fact that you could use your own datasets helped student really engage with- and feel accountable to- the material in a way that wouldn't be possible with more traditional problem sets. I also really liked that the course was inclusive of so many disciplines, as it allowed us to experience creative and diverse applications of statistical tools, which is valuable in research.",
    "Professor Jonathan was great to work with. Really well set up class.",
    "Great course. I have learned so much and I will definitely use what I have learned from this class to my research.",
    "The course was very well organized and this helped in understanding how each multivariate approach could be applied in different situations. The flexibility in working with a data set of choice helped frame the key concepts of this course in a way we could easily relate to. The ability of the tools used to help visualize output thorough different techniques taught in class was one of the best aspects of this class. Visualizing complex interactions between variables, spatially as well made this course really interesting. The software examples were also handy in helping with the coding process.",
    "Going through the homework assignments was very helpful in really getting to undersatnd the concepts in this course.",
    "Interesting class, Jonathan is a great professor and engaging. The techniques will give you a broad sense of multivariate stats but it will require you to engage if you want to get deeper.",
    "Concrete practice using multivariate techniques, which are explained dynamically and with humor by a great professor.",
    "Professor is great! Makes stats accessible and engaging.",
    "I really enjoy Jonathan's work to make the class interesting and fun.",
    "I really like that this course allows students to work with their own data to learn and implement the multivariate techniques. I also appreciate that students are free to work on their own or in groups, as they choose. It is also very nice that Jonathan allows us to work in any of the statistical programs we choose. His knowledge of each is an awesome asset to the course and it makes the material so much more relevant and useful to a broad audience!",
    "Instructor enthusiasm",
    "Showed how to make stats applicable to real data.",

Also, the availability of the video was amazing for those of us who had to travel, but didn't inspire people to come to class much... that's not really an area for improvement, just a general comment.",
    "Nothing.",
    "I found that if I zoned out briefly, or my mind was slightly too slow recalling how (say) an eigenvalue was calculated, I could miss a lot of things - you'd say something that seemed important, but I'd feel like my brain was missing a lot of the reasons *why* it was important. (\"Wait, why is it significant that this technique does not require the variables to be correlated?\" etc.) I think this is common to any topic like this, though, so there might not be much you can do to avoid it. More reminders of previously-covered concepts might not hurt. It was sometimes possible to complete aspects of the assignments without feeling like I fully understood the underlying concepts. Overall, though, they were pretty well-designed.",
    "There were not that many TAs, so maybe having a better system of finding qualified TAs would help",
    "Overall a good course. I enjoyed being a part of it.",
    "Having taken an introductory stats class a long time ago, I could have used a little more reviewing prior to some of the stats tools, e.g. MANOVA.",
    "there can be more sessions for softwares.",
    "The course can be little too fast...",
    "The course could benefit from being talk in a more intimate and interactive setting where students can perhaps even perform exercises relevant to the day's lecture in class. I think the course could also benefit from more than one software 'bootcamp.' Lastly, given the enormous amount of technical skills from this class, the lecture could benefit from a professional data skills recitation session.",
    "Maybe the pace of the class could use some improvement. Sometimes the theoretical explanation, while important seem disconnected from the assignments and the practical exercises.",
    "My major complaint is this: We're encouraged to work in groups and submit homework assignments jointly - but group members who don't submit the assignments are then unable to see any TF feedback when the assignment is returned. There must be a better way to submit\/return assignments!",
    "This is both a positive and a negative: I was able to complete the course with an extremely limited understanding of the math behind the techniques. This was certainly my own fault for not taking more time to understand the concepts. BUT it is something that I had focused more on.",
    "Software management and training with students; TA involvement",
    "Sometimes I wish the instructor better connected the minutiae he's discussing the broader picture of the technique he's addressing.",
    "It would be nice if the homeworks were a bit more challenging, sometimes I felt if i had any problems i could look at the examples and piece together an answer without understanding it.",
    "Many students do not attend class in person. It would be great to have the course held in a smaller classroom so those present could have more meaningful discussions and be more inclined to ask questions. Perhaps a clear online option to determine how many students will actually be in class and plan accordingly?",
    "Clarity of connection, and when to use each analysis.",
    "For me, going through, some times I got lost in the details of the methods and needed to take a step back to remember the goal. At the beginning of the course was a decision tree for when you would use different methods; I think it would be useful to refer to that at the start of each new topic to see where it fits in."

This gave us the flexibility to use the most appropriate\/helpful software for each analysis, and gave us exposure to new softwares that we hadn't all used before. Additionally, working in a group allowed us to discuss the material in great depth and problem-shoot\/solve material that weren't comfortable with.

    "I really love that I had the option to either work in a small group or independently. I learn much better on my own and appreciated the opportunity to do so.",
    "Great. They were like additional TAs.",
    "Groups were useful ways to work through code and see how others would write it. It also was very helpful as a way to learn how to do something.",
    "Advantages: Group problem solving, learning code from each other, practicing group dynamics Disadvantages: Scheduling conflicts"

   "comments": [
    "You can put as much effort into this class as you want, and you can also put very little effort into it and do fine. It's worth it to do the former, though -- you'll learn a lot.",
    "Stay on top of the homework and take advantage of the ample office hours available.",
    "If you didn't understand some concept from lecture, it's worthwhile going back and reviewing it (with any of the many provided resources!) before the next lecture - the understanding debt can pile up.",
    "This was a pretty comfortable and not-scary environment in which to learn statistics - I'm not a math person and felt that I learned a lot and the work was manageable.",
    "audit or taking it for credit is worthy it!",
    "Brush up on coding skills. Great opportunity to learn more about data analysis.",
    "The class is MUCH more valuable if you come in with your own dataset and study questions\/hypotheses. My group didn't have our own dataset until the final project, but I was friends with people who had collected and were using their own data, and I think they got much more out of the course. In the final project, I found that my group was more committed to learning\/applying the course's statistical methods when we had our own data. More generally, take this course! It's fun and helpful in orienting yourself (and your research) in multidimensional space!",
    "Just take it. Professor Scherer is simply the best.",
    "just do it.",
    "Take this course. You will gain a lot...",
    "While the course can be time consuming and challenging at times, the multivariate data skills learnt are worthwhile for anyone interested in social science and big environmental data research. Also, anyone interested in honing skills in R, SPSS and STATA should consider enrolling in this course.",
    "Make sure you keep up with the lectures, and leave plenty of time to do the homework, especially if you are unfamiliar with the program that you are using for the homework assignments.",
    "Commit and get your own dataset to work on, so you can take advantage of the class.",
    "Take it. Jonathan is an excellent professor.",
    "It is a good skill course. Take it if you want to learn how to use different statistical softwares",
    "Work in a group. Keep up with the material from the beginning and your final project will come together quite smoothly.",
    "Have data that's important to you and that you're interested in analyzing. If you don't have your own data, start looking as early as possible and ask for help\/loaner data.",
    "Take it!",
    "I recommend you come in with a really solid dataset that you can use for the whole semester, that you know the ins and outs of, that has lots of quantitative variables, no missing data, and a very high number of observations. Also, consider ways of taking notes that don't distract you or make you too crazy from trying to keep up with JDRS's adventures in multi-dimensional space.",
    "Recommend taking it.",
    "You will learn the most from this class if you read about the techniques, attend class and\/or watch the videos (I often re-visit videos while doing homework), and run through the examples that Jonathan provides at home.",
    "Come with a clear set of research questions and a healthy set of expectations that not all of them (indeed, even any of them) can be met. It helps to have data that you care about, though. Can use this information in other aspects of your work.",
    "Use R.... and if possible, try to take a basic R class beforehand.",
    "Pick a group that you like working with and has similar schedules, because you will be spending a lot of time together! Choose a dataset from the start instead of working with provided data."
