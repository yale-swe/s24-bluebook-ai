    "Really good class. Its a lot of work, but it pays off at the end of the year because you improve your Chinese alot. Definitely recommended.",
    "Yes -- totally worth it.",
    "The workload for Chinese 140 was very demanding, but certainly bearable once you get into a routine. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to become fluent in Chinese.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 140 because it's not really any harder than 130 but you gain a great deal of vocabulary and enhance your speaking and writing abilities!",
    "Yes!",
    "Chinese 140 is a really great and highly structured intermediate Chinese class. If you are interested in learning Chinese, it is very much worth it. The teachers are great and you will be impressed at how much you learned.",
    "Chinese 140 is a fantastic class that I would highly recommend. As with Chinese 130, there is a great structure to the class, and Liang laoshi, Mu laoshi, and Sun laoshi are all amazing professors.",
    "I would completely recommend Chinese 140 to any student wanting to improve his\/her overall Chinese. They make us catch up in writing, reading, speaking in the correct tones and practice daily - which makes all the difference in the world, when learning a language."
