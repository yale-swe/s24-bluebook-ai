   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend it.",
    "This class is great. The theme when I took it was \"Myth and Memory in Modern France,\" which was a really good (and interesting!) introduction to some of the high points of French history from the Revolution to now, mostly focusing on France's revolutionary heritage; all in all it was really cool and featured a pretty diverse set of readings. Prof. Pinzka is a sweetheart and actually is invested in helping you learn how to express yourself in French, and won't make you feel like you're stupid if you make a mistake. The workload is also super-manageable (three papers and one presentation.) Highly recommended.",
    "It's a good course, the workload is manageable although the readings can be challenging at times (but you definitely don't have to do all of the reading each time. I would recommend it if your writing still needs some help but you don't want to take any more French language classes. I took it over French 160 and am so happy I did because I hear 160 is a ton of work.",
    "I would recommend it to another student as long as he \/ she had adequate french ability to keep up with the course. It's hard to understand some of the readings if you are not an experienced french speaker.",
    "I mainly took this class because I enjoy French literature, and to that end I wish that we had had better readings toward the end of the course. However I did learn a lot about French history, and I loved coming to class and partaking in the discussions we had.",
    "French 172 is a fantastic class that provides an introduction to both France's history and literature. Highly recommended.",
    "At this level, I suggest thinking about what exactly you want from a course like this one before subscribing for it. Some of the material we did was great, but as a whole the class (and discussions) is rather shallow in its course content beyond reading\/watching films\/discussing in French. For those who might want more of a challenge with these books and the topic, perhaps they can take something more rigorous. If you wish to have ample discussion time on a set of books in a not-too-intense classroom environment, this may be right for you.",
    "It's a strange way to organize a course, so there are dips of boredom in the syllabus, but by the end you'll have spoken and written a good deal of french, read some cool books and seen some great films. Mme Pinzka is really the clincher--she makes every class radiate.",
    "It's a great course for those interested in history. Even for those who don't consider history as their best field, the course is flexible enough to allow an approach from other areas like art, film, and literature."
