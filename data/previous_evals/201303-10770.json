    "You will learn so much in a semester, but it will also take a lot out of you. Do the homework every day, invest time and energy, and it will be a very rewarding experience. Or it could become very troublesome if you do not.",
    "It's a wonderful class. If you're ever going to consider learning Chinese, do it at Yale because L1 Chinese will give you an excellent, solid foundation. The rotation of professors allows you to experience different teaching styles.",
    "Chinese 110 is a lot of work, but it's all very predictable. You get into a routine after a while, which is what I really ended up enjoying. And at the end of the semester you realize just HOW FAR you've come. Very rewarding class.",
    "A great class. I would recommend L1 Chinese to anyone interested in learning the language. There is a lot of work, but it is worth it. Instructors are great as well.",
    "It is extremely challenging and time consuming course, but very well taught and very rewarding!"
