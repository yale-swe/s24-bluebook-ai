    "It was great! Although i am not a nutrition person Rafael was able to incorporate other aspects and focus it more on maternal and child care rather than only looking at nutrition. Even when talking about nutrition-dense topics (i.e. folic acid) he would make the information more applicable and understanding. Although it was sometimes annoying to write weekly writing assignments they really helped develop a better understanding of guidelines, why they were developed, and it was a nice supplementation to the reading.",
    "Great lectures. Very insightful",
    "Overall, a great course. I enjoyed the discussion component of our class. I would just suggest grading the final paper in increments.",
    "There was a lot of work, but I thought the topics were all very interesting. I also appreciated that the final paper was due early, and I liked the feedback process.",
    "Great overview of the course material and some very detailed lectures\/discussions when necessary. Left with a good sense of where the field is going."

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Rafael is a wonderful professor. He is very considerate and concerned about the needs of his students. Even though he is always traveling and going to international conferences he is very responsive via email and will answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0He is extremely knowledgeable about the material and incorporates his work experience very well.",

    "I thought it was a great course. If you're very interested in maternal\/child health I 100% recommend it. Even if nutrition is not your favorite topic. Rafael was an amazing professor and the course was interesting. Even though the final paper is a lot of work he gives you a lot of feedback and forces you to work on it throughout the semester so you're not rushed or cramming at the end.",
    "Everyone should take this class",
    "A great course that covers maternal and child public health nutrition in the U.S. and abroad.",
    "Really interesting course if you're interested in maternal and child health. The class was pretty small, so I appreciated the small setting for discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in this area. The lectures were great and writing the paper was actually very fun and a useful exercise."
