   "comments": [
    "DS is a great program, but try to stay out of Fistioc's section. Class discussion was not nearly as focused as it needed to be, and she at times feels a little aloof.",
    "It's a great introduction to philosophy, if like me you haven't done any before, but might be less worthwhile if you're used to it.",
    "This is a great introduction to philosophy. Not only will you read from the great philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas among others), you will also learn how to think like a philosopher. I thought philosophy was going to be the hardest part of directed studies for me, but the structure of the class made it much easier and more accessible than I thought.",
    "If you've never taken any philosophy before, be prepared to buckle down in Fistioc's class. Professor Fistioc is a hard grader, but she recognizes students who make an effort in section and in writing. She tries to make time to see all of her students, and her comments are usually helpful and illuminating. In this section more than any others, I felt I made a deeper connection to myself by reading these great works. Ideally, you get a better sense of who you are and how you identify yourself, so it may be helpful to go into the class not caring that much about the grades. The reading goes downhill after you hit Aristotle, but does get much easier. The final is comprehensive, but not unbelievably tricky.",
    "I would recommend it. The student should be aware that it requires a lot of time, and that the pace is very rapid.",
    "Philosophy has some of the shortest, but the most dense, readings. They can be very time-consuming and difficult to get through, but its still feasible. Professor Fistioc has students sign up to give in-class presentations and make detailed handouts for nearly every reading, which is really helpful when it comes to studying for the final. In general, the class is much more about student participation than professor instruction - Professor Fistioc lets everyone talk, which can sometimes be detrimental when it means there is not enough time for her to teach.",
    "I definitely recommend DS Philosophy. We read a lot of interesting works, although I expect the works second semester will be even more interesting. Professor Fistioc leads a good section. She has a very particular conception of good writing which emphasizes clarity at the expense of eloquence - so make sure you meet with her and make sure you're following her guidelines.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is an introduction to the thoughts of the great minds, focusing on Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient thinkers, as well as medieval writers like Quinas and Augustine. DS allows a close reading of the text and a discussion of the ideas presented with a professor and a small group of some of the smartest minds at Yale.",
    "DS Philosophy is somewhat like a crash course in Classical Western Philosophical Thought. In the first semester you start with Plato and end with Christian ideals portrayed through Augustine and Anselm. Throughout you are expected to read a good amount of texts, averaging about 60 pages for each section meeting. It seems like a lot, but you learn how to manage your time and how to read texts with the ability to absorb important themes and messages. It's usually less compared to the other DS classes. The essays might also seem daunting, but if you start working on them at an earlier time, so that you at least have a thesis to discuss with your professor, you will be in good shape.I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While it is a large work load, you will be exposed to various Philosophical ideas along with your peers where you will be able to discuss these books throughly and bring up ideas completely new and intriguing to you. It's a completely different experience than if you were to read these texts on your own.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The materials we read are difficult but interesting and discussion in section is usually very good. While in-class discussion can sometimes wander or suffer from vagueness, Dr. Fistioc is extremely helpful in office hours--definitely take advantage of this!",
    "This is a great introduction to some of the most influential works of ancient philosophy. One of Prof. Fistioc's strengths was her suggestion that each person do a presentation to the class on the reading for the day. The person who presented needed to learn the material very well and then summarize it so that they could explain it to the class. Prof. Fistioc saw that these presentations were well done and helpful to everybody. One complaint I have would be that oftentimes discussion would center around the question \"Does this argument make sense?\" rather than \"What does this argument mean?\" After class, I was sometimes still unsure what the arguments essentially meant.",
    "DS philosophy is a good introduction to the philosophy of the western canon, focusing on Plato and Aristotle. Philosophy was definitely my least favorite section in DS, but that is variable for different people, and I would definitely suggest DS to another student."
