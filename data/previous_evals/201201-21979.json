   "comments": [
    "It's a fast paced review of black theatre. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in black theatre but never had a chance to read any good playwrights. It's a really great class.",
    "If you have even the slightest interest in African American arts\/theater then you should take this course. The plays on the reading list are really interesting and the discussions are lively and thought-provoking. It's definitely worthwhile, and the workload isn't too overwhelming.",
    "Not one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. McGinley demands a bit too much and the class itself isn't that satisfying.",
    "The course consists of weekly readings\u0097a diverse selection of African-American plays and theater theory\u0097and eye-opening discussions on these readings. Having had little previous knowledge of the subject matter before taking the class, I feel like the course was a fantastic introduction to a relevant topic. I would recommend taking any seminar with Paige McGinley; she assigns a very fair amount of work and helps her students to engage with the readings.",
    "Good reading list, interesting history and topics. Manageable. Worthwhile.",
    "YES! Great course, especially if you're a theater studies or race studies or American studies major. Make sure you can read the plays each week and do the posts on time (it's relatively easy to do, the plays are interesting and mostly short).",
    "Yes. Relatively easy assignments (about 1.5 plays per week) and it's great material."
