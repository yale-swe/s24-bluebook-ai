   "comments": [
    "Strengths- the topics are essential to learn for working in healthcare and are interesting. Lectures feel more like a multi-way conversation often, which is informative and impressive that Howie is able to tailor the class this way. Weaknesses- the final questions were fair but the grading was very picky. Many of the SOM students were not as committed to working on the final project, the class may be better if taught by Howie still but at YSPH or the med school.",
    "I think the course material is very beneficial given that it provides an overview of the US healthcare system. Given that it is similar to an undergrad course, I feel as though some more practical applications rather than rote memorization of detail would be more helpful\/applicable at the graduate level.",
    "Strength is learning about all areas relevant to US healthcare and its current state Weakness is that its mostly cursory and can't cover all these topics in depth. I would like to have questions that test more than memorization. The final project is somewhat arbitrary given there is no specific technique we learned that should be applied to the presentation. Seems just like an assignment for the sake of having an assignment.",
    "It was a great opportunity to learn more about healthcare topics in more detail. A way it could be improved could include the instructor explaining more about exam content during lectures.",
    "Great overview of the healthcare sector in the United States. Very comprehensive. Dry at times, but that is the unfortunate nature of some very important topics in healthcare policy.",
    "Mandatory if you intend on working in healthcare",
    "Strengths: Howie! Only suggestion: add a glossary",
    "A great overview of a wide range of topics in healthcare. It would have been nice to have a midterm (or short quizzes throughout the semester) rather than just one final at the end so that we could stay on top of the material and better evaluate our understanding of the content. Loved the review sessions and thought that they were very helpful. Emily was an amazing TA! It often felt hard to participate because class was dominated by several students who asked a lot of questions (felt like the participation component was geared towards individuals with an already higher level of understanding or familiarity of the content). Would have appreciated more opportunities for discussion.",
    "Great overview of the US health care system.",
    "Really enjoyed this class. Instruction was great and sparked good conversation among the students",
    "Material is very interesting, taught at a reasonable rate, and Howie is great.",
    "strengths: -Lectures are updated based on contemporary issues, so students are able to connect present-day news headlines with concepts as covered in lecture",
    "Strengths: this is a great crash course in the American healthcare system. Howie is an entertaining lecturer and his vast experience really enhances the course. The workload is very light until the final project, which became a bit all-consuming. Weaknesses: I would like to see the class draw on the readings or perhaps cases to have a richer discussion in class. Also, I actually really valued the financial analysis portion of the final project but don't think that there was enough structured support for it given the general lack of experience, especially with DCFs. It would be great to spend class time or a review session on how to do this, and special considerations relevant to healthcare.",
    "Strength: great introduction to the overall American healthcare system from all angles Weakness: too much information for students to obtain a clear grasp of all topics in one semester",
    "Strength: Great overview of healthcare as a whole Weakness: Not much practice with economic\/financial data in class"

Lectures feel more like a multi-way conversation often, which is informative and impressive that Howie is able to tailor the class this way. Weaknesses- a few of the lectures moved very quickly and were not presented in as linear\/consolidated a way as possible.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Very knowledgeable and makes the class humorous with personal anecdotes",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Good at lectures. Tends to veer somewhat off topic but overall the stories are always interesting. Sometimes caters questions that are not relevant to the class.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is a great instructor and his lectures are overall very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is great at covering a huge amount of material at a seemingly leisurely pace. As a student, I don't feel rushed, which is nice.",

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0There was a lot of content presented in this course and I appreciate how thorough Howie was in covering it all. However, it was sometimes hard to tell which ideas or concepts were MOST important, because so much information was given to us without really summarizing the key takeaways. I also felt like many students did not really have a chance to particpate.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0More interactions between professor and students may be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is a great professor and is extremely knowledgeable. Staying focused and on track w the syllabus would help, but overall I found the content relevant and important and the pacing appropriate",

   "comments": [
    "This course covers almost every topic in healthcare and is essential to the curriculum, especially for students going into management in healthcare.",
    "It provides an overview of the US healthcare system including multiple involved industries, such as pharmaceuticals, hospitals, etc.",
    "I would summarize the course as a great intro to all topics healthcare. I would recommend it because very few students know everything about healthcare, and all the different topics.",
    "This is a useful course for any student interested in working in the healthcare industry",
    "If you want to have a comprehensive overview of the US healthcare industry, this is the class to take. That being said, the material can be dry at times.",
    "Most informative course Ive taken thus far.",

    "Yes",
    "great summary and strong introduction to different facets of healthcare",
    "Definitely a good overview of the healthcare industry. Prior knowledge is useful but not required",
    "It's mandatory but it's fantastic.",
    "Good intro course on variety of healthcare topics. Recommend for students who want to learn about healthcare in US Prepare to volunteer and participate.",
    "-great if you are looking for a comprehensive overview of the U.S. healthcare system, as well as the underlying issues and landmark legislation that shaped it up to present day",
    "Good course to obtain a cursory understanding of the multi-faceted healthcare system. Not too much work until second half of semester, and most of the work is on an in-depth research project for a healthcare company of your interest. Would recommend.",
    "Perfect for a student who is interested in healthcare but does not have a strong background in the industry."
