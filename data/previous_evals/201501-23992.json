   "comments": [
    "Mexico is a country with a history that is tragic, frustrating, and inspiring. this course spans this long history and you will come away with important lessons about the Mexican people, their resilience, and their efforts to make their nation great.",
    "Yes, definitely. You should be interested in Mexico specifically, though, not just looking for a ROTW requirement. Gil Joseph is a great professor.",
    "This course is, like Mexico, timeless and relevant. The subject matter and breadth of information covered will introduce you to a range of issues that one might hope more legislators would understand. If you want to know about the United State's most important foreign relationship, this class is a must.",
    "IF you're interested in Latin American history, yes.",
    "A good overview of mexican history.",
    "Gilbert Joseph is possibly one of the most phenomenal history professors and Mexican history is his specialty. Take it.",
    "Good overview of Mexican history since the Mexican Revolution (although the course starts a little before) through the present. Professor Joseph is fabulous not only extremely knowledgeable, but also an incredibly kind and supportive mentor. He brought in two guest speakers at the end of the semester who were experts in different aspects of Mexican politics or current events issues, which was a special treat. The workload was spot on not too much reading, but enough to give us a solid grounding for seminar discussions. Coursework also included movies (some of them Mexican comedies), which was a welcome break from reading and offered a different perspective on historical issues. Definitely recommended if you're at all interested in Mexico, U.S.-Mexican relations, or Latin America!",
    "Professor Joseph is an insightful, caring, and dedicated teacher. He is very experienced and runs his class in an organized and effective manner. I could rave on and on about his course and his teaching methods. As for the material itself, Professor Joseph does a wonderful job guiding the conversation and each week's topic so that students really do gain a strong sense of Mexico and all of its elements. Students will present and occasionally lead discussion, so consider the other students in this class when you are choosing courses."
