   "comments": [
    "This is a class on psychoanalytic theory (not literature), primarily Freud and Lacan. The texts are often very, very difficult. Be prepared to endure your own as well as your classmates struggles with understanding even the most basic concepts in some of the reading.I imagine the ideal student to be a theory and\/or philosophy junkie. If you're of this mold, you should have a good time.Moira is great and, having been a real, professional psychoanalyst, she speaks with a rare perspective.",
    "Take the class if you have any interest in Freud, take it for your core seminar requirement - basically, if there's any reason you might want to be in this course I can think of no reason not to take it.",
    "Without question.",
    "If you like psychoanalysis--that is, if you're interested in theoretical texts (without much literature involved)--this class is wonderful. Prof Fradinger is energetic and extremely well-versed in the material; she will immerse you in the discourse of psychoanalysis past your ears. Be wary though---class often becomes diffuse, conversation veers off, and she often continues discussion far past the allotted time (which is fantastic if you want to discuss more, but frustrating if you are busy and feel that discussion has only just gotten interesting 1.5 hours in).",
    "This is my second class with Moira and she is a great professor!!This course is so important in that it helps you deconstruct all those things you have been taught to believe in and makes you aware as to how you are such a passive product of this society.Great class! Starts off a bit slow, especially if you are encountering the texts for the first time but soon you will be rolling in all that theory! And Moira knows her stuff for real, and helps you understand the texts.Her best class is still Radical Films of Latin America though. Best class at Yale everr!!",
    "Like reading Lacan... except you are reading him in the tunnel of love while surrounded by teddy bears and hot chocolate. Tres bien.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are willing to endure its annoyances.",
    "Yes, the class can be frustrating sometimes (no structure, free-flowing discussion, annoying students), but it pays off. Stay after hours if you can to get some 1-on-1 convo with Moira, it pays off.",
    "A wonderful, wonderful course. Shop it and meet Professor Fradinger-- I could not possibly describe her here. Psychoanalysis is strange and thrilling and thorny...and it has influenced and structured much more of our way of thinking about things than you might expect. Discussions are the liveliest I've had at Yale-- and the stakes are always high and real...it never feels like you're talking just for the sake of talking. Class always goes at least 2 hours over time. A joy!",
    "A full class that can get very confusing at times but is ultimately worth the ride.",
    "This course on psychoanalysis rather than a course on psychoanalytic approaches to Literature. As such, it is great, but don't expect to work on literary texts - the reading is heavy psychoanalytic theory. Moira is a delight, but the course is very unstructured, so you will have to structure things yourself if you're avoid falling into the drift.",
    "I think every student should have an experience like this. It's a great class. You will learn so much."
