    "It's a step for all PhD students and can be both helpful and a burdensome as a step toward independent research.",
    "540 is a time carved out for doing research and talking about research.",
    "Yes, great opportunity to move a research project forward and begin thinking clearly about the review and publication process.",
    "Research and Writing introduces you to the world of professional writing and publication. The class is too big to give you much personalized attention on your project (and by the time you actually get to discuss your proposal, it may have changed a great deal or you may have progressed beyond that stage, so it may not be terribly useful). However, it is an excellent primer in professional political science and what it means to be a professional scholar. Very useful."

    "I felt like this class was first and foremost about professional development. It is explicitly focused on advancing our own research, and is incredibly valuable for giving us focused time to work on our own projects."
