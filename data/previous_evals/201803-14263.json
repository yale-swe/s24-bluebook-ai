    "A wide range of theoretical and empirical insights about contemporary political psychology studies, and critical views on experimental studies in this field.",
    "This class provided an excellent and accessible overview of political psychology and its applications to political science research, particularly with regard to the role of identity formation on political behavior. I learned how political psychology could be applied to research in culture, conflict, religion, and the role of elites in opinion formation. In addition, this class provided good initial exposure to methods used in political psychology research, such as ethnographic research, lab, field, and lab-in-the-field experiments.",
    "This class enabled me to evaluate literature from political science and psychology to better understand the sources of political behavior.",
    "A better understanding of political psychology, was quite helpful in generating my bibliography."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are a lot of readings - which is an advantage and also somehow a disadvantage. The preparation for the course has been \"tough\", however, there are many different aspects provided and the selection bias (due to disciplines) is also well mitigated. Discussing many readings in a two-hour course is also a difficult job, it is hard to get into depth. My suggestion is that a balance between review-type readings (where the reading is dense) and empirical ones (where the research design might be more of importance) shall be found; Review articles, sometimes, must not be obligatory. However, it also depends on how the course shall be structured, I myself prefer an inductive approach where we start from minor points to form a bigger picture.",
    "The strengths of the course were in providing a broad overview - theoretical, applied, and empirical - of political psychology and its applications to comparative politics. It was also refreshing to have this course taught in the context of comparative politics, rather than drawing entirely on research from American political behavior. A couple of possible suggestions for improvements are: (1) providing slightly more guidance during student discussions to ensure that discussion does not stray too far from the topic and to ensure that key points from readings are covered, and (2) slightly more time spent covering the methodologies in political psychology research and their various strengths and weakness.",
    "The strength of this course was the breadth of the assigned readings. It included readings from several different countries as well as several different disciplines.",
    "Very interesting readings. Because the course spans so many different themes some of the readings seem quite irrelevant to ones own interests - but that seems inevitable. The discussions were generally engaging, though some of the students in the class contributed very little making the atmosphere in the class at times rather strange, not sure whether anything could be done about that."

   "comments": [
    "Students who are generally interested in psychology and seek to conduct research on the micro-foundation of political science should take this course. It provides an excellent introduction to psychological theories as well as their realisations in political science. Specifically, the comparative view which involves a wide range of polities\/contexts is very helpful. I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in comparative politics, political psychology, or political behavior. It would be useful for students in psychology looking for an introduction to its application to politics, or political science students interested in political behavior, group identity, conflict, and religion.",
    "I would recommend (and have recommended) this course to other students. This course was well organized and assigned a significant amount of reading. It was absolutely a class that students got out of it what they put in. It introduced readings and concepts that will prove useful for future research agendas.",
    "Yes, I think it gave a very good overview of the field that I very much needed."
