    "A good overview of Viking culture, and the workload is definitely dependent on what you want to put into it. Find a final project that you're excited about, and it will be infinitely better.",
    "Only take it if you're really interested in VIking history and archaeology. The readings are abundant and mostly dry.",
    "If you like Vikings, take it. If you like archaeology, consider taking it.If you like both...It's tons of work if you do all the readings, but not much if you don't (like me!)",
    "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in the Vikings, you should take this. That said, if you also want to learn about a people who really made modern Europe and the West what it is today, you should also take this class.",
    "If you have any interest in Vikings or archaeology (and the seminar program still exists), take it.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are interested in the subject matter. The class is definitely interesting, but very specific. There are also a lot of readings on closed reserve in the library which can be really frustrating.",
    "If its ever offered again, and you can get into the seminar, and you have any interest in the subject at all, you should most definitely take it. The course was simply put, amazing, possibly the best I've taken at Yale. Philip Jones is a great professor.",
    "Viking Age Archaeology was a class about the Vikings through the lens of archaeology, meaning that there was a strong focus on material cultural. As someone who has always found the vikings fascinating I really enjoyed the class, but I found a number of the readings rather dry. The course provided interesting insight into the field of archaeology for a non-major and revealed a number of fascinating debates in the field. If the class is ever offered again, I would highly recommend it to someone with interest in both archeology and vikings, but not for someone with interest in only one of the two."
