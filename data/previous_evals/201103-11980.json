   "comments": [
    "Interesting class if you are willing to work on your own.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It is all over the place. The readings are either interesting but not applicable to the class, or important but EXTREMELY boring\/confusing. Our discussions were most interesting when we were just spitballing, sharing anecdotes about interesting sense-related memories. The readings are totally unnecessary for the class. It was a very weird class, the whole way through. Nobody really seemed to like it, and more importantly, people were very confused by it. I wouldn't take this class again, and I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Yes as a fifth class -- little work, the readings can be interesting, and you are challenged to think initially about how much the west privileges sight.",
    "This course is a great opportunity for discussion. You learn a lot simply from doing the readings and getting to talk to peers about them in class. The final project was so open-ended that it was really to see what each member of the class came up with. The workload is completely manageable, it's mostly reading, and the class is very fun.",
    "The class is made up of incredibly interesting topics; unfortunately, those topics are presented with little logic or focus. I would recommend the class, but I'm still figuring out just how much I got out of it.",
    "This class is interesting and really gets you to look at theatrical performance in a new way",
    "I would highly recommend taking a course with Professor Lamp, and this course in particular. The class readings, assignments, and outside speakers that were brought in this semester were all of the highest quality, and the professor is one of a kind at Yale. Because the class attracted a variety of students from different backgrounds, the discussion and ground covered were very rich. Five stars!",
    "It was a class where we looked into the senses and how they have been perceived and interpreted in various cultures and time periods. We talked about how incorporating the senses in museum and theater practices could enhance viewer's understanding of the works or aid the artist ins conveying ideas and emotions.",
    "The class examines the way the full sensorium has been and might be engaged in various art forms. It considers the participation of the 'viewer' as well as the 'actors' and seeks to find creative ways to merge these two roles. I would definitely recommend the class."
