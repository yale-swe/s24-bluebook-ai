    "take this class!",
    "Good, general course on the UN. Focus on Right to Protect and UN peacekeeping, as well as diplomatic efforts. Prof. Krasno has much experience and stories to share, and will bring in interesting speakers. She is very passionate about the UN and that carries through in class.",
    "Take it.",
    "Great class, gives an understanding of the international system and what it means to be a part of the UN",
    "Really interesting material and good professor. If you're looking for a vibrant, discussion-based seminar, however, find another class. Half of the class is student reading presentations and half is Krasno lecturing. Lots of people on laptops the whole time. Kind of unfortunate: the UN is a fascinating and timely subject. Worth it for a relatively easy class, but not if you're trying to get an interactive seminar experience.",
    "This class is way too easy to blow off and not do the reading, so do yourself a favor and do not take it unless you plan to be personally motivated to engage with the readings and bring up your own comments in class. There is NO class discussion which is awkward, especially because you look around the room and realize NOBODY is paying attention and everyone is staring at their laptops. A laptop ban in this class could really go a long way. Also there is no incentive to do the reading unless it is the day you are presenting. If you're just looking for an interesting poli sci class, this isn't it...there are much better classes out there. However, Prof Krasno is really sweet. The format of the class just doesn't work.",
    "It is not a course that will make you think differently, but rather--as any political systems course--it is about acquiring an understanding of the framework of the UN. I would recommend only if you will do all reading; otherwise you will learn little.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting look at the UN and how it itself functions and how it impacts the global community.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this class to anybody who wants to learn more about the UN or anybody who thinks they know a lot about the UN.",
    "It is a great course, my understanding of the UN increased significantly after. Take only if you are majoring in Global Affairs or International Relations."
