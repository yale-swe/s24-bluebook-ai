    "A difficult but standard survey in integration and series.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "If you need to know Calculus 2 then definitely take this class. Don't try to teach yourself from the textbook. The class and the textbook worked very well together to teach Calculus 2.After taking Calculus AB in high school this was the perfect class to take. There's a short review in the beginning but everything else was new material.",
    "I would only recommend taking it if you had to fulfill a requirement, and try to get Orszag as your teacher.",
    "Make sure you thoroughly understood AP Calc BC before you take this class. It's definitely one level (or two) beyond BC so if you don't have a good foundation, you may struggle with this class. The midterms and final are pretty hard so make sure you know ALL the concepts REALLY REALLY well or else you will get owned. I would recommend it to those who are prepared as suggested above; it's definitely NOT a gut class. You will have to work hard.",
    "Take Mathematics 112 first, 115 is more difficult than you think.",
    "Math 115 is a challenging course, regardless of how much background in mathematics you might have. But if you're up for the challenge, and want to learn a lot of fun tricks (both related and not-too-related to the scope of the course), definitely consider taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who genuinely enjoys calculus. In that case, Orszag is probably the best professor as well. He does not seem too interested in calculus himself, except in the ways that it applies to more advanced math. But he was very clear, and it's clear that he is the leader of this course.If you need to take this course to fulfill a requirement, you won't enjoy it, but go ahead and do it.",
    "This is really only a class that you should take if you really need to, and if you really think you need to, you should double-check your priorities. The material covered on the tests is substantially more difficult than covered in class, so expect to study a lot outside, and overall the quality of instruction could have been better. If you must take it, take it with Michael Frame if possible, otherwise take it with the section professor, and your experience will be a little lesspainful. The homework load wasn't too bad (one problem set a week), but it was inadequate preparation for the tests.",
    "Math 115 is basically the second half of BC Calculus, from methods of integration to infinite series. It's a little trickier than high school calc, so even someone who did well in BC might want to take it as review. There are weekly problem sets which can be tough some weeks but are generally very reasonable, and there are two midterms. The teaching is notoriously miserable, so you need to be somewhat independent about learning the material. I wouldn't recommend this course unless you need to take it or unless you did well in high school BC and are looking for an entry-level math course that won't stress you out too too much."
