   "comments": [
    "I would probably not have taken this course, if given the chance to choose again. While Professor Siu is very nice, and some of the case studies in the second half of the class were very interesting, there is too much theory and generalization. If it weren't for Professor Siu, it would have just been all very pretentious - the use of long words and metioning Marx all the time for no reason.",
    "Yes, take this course if you want an advanced seminar that does not require you to talk a lot. You will still learn a lot about urban anthropology, which is a fascinating subject that can be applied to many other disciplines besides anthropology (architecture, sociology, history, political science).",
    "Urban Anthropology and the Global History is a must-take for those interested in urban studies or (and) South\/East Asia. It is divided in two main sections, the first comprising the theoretical framework within which have an assessment of the general dynamics of urban development in a global net, and the second including on the other hand the single, focused case studies.Professor Siu makes clear however that this is not an easy class, and she is indeed a tough grader. Nothing impossible at all, in any case, especially considering that the weekly reading barely consisted ofmore than eighty pages.",
    "While I liked the material, I can't recommend this course highly because there was so little discussion. Prof. Siu's teaching style leaned more towards lecturing and by a certain point in the semester, no one was talking at all. I also think that this course attempted to cover too much. Yes, it is a global history focus, but jumping from topics as diverse as Brazilian street children to African traders got a little confusing at times. However, Prof. Siu is really nice and very helpful during office hours. I enjoyed working on the final project because it was a topic I was interested in. Perhaps if the syllabus were changed and participation were made mandatory, the class would have been better as a whole."
