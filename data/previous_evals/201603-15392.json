    "I learned intermediate Spanish vocabulary and grammar. I improved both my accent, pronunciation, and writing. I also became a better reader.",
    "Spanish 130 provides a good review of Spanish grammar and introduces new concepts in a way that's easy to understand. The course places a high value on developing students' reading, listening, writing, and speaking skills, by having students read a number of short stories, watching videos, etc. There is also a cultural component to the course.",
    "Improvement in speaking and writing in Spanish",
    "speaking with better fluidity, using a higher level of vocabulary, perfecting grammar",
    "It was a great opportunity to improve my Spanish.",
    "I improved my conversational and writing skills in Spanish. I learned a lot of new vocabulary and grammar, as well as some of the culture of the Spanish speaking world.",
    "I gained greater fluency in the Spanish Lanuage and learned a lot about the culture.",
    "Improved my knowledge of Spanish grammar as well as my proficiency in speaking",
    "I hadn't taken Spanish since my senior year of high school, which was 4 years ago, so I had forgotten a decent amount of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. That being said, as far as I remember, Spanish 130 filled in a bunch of gaps not only for things that I had forgotten, but also for basic rules that I had never learned. In high school I went through the AP course and got a 4 on the exam. 130 was mostly a review, but with important foundational review and some grammar rules that were completely new to me. The vocabulary I think was the weakest element. I think there could have been more vocabulary and that it could have been presented in a more sensible way. But basically, my grammar became a lot stronger, especially with direct and indirect object pronouns.",
    "Spanish 130 helped my develop my Spanish grammar skills. The course focused on intricate grammatical details that I previously hadn't learned, and my Spanish greatly improved due to the concentration on details."

   "comments": [
    "This course was amazingly well-organized. From the very first day it was clear what would be happening every single day of the course. The homework was useful, but not too much, and the the tests and quizzes while numerous were not overwhelming and very helpful.",
    "Strengths - really good pace for learning new vocabulary and grammar. Weaknesses - a lot of the CC assignments felt like busy work, some supersite assignments asked for precise answers for very vague questions so it was easy to get them wrong just because of insignificant things (like making a noun singular instead of plural when it doesn't matter for the context of the question)",
    "n\/a",
    "The course is very organized, which is both good and bad. It is good because I knew how to prepare for every test, which was very fair. But sometimes I felt like the routine got a little bit boring.",
    "The strength\/weakness of this course is having class every day. It helps with fluency, but it also makes life that much harder.",
    "Strengths were the frequency of practice and immersion. Some of the readings could be repalced with slightly more engaging readings, but due to the shortness this is hardly a serious problem.",
    "I think this course is an excellent review of the basics for someone who already has a decent amount of Spanish under their belt. I placed into this class so I cant say how it jives with 120. Its strengths are definitely that it provides a strong grammatical foundation. I think it could go into grammar more, though it would get a bit more boring if it did that. I also enjoyed the majority of the stories in the cuaderno. I think this course could have been improved by giving more\/different sensible homework and reviewing grammatical concepts (after they had already been taught) only when there was student confusion on them. For instance, if you spend, one class talking about the imperfect subjunctive, then assign a fair amount of homework on the imperfect subjunctive, go over a select number of questions, and if theres confusion, go over more of the questions or do a different assignment and go over those questions or clarify specific questions. If, however, there is no confusion on the select questions, there is no need to spend the whole class going over what was just taught the previous day. I think the supersite assignments were, for the most part, busywork that did not help with internalizing the vocabulary or more importantly the grammar. I dont think it should be used at all. It was often less than relevant to our focus in class and occasionally it had strange\/particular answers that were frustrating. I also think that some of the redacciones that we did had very strange prompts, like the one with the cashier being threatened by a masked person. The prompts should be made more normal. I would also prefer doing a weekly journal that is more free form than the types of redacciones done.",
    "The course was extremely strong in teaching Spanish grammar very comprehensively. However, I believe there are two areas where the course could improve. First, I wish the course had been more helpful in improving my Spanish speaking skills -- I felt as though there weren't enough activities that required speaking off-script for extended periods of time. Additionally, I believe the activities that corresponded with the stories that we read in the blue course packet can be classified as \"busy work\" -- they required a large amount of time to complete with minimum academic benefit. I believe that vocabulary and reading comprehension activities can be very beneficial to learning a new language -- however, these particular exercises only required excessive regurgitation of information on previous pages that the student would have to search for instead of prompting true analysis of the story or facilitating usage of new vocabulary terms.",
    "Weaknessesf- too much repetition of material in L2; class did not move fast enough, not enough work that focused on communication or interpersonal speaking."

    "Yes! This was the way a language course should be taught. You'll get a strong foundation in the concepts we learned, and your spanish will continue to improve.",
    "Yes! Many students need to take L3 to graduate anyway, but the workload is definitely manageable and all of the assessments are fair.",
    "Yale's Spanish language program is really great and you will be able to have real meaningful conversations in Spanish at the end of the semester",
    "yes, particularly matthew as a professor",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, there is an average workload and there are enough resources for every student to succeed.",
    "Hopefuly, you get placed into L3 instead of L2.",
    "Only take SPAN 130 if you need it for the language credit, or you are somewhat proficient in Spanish but want to refresh before going into your career.",
    "I would recommend this course to you if you want to strengthen your foundations in Spanish. Its not particularly difficult, its sometimes a bit boring, but itll fill in the gaps that you probably need. Also, you might get a fantastic teacher like Matthew.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is very for learning the finer points of Spanish grammar, and although there is daily homework as well as additional assignments, the workload is manageable if you stay on top of all of the assignments."
