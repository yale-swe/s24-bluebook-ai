    "Yes I would recommend the class, I learned a lot but it wasn't stressful which is a unique combination.",
    "Overview of the techniques commonly employed to investigate nervous system function. I would recommend it because it allows students to deepen understanding of the material in small group format with discussions led by experts in the field.",
    "Neuroscience 610 01 is an class that gives you an overview of some of the important techniques in neurophysiology. I would recommend the course as it fills a very important gap in neuroscience classes. It provided a lot of information about techniques that could not be easily found elsewhere.",
    "The class did a good job of covering a large variety of topics in neuroscience in an interesting manner. I would recommend the class."

    "Strengthened my physiological understanding of the body",
    "This course teaches the basics of neurophysiology, and gives an excellent introduction into the most important techniques in neural recording.",
    "It gave me a better understanding of the tools available. It also helped me identify labs using various techniques. Perhaps most of all, it gave me a better understanding of techniques outside of my field so it is easier to understand the research of my peers.",
    "It provided me with a lot of in depth knowledge about the strengths and weaknesses of techniques in neurophysiology. This knowledge will help me decide which techniques will be best suited for the questions I wish to ask in my research.",
    "A great overview. I'm fairly new to neuroscience so this course helped immensely."
