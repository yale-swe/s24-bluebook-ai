    "DS Literature is a great course to take freshman year because it provides an overview of major literary works in the Western Canon. I liked how lectures served to both illuminate and clarify the text as a whole, while typically providing a particular interpretation. Then, in section, we could focus on doing close readings of specific passages and comparing the themes in the texts to things wed read earlier in the year. This format made for very fruitful learning. I would recommend first semester DS Lit to any incoming freshman.",
    "DS lit is an okay course that provides a base understanding of the earlier texts from the Western canon. I recommend that you not take it if you truly have a passion for the classics because you'll be disappointed with the rushed course material.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a lot of reading, and the papers are difficult, but it is rewarding. Your analytical and writing skills will improve.",
    "I would recommend this class to fellow students so long as you get a professor that works to create a productive and positive work environment that lends itself to healthy and vibrant discussion that yields a solid understanding of the texts.",
    "Very enjoyable class, but difficult. Lots of reading, and since it is Literature, you cannot skip much reading.",
    "If you would like to delve into some of the most monumental works of pre-Renaissance literature, take this course! The lectures and seminar discussions expand and sometimes even challenge your own take on the text, and the other tracks of DS provide a historical and intellectual foundation for many of the Lit readings. I would highly recommend finishing the weekly readings before the Lit lectures, which tend to be much more detailed and text-based than the ones for H&P and Philosophy.",
    "I would recommend the class but would advise the student to switch to another instructor's section.",
    "This course covers a staggering amount if material over a brief period of time, and being able to experience this breadth of literature is an accomplishment. Take it if you love books, at all. However, DS Lits ambitious survey of the western canon makes it less feasible for students to truly go in depth and translate their love of literature into love of the class. Take this class if you are interested in truly committing to the material."
