   "comments": [
    "if you're interested in learning more about judaism and religion in general take this course. 1 paper, a midterm, and a final. Very straightforward set up and lots of interesting information to learn.",
    "Yep, it's a great class. Really straightforward design, pretty pain free.",
    "It was a great course and I'd recommend it",
    "Overall, it wasn't too much work. Highly recommend.",
    "Interesting history that you probably won't learn anywhere else! Take it for a fun and not-too-challenging history credit",
    "take really good notes in class and you'll be set solid introduction to jewish history",
    "I 180% (10 Chai's) recommend this course! Coming from an economics major, this class was very engaging and rewarding. Professor Marcus may seem intimidating at first, but after a week you will realize he is such a sweetheart (just make sure the air conditioning is always on in the room!!!). The lecture is just Professor Marcus talking for 75 minutes with a few notes written on the board. So, be ready to really dial-in during class time. Although it requires more focus, you will find that his old-school approach to teaching forces you to pay attention since there is not a powerpoint to simply copy off of during class. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!",
    "If you want a very difficult history course which will require you to learn every major figure, event, community, and date in the history of the Jewish people this is definitely not for you. If youre curious about the early history of the Jewish people, with a focus on Biblical-era to 1500, this is a great class. The midterms are not too challenging (if you go to lecture, review your notes, and skim the readings the night before youll be fine), and the primary source analysis was fun. I found that it provided a very helpful perspective for more recent Jewish history, including that of the state of Israel."
