   "comments": [
    "Some basic writing skills but not much beyond that.",
    "I feel like I left this course with a broad, but surface level understanding of psychology and what that entails. It made me want to take more psychology classes.",
    "Psych 110 did not really teach me much more besides what I had learned in other courses. It was a very general overview of something that I think could be interesting in depth.",
    "i learned an overview of psych topics that can be taken more in depth in future courses.",
    "I gained insight into the human mind\/brain and the causes of our behaviors.",
    "The single most important thing I've learned this entire semester was the deeper understanding of evolution that I gained from reading the very first assignment. (Understanding Natural Selection: Essential Concepts and Common, by Gregory, T.R.) HAVE THIS ARTICLE AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY PSYC 110 COURSE, EVER. Correctly and completely understanding the theory of evolution is so crucial to understanding the topics of psychology and moral philosophy, and it provided a great foundation for the addition of further knowledge.",
    "I had never taken a psychology course until I took Intro to Psych, and I'm glad that I did take this course with Professor Holmes. I learned a lot about human behavior and the brain.",
    "Like in many Yale courses, I managed to learn a great deal of information in a relatively short time period. I have taken a Psychology course in my sophomore year of high school, which I found deeply fascinating because it seemed to at least dance around the question of human nature. Psychology 110 did not dance around, but rather waltzed hand-in-hand with the concept of human nature, intimately examining the various historical arguments surrounding the concept. This aspect of the class becomes especially clear in the last lecture, which discusses human morality.",
    "I learned a lot of general psychology information.",
    "This course gave me a really good overview of the field of human psychology. It helps one to understand underlying reasons for behavior of others, and also helps to understand how others may view your behavior.",
    "I did not develop any knew skills or insight from this course.",
    "I learned about the field of psychology on the most basic level. Each lecture was dedicated to one of the many fields of study within psychology, such as personality, morality, and social groups. Unfortunately, I don't think that I learned many skills; all I really learned was just the class material. Furthermore, I think my biggest takeaway from the course is that psychology is still a field in development, and cannot really tell us anything with certainty.",
    "-Basic foundations of psychological principles -How to write effective reading responses -How to memorize large amounts of information in really short periods of time",
    "I thought this class was applicable to the real world. I learned why certain people attract to certain things\/ other people, I gained insight into why many of my bigotries\/habits occur.",
    "I knew very little about psych and now feel that I have a pretty solid overview of the field, as well as parts of it that I am interested in pursuing further.",
    "Good psych course. Basically AP psych. Already took AP psych so didn't gain much, but not the profs. fault.",
    "An understanding of the fundamentals of psychology, as well as an overview of the different specializations within the field.",
    "shallow intro to many topics of psychology",
    "You learn a lot of basic information about many different topics in psychology.",
    "This was a crash course through several fields in psychology, everything from emotional processing to social interactions to morality. The main take-away from this course is that while the study of the mind can at times seem vague and unscientific, it is indeed a legitimate scientific discipline that is worth pursuing.",
    "A good understanding of the basics and history of psychology.",
    "PSYC 110 was an extremely eye-opening and fascinating class. I learned so much about human behavior and how the human brain works. Most of the stuff we learned was applicable to everyday life, which made the class so interesting. Also, Professor Holmes is really funny and great, so definitely take it with him if you can!",
    "This course gave me a great foundation and overview in psychology. I learned to study in a new way, namely by flat-out memorizing definitions of key terms, but I also gained an appreciation for psychology as a field.",
    "This was an overview of the field of Psychology, so I learned basics about various subcategories of the subject. It was comprehensive and didn't go into much detail about each thing because we were learning broad themes, but gave me a good understanding of what each field is like for future reference in the major.",
    "I learned the basics of psychology, how the brain works, and how behavior is influenced by our environments and our peers.",
    "I actually felt as if I learned a lot about the brain and how it relates to everyday functions. One of my friends summed up Psych 110 well by saying it just gives you vocabulary for things you already know. Therefore, I feel like I begun to study things I think about every day from a more academic angle.",
    "Broad overview of psychology's many sub-disciplines.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the fundamental principles underlying psychology. I also learned how various historical contributions to the field of psychology are viewed by modern day psychologists.",
    "I gained a broad overview into the large field that is psychology. I had the opportunity to learn about behavioral, social, developmental, abnormal, etc. psych.",
    "Was able to understand a wide variety of Psychology knowledge applicable to many daily interactions and observations",
    "I developed a lot of insights about the cues that influence human interaction and behavior.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the basis of psychology in a short period of time and really enjoyed the class.",
    "As an aspiring behavioral economist, I learned much about the processes that internally drive the ambitions of the human spirit. Understanding my personal biology and psychological effects were incredibly useful, in part for my development as a nascent adult but also for an intense, academic enrichment in the field of science. I certainly feel more aware about my person and also my interaction with the world and the people\/environment around me.",
    "I definitely learned a broad range of material about how we view and think about the world as well as the methodology behind experimentation.",
    "basic psychology concepts. Exactly would you expect from any introductory class. A large overview of a lot of topics with sadly a minimal depth. It's nothing personal with the instructor. It's more like that's just how things work out with a survey class.",
    "I learned many concepts about psychological science.",
    "Great into to human psychology, learned very useful, interesting and applicable material.",
    "A general overview of psychology and topics therein.",
    "In this class I developed a basic overview of several of the different areas of psychology. Each week, Professor Holmes would go over a different area of psychology. It was very fascinating and allowed me to realize the many different areas I can go in psychology.",
    "The course is great as an introductory course. Psychology does well to provide a general description of the many facets of psychology. For someone that has not taken a psychology class, it is valuable as a means of testing one's interest in the field.",
    "I was able to develop a general understanding of the connection between the generation of physical events, emotion, and personality, with neuronal brain firing and instinctual human desires.",
    "General psychology knowledge",
    "I learned a lot about psychology and how the mind works.",
    "Learned general psychology knowledge - pretty much what was expected for an introduction to psychology class. I had taken intro to cog sic prior to this course so some aspects were repetitive.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of psychology, and learned about the scientific basis for a lot of human behavior.",
    "Good intro to psych! learned how people make decisions.",
    "Learning about the human mind and it's strengths and weaknesses",
    "I learned about the basics of psychology and new lenses in which to view everyday interactions.",
    "in-class note taking skills improved, seeing the world differently through applying class topics, interest in psychology grew",
    "Psych intro",
    "Very broad overview to psychology. A lot of intro to psych is very intuitive, however, every class there seemed to be something that was so applicable to your life and really just blew your mind.",
    "A lot of \"fun facts\" about psychology and a couple of more deep understandings about the field.",
    "The class was a good way for me to learn the basics of most fields of psychology, and it is helping me in making the decision of which field I want to specialize in. I've learned more about which fields and topics interest me more than others.",
    "I learned how to study lots of facts and remember information.",
    "Intro to psychology was a really good intro class that introduced all the main fields of psychology. Would recommend to anyone even slightly interested in the subject or anyone who wants to understand more about how the mind works",
    "I learned the basics of psychology.",
    "This was a great class. I gained so much insight pertaining to all disciplines of psychology. We covered both the clinical and experimental sides. Excellent teaching.",
    "Foundations of psych, basis for any potential psych major, also an amazing class to take for fun!",
    "I learned about major psychological theories and the biological, social, and cognitive bases of behavior.",
    "Basic psychology, how people think",
    "I learned basic knowledge about various branches of psychology and the theories of notable figures in the development of psychological science.",
    "I learned the basics of psychology in this course, in addition to reviewing biological aspects of psychology that I had learned in previous science classes. This class was my first experience with psychology and I found it very interesting. I definitely learned more about how the mind works and why humans act the way they do and how they are affected by their environment.",
    "Great intro course to psychology where you learn about many seminal studies that have shaped the way we think and act. Highly recommend.",
    "How to study and really put in the work for an assignment",
    "I learned the basic foundation of psychology.",
    "It was a great intro course that is very applicable to not only any major but to everyday life.",
    "I think one of the biggest things I learned from this course was how to study for a test that covers a lot of material. I definitely improved my study habits and learned tips and tricks from our TAs to improve my test grades. I also think this class did a great job at simply providing a great foundation for students interested in psychology.",
    "I think that I've improved greatly from this course as this course has taught me not only to work hard, but to also take notes well during lecture. I've also gained much knowledge and found out more about random, interesting things.",
    "A plethora of skills in many different subjects within Psychology.",
    "I developed the skills of how the brain and all its cognitive processes work, how it affects human behavior - and the role of psychology in all of this.",
    "I have never taken a psychology course before so this course gave me a solid baseline understanding of all the different areas of psychology. I learned a lot of valuable information about how the brain functions and what factors influence our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Taking this class made me realize that I want to advance by knowledge of psychology and allowed me to pinpoint a specific area of the field (developmental psychology) that I am interested in delving deeper into.",
    "I learned a broad overview of the field of psychology, and a lot about how psychological research is conducted.",
    "I learned a general overview of the subject of psychology as well as how to take good notes during a lecture.",
    "A basic but broad understanding of the field of psychology.",
    "I significantly strengthened my knowledge of psychology.",
    "I learned a lot of about the effects the environment can have on an individual, how powerful the brain is, and how to analyze in ways I never thought I could.",
    "This course was useful in teaching a lot of fundamental skills necessary to studying psychology and gave a great overview of the field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Drawing a blank Weak: Lack of any meaningful interaction with someone (TA\/professor) unless you explicitly go out of your way to work out a time. Poorly designed course structure that does little to test actual knowledge. Professor was lackluster.",
    "There's really no guidance with Reading Responses. Having examples really didn't help, and neither did the document that was sent out. I just don't think that it's very likely that students come up with something completely original in a field where we're taking an introductory class.",
    "A weakness that jumps out at me is the book review. I believe it is unnecessary and also very long for an introductory class.",
    "The lecture was very interesting and the reading material went well with the lecture. The majority of the content on the tests had to do with the lecture, and reading the material helped to understand everything Prof Holmes was describing. The workload was very manageable and the tests were fair.",
    "The weekly reading responses were helpful in keeping me on top of the reading. Not always fun to do, but still beneficial. I appreciate that there were 3 tests, as there was less material to study for each test, and it was a lot less pressure!! I did not enjoy writing the final paper. Perhaps it was my choice of book.. so maybe you guys can pick better books! It seems WEIRD that we're required to participate in psychology studies, given the fact that in lecture, we've addressed how problematic it is that the vast majority of psych experiments are conducted using college students as participants, which beings into question its generalizability. Aren't we just perpetuating this problem? Perhaps researchers should figure out a way to find participants that are more representative of the entire population as a whole instead of taking advantage of the fact that we want to pass this class.",
    "Overall good class. Interesting lectures, very reasonable workload. Felt I gained a good knowledge basis for different types of psych appropriate for an intro class.",
    "Very well structured course that takes you on a journey through every part of the extensive field of psychology.The lectures are equally entertaining and educational, and the book review assignment is a great opportunity to delve in some of the seminal works of modern psychology and philosophy. Room for improvement: The teaching fellow Nicholas Santascoy sent out an e-mail with info on the structure of our book review less than 24 hours before it was due. While it was helpful advice, it was really not optimal to have to restructure one's entire introduction of a 10-page paper so shortly before deadline. Ideally, the guidelines should've been sent out way earlier, or not at all.",
    "Our guest lectures weren't very interesting, which I feel is kind of the point for a guest lecture.",
    "Professor Holmes is an excellent lecturer and explains concepts clearly enough for the scope of the class that seemingly-complex and foreign concepts are synopsized to be easily understandable, especially through his use of metaphorical examples. Also, I see great potential in the position of our TAs; perhaps a discussion section between the TAs and their students could be established in order to further facilitate a stronger TA-student relationship; I suggest this simply because I found it occasionally intimidating to speak with my TA due to lack of familiarity and the fact that I had very little idea how formally or informally to interact with my TA. This can be especially helpful in a lecture class, which can sometimes feel alienating.",
    "Excellent course with engaging lectures and fascinating readings.",
    "The course goes into a fair amount of detail at the beginning - which is probably necessary as a good foundation for students that will proceed to become doctors or psychologists. I don't think there is much room for improvement.",
    "Introductory psychology is a course that has a lot of potential to engage students and make them excited about learning and psychology in general. However, this course did not do either of these things. The lectures were straight out of the textbook -- this was disappointing. What is the point of going to lecture? In my opinion, a professor's lectures should complement the textbook, provide new insights, and show real-life applications of the material learned. This course could be improved by taking this into consideration. Another weakness of this course is the 5 hour research participation requirement. As a junior taking difficult courses for my major, this was an extremely large time commitment that decreased the quality of work done for my other courses. I did not learn anything from participating in the research, besides how to cope with things you do not want to do but are required to.",
    "I think this course has interesting material, but the format of the course could really be revamped. The class was framed around our three tests (of equal weight). The problem was that the tests were entirely about what you could memorize. Everything on the slides or anything said in class had to be memorized, and then regurgitated for the test. I think this is the class's greatest weakness. The tests really should be about applying the material, not just how well you can memorize lists and theories. The format of the tests made me learn the material not for the sake of learning, but for the tests. Furthermore, this class highly encourages the participation in 5 hours worth of psych studies on campus. They claim that they don't force it because you have the option of write a long paper and submit it for formal review. Most students choose to do the studies, which is what I did. The problem is that it can be highly unethical, as one of the studies took place in the professor's office. This is highly inappropriate, and I really urge that this piece of the class be removed entirely and made completely optional.",
    "Strengths -interesting content -humorous and mostly engaging professor -not too much work overall Weaknesses -tests seem to sometimes not be correlated with classroom material -class videos are not put up on Canvas -not actually sure, but it seems as if the TFs were inconsistent graders",
    "i thought the strengths were the TAs and the course readings\/reading responses. I thought the weaknesses were in the professors lecture slides, it was hard to follow\/ write notes because he didn't have much information on the slides.",
    "The course is very straightforward and well structured which I appreciated. Lectures packed a lot of info, which I also appreciated.",
    "Weakness was the claimed use of the textbook. I never read it. Totally unnecessary. I think my test average was a 95. Holmes was a great lecturer. Class didn't need a textbook. No point in saying you need one if you don't. Didn't have a textbook for my stats class and that was fine. Strengths was great slides. Could have used more text for review at a later time, but over all good. Also great anecdotes. Helped me to remember. Tests were fair. I appreciated that. Maybe in the future offer the option to download the slides in a \"four slides per page\" format like my bio class. Psych totally killed my data storage for Onenote. Also, I think the experiment participation thing is basically time extortion, but whatever, I don't hold that against Holmes, I know that's departmental.",
    "Does a great job exposing you to a lot of different areas, but doesn't spend much time on any one area, and the lectures can be a little dull at times.",
    "super interesting material",
    "The course delves into many fields of psychology relatively briefly, without spending too much time on any particular field. At times, it did seem that we were learning random tidbits of information that would be of no use further on in our educational careers, but I understand that for a field as diverse as psychology, such a course plan is necessary to create a comprehensive introduction class. One aspect of the class I particularly did not enjoy was the writing assignments. We were assigned to write responses to the reading for every week, and these assignments really seemed pointless sometimes. I understand that engaging with the course material is important, but assigning something as vague as \"reacting\" to the reading by attempting to find relationships between ideas in the text does not necessarily fulfill this goal--especially when the conclusions formulated by students are simply incorrect. I believe that weekly open response questions that require the student to draw on theories from the text to explain given phenomena would have been much more effective. The book review to me was the most pointless assignment in the course, as it was the most vague and unguided of all. Students had the option of either arguing against the points made in the book, or applying them to some existing problem in the world. The former felt like an unreasonable task for an undergraduate with no professional experience in psychology or primary sources on hand, as these books compiled large amounts of evidence to support their claims.",
    "Workload was not bad at all - we had 3 midterms and a final. We also had to write weekly reading responses, which were actually good in making sure we kept up with the reading. The exams were very fair.",
    "Strengths are that it provides a great overview of psychology and starting point for people who want to major in it, that there is no section for this class, and that there is only as much workload as is necessary to learn the material. Weaknesses are that I wish lectures were more engaging and that the book review had more guidance. Lectures could be made more engaging by having more student interaction, in-class demonstrations besides videos, or changing the style of lecturing of the professor to be more active\/engaging.",
    "The slides were good because they had lots of pictures that helped me understand things into further detail. The lab assignment was really arbitrary and unnecessary, I don't know why I was required to do it because it wasn't for a grade and I had to do TEN HOURS OF STUDIES. That's absolutely ridiculous for a big class with students who don't have that kind of time. I get the idea of doing it, but 10 hours is really extra. The reading responses were fine, but my TF graded them unnecessarily roughly. I did the readings at first and got poor grades on the responses, so I started just flourishing my responses more with less info from the text and did better on them. Did they really care that we were reading? The lecturing was good and the videos in lecture were fun. Reading the textbook seemed pretty unnecessary, seeing that most of the exams were based on lecture. The exams were really tough - I studied extremely hard for them and didn't do as well as I should have. They were based on minute details, not key concepts, and the TFs were looking for specific answers, so you could attend lecture and do readings and still do poorly. The book review was also unnecessary, criteria was not really talked about much and my book hardly ended up being about psych (Big Gods), so my essay ended up being a historical review and I'll probably get a bad grade on it. I have to take this class because I'm a psych major, but the structure needs a lot of work. Avram Holmes is super chill though, and his lectures were really interesting. I would love the class if the grading weren't so horrible.",
    "I thought the reading responses felt forced. But they did get me to read each week so there's that",
    "I really liked the setup! I wouldn't change that much except for I would maybe have fewer reading responses and make the ones you do have more in depth. I felt as if I gained a lot from the paper assignment, but next to nothing from the reading responses.",
    "Hmmm some of the material was dry.",
    "The course wasn't difficult in terms of workload but the expectations of the assignments given were sometimes unclear. It was difficult to understand what criteria grades for assignments were based on.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures, a lot of material without being too much to handle",
    "The strengths of this course include Profesoor Holmes's power points, his energy during class, and the stories and videos presented while teaching concepts.",
    "I liked the class a lot. My only complaint is that we did not get our exams back, which I would have liked to receive to see what questions I lost points on.",
    "Course was good at giving an introductory look at the field. However, due to the large quantity of topics covered, preparing for exams relied on rote memorization rather than a thorough understanding of each lecture\/topic. Could be improved by focusing on more general themes and looking at them in detail vs study to study. Great course!!",
    "The lectures were interesting and the reading the book for the book report helped me better understand the material. My TF was also very helpful in clarifying confusing concepts and providing feedback on the book report.",
    "The lecture always touches upon reading and our professor was open to questions as he presented the lecture.",
    "This course was set up such that what students got out of it was proportional to the effort they put in, and it was very fair. For someone who attended all of the lectures, took thorough notes, and did the readings, it was a very fascinating and informative class. In addition, the TAs were very approachable and helpful, and Professor Holmes, in addition to doing a great job at lecturing, was very friendly and funny and kept the lectures engaging.",
    "Strengths: Interactive, nurturing, and intellectual professor who never ceased to amaze me! Fantastic TA's who were always on hand to give advice and answer questions. Reading responses forced interaction with the textbook and search for deeper connections. Book review was loads of fun! Weaknesses: Unclear instructions for initial reading responses (I personally interpreted the prompt as connecting a general idea to two different aspects of the reading, whereas the actual goal was to connect two aspects of the reading together with each other). Unclear grading requirements for the book report (formatting for introduction\/conclusion\/placement of thesis statements were formally given out the day before submission - the rubric was helpful but didn't offer specific guidelines for number of thesis statements\/number of introductions\/whether the paper should be two separate essays or one combined one).",
    "I think the class is interesting but it could be improved perhaps with more of the class notes going online.",
    "Strengths: Well organized and put together. He stayed on topic and helped me learn a lot. A very engaging lecture in the sense that I could stay awake.Good topics and very engaging readings. A good survey Weaknesses: -I HATE GUEST LECTURERS. I honestly felt that most people I was around dozed off after the first guest lecturer (I did too). I know that scheduling is an issue but I just feel guest lectures should be more engaging. The second woman on psychological work just bored me too. Last semester's offerings that I sat in on were just more engaging. MAYBE it would be wise to possibly give the students some choices to make sure its a topic they would be interested in. idk. -Grading was very fair and evenly spread out, which is nice. One possibly chance, however, is possibly having some sort of dropping ability with the midterms. Most classes do let you drop one exam. I do concede those classes do have finals and this one doesn't but it should be considered a possibility. Life hits you in the guts and I think the election is evidence of the fact that we simply can't control when we are optimally functional. Just a thought. -More videos. I love them. -If you're going to make us read papers, at least have the heart to put a question on the midterm about it. I just felt that my studying on those could have been better spent on other material. sorry",
    "Strengths: fairly engaging content (though I wish there were more aha moments) but the lectures were sometimes dry, especially if they heavily correlated with the readings. Exams were fair and I sincerely appreciated having three rather than two.",
    "Strengths, interesting material and lecturer. Weaknesses, some busy work, not always the most challenging material.",
    "Great course, wouldn't change anything.",
    "I loved this course. I thought it was great and showing students all the areas of psychology. I don't think it needs improvement and should continue to be taught in the same structure. Having 3 tests and no final was very nice and I think that is a very good layout.",
    "The course is a lecture and is limited in the sense of engagement that there is. Although the material is interesting, it becomes somewhat dull sitting there without interacting within the class or any application\/consideration of the information.",
    "Answer boxes in tests should be larger.",
    "The course was strong in its coverage of a broad range of topics which allowed each student to identify their particular interests within the field. The lectures were also pretty engaging with lots of examples that demonstrated human error, development, etc. Areas for improvement include limiting the amount of textbook reading, which was rather long and did not help all that much. The information covered in lectures was more than enough.",
    "Strengths: Reading was a bit long, but for the most part was very helpful. Lectures were great - Professor Holmes kept them as engaging as they could be. Reading responses were helpful but not very well explained so they were difficult in the beginning. Weaknesses: The book report project was unnecessarily long and I didn't really see a point to them. Also, there was no section so there was no real way for students to actively synthesize their learnings - suggestion would be to make optional discussion sections.",
    "It's hard to get that in depth analysis especially when you seek to ask a professor a question.",
    "Each lecture was very engaging, and the material itself was also very interesting. I like each of the units that was covered. I do think that the different requirements (reading responses, reports, lab credits) were kind of unorganized, but it overall provided a good overview of psychology.",
    "I enjoyed the subject and lectures were entertaining. Reading responses were not fun, but in the end were beneficial to writing so I enjoyed them.",
    "The strengths of this course were that it was very informational and enjoyable. The only weakness that I can think of was that the teaching was a bit dull at times.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, great TA and profesor, homework not overbearing Weaknesses: class curve is difficult, no practice exams for 2nd and 3rd midterm, not many words on slides so difficult to review slides solely, PSYC studies seemed random and unnecessary",
    "I did not find the lectures helpful.",
    "Easy to follow material. Deceptively more difficult than thought of",
    "Biggest weakness was definitely the powerpoints, they had no information on the slides at all and it made the class that much more difficult. If you don't pay attention every second of every class, you will be far far behind. Further, the book doesn't really cover what is discussed in the lecture in the same way it is expected from you. Point being, please put more information on the slides.",
    "I did not find the course material very interesting, partly because of a general lack of interest in the field on my part (not the course's fault) but also because I felt that it was presented in a very shallow, surface-level way that did not really build on itself and seemed like a collection of \"fun facts\" more than a coherent body of knowledge. I did really enjoy the book I read for the book review, \"Moral Tribes,\" so that was probably the highlight of the class.",
    "Strengths: experimental participation requirement Weaknesses: little emphasis on experimental methods, little emphasis on experimental design, little emphasis on reading\/understanding scientific papers, little emphasis on data collection or analysis, evaluation based on rote memorization",
    "The main issue I found with the course was the book review assignment. Not so much the assignment itself, but the basics of the paper were outlined in mid-October. Not being one to procrastinate, I started and finished by mid-November. As the deadline drew nearer, the teaching fellows kept sending more emails, adding additional requirements for the paper only a few days before it was due. In thinking I had finished the paper, I had to essentially rewrite it multiple times. It would be better if definite guidelines could be established and given when the assignment is introduced, not just a general direction when it is assigned and then more details right before the due date.",
    "The essay portion of the course was poor.",
    "It would be better if there were sections in addition to the large lecture class",
    "The class is fairly simple and easy to follow, which is a strength. However, the assigbments, such as the reading responses and the book report, seemed infantile and obnoxious rather than actually helpful.",
    "The course material was very interesting, and Dr. Holmes did a good job of splitting up the material into comprehensive segments.",
    "This course was very thorough when it came to covering all subfields of experimental psychology. If I was to suggest anything, it would just be to spend slightly more time on the clinical side.",
    "The course was a good broad introduction to a lot of topics, but we did not get very deep into any of them.",
    "Well organized.",
    "I think overall this course does not have many areas of weakness. The lectures are always interesting and the workload is not too demanding. Tests include only material that has been covered and are very fair. It is very feasible to do well in this class, but I would not say it is an easy A as some say. You need to put the work in.",
    "I found the course to be very engaging and the material fascinating. I think one area where it could be improved is maybe in terms of the exams, making the material tested more focused.",
    "I thought the class was very well structured and organized. Wouldn't really change anything.",
    "Put slides online and lots of resources to study",
    "The course was interesting in its material, but the lectures were a bit dry.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that the lectures are extremely interesting. I was not usually bored in lecture and I enjoyed how the topics varied so much and the course moved quite quickly. One of the weaknesses of this course was that we never discussed the out of class (non textbook) readings in class so it was unclear to me sometimes how they fit into our curriculum.",
    "Some of the strengths are that this course has the best professor and great lecture materials, but the TA's don't really know too much about the lecture and the review sessions aren't too particularly helpful.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, but I think that at times, the readings weren't super necessary because they often reiterated the lectures and weren't really on the tests.",
    "Stregths: 1. Very interesting topics 2. Good evaluation methods (3 exams, reading responses and 1 final paper) Weaknesses: 1. Professor could have been more engaging during lectures.",
    "I think that the course did a good job of spending time covering each major area of psychology. The only thing I felt could be improved is that length of each unit and the spacing between exams. We covered I believe about six (or more) chapters from the textbook before the first exam (this was a lot to handle) and way less material between the other exams. Another weakness was the guest speakers that were brought in. I found their lectures to be very boring and none of the speakers spoke with any excitement or emotion so I often found myself drifting off to sleep during their lectures and then missing the questions on the exams about their lectures.",
    "I thought that the subject material of this course was very interesting, and lectures were formatted in a way that it didn't get too dry. However, a lot of the readings felt unnecessary or like they didn't really align with what we were covering in lecture (and they weren't really featured on the exams, either), which made it a little difficult to slog through them.",
    "This class is a lecture so its really up to you to show up and take good notes if you want to do well on the exams and reading assignments.",
    "the lectures were pretty interesting and easy to understand. however, they did move pretty quickly. At some points, i thought that having section as well as lecture would have been helpful.",
    "I wish it tested us less on memorization and more on applying concepts. I would have liked there to be more coursework and fewer exams.",
    "This course was great.",
    "This course was very interesting. Professor Holmes did a great job with the slides and kept me interested the entire time.",
    "The course was very engaging and the subject matter was taught in a manner that made it very interesting. Although it was not necessarily a weakness, the 5 unit study requirement was not particularly helpful for the course."

   "comments": [
    "It is a requirement for most things. So I guess. But try to take it without Avram Holmes. A video on paint drying might illicit more excitement than listening to him drone on. Psych is so interesting but it only takes the right man to suck out all of the fun.",
    "It was an interesting class, but has a lot of extra assignments built in that are really just busy work. But overall it's an easy class and a good intro to the field of psychology.",
    "definitely. I think this is a great class, especially for freshmen. It is a nice transition into taking a college class. It's not too much work, but it does require that the work be done. It requires us to write a formal paper and read a research novel. I think it's essentially a great class for introducing the types of skills we will need in all of our classes but in an accessible and enjoyable way.",
    "I would say take a more in-depth psychology class that focuses on a specific topic.",
    "Yes, the course was interesting, and the workload was manageable. A good class to fill your schedule or evaluate an interest in psych.",
    "Yes, it's a good, basic introductory class that introduces you to a lot of different branches of psychology and provides a foundation.",
    "Great class. Definitely take. Very reasonable \/ low workload, interesting lectures, and a good teacher.",
    "I've explained the marvels of PSYC 110 to anyone and everyone who cared to listen. Expend demand to rise.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student. The workload and grading is very fair, and Professor Holmes made the lectures engaging and interesting.",
    "For students planning to major in Psychology, Cognitive Science, or perhaps certain social sciences, I would reccommend this course since it examines the nature of human behavior. This question is examined perhaps most in-depth in the Book Review essay near the end of the semester. For an additional precaution, it is very difficult to write 10 pages in the last 4 days of Thanksgiving Break.",
    "Loved this class. Definitely take it if you are at all interested in psychology.",
    "This is definitely a good foundation course in psychology, and gives you some detail, but also a broad overview of the field of human psychology.",
    "If taught by Avram Holmes, this course is a bore. If you take it, I do not recommend going to lecture, as I learned much more from reading the textbook. I have had friends take this course with other professors; they have an entirely different opinion about the course, so I would perhaps wait to take the course with another professor, if I were you.",
    "Ultimately, I would not recommend this course to another student. I think the material is interesting, and if you are interested in psych, definitely take the class. However, if you just want to take a course that will teach you something unique, I would not recommend this class. It was too heavily focused on memorization and regurgitation. There was never a moment where we discussed how to apply this material to our daily lives or to the real world. I think that is an essential piece of the class that was missing.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course, especially for someone interested in studying psychology later. The class itself does not go into great detail, but does provide a good overview of topics. You're guaranteed to like at least one topic out of the semester.",
    "Yes, I think all students should be required to take a psychology course, and this is a great one to begin with.",
    "This is a pretty easy course if you're willing to put the time in to study for the 3 exams. However, if at all possible I would recommend trying to take it with someone other than Holmes. His lectures are super dry and the other professors get better course reviews. Also, this course needs a major trigger warning on it, since Professor Holmes uses a bunch of unnecessary examples about sexual violence.",
    "Would recommend. Very easy if you've taken AP psych. Fair tests. Good assessment pacing. Interesting lectures.",
    "I think so -- it's a lot of interesting material, but I didn't love the way it was taught.",
    "highly recommend- most topics were super interesting and assigned reading is completely unnecessary",
    "Yeah this course is definitely worth it!! Even if you're not interested in psych, you learn so many cool things about the human psyche and the way the world works. It's pretty cool.",
    "Yeah it's all interesting stuff. Just pay attention and do the reading and you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend intro psychology. Overall, the course was interesting and very entertaining at times. It does a great job at introducing many psychological concepts to students who are interested in the field, and convincing them to major in psychology. That being said, the written assignments are vague and uninteresting, and often consist of little more than reading the text and presenting a counterargument. The topics discussed in the class are also never discussed that in-depth, since the course attempts to cover many topics in a short period of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The information and lectures are extremely interesting and informative. Lecture attendance is important to get a goo grade in the class. The grading system is also fair and its easy to do well in the class.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class if you can - you will come away with a greater understanding of human behavior and learn so many things that will be applicable to your life.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to gain a general overview of psychology! Note that lectures are not always engaging but you will appreciate what you learn.",
    "You'll look at the instructor and be like \"yo that's not Chun or Bloom\", but Avram Holmes is a sweetheart of a man and incredibly engaging and funny.",
    "TL;DR: I would recommend this course if you're a psych major or interested in knowing the basics of the subject. I'd Credit\/D it if you're the latter. There are waaay better (and more fulfilling!) psych classes to take if you're taking for a grade and a) looking for an intro psych class or 2) looking for a gut. I personally really liked Emotional Intelligence, though not as gutty as it seems. 1. THE CLASS: lecture was actually super interesting. If you're waiting for one of the legends to teach this class just stop being annoying and take it now bc they're not coming back. That being said, Prof Holmes is young, has energy, is engaging, has good content, and wasn't boring. I really liked the course material. Would be a great class if I didn't have to worry about my grade. 2. THE TFS AND EXAMS: they do review session before each exam which is nice. However, my TF graded reading responses really harshly for some reason which was really annoying. I feel like they put arbitrary stuff on the exam that is detailed and isn't concerned with whether or not you learned the material, but just that you can remember dumb details. Exams were tough, I studied a lot and attended lecture and did readings and still didn't do too hot because grading was overwhelmingly detail-oriented. In retrospect, I had no business doing the readings for the exams because if there were questions about the readings, they were so specific that I wouldn't get them anyway. 3. THE ASSIGNMENTS: you have a reading response each week. You don't have to do the reading, just do a paragraph of reading and BS the rest. the TFs have a certain formula they look for, I feel. There's an essay on a psych book we did over Thanksgiving. My book was hardly related to psych and there wasn't much talk about the essay so I didn't even know what they were looking for. SOMETHING TO NOTE: you have to do 5 credits of psych studies where you sign up online and go to usually SSS to take a survey or something. .5 credit = 30 minutes of a study. You end up having to do an expected 10 hours of studies. This isn't even for a grade so it's not a cushion, just a requirement. This was the worst part of this class. 10 hours I feel is pretty extra. I feel like it's just so the psych department doesn't have to pay their lab participants to get data...imma sip my tea tho",
    "I think everyone should absolutely take this course!! It made me want to major in psych and I would come home every day and tell my friends and suitemates about the stuff we were learning. It is a pretty standard lecture, with textbook chapters and reading responses, two midterms and a final, and a longer book review paper. It goes through main areas of psychology, and helped me see what i was interested in learning more about (I was interested in learning more about EVERYTHING). Professor Holmes often puts funny\/cute videos in the lectures (especially in the Developmental Psychology portion of the course). Take it take it take it!!!",
    "Yes- Dailey good CR\/ D",
    "I would recommend intro psych to anyone who is interested. The assignments are very low key (a few reading responses and a 10-page book review) and the class material is very interesting. Prof Holmes also uses a lot of fun videos in lecture.",
    "I really liked PSYC 110! I would definitely recommend it to students who need a social sciences credit. It's a good class if you're looking to learn about the big topics of psychology, and I thought Professor Holmes did a great job teaching it. Definitely not a stressful class as long as you go to lecture, take good notes, and prepare well for exams. But don't be like me and leave your book review to the last minute - it's more work than you think it is!",
    "Yes! Great intro class. Take it seriously, but definitely take it!",
    "Yes, take this course, Avram is great",
    "This class provides a very brief glimpse into some of psychology's many sub-disciplines. The material is interesting and it is not difficult to do well in the class, provided that you take careful and extensive notes during lecture (lecture slides are not helpful on their own). Prof. Holmes is a great; his lectures are interesting and he puts in much effort to make them as funny\/entertaining\/relevant as possible.",
    "It's a fine introduction to psychology. I wasn't super engaged in it but if psych is your thing then go for it.",
    "Yes, this course gives a strong foundation for psychological concepts and fields.",
    "I would definitely recommend to another student because Professor Holmes is an absolute gem.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to everyone. I think it is a class that everyone should take at Yale.",
    "Great course - take if you are curious about the workings of the mind and daily human phenomenon!",
    "Yes, it is a good way to develop a strong foundation in psychology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. In fact, I will miss it next semester. The class environment was very enjoyable and something I look forward to, but we also covered a broad range of material and was impressed by how much I learned in a short period of time.",
    "Of course!!! PSYC 110 was an incredibly enriching, yet not entirely difficult, class that really informed my viewpoint of the world and will help me make better decisions that can positively benefit myself and others.",
    "I think everyone at Yale should be required to take some form of psychology since it seemed both very interesting and broadly applicable to almost every domain.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students who intend to major in Psychology.",
    "Definitely take this course! The material is quite interesting, both from lecture and the readings. Even if Prof. Holmes is teaching, please give him a chance. I shopped this course last term and was so put off by him the first time that I didn't take the course but I decided to this semester and was entirely wrong about him! He does somewhat speak monotone but nothing absurdly difficult to get used to. Plus, the material is engaging enough that you'll remain invested in the lecture. He's also just an incredibly sweet and approachable person who seems genuinely passionate about helping his students -- definitely a dad figure. In terms of workload, I rarely read the textbook which made the reading responses somewhat challenging in terms of figuring out what to argue but I managed anyways. There's an art to doing them without reading that you can eventually master, otherwise, just do the readings. They are long but interesting. The exams are only a matter of memorizing information, which stems from taking detailed notes in class. The multiple choice component is fairly easy and the short answers are not too bad even if you don't always remember specifics. You just have to study each lecture beforehand (not even the readings), and you'll likely be fine. The book review was also not too bad considering half of it was simply summarizing the book. Overall a pretty easy class if you do the work when necessary, and I thoroughly enjoyed taking it. If you're deciding between this and cogsci, take this unless you're more interested in the brain and scientific\/mathematical approaches. The material does not overlap much when Prof. Holmes is teaching, and even when it did, it was to my advantage!",
    "Great intro course. Interesting material and very well taught, and surprisingly light workload!",
    "It's definitely a good introduction to psychology, as it gives a broad overview of a lot of topics within psych. If you've already taken psych classes (which I had), It's a nice review and overlook, anyway and it just means you'll have to work less hard to prepare for the exams. Professor Holmes is very personable and a great lecturer!",
    "Yes, if they're interested at all in psychology it's a must.",
    "Yes, definitely! I loved this class. I got to learn all about different areas of psychology. I was considering being a STEM major but am considering major in psychology now. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who has never taken any psychology course before but thinks that they may be interested. It is broad enough to appeal to a wide range of students with any preliminary ideas on the topic.",
    "Yes - interesting and manageable introduction to psychology, very relevant to real life",
    "I would recommend this course. Gives an overall understanding of our psychological systems. A lot of information is covered but it is not hard to keep up with, it moves at a good pace so you get the content without being overwhelmed or bored. The first test has the most content but isn't hard, and they get easier from there as each test includes less lectures than the previous one - they're all very fair and come from lectures. I really enjoyed it and think that a basic understanding of our psychological processes is something most people should take!",
    "Yes, this is a very good perspective on psychology. The course is not only structured to look at the accepted theories today, but also the debunked theories of psychology. From a pedagogical viewpoint, I think that this is really good for developing a rigorous understanding of psych.",
    "Yeah, it's not the best class ever but psych is an important subject to have at least some knowledge of so I'd recommend",
    "Yes! I love this course. I learned a lot, lecture was engaging, assignments were doable and fair, and the exams were the same way.",
    "Yes, it is good to know the basics of human psychology, especially as a humanities\/poli science major",
    "Yes. It was fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that was interested in psychology. This course provides the basic knowledge in psychology that is needed for further coursework.",
    "This is a great course to cover one the social science requirements. The topics are very interesting so you will never stay bored. I'd recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Fun class",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who loves psychology, but if you only have a vague interest in the field (as I do), it can be very boring. You don't really learn much in depth, and because it's a huge intro lecture class they have to kind of baby you a bit. Definitely a class that lets you know about the possibilities of the field rather than giving you a great new understanding of things; a lot of it feels like memorizing names for things you already knew. If you really enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of things then I would recommend taking something else.",
    "If you're a psych major or want to do pre-med, you pretty much have to take this course, whether you want to or not. However, if you're not pursuing either of those two fields, this course would still be good to take. Why not learn more about the mind and what we have yet to learn about it? The course isn't a gut; be prepared to read and study intensely for the exams that may or may not reflect the lectures at all.",
    "Definitely take this class!!! It is amazing",
    "Yes! It's a fantastic intro course that covers all topics of psychology, and then you can choose to delve into the topic that most sparked your interest.",
    "Most definitely. His course strengthened my interest in psychology.",
    "Absolutely!!! Amazing course, amazing professor, made me decide to become a psych major!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has an interest in psychology or someone who is considering it as a major.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would. The course is interesting and, compared to other pre-med requirements, has a lesser workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they were interested in psychology. It is a great way to get introduced to the subject and all around very engaging.",
    "Great intro course to psychology where you learn about many seminal studies that have shaped the way we think and act. Also pretty easy to do well if you work hard. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes. Definitely",
    "Everyone should be introduced to basic aspects of human psychology because it's so applicable in every field.",
    "I would generally recommend this course.",
    "I really enjoyed it.",
    "Yes I would but I would tell them that there is a lot of work. There are quite a few more assignments than most Yale courses between the lab hours, book review, tests, and Thursday reading responses. Students will definitely learn how to study for exams that cover a ton of material in a short amount of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I took this off a whim, and I don't regret a single second of it!",
    "Yes, I found this course to be incredibly interesting, but I also learned a lot, which is all you can ask for in a course. It wasn't incredibly hard either, but you do have to keep up to do well.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in psychology but has never taken a psychology course before since this is an introduction class. Lectures could occasionally drag on and it was often hard for me to absorb all the information since there was so much being taught in each lecture. Most of the homework is just reading parts of the textbooks and the tests solely consist of material from the textbook and the lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course, since it is an entertaining class about a subject that relates to pretty much every aspect of our lives. It is a survey course, so some of the material is surface-level, but I thought it did a really good job of introducing us to psychology as a field.",
    "I would recommend this course because I found it very interesting and the workload wasn't bad.",
    "The class is fairly average. there was a good amount of reading every week and typically a reading response. the tests were fairly difficult and mostly based on basic memorization of the readings. it was a fine survey of a lot of topics in psychology.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes! The material is so interesting and it is taught very well.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. The subject is very interesting and the class is manageable."
