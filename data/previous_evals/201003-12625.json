   "comments": [
    "If you need it, take it. If you don't, it's not overly difficult, but the subject matter is pretty dry.",
    "The subject material is interesting, however the lectures are not. The class meets twice a week, one of which is a homework problem session to do the pset...which means you don't actually have to do the homework until after the TA has already done it for you.The midterm and final were poorly organized which was frustrating. Overall this class is worthwhile, and I'm glad I took it. The work is very low except for the final research paper. I would suggest it as an engineering elective.",
    "It is a good course that will familiarize you with the ways to control air pollutants from burning fossil fuels.",
    "It's a good class. You learn about the methods of controlling several types of air pollution. You have lecture once a week and problem-solving sessions once a week before they are due. It's light work for the amount of information that you learn.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for your major",
    "As easy as a high school course, and as poorly taught. This is not why you chose Yale.",
    "You take this course for the major. It's not great, but many Yale science courses aren't great, but at least this one's pretty straight forward. The professor Khalil is nice and doesn't make exams that try to trick you, but he's a bit absent-minded.",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in air pollution or anyone who wants more in-depth knowledge of environmental quality control. Even to non environmental engineering majors."
