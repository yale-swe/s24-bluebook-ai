Class discussion was always lively and everyone felt inclined to contribute to the growing knowledge base we were building around medieval drama.",

He also often had specific questions in mind before class, which allowed us to have focused, intellectually stimulating conversations."

    "I cannot stress enough how wonderful Paul is as a professor. I would only ask for one change to the way he ran the classroom. Each student had to do a presentation on the topic of their choice. The problem is that the length of time allotted to each presentation wasn't very well-defined. Some ran for ten minutes, others twenty, and still others closer to forty. Presenting information within a specified time limit is an important skill to have, and Paul could have explained more clearly how long each presentation should last."
