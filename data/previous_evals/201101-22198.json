   "comments": [
    "Professor Roach would frequently wander off the lesson plan and go on a tangent, which encouraged the same of your attention. The most important part of this class is the studio section, so be discerning and pick the TA who's both not going to assign extra essays and is really engaged and knowledgeable about his\/her specialty. You'll bond with him\/her and with your classmates and put on a super fun show!",
    "Do not take this class unless you need it for the major. It is more of a history class than the theatre class. The only redeeming aspect of the class is the studio portion, which is quite enjoyable. It is definitely rewarding to create something original with other theatre students.",
    "You gotta take it if you want to be a theater studies major... It's a lot of material covered at too fast a pace, and not covered in depth enough. But it can be a very fun and enjoyable class if you take it upon yourself to make it one.",
    "I mean, you probably are taking this because you have to for a major but this semester is way better than the first so look forward to it!",
    "If you are even remotely interested in theater, or art, or history, or life at all, take this class! I took it as a sophomore (and a non-Theatre Studies major), and it was a refreshing and incredibly fun experience. Joe Roach is brilliant. His lectures are funny and thought-provoking, and he is one of the best and most inspiring professors I've had. This class has a \"studio\" rather than a section where you'll spend the semester collaborating on a final performance in a certain theatrical style. Take this class with the first half, THST110, but know that it stands just fine on its own. Either way, you'll have a great time.",
    "A theater survey course that goes over thousands of years of history in a single semester. The class is required for theater majors. It's sometimes way too much work. It's interesting. Sometimes, it's fun.",
    "Theater Studies 111 is a required course for the major, so you have to take it if you want to be a theater studies major. That being said, I thought it was a fantastic and definitely worthwhile class. I think it is important to understand the historical and literary dramaturgical background in order to pursue studies in the theater. This course perfectly fulfilled that role. The studio system is also awesome in putting the studies to real live practice.",
    "If you want to be a Theatre Studies major, you have to take this class for a full year, so you better learn to love it. The second semester is easier because you know how to play the games of section and reading. Some people like Dr. Roach, some don't, but I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures. He is truly a master of the art of theatre.",
    "definitely recommended",
    "Its a little dry, but the plays you read are AMAZING. Make sure you have a great studio head because that will make or break the class.",
    "GREAT CLASS! Work is pretty minimal (don't get behind on readings) although it is annoying to have a final paper and a final exams, especially if your TA assigns additional work. The professor (if it's roach) is hilarious, and I for one felt really sad on the last day of lecture. There is additional work in section, so don't look at the class syllabus and plan on not having more work. Besides being a pre-req, this is a great class to take to fill you in on theater history and acting styles. Section performances are a really fun way to see what your classmates are capable of. I was always impressed by them. Also, since they take up the last 2 or 3 classes, the end of the year is especially low-key (if your section has their stuff together).",
    "Very similar to 110. Joe Roach is awesome. Studio is a blast. If you're interested in theater, this is highly recommended.",
    "Prereq for the THST major. That is my summary.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in theatre (or anyone who is interested in learning more about theatre). Going to this class was really a highlight of my week. If you take this class, you will learn a tremendous amount, leave with a solid background in theatre history, and be ready to analyze performance in a much more nuanced way.",
    "It's great; anyone interested in theatre should take it. I preferred it to last semester.",
    "It truly is a survey. You won't love it all, but there will be some elements you do love. I'd take it if you want to be a major obviously. It's a big prereq, so take it if you want to do anything in theater in terms of academics at Yale.",
    "If you are interested in understanding the fundatmentals of theater and also interested in meeting and working with really interesting people (the sections are really intense)-- TAKE THIS CLASS. It really is amazing.",
    "Yes take it if you are interested even if you don't want to major in theater studies. It's a great way to read amazing plays and learn about theater theory\/history.",
    "Yes, take this class. Interesting way to get a grasp on the history of the theatre.",
    "A brief, interesting survey of Theater History from the Greeks to today. You read a lot of good plays and get to perform. It's a good experience.",
    "Take it, but only if you want to be a theater major. Otherwise, you won't think it's worth it.",
    "A very interesting class. Professor roach has a tendency to go on tangents, and the students are always inevitably unprepared for his tests. However, his lectures can be quite gripping, and the class gave me a new found appreciation for theatre. Overall, the class is not a lot of work and it can be very fun. Just be prepared for some stresful studying periods.",
    "Yes; after the two semesters of 110 and 111 I truly have a solid grasp of theatre history. It's just important stuff to know if you want to go into the field, simple as that."
