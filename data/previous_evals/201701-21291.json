    "Learnt a lot of advanced vocab, interesting stuff about chinese culture and modern social and political issues",
    "I have a firmer grasp of the Chinese language certainly, but more than that this class was fantastic at delving into the culture of China and Taiwan."

    "Fabulous teacher! One of the best instructors I have had at Yale. Lots of daily work but worth it.",

    "The greatest weakness of this course is the textbook - it really is rather boring. Maybe using other media sources or switching textbooks might help.",
    "Zhou laoshi is engaging, wonderful and understanding. He makes the class fun and interesting. the weekly quizzes are great to learn new vocabulary and keep up with the text. I liked the oral presentation because it made you really think about words you learned in class and how to express them fluently. the essays were important in solidifying new sentence patterns and vocab.",
    "You learn a lot of vocab and interesting stuff about china The very structured syllabus gets a bit tedious",
    "This was an excellent course that allows you to get out as much as you put in. At times I wish that we had more discussion time."

    "Yes, it's good and you probably need it to keep going with chinese",
    "Zhou Laoshi is fantastic and is highly motivated to help the individual student succeed. He understands well the level of the students and the class and helps everyone to improve based on where they are. I would certainly recommend this course! He is always available to help."
