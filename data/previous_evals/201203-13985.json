    "Question 1 - I thought the book was not a great text for the course.Question 2 - Need to think of a better way to integrate case studies with classes.",
    "While the conceptual materials presented in the first few weeks (biases, etc.) were useful, little material in the course was relevant for making environmental public policy decisions for others.This course is needed, although I believe it needs to be framed differently to better align with F&ES students. If not, the course needs to be advertised with a caveat that it is about decision making through the lens of contemporary economics, with few other implications considered.",
    "This course has potential but needs serious tweaking before it is a worthwhile endeavor for students. One text is insufficient for explaining the concepts taught in the course, especially if students have no prior experience with decision making as it is taught in the text and by the instructor. The material was presented parochially and often without context. The supplemental readings were self-serving and irrelevant to the untrained eye.",

   "comments": [
    "The text book and how the case studies are integrated. Perhaps working communally or in groups of 2 or 3 on a case study would be better? Making a weekly assignment (a short one) that counts toward the grade? Not sure the best way to change it, but I think it needs changing.",
    "The theoretical and practical work related to the course could easily be grounds to transform the course in a two units course. This could allow for a more robust student workload to match the content and discussions. As a one unit course I felt there were some constraints on the actual extent required for the assignments.I would suggest to have a more structured syllabus. Perhaps taking into account practical examples and case studies as part of the syllabus would clarify the link to \"environmental decisions\". It's true the student projects helped on building that link. I feel the course would profit greatly from the addition of selected case studies to the reading material. In this case, the Gilboa book could be required reading for the first half and then, the class discussions could evolve around the selected case studies.If it's not possible to transform this course into a two unit course, I would suggest to transform it into a PSC.",
    "TA, more than one text book, papers, and more small assignments to engage students",
    "Reading materials: The textbook was severely limited in providing insight when considering environmental decisions!Many contemporary works on environmental governance coupled with current thinking in behavioral economics and social psychology would better serve the course's goals.",
    "Refine the workload. It's a ridiculous amount of work for a one-credit course.",
    "There was a consensus among the students that the course was narrow in scope. This is not necessarily a criticism, since the course followed the text very closely, however during the course, I felt that there wasn't enough space to create a framework for criticism of the concepts. The class uses neoclassical economic models and applies them to environmental decision making. The course could be improved by allowing time to discuss the concepts critically. Many in the class felt that issues such as: utility optimization, pareto optimality, and the normative biases of neoclassical economics merited a critical discussion in terms of their usefulness in practical decision making."
