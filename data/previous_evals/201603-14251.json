   "comments": [
    "I learned the Eric Braverman approach to making ethical decisions, including a specific framework and tools. Mostly I just learned how to fit concepts I already knew and understood into the instructor's framework.",
    "I learned about what goes into decision making in high-stress, ambiguous, sometimes life-or-death situations that have no easy ethical resolutions. We developed frameworks involving biases, rules of engagement, sources of obligations, constituencies, cures, and remedies. Readings were engaging and Eric encouraged thoughtful analysis and discussion of topics.",
    "Taking this course allowed me to think and reflect about some of the most difficult ethical choices that leaders have to make. I certainly did not think about this issues from the perspective of leaders before taking this course.",
    "1. Frameworks to think through ethical (particularly ethically nuanced) decisions 2. The assumptions I\/others make about other's in terms of values, priorities, motivations, ethics, etc. 3. A more realistic idea of the scenarios public leaders face 4. How to communicate my rationale to others",
    "This course helped me to develop concrete, easily recalled structures for approaching an ethical decision in a way that helps organize my principles, biases, and obligations to make choices that are most in line with what I believe is right.",
    "Very good course, learned a framework for thinking about ethical decisions.",
    "We developed several frameworks to evaluate complex ethical decisions. While the students often made different decisions given the same information, each student (including myself!) had a better sense of where our moral boundaries lie and how that affected our decision-making during simulations.",
    "Framework for decision making. Personal values. Current events.",
    "Very good analytical course. More about framing decisions than about content but a very necessary skill.",
    "Good methodical way to evaluate ethical decisions.",
    "This course provided a framework for self-reflection and consideration of various ethical approaches to decision-making. The readings were interesting and enabled me to think about current events through the eyes of decision makers and consider their ethical dilemmas as they made these choices. Class was an opportunity to hear from a diverse set of students about how they weigh various factors in their decision making.",
    "More than anything else, this course taught me how to think logically and analytically about ethical decision-making, which in turn gave me a new tool with which to check my gut impulses and emotional reactions. This course also gave me insight into the personal values and ideological principles that shape my worldview. In short, it gave me a better sense of self.",
    "The primary knowledge and insight gained for me derived from learning about how my classmates in the seminar approached and thought about the ethical questions raised via the in-class simulations. Seeing the differences in their approach to these common situations was very interesting for me, particularly given how much divergence there was at times in how we considered different ethical issues. In terms of skills, I think the primary gain was being able to more clearly articulate some of the frameworks I implicitly apply when evaluating ethical choices. These skills are a bit subtler to measure than those in say, a quantitative or science-based course, so it's somewhat difficult to discern how much I have learned in this way until I have more of a chance to apply these skills beyond Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The format of the class was appreciated--simulations are probably the best way to go when teaching ethics. Many of the simulations, however, felt cookie-cutter (they all felt like episodes of the kids' show Scooby-Doo, because it is obvious how they will all end). The student-run simulations brought some much-needed variety to the instructor-led simulations, so there was some good balance. One of the things that I was really hoping to get out of the class was to get to know the other students and the instructor well. But the instructor held very few in person office hours, and over-the-phone office hours just felt weird. They were so limited in nature that most people assumed they were reserved for whichever group had to present the next class period. And because of the odd schedule for the class, we didn't see our classmates for half the semester, and in that way it felt like we really lost a lot of potential cohort building. I had also heard that last year this course was 1\/3 SOM students, 1\/3 Law students, and 1\/3 Jackson students, and I was hoping for a similar mix to get to know students from outside my program, but the majority were SOM students this year and that was a disappointment. Also because of the odd schedule, there were other classes that I wanted to take that I had to pass up on, even though there were only a few conflicts during the semester. Since I didn't really get the cohort building experience that I was hoping for, I'm not sure this class was really worth it. Another disappointment was the complete lack of feedback. Discussions helped us form our own opinions, but the only time that you get feedback on your application of course concepts is during the final exam, and that seems like a shame. Ethics is something you want more feedback on throughout the course.",
    "Strengths: Most of the readings, esp the articles, were engaging. The best part of the class is listening and exchanging views with fellow classmates - since there is an application to get into the class, the intellectual caliber of the average student in the class is quite high. Weaknesses: Some discussions meandered or got off topic. Also it's set up so that the most outspoken people air their views the most - I would have liked to hear the opinions of others.",
    "Strengths: 1) The discussions that we had as part of this course were very interesting and engaging; 2) The group of students selected for the course was diverse, and hence students were able to provide very different perspectives; 3) The readings for the course were very interesting. Weaknesses: 1) At times the course felt slightly unstructured. At the same time, I do not think it is possible to teach this course in a strictly structured way.",
    "Weakness: There was little direct feedback given to us, so it was difficult to gauge whether or not we were 'on the right track'. Strengths: Professor Braverman - is the perfect teacher for this type of class. Really appreciated the size of the class, the level of engagement from students and professor, the topics, the simulations were excellent",
    "The framework that is offered in the course is excellent, and the conversations in this class have been many of the most valuable I have had in Yale classrooms. One way the course might be improved is short, occasional writing. A paragraph or two on an ethical decision or concept in that week's reading may enhance student engagement with the same, inform deeper class discussions, and lead to more robust memory.",
    "Would be interesting to see quantitative decision making criteria, as course was fully qualitative",
    "This class was wonderful one of my favorites thus far at Yale. Strengths include: quality of instruction by Eric, classroom discussion, pre-class reading and our always engaging simulations. I thought the fewer but longer classes worked well for our Socratic discussions. There are no weaknesses I would mention, except to say that I would have taken up the opportunity for even more class sessions.",
    "This course is phenomenal. It is challenging and forces students to think well beyond the normal courses at Yale, helping them to develop a framework for decision making. What I learned here will help me for years to come.",
    "Strengths: very thoughtful instruction Weaknesses: Instructor availability",
    "Great seminar style that left much room for discussion. Often wished there was more of a lecture component or time for the instructor to speak, although the seminar-style discussion for students to speak back and forth is helpful. Also sidenote: felt that the (hyper) focus on \"terrorism\" was often charged and reinforced generalizing tropes of marginalized groups without the appropriate critical unpacking.",
    "I liked the readings and simulations. I think the course could be improved through more small group discussion and sharing. The few times I had an opportunity to speak with 2-3 other students, we got much deeper than we could get in the full group discussion. I might also add a peer evaluation component for the simulation groups; I had a difficult time working with my team and the chance to provide feedback in a structured way would have been helpful.",
    "I loved the simulations and the fact that we split them up with engaging conversations and discussions. I also thought that the syllabus was great; all of the readings were very interesting! The main weakness - and I know this isn't totally fair given Eric's schedule and other commitments - was the meeting cadence. I found it difficult to get into a grove when we were taking weeks off between sessions. This also made it challenging to get to know other students; there's a familiarity that comes with meeting every week.",
    "The key strengths are the small, discussion-style format, the simulations and the extended session times (3-4 hours each), which allows for deeper discussions and engagement with the simulations. Moreover, the course benefits from being different in terms of style and format from most other Yale courses. In terms of areas for improvement, I think the long intervals between class meetings (sometimes a month) might disrupt some of the rhythm\/momentum in discussions between classes (although I don't know whether this is outweighed by the benefits of extended session times). I wonder to what degree there could be clearer connections between the class sessions, such that the simulations feel more cumulative rather than discrete."

   "comments": [
    "Probably not. It was a good course, but it didn't seem that rigorous. I'm not sure I really learned anything new, I just learned labels to attach to concepts I already understood. And since you don't have a lot of opportunity to get to know the instructor or your classmates, and you don't get much feedback, it just seems like you could spend your time better elsewhere (especially given that attendance is mandatory and the class schedule is so odd, and pretty much everyone has to sacrifice something important to take the class). It wasn't a bad course, it just wasn't the best. And the instructor on the last day of class seemed to indicate that one of his goals for the class was for the students to get to know each other well. Though I am friendly with the other students, we are not friends, and because of the irregular class meetings and the heavy SOM student ratio, it seemed unlikely that this would happen without the instructor trying to facilitate it.",
    "I highly recommend the course - it will get you thinking about how to develop a framework for evaluating difficult choices that works best for you. The non-traditional nature of the course also highly appealed to me. There were 18 people in the class, you're split into groups and each class a group prepares a simulation on a given theme - there is no homework (besides the reading, which is very manageable) and there is a straightforward final exam: you're given a hypothetical ethical dilemma (usually based on an actual situation - for us it was the Syrian crisis) and 3 hours to write out your analysis and justification of your decision.",
    "Yes- it has actually changed how I approach difficult decisions in life.",
    "By taking this course, you would be able to face some of the most difficult ethical choices that leaders have to make. We do not tend to think about these things in normal circumstances, but leaders must be prepared to make difficult choices when unexpected things happen.",
    "Yes!",
    "I absolutely would. No matter the field, we all need to take as much care to develop approaches for the ethics of our decisions that are as well-considered and structured as we do for the functional effectiveness or efficiency of our decisions.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student as one of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. Exceptional course. Eric challenges students to think dynamically and helps you develop a process for making tough ethical decisions for situations when there is no \"right answer\".",
    "Absolutely. Course was unlocked a new analytical skill and frame for interpreting the world that I had never study.",
    "Yes! He is a great professor.",
    "Absolutely. Unique experiential learning opportunity.",
    "Absolutely. Simply put, no other course in grad school has taught me so much about myself and how I view the world. This course will give any student a tremendous new framework with which to approach ethical choices, while simultaneously creating space for self-reflection and introspection. Learning through simulations is also a lot of fun and very effective; I wish more courses used this model!",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, but I think it would be important to highlight that this is a very different course than many others they may take at Yale. The focus is on classroom discussion and engaging with simulations, and thinking holistically about ethical, moral, and philosophical frameworks as opposed to gleaning more discrete areas of knowledge. I found this to be an excellent complement to my courses for the semester, but I think a more open mindset is necessary in order to fully engage with this course in particular."
