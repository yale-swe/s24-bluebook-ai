   "comments": [
    "This class is pretty boring. I would not take it unless you want something easy with not terrible amounts of work, but going to lecture is kind of unnecessary.",
    "I would recommend this to people looking for the somewhat dry, but necessary, foundation in migration policy and law. It isn't too much work and the lectures are pretty enjoyable, but it won't blow your socks off.",
    "Yes, if just for the readings. If you research and read about issues of borders, asylum, conflict, etc etc on your own, then don't take the lecture. If these subjects interest you and the only way you'd learn is through a syllabus, then take it. You're informing yourself, above all things.",
    "ERM 317 is a great class if you're interested in migration or political science. The class is very American \/ Euro centric with brief looks at Africa and Asia. The class walks you through why people migrate, the effects on sending and receiving states economically (micro and macro), politically, and socially, as well as current refugee \/ asylum regime. I would recommend it if you're interested in the topic. The class does require some understanding of economics but I've never taken any econ classes and excelled in the class. Prof. Peters and the TF's did a great job teaching the material even though Prof. Peters can be a bit of a dull lecturer (she posted her slides online before class and didn't lecture much beyond what was on her slides). Assigned reading of about 100 pages per lecture. Worthwhile and enjoyable and not too difficult to do well in.",
    "It was an interesting class into the issue related with migration.",
    "I had really high hopes for this class. The subject matter is very interesting and topical to today's world. However, the class was pretty dull. It was more a survey course of general theories instead of really engaging with current events. It was a pretty straightforward class and the grading was fine. I just didn't think it was particularly interesting. Also, the group project at the end was not fun to do, and I don't think people really got much out of it. Overall, I would not recommend it, even though migration interests me so much.",
    "Only if the student is very interested about migration patterns should he or she take this course.",
    "It is a great class if you are very interested in policy. It is a typical polisci class (not very critical about the racial reasoning of this policy). It does help you have a good polisci background to understanding the mechanisms in immigration policy, but it is not very engaging.",
    "This class will cover a broad range of migration issues. If you're a political science major, or interested in race\/border control\/immigrant populations, this class will definitely be useful. The lectures are pretty straightforward and the tests are fair. That being said, there are a lot of readings you need to do (and you'll be tested on), and sometimes it's a little confusing trying to understand what to take from the class besides memorizing theories. Much more economics focused that I thought it would be, but overall a good class.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning more about the specifics of global migration (which you should be - it's a fascinating topic and i didn't even realize how much there was to it before taking this course). Keep in mind, though, that the class is very US-centric and focuses mainly on the political economy of migration, so lots of stats and game theory. The paper is a group project for which you're assigned a topic to research using an EU database, which not the best experience. But since this was Prof Peter'sfirst time teaching the class, that may change.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 124 as a basic survey course, which is the usual lecture and section combination. Beware that there is a group project involved, and I would recommend you check out any other courses on migration as well, if there are any.",
    "Politics of Migration was a pretty good class. Professor Peters did a very good job with covering a lot of material about a very complicated topic. Her lectures went along with the Powerpoints almost perfectly, which made it easy to catch up if you had to miss class.Often, because the lectures followed the Powerpoints so closely, they were a little dry and not exactly the most exciting of all, but overall the class was enjoyable because of the material.",
    "I would recommend this class as a lecture that has a significant amount of work to do well but that is definitely manageable. It is not just an easy lecture so it does require some commitment but it's possible to do well if you invest a reasonable amount of time and energy.",
    "Good survey class on the issue of migration from the point of view of sending and receiving states. It is definitely an important issue to know about in our current world. While I thought it would make it easier to figure out where I stand on the issue, knowing more about how complicated things are actually made it harder to know how I feel about the problem, which is probably a good thing. Professor Peters is a good lecturer and makes sure to bring in a lot of different resources and arguments. Anyone who's interested in this topic at all should definitely consider the class",
    "Politics of Migration is a new course, and is considered to be in both the Political Science and ER&M departments. It covers everything from socioeconomic theory to world history to modern day policy.Although this class did feel very brave and ambitious to tackle and merge both worlds, it ultimately suffered from a very clear divide in the material, reflected in both its syllabus and assignments.Politics of Migration felt very experimental.It felt like it did not know what it wanted to be.Did it want to be a History class?A Polisci class?An Economics class?Did it want to be very contemporary, to focus on the here and now and how we can concretely apply theory towards the future?Or did it want to review the history of migration and how various theories evolved?In an attempt to appeal to both PoliSci majors and ER&M majors, the syllabus felt sort of all over the place, both chronologically, and conceptually. The vibes of studying history and theory, and then transitioning into policy and economics felt very roughly put together, and did not feel like a cohesive syllabus.An example of this was where the syllabus would focus on Economics briefly, and then jump to International Relations theory. The syllabus and course material were very scattered and would sporadically emphasize or assume knowledge of either Economics or International Relations Theory, and then proceed to deemphasize those same concepts in attempt to remedy confusion.Class assignments were not well established, and disproportionally representative of grades (Only 1 group paper, and then the midterm and final).Instructions and directions on how to incorporate class material into these projects were almost always unhelpful and not uniform between the different sections.Overall, this class constantly felt like it was making things up as it went along.The material was spread out across different, vaguely related terms and theories.Every once in a while it would dive very in-depth into certain case studies or fringe theories, but this almost always felt like an overcompensation for the fact that things sort of fell together as the semester went along.Although it had good intentions, the result was a class whose sense of direction was always unclear, and whose enthusiasm to engage with its students ultimately suffered from a lack of focus.",
    "Yes! If you want to know more about migration and the way a lot of society are built by migrants!"
