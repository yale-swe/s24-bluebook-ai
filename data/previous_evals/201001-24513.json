    "Definitely not. It does not promote any sort of educational advancement and instead made me dread Wednesday afternoons where I had to sit in a small 2 hour lecture.",
    "A great seminar - provides a solid and all-round perspective on American Financial crises. Broad but not superficial. Allows for creativity in selecting topic(s) for your papers, and testing your own hypotheses or testing the robustness of previously observed results.",
    "i really enjoyed the course. there wasn't a lot of discussion as it was more like a smaller lecture, but the topics were extremely interesting (if you like financial crises) and the reading was always complimentary to the lectures. it was great looking at economics from a historical perspective (or history from an economics perspective) and the final paper was actually rewarding for me since it was the first time i've written an economics paper with results that actually supported my hypothesis. i would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Probably not. I think there are better, more engaging econ seminars to take.",
    "no, won't learn anything, or interact with material"
