   "comments": [
    "If you have a background in math proofs or like rigorous math, this isn't a bad course. Otherwise, this will feel like most annoying abuse of notation ever; for the latter category, 222 is much more appropriate. Lectures are unnecessary since Garland just rephrases the text for most of the time (except for more computation aspects, since the text is very theoretical). Be warned though. There is no syllabus and homework is posted on the board for about 20 minutes.",
    "Don't take it unless you have taken a proof-based math course already, otherwise you will be totally lost. There's a lot of overlap with abstract algebra, and almost all of the problems are proofs. The course is poorly taught and the curve is terrible, so it is really hard to get a good grade. The only plus side is that if you know how to do proofs, you can sort of coast in between tests, because the work is very easy. Definitely take 222 if you have the chance.",
    "Don't do it unless you have a very, very pressing reason. If you have any other option (math 222, phys 301, whatever) go with that. I took this course because 222 was at the same time as CS 201, and I'd say it was worth it but only because CS 201 is one of the best classes at Yale. Unless you have something like that, though, just don't do it. You will hate this course.If you do take it, make sure to make time to teah yourself linear algebra on your own time, probably with a different textbook (I recommend Strang). And don't think that because you can do the homework you'll know anything on the exams.",
    "Difficult, intense,sometimes frustrating, but in the end, rewarding (if you don't fail the class) because proofs and linear algebra\/matrix theory are fundamental for further studies in math.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course for another student unless he was ABSOLUTELY committed to becoming a math major and ABSOLUTELY had to take the course for the major.",
    "This class is terrible. If you're a hard math person, take 230. If you're not, take 222 or forget about linear algebra. The lectures are basically unintelligible and everyone gets lost, and the professor isn't usual clear when explaining things. Thus, it is unpleasant to be in class. Oh, and my year it was curved to a B- even though the class was only like 10 people. A lot of people get 0s on questions on tests (4-question tests) because no partial credit is given if you attempt a proof in a way other than the way the professor does.",
    "I would recommend Math 225. It is an advanced and challenging class and it is very helpful to build a solid foundation in linear algebra. It is important to have a previous introductory course in algebra. The course is taught at a good advanced level. The professor and the assistant were very good. Test grading was rigorous and sometimes hard to understand. Overall an excellent course.",
    "It is a very theory based course with many proofs."
