   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -fair grading -low workload -differences in work (some essays, some tests, good mix) -passionate professor who tries to get to know all her students Weaknesses: -Fairly basic Spanish, didn't feel like I really improved my Spanish -class was sort of just reading the readings that were assigned as homework",
    "This class covered a lot of interesting material, but involved a great deal of reading. The class periods were spent reviewing the readings, which made it seem like actually doing the reading was unnecessary. Having smaller quizzes throughout the term for either a small percentage of the grade or extra credit could help ameliorate this.",
    "The class could have been a little more engaging, but that being said I enjoyed its routine. I think one of the biggest strengths of the class was the teaching - Professor Adorno was consistently engaged and truly cared about her students and teaching.",
    "I think that some of the material was really interesting. However, the format of the course was the same every single day - there would always be slides on the board that the students would read and then we would answer questions. This made the class really boring at times, and I wish the format was changed sometimes.",
    "The course is not too hard, so it's really put in what you want to get out. You can participate a lot or a little in class and professor Adorno is extremely welcoming and friendly. When you make a mistake she will correct you, but in a way that doesn't make you feel deterred from learning Spanish which is so important in languages. That being said it isn't hard to slack a little in the course.",
    "Strengths: Mostly taught in Spanish which allowed for immersion, students often had to the opportunity to speak which is important for improving your Spanish, exams and papers were challenging without being overwhelming. Weakness: It was at 9am",
    "I thought the readings were very encompassing and useful. Rolena puts together a great selection of literature that gives you a good overall view on Latin American culture. However, I felt that the PowerPoints and lectures could have been more engaging.",
    "I feel that the class was actually too easy to learn much. There wasn't much reading so we got a pretty limited introduction to Latin American culture. Also, there was a wide variety of Spanish-speaking ability in the class and we spent class literally reading out loud the important passages from the reading, so we had like two actual interesting discussions the whole semester.",
    "Strengths: Profesora Adorno, the course content, course structure Weaknesses: none",
    "great discussions in the classroom but only read male authors.",
    "The slideshow presentations covered the main points of the reading and helped create points for class discussion which helped clarify any doubts from the readings. Furthermore, the professor's discourses went beyond the reading and helped apply to aspects of Latin American cultures in general. No suggestions for improvement.",
    "Strengths: A good introduction into the cultures of Latin America, good readings from a variety of places and authors, touch on many aspects of culture as well as developing our own definition of culture. Weaknesses: The class has a foundation on generalizations (i.e. during the Caribbean unit we only talked about specifically Cuba and I don't think other islands were mentioned at all) which is to be expected as an introductory course but just be aware that this is the case. Not all of Latin America is covered, I imagine Brazil is vastly different but we didn't even mention it in class.",
    "Strengths: The stuff we read is awesome Prof. Adorno is an expert in the area and has clearly thought deeply about how the overall picture of this class fits together We are basically forced to practice speaking by reading aloud Great feedback on essays Tests\/essays are fair Weaknesses: Class can sometimes feel like its moving a little slowly which makes it easier to become less interested in exactly what is going on. People aren't super engaged in class which is the way it is, but Prof. Adorno interacts with us so much that this lack of engagement slows the entire class down.",
    "It was very strong in many respects. I think the only weakness was that it got very hard to really understand the readings by yourself but in class, she did a great job of fixing that.",
    "The diverse reading material and variety of assignments was a strength. However, the reading material could have expanded into a wider range to explore further ideas of fiction, particularly if it had explored more poetry.",
    "Professor Adorno is fantastic and she runs the class very well. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Expectations are clear from the start, and she is a very generous teacher. She expects your attendance and participation in class, but little work is required outside of class. She tells you what readings will be discussed each day, and posts the lecture slides for class ahead of time so students can review them and be prepared for discussion. The midterm exams are extremely fair and reflect exactly what is discussed in class, what is on the lecture slides, and the content given to students in Professor Adorno's comprehensive exam review packets. Great class -- I can't think of any improvements. The content is also very engaging",
    "Strengths - the size is a small lecture\/large seminar format. Students can still participate, and Prof Adorno makes it very interactive, but it's not quite as involved as taking a seminar. The material is really interesting and moves at a great pace. no weaknesses I loved the class!",
    "Strengths: Profesora Adorno is phenomenal. Her lectures are so elucidating and eloquent, and you come out of each one feeling so much more aware of the significance of culture. The essay prompts are also very open and flexible, which is great for crafting a work that you are interested in writing. Weaknesses: More of a leminar -- not nearly as much speaking or conversation as I expected. Since Adorno summarizes the texts in class, many people eventually stopped doing the readings.",
    "This course's strengths lie in the subject content and the professor's teaching methods. The professor chose interesting readings that were rich in cultural and historical experience. These readings were perfectly organized to introduce students to the subject content in a compelling way that facilitated class discussion. She was very receptive to participation and invested in helping students better their Spanish through allowing many class reading and writing opportunities.",
    "The course was engaging, and the readings were carefully selected. There were times when the material felt redundant, though.",
    "Strengths: The Professors enthusiasm and aid (flexible and intensive office hours) when writing our papers greatly improved my understanding of how to write an academic paper."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if your Spanish isn't all that it could be. The level of Spanish required for this class is less than that required of other L5 courses. It is a good class with a kind professor, but if you're serious about improving your Spanish maybe look at a different course.",
    "Absolutely! The class was fun and informative, and a good introduction to advanced Spanish classes.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this class and the material. I thought it was well structured and a great option for L5 language.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in taking an easy and interesting Spanish course, I would definitely recommend this one. There is no cap on the number of students, and this course is really great in that we are not actively learning about Spanish but rather Spanish cultures, thinkers, archaeologists, etc.",
    "Yes, if you want a more laid-back introduction to the cultures of Latin America. The readings are engaging and so if you want you can dedicate a lot to this class, but it's really not necessary. Professor Adorno is extremely welcoming and helpful. She will correct you when you make mistakes, but in a way such that you don't feel deterred from learning Spanish.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course because it is an excellent opportunity to improve your Spanish while learning about Latin American culture in a supportive setting.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student. The workload is VERY manageable and the tests are not difficult as long as you show up to class and do the readings. The essays are fun to write and Rolena provides lovely feedback. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to take an L5 Spanish class but doesn't want to drown in work, or to advanced Spanish speakers who aren't quite fluent and want an environment where they can participate as much as they need without fear of judgement.",
    "Yes, Rolena is amazing and she will help students learn a lot about culture.",
    "This class will provide a really easy L5 if you want to get your language requirement done. If you want to learn, I think you could pretty engaged in the class, but hardly anyone is.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Profesora Adorno is great and the content of this course is fascinating.",
    "Yes, I found it interesting and helped me improve my spanish.",
    "Yes. The workload was very manageable, not at all excessive. Though I initially signed up for the class to fulfill my language requirement I found myself developing a sincere appreciation for the cultures studied. The professors knowledge made the class atmosphere intellectual, enjoyable, and engaging, which made it easy to carry out assignments because I had a great understanding of what was being taught.",
    "Yes, it's a great introduction into the cultures of Latin America",
    "Yes. This class is what you make of it. Prof. Adorno is able to discuss these texts and ideas at as high a level as anyone could want, but the actual level of work required to do fine in the class is quite low. This isn't ideal, however it is still worth it to take this class so you get to practice Spanish in a pretty low-stakes place while also getting to read and learn about a cool piece of world culture (which I was largely ignorant of).",
    "Yes definitely it was very interesting to learn about the several cultures.",
    "Yeah, it had interesting ideas.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It requires a low level of engagement outside of class, though you are expected to attend class and participate occasionally. Professor Adorno is fantastic, and her passion for the material and teaching makes the class even more engaging. She is a very fair grader, and the two midterms are easy and reflect the review packets she gives almost exactly. The writing assignments are very open ended and not bad at all. Professor Adorno is generous all around, and gives clear and helpful feedback on every assignment for students. The material is also interesting and I enjoyed learning about different countries' cultures, myths, writers, etc. You can get away without doing the readings, but it'll definitely help your Spanish to do them.",
    "Yes. It provides a good introduction to the cultures in an important region of the world, and teaches you other knowledge important to the study of cultures, societies, and peoples in general.",
    "Yes!! Prof Adorno is an incredibly knowledgable and interesting lecturer and your Spanish will improve!",
    "Yes, Profesora Adorno is an excellent teacher. She cares so much about the content of the class and her students, and this class was worth taking even if just for her alone.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It is an excellent course for practicing essential Spanish skills and a wonderful opportunity to lean about Latin American cultures in a very dynamic manner.",
    "Professor Adorno is why people apply to Yale. She is extremely qualified and knowledgeable in her field and chooses to teach undergraduates. The class is very interesting and a great way to get your L5.",
    "Yes, the texts were stimulating and the professor is knowledgable and always willing to help."
