    "Greater understanding of French language",
    "I learned so much in this class. Professor Delaitre is an incredible teacher. Her teaching style is clear, she is extremely organized, and she really wants to help you learn. She is strict but in the sense that she really cares about you. She is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. Please take this class with her!",
    "Better learning and understanding French",
    "I gained an understanding of French and i believe I can have a proper conversation in French.",
    "This course is great! I definitely developed my french speaking abilities during this course.",
    "I advanced my French language learning by a lot in this course. Before I took the course, my French knowledge was scarce following FREN110, but Carole quickly whipped me into shape with her structured and efficient way of teaching.",
    "I further developed my French speaking, reading, and writing abilities.",
    "I learned more french in two semesters at Yale than I learned in seven years of high school and middle school spanish",
    "I learned more about verb tenses, grammer and vocabulary in general.",
    "French!"

   "comments": [
    "I have a strong issue with the movie we had to watch that contained sexist and racist scenes. I also have an issue with the French in Action videos, which I think do not provide information in the best structure.",
    "Literally one of my favorite classes. I don't have anything bad about this class except that if you want an A you really have to work hard for it -- I spent at least 10-15 hours a week on homework and reviewing for weekly quizzes. Another thing has nothing to do with the course, but the textbook we use was made in the 80's and has some racist\/sexist things. If you can get past that, this course and especially this professor is amazing.",
    "It was very fast paced, which is a strength and also a weakness",
    "The Tuesday video sessions are not helpful. It should be changed. The monday evening tests are not the best way to start a week. i didn't enjoy them",
    "This course is very interactive and the classes are very small. The French in Action Lesson plan is a little outdated, but the professors make up for it!",
    "Strengths of this course include its great structure for learning. Carole's Powerpoints and daily exercises were always enough to get an A in this course. A very minimal weakness of this course is that there is a lack of french submersion, as Carole will from time to time switch to English to describe something.",
    "Strengths - very structured, in-depth coverage of material. Weaknesses - textbook\/videos are very outdated, which means that some of the vocab we learn is dated, as well.",
    "This course is pretty intensive and asked a lot, with the workbook and the weekly videos and tests, but it also rapidly improved my French skills. I went through both L1 and L2 and I know feel that I could get by in a French speaking country, something I never thought I'd be able to do. This course is a lot of work, but if you put in the effort it can be very rewarding.",
    "It is effective in reaching french but the material is outdated (the videos we watch were made in the 80s) and can be very sexist. Also, it is extremely hard to get an A in this class.",
    "Strength includes the emphasis on grammar, teaching style, very interavtive and engaging weakness: the program is outdated, old and just plain sexist, racist. There's little to no emphasis on the culture of France and the people and I found that to be quite frustrating. The french culture and people are so diverse and this course, the program of the teachers do not do any justice to the people in francophone countries. I do not care about Mirelle and Robert and Hubert and their love affairs, I care about the Senegalese people who speak french or I care about the french culture in Morrocco.",
    "One most annoying thing about this class is that all the materials are scattered everywhere, which make it very hard to review in the end. There are excercises in the course packet, single page hand outs and stuff. also need to carry the textbook on a daily basis even though we don't use it that much. Hope materials could be more organized.",
    "I think that this method of teaching French (and a foreign language in general) is extremely effective. I believe that I learned more than my friends in other introductory language courses, and I enjoyed the French introductory sequence immensely. However, I feel there are some ways that this course could be improved. First of all, there is a discrepancy between effort and results. I feel like each section\/\/professor is radically different, and each section\/\/professor focuses on different aspects of the language. Therefore, I felt like I could put in a lot of effort and studying one week, but I would end up doing poorly on the test because my professors' focus was different from the majority of material on the test. During other weeks when I wouldn't try so hard, the tests would seem easy while my friends in other sections believed that these specific tests were the hardest. Also, I think that the French in Action videos are outdated and need to be remade. A lot of the material is objectionable and offensive (however, I liked the method overall)."

    "Yes, the French department does a good job preparing students to speak French",
    "I would! You really gain a strong foundation in French, and the class is well taught in organized. I think I've stressed this enough, but I took my first semester with another professor, and by comparison Professor Delaitre is MUCH better and cared more. I had more fun, learned more, and got better grades.",
    "It's tough, but if you enjoy french, it's worthwhile.",
    "Yes, absolutely take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning French. The department is very strong, and the class is a lot of work. However, you will learn a lot by the time you are done!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student if they are interested in advancing their French learning. The course provides enough knowledge for a student to watch a French movie comfortably.",
    "I would, but only if that student was seriously interested in pursuing French.",
    "If you are set on learning french then yes. It you just want to fulfill the language requirement, absolutely not",
    "yes, take it if you want to learn french the language but not the culture. There's little to no emphasis on the culture of France and the people and I found that to be quite frustrating. The french culture and people are so diverse and this course, the program of the teachers do not do any justice to the people in francophone countries. Workload is sometimes a lot so plan ahead and take easier courses if you plan to take french",
    "Yes. French is very well taught! Course systems is old but you get the basic grammar structure etc"
