    "This was my first experience taking a Kant course in the setting of a divinity school. I must say it was refreshing. You don't get as bogged down in debates about noumena and phenomena, and instead get a chance to dig deeper into other parts of the texts.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. It demands your full presence and dedication. If you are merely looking for a way to somehow get your credits done without much love, you should not waste the spot in the class and let someone else take a shot. If you have genuine interest in the topic of Hare's class you will attend an amazing course. Looking back, you will think of the course as a game changer for your academic work. And listen carefully to Hare's introductory remarks to each week's reading. There is very few secondary literature I trust on thinkers with a sufficiently complex body of work, like Kant. Hare's literature I trust, and I recommend you do, too.",
    "Yes. See above."

   "comments": [
    "A lot of it is valuable, e.g., my research is focused on Spinoza; both the Transcendental Ideal and the Conflict of the Faculties are particularly relevant for the Ethics and the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.",
    "I liked the methodology of the course, and this will surely inform my further proceedings in Kant's philosophy. It makes sense to read a selection of texts from Kant's entire career with a specific interest (here, in our class, religion). That way, you are able to understand developments and see how a book like Religion in the Boundaries of Mere Reason is based on or the consequence of antecedent work. I will do this next time with the interest of political philosophy or philosophy of right. The keyword search function of the online edition of the Akademieausgabe is very helpful for targeted readings of Kant for specific purposes: http:\/\/korpora.org\/kant\/suche.html I appreciated the critical edge towards other Kant readings shimmering through every now and then. This helped understand the controversies around key passages and stimulated critical thought on the reception history of Kant's texts.",
    "The course was a clear, broad-scoped, basic but not rudimentary or pedantic introduction to the material, more than adequate for achieving basic familiarity and competence."
