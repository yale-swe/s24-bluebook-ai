   "comments": [
    "Take this class! It's a history class with lots of note-taking, but the lectures and readings are enjoyable. Master Pitti is a great professor, and I'd recommend taking one of his classes while at Yale (especially this one since there is FOOD). Don't let the two papers scare you away, they're nice since you get total control over what you write about, and they're not strict essay format.",
    "If you're interested in history, I recommend taking this class. I found it easy to be interested in the material, even though it's not directly related to my major. Master Pitti is an amazing lecturer, and he brings free food now and then if you need more convincing.",
    "Great course! The lectures can seem pretty long (75 minutes) but the material is fascinating and I can guarantee you will learn so much about Latino history!",
    "A great intro class to the field of Latino\/a studies - introduces you to politics, popular culture and political science methods of analyzing organizing. Take this if you want to be well-rounded in Latino\/a history!",
    "This class is a great way to learn about Latino history. It is well taught and covers a substantial amount of material. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Very informative american studies\/history hybrid class. Pitti covers a lot of material each week, sometimes too much, but it is not essential to remember all of it. Also the final was not cumulative which was great. Readings were typically a book a week, but with section being only 50 minutes it is of course not necessary to complete it consistently (they also Don't contain essential knowledge for exams). An essential class if you want to learn more about the Latin@ narrative (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and Cubans!)from colonialism to today!",
    "Great class and a steady guide through all kinds of Latino history (as in, not just focused on Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans).",
    "The class is a lecture on the overall history of Latinxs in the United States. It brings in a ton of historical material, and balances political and social formation in the U.S. with the political happenings of Latin America and how they are connected. Professor Pitti is awesome and gives great lectures and occasionally brings in food to class. The reading is pretty manageable and most of them are actually really fun and interesting readings. It was two papers, a midterm and a final, all of which were generally based on stuff in lecture and readings. No surprises, fascinating, and good for anyone who wants to learn more about American history, Latin American history, or second-semester seniors who haven't taken a class with Pitti yet.",
    "Such a wonderful course! You'll learn SO MUCH about parts of history with which many of us are shamefully unfamiliar, and you'll come out of the course with a much better understanding not only of individual Latin@ histories but also of how Latin@s have shaped North American + US history, and how our borders, both racial and national, are shifting and changing even now. Also, Master Pitti is a fantastic lecturer and truly kind professor, so you're probably guaranteed to like the course just because he's so great. If you're interested in the material, regardless of whether you're Latin@ or an American Studies major, take it!!",
    "This is a great course that will show you how important Latinos are to the history of our nation, and will highlight on their long history of contributions to this country. It's a history full of violence and struggle, but also one of powerful resistance. You will learn about labor activists, community leaders, and radicals who played a pivotal role in history and how people reclaimed their dignity in spite of their subjugated positions belonging to a marginalized group. It's a history of a people whose spirit has never been quelled despite years of exploitation, and a history that should be embraced. This course will help you understand Latina\/o peoples in unprecedented ways, and will provide you with a more comprehensive understanding of the overall history of our nation.",
    "Pitti is a good professor. There are A LOT of readings, so prepare for that. The lectures sometimes go very fast. But it is a great course if you want to learn more about Latin@ histories that the general k-12 american education does not teach.",
    "This is a fantastic class with a fantastic teacher. Yes, there is a lot of reading, but the assignments were all carefully chosen and really do make for great, thought-provoking discussion. Take it because the subject is great, but really take it because Master Pitti is The Man and he will bring tacos into lecture."
