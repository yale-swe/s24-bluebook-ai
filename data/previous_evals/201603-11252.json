   "comments": [
    "Honestly this course attempted to teach combinatorics and graph theory and proofs. It did not succeed at teaching someone with little experience with proofs how to think like a mathematician and come up with brilliant ideas.",
    "Difficult, challenging, rewarding.",
    "Learned about combinatorics and graph theory as well as general skills for proof-based math.",
    "Great coverage of combinatorics and graph theory.",
    "I learned a lot from this course. Knowledge of proofs is not required, and I didn't have any, so there was a significant learning curve at the beginning. But by the end I felt really confident with the thinking and notation involved.",
    "I developed better combinatorial intuition and problem solving abilities from taking this course. This was also my first introduction to graph theory, a field of combinatorics where I had previously not had much experience with; from our discussion of graph theory, we had the basic knowledge to now explore and understand more advanced graph theory topics and problems.",
    "I feel like I gained a good understanding of combinatorics and graph theory, as well as a good introduction to proof based math.",
    "I learned about combinatorics, graph theory, and how to make rigorous proofs for each.",
    "I learned a lot about ways to think with regards to mathematical questions as well as proofs.",
    "Some very good mathematical concepts and principles, including counting, recursion, graph theory. Overall a very good introduction to discrete mathematics, as the proof-based nature of the class really allows everyone to fully comprehend these concepts.",
    "I greatly developed my ability to construct proofs in this course. Although I had been asked to do proofs in other classes, this was the first one where I was actually taught how to write them.",
    "Basic Graph Theory and Combinatorics",
    "We learned about combinatorics, counting, generating functions technique, and graph theory.",
    "Although I had exposure to mathematical proofs before this, the combinatorial\/qualtiative proofs were new and pretty cool. I also learned the basic structure of proofs in graph theory, and how generating functions work.",
    "I hadn't ever really studied graph theory, so this course definitely taught me most of what I know on that subject. I had already done quite a bit with combinatorics, but this course still taught me a lot of cool relations and kinds of proof that helped me understand that area of mathematics much better.",
    "How to analyze graphs",
    "Good introduction to formal proofs and discrete mathematics, would definitely recommend all CS majors to take this course instead of CPSC 202.",
    "Knowledge about combination and graph theories.",
    "I developed the skill of working through problems by myself and having to use mathematical logic to explain statements that may or may not be obvious.",
    "I learned basics of counting principles and graph theory. We also briefly touched on generating functions. Most imporatantly, I felt the course gave me valuable insights into problem solving techniques.",
    "I learned how to tackle higher level problems in Discrete Mathematics, and how to learn how to write proofs for combinatorics as well as graph theory.",
    "Hamiltonian graphs. Proofs of why things are connected. The meaning to life, and why binary trees and people in line are intimately connected. These, and a whole lot more, I experienced first-hand by taking this course. What is most extraordinary is the level of commitment I put into this course, and the way that it continually baffled me and presented me with beautiful secrets in alternation. I swayed as a bird in a stormy gale, as the ways of thinking discretely managed to evade me for most of the term. And yet, the material is some of the most epic in all of mathematics. There were times when we created new abstractions and worked with certain things only by their properties, and I loved how things click when you finally get it. In short, I learned to be a true warrior, and to solve puzzles late at night with friends plural, single, and hypothetical.",
    "I learned how to write a formal mathematical proof, I learned how to solve complex discrete math problems using mathematical and logical reasoning, and I received an introduction to graph and counting theories."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Badly organized, the lecturer was not well organized for the most part, and lectures did little to help us on the problem sets.",
    "You'll learn a lot, but be prepared to put in much more work than any of your other courses.",
    "Sort of the same as I'd imagine any other class on the topics would be. One suggestion would be a little more generally explaining topics and a little less just reading off proofs from the book in class.",
    "Prof Tran's lectures were very clear, and I also liked his sense of humor. The course was pitched at the right level, and the psets were challenging but fun to do.",
    "I learned a lot from the course, but I wish it was more structured. I understand that this is the first year the course is offered by Professor Linh, so I hope the course will improve next year.",
    "The problems\/problem set were the most enjoyable part of this course. I would recommend incorporating more problems into the lecture and possibly extending problem sets by a few more mid-advanced level problems.",
    "I thought the course was for the most part pretty well designed, but I kind of wish we spent a little more time on graph theory and a little less on combinatorics, since I got the sense that many people in the class had seen the combinatorics before while the graph theory was mostly new material.",
    "The course was interesting, but could take some more time at the beginning to establish proper techniques for proofs.",
    "Discrete mathematics itself is fascinating and I felt that the course covered an appropriate amount of material. It also was accessible for people who hadn't had much proof-based math background (like myself) as well as people I think were math majors. However, the lectures were almost entirely based on the textbook (including in-class examples) and made them sort of redundant, even if they clarified some more confusing parts of the book. I wish there was more material\/class notes that could have provided an alternative from the text, though office hours, the internet, and the excellent peer tutor helped a lot.",
    "It is not an easy course. Many of the proofs are fairly complicated, some require a certain level of wild creativity. The questions on the p-sets are usually very interesting, but it is fairly normal for most of the students in the class to not be able to solve half of the p-set and to resort to asking the TA for help.",
    "Weekly problem sets were cool",
    "I thought we could have covered more material, as we didn't get to cover topics like matching or Ramsey's theorem.",
    "The content of the course was great - the premises were accessible, the problems were interesting, and the potential for application was often clear. With that said, it adhered a bit too strongly to the textbook and was not as engaging as it might have been, given the material. The final exam could have been longer, but the problem set\/starred problem structure was nice. More applications could have been interesting, and a faster pace as well.",
    "This course covers a wide range of material. However, I feel like much of the class was self taught through individual readings, which I think could be improved.",
    "I think the lecture was almost always very helpful in understanding the proofs of the class. Even though the proofs were mostly mundane, having the lecturer walk through all the small leaps of logic made it much easier to follow than just reading the textbook. That said, the textbook we use is very good and will answer most questions not answered in lecture after some close reading. One small weakness of the class is the fact that the more arcane and difficult proofs of the class were often given just as much time as easier proofs, which made for difficult problem sets if one happened to be unable to attend the TA sessions.",
    "strengths: the course teaches graph theory in a moderate depth weaknesses: could have taught more application",
    "There could have been an answer key for the practice problems to better prepare ourselves for the exams.",
    "I thought it was a very good course at strengthening my skills in proofs but I thought that the lecture aspect was basically useless since he just copied the material from the textbook onto the board.",
    "I wish the teacher would post more practice problems throughout the semester for students to do. Most of the theory we covered in class was pretty easy to understand. What made the course challenging learning to come up with \"tricks\" to make solving certain problems easier. I feel like this problem solving is best learned through a lot of practice, and the Pset problems don't necessarily provide enough.",
    "This couse is very rigorous, and you are expected to have a strong background in mathematics. I took it Credit D\/F in order to ease my way through it but I still had to put in a lot of work and hours to keep up with the material covered in class. I went to office hours regularly and spent a lot of time on the psets. The strength of this course is the faculty (the professor and TF are amazing, very down to earth, helpful and patient). I really like the part on graph theory, more than combinatorics, but some students prefer the later. I think the course is well structured and covers a lot of interesting, challenging topics.",
    "The lectures were often difficult to follow and offered no real insight beyond that provided by the textbook. Professor Tran presented proofs on the board that gave some degree of insight into how discrete math problems should be approached, but oftentimes left me confused and no better off than when I entered the lecture hall. The book itself was quite useful, and the problem sets were challenging but manageable, making each week's assignment a good way to learn the material that I was not understanding in lecture."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to another student if you can avoid it. If you are already good at proofs\/math, go for it. But if you don't have a very good understanding of proofs going in, be prepared to get wrecked.",
    "Nice enough prof. Seems easy at first but is actually a hard class. Easier than years past I am told.",
    "Yeah, generally good class if you want to learn about graph theory and combinatorics.",
    "Great class that gives you a solid understanding of counting and graph theory. The psets are challenging but fun, and Prof Tran has a good sense of humor. Some of the proofs can frustrate, but the class is definitely worth taking if you have the time to understand the material well.",
    "I would definitely recommend 244 over 202 for CS majors.",
    "This is a good course, especially if you have to take to get an introduction to proofs. However, try to take it with another professor if possible.",
    "Yes! Definitely an intellectually stimulating class and gets you to really think through proofs and the logic behind theorems we take for granted.",
    "Take this course if you enjoy math and want to be good at doing proofs. The first few weeks will be tough for everyone, but eventually you really do get the hang of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody who wants to explore a new branch of math that is not commonly taught in schools; often, high schools are geared towards the calculus curriculum whereas the basics behind this course are something that many high school students can handle. It also helps train you to think in a different, mathematical way. I would also recommend this course to those who have had previous experiences with combinatorics and discrete math to still take this course as it does a good job of reinforcing concepts and still provides challenging and fun problems to solve.",
    "Definitely take this course over 202. You get a great introduction to combinatorics and graph theory while gaining a new appreciation for proofs. At times, especially in the first half of the semester, the problem sets could get difficult, however the TA was always willing to help. Overall, a great course if you're looking for a bit of a challenge.",
    "It is definitely a course anyone interested in mathematics should take.",
    "I would recommend taking this over cs202 because you get a lot more out of it; however, for someone who has not done math competitions in the past, it was quite challenging and required several hours of work a week. The teacher mainly teaches directly out of the textbook so attending class is not super necessary. I found the peer tutor to be super helpful in problem sets as well as the weekly discussion sections. The professor is also pretty accessible for office hours if you have further questions, so don't be afraid of taking this!",
    "Yes, if you are willing to learn a lot more about mathematical proofs and how to approach a question in a systematic yet creative way. You can get through the all the p-sets just by diligently going to TA session and office hour, but the better way to learn is to spend HOURS and DAYS ruminating over the questions.",
    "Cool course with interesting and challenging material. A good intro to pure math if you haven't seen that kind of stuff before.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it provides a good foundation in discrete mathematics.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student - the mathematics is very cool (accessible premises, complex problems), and clearly has many applications. It also covers a pretty broad range of topics, which I think are useful outside of cs too. If you have experience with rigorous mathematical proofs, it will be pretty doable and fun; if not, it will probably be more challenging, but I think still rewarding in the end. Just make sure to read the textbook, do the problem sets mainly on your own, and make yourself stay focused\/engaged in lecture.",
    "If it isn't required for your major, I would not recommend this course. It is not that interesting and has a heavy workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those who like brainteaser math problems. The material taught in the class isn't particularly difficult to follow: you'll often find yourself feeling like everything from the lecture and book makes sense without much effort. That said, the problems are often a completely different beast, especially the bonus \"star\" problems (in the words of the instructor: meant to \"challenge those who might have already learnt the material and find the course boring *dry chuckle*\"). I've heard that the other discrete course deals with algorithms a lot more than this course, which barely touched them, so if that's what you're looking for, then don't take this course. However, this course goes much deeper in basically every other aspect, so you'll probably come out of this course much more prepared for higher level classes.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in Maths\/ CS. It's a good way to learn and do formal proofs, and all levels of students can find their own challenges in this course.",
    "If you are a math major yes. If not, no the course is very difficult and not relevant to my learning at all.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course! What's cool about this class is that the material learned is very easily applicable to everyday situations. In that sense, the course really rekindled my love for mathematics. If you're thinking about taking this course, here's a warning though: the theory in this course is deceptively simple, yet the course is challenging due to the diversity of problems you have to solve. Make sure you practice a lot of problems from the beginning so that when the exams come around you know the tricks necessary to solve all of the questions.",
    "I would recommend it if you really like mathematic\/are extremely good at it - or if you are taking it Credit D\/F. It is a unique course here at Yale and I believe I learned a lot by taking it. However, taking it Credit D\/F made it easier for me, even as a prospective Applied Math major, but I still found it very stressful at times mainly because of the difficulty of some of the material covered. Think twice before taking it and if you can accommodate this class in your schedule, but it's worth it.",
    "Only take this class if you need to for your major. It's interesting, but not worthwhile unless you're going to be using the theories later on. I found it quite difficult, and I was surprised when I discovered that many students taking the class had already been exposed to discrete math before taking it, making the curve a bit brutal despite the amount of work I put in to try and keep up with the material."
