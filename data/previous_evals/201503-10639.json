   "question_text": "How would you summarize AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 for a fellow student? Would you recommend AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is a broad exploration of the role of theater in the production of the \"modern.\" I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student with an interest in drama, media studies, and cultural criticism.",
    "AMST 677 01 is a review of Drama from the early modern theater of the English Restoration to the twentieth century, in its relation to mass culture, and implications of cultural production, gender roles in society, and world views and representation of Anglo history and Northern Europe. The evolution of stylistic aspects of playwright, in relation to the conception of stage direction and design are relevant aspects of this review. I would recommend this course to another student with interest in theater history to participate in an open conversation of the themes mentioned above.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this seminar or anything else taught by Prof. Roach. I already have encouraged friends in lower years to do so.",
    "This is a wonderful course, and a great way to get more familiar with drama if you've never studied it before. It covers multiple centuries and countries, but if feels very coherent and substantive. Professor Roach is brilliant, enthusiastic, and generous. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend the course to anyone who is interested in western drama.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone. For me, one of the greatest parts of the course was being introduced to a form and genre that I had never systematically addressed (modern theater) in a way that, because it was accompanied by cultural theorists like Raymond Williams, Barthes, and Habermas familiar to me from literary studies, added to a genealogy I was already forming for myself. I was also impressed by the emphasis that Professor Roach placed on issues of gender and race throughout the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others students. It provides a great introduction to the history of modern drama, while at the same time challenges you to think about mass culture, the development of media, etc. However, if you do not like courses that focus on close reading\/historical approaches to literary texts, I would encourage any new student to read more theory on the side."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I haven't really designed my dissertation yet, so it's hard to say. I don't necessarily see any of the texts that came up on the syllabus appearing in my dissertation, but it was a good methodological exercise. I think that the course asks for a kind of interdisciplinary and flexibility of mindset that can be valuable in the process of planning a dissertation and other scholarly work.",
    "The course is a survey of the complementary discipline (theater studies) I require for my dissertation, and was an effective historic perspective of performance and mass culture, that I can use as an analytic method for the specific cases and place I study (Chile, 1980s). The broad amount of topics that the cases reviewed can encompass (from Gender studies, world views and representation, cultural production, theater as propaganda, modernity, to technical aspects of drama and performance) was present by the various interests of the students. The course contributed with new comparative material, with discussion on basic authors of the topics I am researching and with new authors to review.",
    "This class certainly did deepen my knowledge of the profession; I can see now how the class's various assignments were designed to create a robust outline for the kind of paper that is publishable and that contributes to the existing corpus of knowledge about a subject. Even the phrase \"penumbra of allusion,\" mentioned many times in the seminar, was a very useful way to think about the purpose of footnotes in an academic paper.",
    "Because Professor Roach was so supportive of students' efforts to tailor their final projects to their own research interests, I left the class feeling like I'd both broadened my knowledge and done some helpful work toward future studies.",
    "The theoretical part is actually more helpful to me. I have read one-third of the plays before but can still learn a lot from the discussion.",
    "As I wrote above, this course definitely filled in a void that I hadn't fully realized existed, but more importantly gave me reasons to keep on reading in the field. Now that I have read a few plays by Ibsen, Chekhov, and Caryl Churchill, in particular, it feels like the entire landscape of what I have left to read has changed, in a really exciting way. The final paper I wrote for the course is definitely something I will continue to pursue, whether for an article or for my dissertation. In any case, I have a million reasons to thank Professor Roach that I can't even begin to enumerate here.",
    "I definitely know more about modern drama now than I ever did, so the course opened a new world to me. I do not know to what extent the course will contribute to my future research, but I am confident that the course has made me think differently about literary texts."
