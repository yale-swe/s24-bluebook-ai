    "This course covers the stuff you need to know in order to read and enjoy poetry. You might think you'd get that in other English courses, but there's no guarantee of that. So in general, you ought to take it. Then again, the sort of English major that really needs this course will be convinced that he\/she doesn't need it, and, perhaps, vice versa: if you think you really like poetry and you really want to understand it better, there's a good chance that you'll be ahead of the game in this class. Hard to tell.",
    "So much Robert Frost that your New England winter can get even drearier than it now appears",
    "Good course! Take for Stern's jokes, for the mind-bending lectures, and for the chance to read some truly amazing poems. Writing the papers felt like pulling teeth, but the class is otherwise not too taxing a journey.",
    "Problems of Lyric is a great opportunity to read fabulous poetry and learn about what makes poetry, poetry. The professor is perceptive but after 40 years of teaching has (unsurprisingly) become overly enamored with his own ideas and is bad at sharing the floor. However, I must say that if you love poetry and\/or want to have better mastery over discussing and comprehending poetry, this class will serve you well, and it's fun to read wonderful poetry for homework.",
    "If you want to learn how to really understand not just poetry, but all the arts, take this class. Professor Stern is strict, but he really knows his stuff. The class isn't so much about understanding what poems say, more like understanding how the poets manipulate rhyme, meter, structure, etc. to convey the message. You learn how to recognize art that's objectively \"good\", even if you personally don't like the piece. It's a great class.",
    "Great. 10\/10 Would recommend",
    "A great choice. Problems of Lyric was a fascinating experience that showed me how to read and appreciate poetry in a new way. I took the course to learn the basics of reading poetry, but LITR 334 truly taught me how to understand language on a profound level, whether written as verse, prose, spoken aloud, sung, or conveyed through other artistic media. From sound to structure, syntax and philosophy, Professor Stern paints a complete and detailed picture. Overall, a course I would highly recommend to others (the less-than-intense workload was a bonus as well!)",
    "A truer course taught by a wiser teacher One would be pressed to findeven at Yale. At times a critic, then a fervent preacher Is Stern the tough yet kind, without a fail. His class: a tribute to the greatest poets, An exploration of the famous forms. Youll learn to read the types like thisI know it! A sonnetand recognize their quirks and norms. To study poetry is more than just An exercise in words and hidden meanings; Youll find the common hopes, the pain and lust, Of human life, and many other gleanings. Come learn the art of nature, and natures art. One class is insufficientbut its a start!"
