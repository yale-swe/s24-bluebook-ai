   "comments": [
    "For someone interested in qualitative research methods, especially in political science, sociology and anthropology.",
    "This is a unique course because you have course time focused on qualitative techniques, while you are independently executing a field project. I would recommend it to students who will be conducting qualitative field research, so it is pretty self-selective.",
    "This is an essential class if you are hoping to do qualitative field work in the future. It gives you experience of carrying out a field work project, but also gives you lots of support in doing this. You read other academics' experience of field work methods and discuss key ideas in class. The professor is great. I highly recommend this class.",
    "It is hard to say whether you should take it before or after getting field experience.",
    "I would summarize PLSC-505 as 'how to do actual social science while talking to people', and would strongly recommend that my fellow students take it.Even for a quantitatively focused student, it highlights problems and issues that can affect data gathering in surveys, experiments, or other supposedly non-qualitative work. For a qualitatively focused student, it adds rigor and highlights the fact that qualitative work must be done, even though its hard, with attention to detail, design, and where and how things can go wrong.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that thinks they will have to use qualitative field methods in their research. While some theory is reviewed in this course, the focus on utilizing the methods made it more valuable to me than other similar courses offered.",
    "This course is a practicum in field research and is intended to help students understand what field research is and put that into actual practice in order to maximize our research opportunities and hopefully get the most out of our field work.I imagine many students will not realize the benefit of this course until they actually are in the middle of their research. However, the utility of this class cannot be understated and I would highly recommend this class to anyone who intends on doing field research, and even recommend it to quantitative folks in order to help them understand \"what the numbers mean.\"",
    "I would say that it is a class where you get to work on a field research project in a supportive environment with other students going through the same process that you are. I would definitely recommend it, provided that they have time to do the class because it is much more demanding than the other classes I had this semester.",
    "Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's a great chance to get experience doing actual qualitative research."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "If the professor could spend more time explaining and elaborating on related theories, instead of inviting student guests to talk their own projects, that would be more helpful. After all, field project would only deepen our understanding of theories after we grasp the theories in the first place. Entering into the field without a solid theoretical foundation would be less helpful.",
    "This was a great preparatory course for my summer research for my environmental masters. It is a lot of work, but I think it was worth it.",
    "This has been an essential class for preparing me for my future research.",
    "Prepare me for the following field interviews.",
    "This course gave me a better sense of how we consume qualitative work, and to think through all the pitfalls that are out there. While many works include, even if it is totally mediocre, a case study, its often hard to know where and how to start in recognizing how they might be wrong, and how one could argue they are wrong.For my own work, it was good to learn firsthand some of the problems that can come up in doing field research, some of the bad habits I have as a researcher, and was excellent prep for any qualitative work I might do in the future.",
    "Prior to this course, I had no formal introduction to qualitative research methods. This course prepared me well for a summer Master's thesis I will be performing in the coming month- from preparing the IRB (and even knowing that I need to do one!) to choosing appropriate qualitative methods to analyzing results. I feel it was valuable to have exposure to these techniques prior to research this summer.",
    "This course, depending upon exactly how my research goes, may have been an instrumental part in enabling me to best conduct field research. Many thanks for all your hard work and the opportunity to study!",
    "It definitely deepened my knowledge of methods in political science. My field research project also gave me a chance to explore a topic of deep interest to me in a really productive way. I do not know if moving forward I will choose to incorporate field research into my dissertation, but it is helpful to know the benefits this method can contribute to understanding social science phenomena and developing hypotheses."
