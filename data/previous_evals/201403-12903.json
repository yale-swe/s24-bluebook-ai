    "Take this class. It's great.",
    "Bill is a wonderful person! As a professor, there's a lot to be desired, but he's such a cool character that I didn't mind throughout the course. He'll spend most of the class talking on and on in a monotonous voice and there are a lot of readings, but the midterm and final papers are pretty manageable. Bill definitely sees this class as a transition class for freshmen into college (we had a whole class after we got our midterm papers back with him talking to us about common writing errors we made and how to improve). Overall, I don't feel I learned a significant amount especially since I wasn't very on top of the readings, but it was a good first semester freshman year course to take to ease into a fuller college workload. There will be a couple of movie screenings which I really enjoyed, and a day trip to New York to visit the Tenement Museum.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student because the class was fun and interesting. I would say that we read books and learn a lot of epidemiology in a way thats not revolved completely around science.",
    "Definitely recommend- workload is light, interesting class, and I personally just really appreciated a small seminar versus all the other big lectures I was in.",
    "Excellent freshman seminar - very interesting and broad overview into the various aspects of multiple epidemics throughout history. Note that this is NOT a science course - if you're looking for biology or physiology of disease go somewhere else. This is about epidemics and society - you talk about literature, philosophy, science, history economics, sociology, public health, politics - anything and everything really in this class. Which was really great and what liberal arts should actually be about. The discussion is pretty much unstructured (we once veered off course entirely and spent an entire afternoon talking about ebola instead) - so if that's your thing then great, if not then you might want to find something else. There's quite a lot of reading for this class - one book every week or two weeks - but it's definitely manageable and the books chosen are outstanding. (Just that there's perhaps a bit too much french literature involved for some inexplicable reason.) You can get by and come to section without reading of course (as I'm pretty sure most people did at some point in the semester) - but seriously to get the most out of this seminar do your readings. Two optional film screenings as well but go for those too - you won't regret it. Apart from the books - one ungraded(!) midterm paper and one 3000 word final paper. Assessment is incredibly chill - just that as a result there's a lot of uncertainty with your final grade so be warned. Hence if you don't read the books I daresay this class would be a total gut. Bill Summers is an awesome guy - he's incredibly smart and knowledgeable about literally everything. Go look him up. He really enabled all the discussions throughout the semester, and he has plenty of great stories to tell. Also he brought the entire class on a walking tour of NYC and even to his apartment for lunch. Which was pretty much the highlight of the course (the trip, not the lunch) and a great bonding opportunity for everyone in the seminar. However Bill tends to go off on tangents at times and he can occasionally monopolize the discussion. But then again the quality of discussion in the seminar very much depends on how much you choose to bring to it - so read your books and have something to say. Overall - TAKE THIS CLASS. Good books, fascinating discussion, minimal work. Literally the best class I've had ever.",
    "Actually take this course! I had a lot of people tell me that they thought about it, or shopped it in the beginning (after not making pre-registration) and then never followed through. It can be a bit dry the first day, but Professor Summers keeps the rest of the course completely personal and gets to know everyone on an individual basis. Probably one of the only classes freshman fall that didn't have me ever stressed out or wanting to quit, because the material is always interesting and fast paced to the point where you've never really struggling to understand.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, but I wish the assigned papers had clearer instructions. A grade checkpoint some time during the semester since no grades were really given or discussed throughout the course.",
    "The course was very interesting and not a lot of work. Very heavy on reading (if you choose to do it). Make sure to participate often. Bill, the professor, is awesome.",
    "Summer's class is fantastic for a schedule that's filled to the brim with other stuff. The readings offer a new perspective on epidemics (hence the name I suppose) and it's a refreshing course to take. I'd highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "An interesting freshmen seminar, I did enjoy it and it did not have a heavy workload aside from lots of readings, but perhaps there are better seminars if you are not interested in the material.",
    "This is a cool freshman seminar, though not what I was expecting. Sometimes it goes into literary analysis of the readings, while other times it stays with discussing diseases. Bill is really interesting and entertaining, especially once you get to AIDS. Be sure to participate in discussions, because it is never clear what you are graded on. The workload fluctuates, with the reading sometimes being 20 pages of a WHO report and other times 200 of a novel. Overall, I would recommend it."
