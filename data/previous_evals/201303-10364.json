   "comments": [
    "In my experience, Phil 115 was very polarizing; most students I talked to either loved it or hated it. I was one of the students who absolutely loved it. Many students didn't come to lecture because Whittle's lectures were a bit dry and repetitive of the text book, but I found lectures to be a helpful review. As a philosophy major in particular, I found that what I learned in this class helped me in literally everything else I do. I loved the content, and found that taking this course gave me a new lens through which to view the world. There is not too much homework, and the way it works, you can always check whether your homework is correct or not before submitting it. If you are someone who likes syllogistic thinking and logical arguing, this class is perfect for you. I'd surely recommend it!",
    "Boring but good QR and the homework is fun.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in mathematical philosophy",
    "Good intro class in logic. Whether or not you're planning to pursue philosophy further, it's an interesting class.",
    "We learned the mathematical language of First Order Logic and how to apply it to a few specific cases and problems. We also learned about logical concepts and terms such as validity, soundness, and truth.",
    "Only to fill the QR requirement but even then, it is not an easy course to do this in.",
    "Definitely recommend this class if you're looking for an interesting, manageable QR. Professor Whittle explains things well and makes the exams very straightforward. If you go to lecture and do the homework, you're pretty prepared already.",
    "took it for credit, pretty interesting, would recommend shopping it at bare minimum. you'll know if you're going to like it",
    "No surprises with this class- it teaches you basic logic and the methods for constructing proofs. The workload is manageable and lectures are useful for increasing understanding of the subject. I would recommend it if you seem interested in computer science or math where proofs play an important role, or if you just want a basic introduction to what philosophy classes are like. Heed the warning that the subject material is rather dry and mechanical though.",
    "Not a lot of work and graded easily. Also proofs are good mental workouts and can be fun at times. Recomment",
    "I guess take it if you need an easy QR option, though I'm sure there are better options. If you're interested in logic (as I was) DEFINITELY just skip to mathematical logic.First Order Logic is basically a joke. The entire course's material probably could have been covered in 3 weeks.",
    "Yes; material was extremely interesting and useful in other courses (especially those involving essays). Textbook was also fun to read (the software made for a great study tool).",
    "It is an interesting class and not too demanding. Lectures are sometimes boring. It is an easy QR credit for people who don't like math.",
    "The course covers pretty basic to intermediate logical proofs and tools for logical analysis. It is a very easy workload and the material is rewardingly challenging, but refreshingly doable at all times. Actually the easiest class I have taken at Yale.",
    "A bit difficult - this is not an easy QR credit; if you are really interested in learning about logic, but don't have much experience, take it Credit D. The proofs can be pretty difficult, and you don't get too much partial credit. Amazing professor though (if Bruno Whittle is teaching it, you might want to take it). He's an absolutely funny lecturer and a great help to students.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student. For those who need a QR, it is more than manageable. The concepts are never that challenging, and things that are more confusing at first become clear by doing practice problems. The lecture notes and text book correspond pretty directly, the homework policy is a good one, and the exams were definitely fair based on what was covered in class.",
    "If you were an all-around student in high school (i.e. fairly advanced in all subjects, took a full slate of APs, regardless of subject), but are now a social science or humanities major at Yale, FOL is the QR for you. It's an interesting combination of pure memorization, rote application of various rules, and some more abstract thinking. If Professor Whittle teaches it again (though it doesn't seem likely since this class has had 3 different professors the last three times it was taught), know that while his lectures may not be the most interesting or easiest to follow, his handouts basically explain the entirety of the material. Workload is fair, grading spread is very fair, exams arejust right, and it's an incredibly fascinating and useful subject (especially for pre-law students) to boot. Highly recommend.",
    "A solid, low-stress introduction to the field of formal logic. I personally enjoyed the material\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite a bit, actually\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the lecture itself can feel redundant given the fact that everything is covered in the reading. Definitely take it, however, if you have any interest in the wonderful world of FOL.",
    "Easy QR with minimal amount of work. Proofs were kinda fun once you get to understand them. First two tests were a breeze and the third suddenly got pretty hard, so watch out for that. Class is SUPER boring - all we did was review the lecture slides, which you can do from your dorm room.",
    "Yes--it is very cool to train your intuition and to take a course on logic. I did not take this class for the QR credit--I had plenty of QRs already. I took this class because I had never really learned about proofs or logic in general before, and found this to be a great introduction. Professor Whittle gave really enjoyable lectures! What's more, the workload is not bad at all, and the class is designed for you to learn a lot and do well. I highly recommend FOL to any student interested in formalizing their logical reasoning.",
    "Yes and no. Yes, because it's a good QR class if you're not particularly math-minded. No, because it gets trickier towards the end with proofs, and it can be more stress than you've bargained for.Overall, I would recommend the class. It's very satisfying when you do figure out the proofs, and I think that the course helped me think in somewhat more logical steps. The workload isn't bad either, and the homework questions are really geared towards helping you understand the material.I understand this was Professor Whittle's first year teaching this class, and I think he did a great job. A bit dry, but always crystal clear with his explanations and powerpoints. He could have made his tests much more difficult than he did, but his problems were always fair and reasonable.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. If you like puzzles, you will seriously enjoy it. I would recommend it to philosophy majors and non-majors. Workload includes weekly problems (but these can be done anytime before the exams) and three non-cumulative exams. The homework is submitted over a program that gives you instant feedback, and you can keep submitting until you get the problems right. I would recommend it to anyone. Great class!",
    "Basics of first order logic and logical reasoning, learn about logical proofs and relationships.",
    "This is an extremely easy class. All of the material are solving fun little logic puzzles. Barely anyone goes to lecture, many do not go to section, and frankly, you really don't need to. There is very little homework, and the problems are submitted via a third-party system that lets you see what you got wrong before submitting it to your TF. The exams were all unchallenging. I understand that some people struggled in the class; I found it blindingly simple and thought we moved at a glacial pace. I didn't feel rewarded by taking this class, I found it a throwaway credit that I took because I thought I was a philosophy major and needed it as a prereq.",
    "Don't take this class if you have any interest in learning anythingsignificant from your QR. Professor Whittle is not a good lecturer. This class could be a great class, if it moved far faster and the tests used the advanced problems on the problems sets for more than one problem worth five points. Take this class if you want a very easy QR.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. If you find proofs satisfying or enjoy puzzles, you'll have a great time. Textbook reading was often unnecessary, and it was very satisfying to take tests where all of the concepts being tested had been covered in class and were very manageable. Take it. It's also not a ton of work, so a very doable fifth class.",
    "I had heard mixed reviews about previous logic classes, but I think maybe it was Prof. Whittle's style and the textbook\/computer program combo that made the class enjoyable for me. He gives out handouts with his powerpoint slides every class, and gives a good deal of useful review for the first two tests. +1 for having an entertaining english accent. It's pretty slow-moving at first, but really picks up after the second test. Homework takes very little time. Tests are really fair and straightforward. I am a total humanities\/social sciences person and thought this was a really interesting class and I think one non-math people like myself can do well in if you put in the work and practice doing proofs a lot.",
    "This was not a difficult course. The fact that the homework for the course is divided into only three sections, each of which can be completed at one's own pace and turned in the day before each exam means that there are essentially only three days of work necessary for this course. I also found that all of the necessary material was covered in my section as well as in the lectures and textbook, so it was only necessary to attend section (this is not my normal approach to classes, but when desperate to fulfill a QR requirement in a mildly interesting way on a very busy schedule, sometimes these things happen). I don't feel the course altered my thinking particularly, or anything like that, but it wasn't unpleasant.",
    "Very little work. Can be challenging but definitely manageable. Grading seems fair.",
    "For any quantitative-minded person, this class should be no trouble. There's very little theory and mainly just solving proofs and really minimal amounts of material throughout the semester. Not sure if it's a QR gut for people who don't want to take math or other intensive QR courses. It was next to no work and few people show up for lecture, because you really don't need to if you read the PowerPoints, though Bruno does have a nice voice to listen to for an hour a couple times a week.",
    "I recommend this course, yes, take it, especially if you are not a math person, great QR, take it with a friend so you have someone to talk through the concepts with and help you if you get stuck on a proof or something, you have a little bit of homework each night but it is not due until the next exam (3 of them) so you can do it whenever is best for you, good 5th class.",
    "Good class, not much work, pretty easy, you don't have to go to class if you don't want to.",
    "If you don't like it day one and two, you're never going to like it. Take it only if you have to for the philosophy major or if you're ACTUALLY in love with this content. You're NOT going to learn how to \"think logically\" in this class. You're going to learn nothing. Take a more interesting class.",
    "Philosophy 115 offers a nice introduction to first-order logic. However, this is definitely more of a math class than a philosophy class. Most of the curriculum focuses on how to complete logical proofs, and little attention is given to the wider, \"big picture\" themes of first-order logic. If you need a QR credit (especially if you are a humanities person), this class is one of the more manageable and less painful, but other than that, I would not recommend taking this class just for the material.",
    "Definitely recommend the class. Trains precise thinking.",
    "Phil 115 focuses on the formal language of FOL. The course started out very slowly, but eventually evolved to be moderately complicated. If you're looking for an easy QR credit, then this would be recommended. If, on the other hand, you're somewhat more quantitatively inclined, then you should probably jump to something more complicated (such as Mathematical Logic, etc). Overall, the workload is minimal, and the exams straightforward. If you're interested in philosophy or construction of better arguments, then this course and the logical tools you pick up will no doubt be useful, although you could easily pick these up on your own as well.",
    "A fun class. I didn't go to lecture or do any reading until the day before the midterm (and later exam), when all the homework was due. I did okay, I think getting an A. I would NOT recommend putting all the homework off until the last moment, but it is do-able if you need to. Logic is really fun. A great, fun, and interesting QR.",
    "First-order logic helped me organize my thoughts in a coherent way. It was definitely a worthwhile course.",
    "The necessary foundation in formal logic---even if, unfortunately, the class coincides perfectly with the textbook.",
    "Through section with Jessie Munton, I learned that logic can be fun and it even makes sense! The exams were kind and the homework reasonable. Also, the computer program is a good way to learn logic and easy to use (go stanford geeks for inventing it). However, I didn't see any point in going to lecture. Bruno Whittle essentially read from his (well arranged) slides, which he later posted on v2. I can't imagine why a third of the class even went--either they had the hots for brunno (he's got something going for him, being british and all), or they still have the fear from high school. Come on....",
    "Sure. It's interesting and if you're an analytical thinker should be an easy A."
