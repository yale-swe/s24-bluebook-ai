    "You'll learn all about Jewish, Muslim, and Christian relations in Iberia until 1492 Take this class. You will love it.",
    "Emphatically not. Professor Menocal will interrupt you every time you try to talk (seriously, I can't remember a single time she let someone finish their thought in peace). Her book is useless as a historical introduction both for its excessively romanticized view of medieval Spain and its heavy pro-Islamic Spain bias. I could have learned as much about medieval Spanish history by reading the other text (Fletcher, Moorish Spain) and supplementing it with occasional Wikipedia checks. Honestly the only thing I got out of this class was lots of things to complain about and an eye for architecture that recalls the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba (it's everywhere \u0097 once you see it it Can't Be Unseen). Professor Menocal definitely seemed to want to run the class as a lecture, but I don't think I would recommend taking it even in that other format. It just isn't worth the trouble.",
    "I would recommend Cultures of Medieval Spain. Be prepared to work really hard, however. Professor Menocal expects a lot out of her students, so it's impossible to come to class without having done the work. The course material is really interesting as are its connections to other areas of study. We talked about history, religion, art, philosophy, poetry and architecture. Although the workload isn't that heavy, the expectations are high, so you need to put in a lot of effort. Medieval Spain is an amazing place and I learned a lot from this course. I think that my writing skills really improved because Professor Menocal forced us to think about every word - its meaning, connotations, and roots - before placing it on the page,or even saying it out loud in class. This course will make you a better writer, thinker and speaker.",
    "Yes! Take this class - if you can get in! If you enjoy history, travel, religious studies or really any aspect of the humanities, this class is for you. You may be wondering, what happened in Medieval Spain? Isn't that a kind of random thing to study for a semester? As it turns out, this class relates so much to today, especially in regards to the interactions among Muslims, Jews and Christians. Cultures of Medieval Spain will challenge everything you thought you knew about the Middle Ages. A lot of class is spent looking at (and discussing) photos of different types of architecture from the time period, often taken by the professor herself, which was really enjoyable. And in the fall we are reuniting to take a field trip to New York to look at art and architecture and the Met and visit other monuments around the city. A really interesting - really fun - class.",
    "Very enjoyable course, and I loved the integration of multiple art forms (poetry, architecture, literature, biblical texts, etc). It really gave me a full understanding of a culture I never knew existed (medieval Spain), and presented it in a manner that was very engaging. It was definitely a good break from an otherwise math\/engineering courseload (yes, absolutely take this class or another freshman seminar even if you are trying to fulfill engineering requirements; you will appreciate the perspective it offers). As an additional note, I came into this course knowing nothing about Islam, and I could now detail its history until the capitulation of Granada in 1492; very useful andrelevant perspective in this day and age.",
    "TAKE IT, if you can get in.",
    "It is a great course to help you think about themes of history in a very different way. It will not focus on a particular type of history, however, and getting your point of view across will be difficult in discussion.",
    "Cultures of Medieval Spain is a great class and I would recommend it to any student! It was definitely one of my favorite classes this year and I learnt a lot from it. By the end of the semester you have a very good understanding of the historical events that shaped the Iberian peninsula in the Eurpean Middle Ages and of the culture of the area (from literature to architecture). Also, the amount of work was manageable and the essays were not very long.",
    "A fascinating overview of the religious and cultural interplay of Medieval Spain. Go as far out of your way as it takes to take this class, it's terrific.",
    "Bottom line-this class is a must take, if you can get in. It will give you a comprehensive view on Spain during the medieval years, from architecture to literature. It will also be interesting to see how the things we learn about medieval Spain can be related to modern themes. Also, Professor Menocal might seem intimidating at first, but I assure you you\u0092ll grow to like of her as the semester progresses. She really cares about the students in the class. The discussions were great and I always enjoyed going to class. Work load is very manageable. It is a wonderful class that caters for any person even if a person\u0092s interests are beyond the realm of history. If you happen to take this class a walk on the streets of Manhattan or a trip to Spain would never be the same again. Plus, it will give you something additional to talk about at your next cocktail party. One of Yale\u0092s finest gems.",
    "Throughout the course of this class we are assigned portions from Menocal's own book in addition to two other supplementary readings. The readings are fairly brief and there are weekly reading responses due of approximately 250-300 words. In addition to these short writing assignments, we have three papers and three ID quizzes on slides that we review in class. As with most other courses, the more you put into this class and keep up with the readings, the more rewarding it is.",
    "Great humanities course, particular if one is not necessarily a humanities major yet is interested in the material. Not too much work, and the reading is pretty interesting (other than the Fletcher book). There are weekly writing assignments, which are not too demanding in terms of length. Very interesting topic. Explores a region and time that are particularly vital to Western Culture yet that often goes ignored. Professor Menocal can be a little intimidating at first, but she opens up as the semester goes on. Also, no prior knowledge of the region is needed- she may open up the first course with places and names you don't know of, but you will quickly catch up. All in all, a great course that I highly recommend.",
    "Best course I've taken. Recommended in the strongest fashion."
