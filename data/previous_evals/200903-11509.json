    "Possibly one of the most stressful lab courses there are at Yale. The two lab reports are nightmares. Only take this course if you absolutely have to.",
    "a Frustrating lab. The techniques used in this lab are helpful to know and well-used in real life but the course structure really sucks.",
    "Learn a decent amount, and don't worry if you're taking it a year after Biochem class since you won't need much technical stuff from it. This lab's reputation is fitting: the labs themselves aren't terribly grueling for the most part; one or two are long, but some days you're out very early. The two lab reports, on the other hand, take a LONG TIME, so prepare to focus all of your energy on them for a few days before they're due, since you realistically will not do any work on them in advance, even if you tell yourself you will. Definitely take the section in the first half of the semester (email profs in advance of first class meeting to tell them your preference)-- it's less painful to write lab reports before and after midterms than during finals and reading week when you have all your other work due. At least 50% of people in the class will be familiar with at least some of the techniques in the lab. Very premed-y.",
    "Take it only if you need a lab course. This class has an absurd amount of workload for a class that's only worth 1\/2 credit. You also put in 2 days a week in lab granted it's only half a semester. Time is poorly managed. Lectures sometimes run 2 hours long and often times, it could be done in less than an hour.",
    "It's intense but fairly short, which is nice. The lab work itself is pretty painless, although the lectures are mind-numbingly dull. The lab reports are a lot of work, but they are manageable - just make sure you go into as much detail as you can given the page limits.",
    "The lab part is ok. The TA's are generally nice and try really hard to make the class run smoothly and to make you feel ok about life. However, the reports are A TON of work, and are ultimately not very rewarding.",
    "Biochem lab consists of 2 projects over the course of the semester that each entail writing a summary lab report as well as quizzes or some homework assignments during the course of the class. It's a good course both in terms of the way it's taught and the fact that you're working in an environment that simulates what working on a project in a research lab is (albeit more structured and with expected results). I would recommend the course, especially if you're planning to work in a lab either at Yale or elsewhere.",
    "You meet twice a week for one half of the semester and work on two lab projects. The first involves introducing a mutation into a protein and then analyzing its effects on activity, the second involves enzyme kinetics. Having lab twice a week ate up a lot of time, and the two lab reports are quite lengthy and time-consuming. But it is an interesting lab course and proves helpful if you are taking a biochem lecture at the same time.",
    "dont take it unless you need to (duh) and if you need to take it then its really not as bad as everyone says. at this pt you have taken other chem and bio labs and so its kinda routine. just a pain in the butt.",
    "Intro Biochem course where you learn a lot of really useful andreal techniques in lab that you would actually use in research outside of school. The first and only lab I've taken at school where I've really felt like I was doing real lab work. It's great and even though it meets twice a week, it's only half a semester!",
    "I think this lab is required for a lot of people. The professors are nice and it's just half a semester so just take it. I'm just glad it's over.",
    "NEVER TAKE THIS COURSE EVER.(but there is BAR pizza at the end so I guess it was alright...)",
    "It was a good lab. Mostly because it's not just a random set of different experiments for you to do. It forces you to realized why you're doing something. Just know the purpose of everything and you'll be fine. It was just a bit frustrating to have so much the first half of the term and then like nothing the second. Try to take first section. At least that way you'll have not having lab to look forward to, especially when classes get harder toward the end of the term.",
    "2 lab reports take FOREVER. start a week(s) in advance.",
    "The lab is a good experience for those interested in trying out the lab scene, and a good lab to accompany MCDB 300. The topic covered, even though they are relatively simple in biochemistry, offer a good refresher for basic lab techniques. I would recommend it.",
    "You learn to mouth pipet with the TAs Orn and Bingjie.Agarose. Ligation phail. FEAST for teaching.",
    "This is a great lab to take because it is very relevant to any future research that one might do. Also it meets twice a week for only half a semester which is a great.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Really annoying lab with really annoying quizzes, horribly long lab reports, and horrible teachers. The lectures were a complete waste of time and thought the project topics were interesting, the took way longer than they should have (mostly because the lecture beforehand was insanely long and boring). Probably not a good idea to take this class without previous lab experience since basically everyone in the class already has previous lab experience. This lab wasn't insanely hard, just very very tedious and time consuming. Notrecommended.",
    "The lab requires so much time. While I enjoyed the material we were learning, the lab reports were unneccessarily long and complicated. Furthermore the instructions were not thorough enough so too much time was spent trying to figure out what to do. Overall, I enjoyed the in class experience, but the lab reports were not fun.",
    "Take it only if you need it.",
    "lots and lots of work. if you have to take this course, do the relevant parts of each lab report immediately after you do them in class. You will be surprised how much you forget by the time you have to write everything up.",
    "Good lab, a little intense for the first half of the semester but rather manageable",
    "The lab reports are a lot of work, but up until they are due the lab doesn't require that much time. It is also nice that the lab only runs for half a semester. The subject matter of the lab is also pretty interesting.",
    "i'd recommend it to mbb majors, probably not anyone more. its a lot of work for a bio lab 1\/2 credit",
    "Biochem Lab is split into two main projects, protein structure and enzyme kinetics, with a lab report for each. All experiements were geared towards investigating the main question for each project, which gave the labs a great cohesiveness. The experiments involve popular techniques such as PCR and transformation. Overall, I would definitely recommend this lab to another student.",
    "Not as difficult as I thoughtit would be, given that it is twice a week for half a semester. Try to take it in the first quarter if possible; I didn't do that and struggled to keep on top of my other classes when this lab began to take up my afternoons twice a week. Aruna and Prof. Konigsberg were very helpful, as were the TAs we had in our section. Don't be afraid to email them for clarification of concepts and especially for questions about how to do the lab reports. The first lab report is a monster, so definitely start it early!!!"
