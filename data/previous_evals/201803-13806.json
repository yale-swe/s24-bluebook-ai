   "comments": [
    "This course demanded a critical look at the institution of the archive, and in doing so demanded an open-minded and conscious mode of critique and criticism. I felt pushed to both engage with course material and remain self-reflective throughout.",
    "I'm grateful to this course for giving me an entirely new perspective on the dangers and violences of archives, especially at a point where I was more or less enamored by all that archives (especially Yale's archive) had to offer.",
    "The course covered a significant amount of material surrounding critical perspectives towards museal\/ archival practices. Beyond critique, the course also explored possible alternatives, both through reading about the work of others and through the proposed projects that we developed through the course. The groupwork nature of the projects also encouraged us to develop our collaborative and communicative capabilities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was not structured with an ultimate didactic goal mind (this was made clear by the instructor early in the class); this lack of ultimate objective was both a blessing and a curse. There was also a moderately heavy reading and film-viewing load required for the course. While the material was stimulating, course discussions rarely covered all of the material and often deviated from the weekly \"theme\" put forth in the syllabus. I think the course could have benefited by staying more \"on task\" with these themes and being more intentional about discussing weekly readings.",
    "I really appreciate how the assignments were designed as collaborative, cross-institutional projects and as creative presentations that offered new ways of organizing information.",
    "I appreciated how the course was focused on creating possible responses to existing issues and that all the students in the class would present our projects to each other. It made the course much more of a discussion space than a space that was simply for learning and then assessment. Additionally, many of the articles that we read were also very insightful and productive for thinking about the issues at hand. I did find the class disorganized at time. Particularly since it was co-taught at Yale and Brown, and Yale's seminars are significantly shorter than Brown's (inherent to schedule differences), it often felt like we didn't have enough time to discuss all the material at hand. This was particularly true because we often also had many items from the Beinecke to look through and talk about."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - I would add the caveat about structure, and emphasize the style of the course, but I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in or working with the subject matter.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I think it fosters a greater consciousness of the ethics of the work of knowledge production, and of what the 'access' we have at Yale to scholarly materials means."
