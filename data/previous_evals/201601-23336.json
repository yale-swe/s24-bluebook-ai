The non-classroom format itself is great, very different compared to a lot of other Yale classes. Prof. Draghi was also fascinating to listen to, and lots of interesting topics were discussed over the course of the class!",

Not sure how this would be done logistically with the field trips etc, but it might be interesting for getting to know people in the class a bit better, as well as for having a more formalized discussion at times.",

There definitely is a continual theme in the class, although the topics range so broadly that they should probably expect to come out knowing a little about a lot of (fascinating) topics, rather than understanding one topic in-depth.",

    "A good balancing point. Challenge self to find the meaning in it."
