We delved into these debates by reading and discussing film theory, translation theory, critiques of globalization, etc. All of these topics are at the forefront of literary studies today, so I feel very up to date on the state of my field.",
    "I learned novel perspectives to observe the cultural production worldwide in examining the discussion and debate around terms like \"world literature\" and \"world cinema\". I had an eye-opening exploration of filmic and literary works from the \"Southern\" regions like China, South Asia, and Africa, and developed critical analytical skills based on the learning of some recent developments of the neo-Marxist and postcolonial theory."
