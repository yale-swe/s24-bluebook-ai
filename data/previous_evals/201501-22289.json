    "This class is absolutely amazing. It is one of those Yale classes that you should take to fully appreciate the value of a liberal arts education. Even if you are not interested in anything about South Africa or history even, Magaziner will keep you so engaged with his enthralling lectures. Don't let the amount of work scare you off at all. It is well worth it.",
    "This is a great lecture course and I highly recommend it if you are interested in learning about South Africa. Professor Magaziner is a great lecturer who gives outlines before each lecture and sticks to the time limit. You always leave having learned something. The course has two take home 10 page papers for the midterm and final and 2 primary source analyses. Very manageable course load. The readings are mostly interesting save a few. Lectures are mandatory. Take it if you want to learn.",
    "This course is a history of South Africa, not THE history, as the professor will mention several times throughout the course. Given this, it is a narrative centered upon native experiences and the effects of colonial rule and subsequent racialized politics that characterize any history of South Africa. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in Africa or in history that is intentionally inclusive of native perspectives and unafraid of challenging the easy or simple narrative.",
    "Its a great class, you'll enjoy it.",
    "If you have been to South Africa, you need to take this class. If you have any interest in African history, you need to take this class. If you have no interest in African history, you should still take this class. By far the best lecture I've taken in four years at Yale. It felt like you were watching the history channel on a daily basis. Magaziner is a tremendous story teller, and inspiring intellectual. But also exceedingly normal, and easy to talk to. The course covers early African civilizations (Great Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe), and continues through apartheid. He supplements the factual history with a ton of cultural examples, which are his specialty. Much less work than his Encounters with African Colonialism (also a fantastic class, but heavier reading and writing load).",
    "History of South Africa was one of the better courses I have taken at Yale. The lectures are fascinating, and focus on culture, emotion, and popular sentiment more than historical facts. South Africa has such a rich and relevant history, and the course made me engage with race, capitalism, and identity in valuable ways. Magaziner weaves seemingly disparate threads into a narrative that captures oppression. resistance, and cultural beauty. He is a great lecturer, and you wanted to be in class every day. it was a lot of reading and writing, but definitely well worth it.",
    "Take this course, no questions asked.",
    "Take this course! It's not easy to do well, but the material is incredibly interesting and Prof Magaziner is a fantastic lecturer. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I loved this class! It's a general survey of South African history from about 1800 (although we covered some background from before then) to just past the end of apartheid. I'm a history major and this is one of my favorite lectures that I've taken so far at Yale. There are 4 papers (2 long, 2 short) and no tests, which worked really well for me--the assignments were very well constructed to help me better understand the scope of what we learned in class. I can't say this of many classes I've taken here, but I genuinely enjoyed, and even looked forward to, doing the readings and papers for this class. Magaziner is great (although he talks really fast so don't get distracted during lecture! You won't want to miss anything he says.) So yes, take this class. It's a lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "Absolutely! I rarely write this on course evaluations, but I do think that this is one of those classes that a Yale student should take before graduation. Whether you are interested in art or literature or politics or the environment, there will be some aspect of this class that will make you think differently about your field of study. Magaziner is one of the most astoundingly talented lecturers at Yale, and the take-home exams are fun and so thought-provoking.",
    "Amazing course!! Be sure to take the class.",
    "If you're interested in South Africa, and race relations yes. If you're just a history major looking to fulfill the LAAA requirement, I would recommend History of Brazil, Japan's Modern Revolution or a course on the Middle East.",
    "Great overview of the entirety of South African history, no prior knowledge needed. There is a lot of reading each week which can sneak up on you, but the lectures and material are mostly interesting. I really enjoyed this class and would recommend it. Professor Magaziner is a great lecturer.",
    "This is a perfect course for understanding the various social and cultural histories of South Africa. Professor Magaziner is attentive, knowledgeable, funny, and talented, and he's one of the best storytellers you'll ever meet. On top of that, the readings for the course are fantastic. Don't hesitate - taking a history class with Magaziner will open you up to knew worlds of knowledge and thinking.",
    "Good overview of South Africa! Take it!",
    "Very informative.",
    "Best intro history lecture at Yale so far, and I'm a history major.",
    "Take it. Don't even think twice. (there is a lot of reading to do but you will enjoy everything and will learn SO much).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! Incredible professor and TFs. Wonderful, inspiring, captivating lectures on a subject that I personally knew very little about. The class focuses on teaching themes over specifics--you'll never have to memorize names or dates. I was in complete awe of Magaziner by the last lecture. Take home essay midterm and final, as well as two primary source papers and heavy reading: a lot of work, but totally worth it.",
    "Absolutely- great lecture on a fascinating history.",
    "This course provides a fascinating overview of the history of South Africa, from before the arrival of the first white settlers through the present day (although the course material really ends around 1994, with the first democratic general elections and the demise of apartheid). Professor Magaziner is an engrossing lecturer who speaks with energy, passion, and lyricism. The assignments differ from most other history lectures. There are no tests; instead, you write two short primary source papers (five pages) and two longer -- a midterm and final -- essays, of ten pages each. The course workload felt heavier than other history lectures, in part because of the hefty writing requirement and because there is a lot of assigned reading, but I really enjoyed not having to take a midterm or final exam (which meant no tedious memorization). In this way, the nature of the assignments reflected the perspective of the course; Prof. Magaziner wants you to understand the historical themes in South African history rather than get caught up memorizing names and dates, which I really appreciated.",
    "Take it if you need a rest of the world.",
    "This is a really good class. DO THE READINGS. The one thing that I would caution against is if you don't learn well through lectures. The readings are really good and interesting but are mainly just supplementary to the narrative explained through the lectures and you really need the lectures to piece it all together. Take this class :)",
    "AFST 335 is a fantastic course. The professor is a great lecturer and puts a ton of work in to make the course really good. There is alot of reading though. The course is more a history of race relations between whites and blacks in South Africa, while I don't feel like an expert on South Africa, I feel I learned alot the history of conflict between whites and blacks in South Africa. The class only talks about surrounding countries for one or two lectures."
