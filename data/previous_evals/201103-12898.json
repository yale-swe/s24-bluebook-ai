   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The course creates a window through which to both and discuss read some wonderful poetry and try your hand at the art form as well.",
    "Poets' Landscapes is a mix of reading American poetry and workshopping poems that you and your classmates have written. Workshopping is a joy - even for those who have not written poetry before it is a wonderful chance to improve your writing.",
    "or someone with an interest in poetry who may not make the time to explore such an interest otherwise, take it!",
    "About 10 minutes per week of reading, one midterm and one final paper of about ten pages each, weekly creative writing poetry assignments. A peaceful, enjoyable seminar with interesting material, doesn't ask too much of you. A definite take.",
    "This is a fun course if you like poetry. I recommend it to English majors looking for a different approach to reading and talking about poetry. It's fun to discuss poems with people who aren't English\/Lit majors. Also a great way to write poetry for credit if you don't have time for an all-out creative writing course.",
    "YES! Take this course if you are at all interested in a poetry writing workshop and place. This is a fantastic class.",
    "I would recommend taking Poet's Landscapes. The course requires weekly readings and a weekly writing assignment (poem) depending on the theme for the week, and there is also something of an emphasis on photography as related to poetry and landscapes. Professor Hayden is an excellent instructor. The only thing I would watch out for in particular are the paper assignments (2 for the semester) which come quickly and are sometimes vague in details. Get drafts in early for effective revision time. Otherwise, it was a very good course.",
    "For anyone interested in American Poetry, this class provides a great introduction to a number of great poets while allowing students to develop their own work through a series of writing assignments. While the amount of writing was extensive, I found myself looking forward to working on my poetry each week. I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in an introduction to poetry.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in poetry, want to be interested in poetry, want to write poetry, or want to approach landscape through poetry. It doesn't matter if you don't have experience (as long as you can get in the class). This was one of my favorite classes here! A lot of it depends on your classmates, and the class this semester was terrific."
