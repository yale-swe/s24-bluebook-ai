   "comments": [
    "SPAN 244 was a very poorly taught course. I did not feel that the quality of my writing improved -- instead, I grew more and more frustrated with the level of disorganization in the class. This class must be reformed to actually present students with a challenging but realistic approach to writing in Spanish.Professor Tortora is fairly unprofessional and VERY disorganized. She rarely returns assignments on time and is not an easy grader. She is a very nice woman and very flexible about deadlines, but she should not be teaching \"Writing in Spanish.\" Her classes were not very instructive at all.",
    "A Spanish writing course in which you read samples of letters, stories, and poetry and write your own letters, essays, creative texts, etc. Grading is based on your writing projects and a couple of midterms (which consist of analyzing texts and writing in-class essays).I'd recommend this course to a person who wants to improve his\/ her writing before taking a literature course in Spanish so that he\/ she knows how to write argumentatively in Spanish. It also helps in general with improving grammar and usage.",
    "No. In the end, I probably learned something, but not from the class. Only from getting help from friends\/tutors and doing a lot of writing. The class was a waste of time. The book was awful and the class was very poorly organized. It also was more work than I had expected. The peer reviews are unhelpful and a huge pain \u0096 they are short enough that you don\u0092t get any good feedback from your peers, but since they exist you have to deal with people being late with their assignments and being flaky. That said \u0096 I heard this class isn\u0092t even going to exist again.",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of writing and to have your classmates read and critique your writing, because that is basically what this course is. You do some readings of examples of the types of writing you are asked to do. The readings are hugely varied in term of authors and time periods so that is good. I honestly didn't find this course to be that great; it wasn't bad but a lot of the time I felt like I was doing busywork that wasn't improving my spanish too much. I think if you are willing to put a lot of time and effort into this course it will help your spanish improve, but if you just want to do the minimum amount of work to practice and keep up with the Spanish you already have, this course is not ideal for that.",
    "If you are a Spanish major or just want to ensure that you can write bilingually, then take this class.",
    "Writing Spanish is a course that focuses on polishing writing skills in the Spanish language. There are numerous essays and assignments which give students a chance to practice the writing techniques, grammatical structures, and various other skills that are taught in the classroom."
