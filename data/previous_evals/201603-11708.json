    "This course gave me the new opportunity to learn Spanish in an environment of students that all shared Spanish-speaking heritage. It provided a great opportunity for me to develop my confidence speaking Spanish conversationally and speak about professional\/academic concepts in Spanish.",
    "I improved my grammar, extended my vocabulary, and overall became more comfortable while speaking and writing."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "An important strength would be the opened interactive nature of the classroom. We got to share our own cultural experiences in Spanish also did creative projects outside in New Haven, such as a \"Photosafari\" allowing us to explore campus and define pictures we took in Spanish. I loved applying my knowledge into my own personal experiences and fields of my interest, and made me enjoy the class even more. If there was any weakness, it was caused strictly by the time constraints of the semester. We were provided optional grammar exercises in the USRP review book, but due to the fast-pace of the class it was easy to fall behind on those optional assignments, and the book was not used much.",
    "Strength: you are forced to engage in discourse in Spanish in ways that you often don't as a heritage speaker. Weakness: there is a wide range of level in the class, so much so that the class can be kind of annoying at times. Also, the work can be kind of \"busy work\" at times, while some aspects of my spanish that really need improving feel kind of neglected."

   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course for Spanish speaking students and provides a much better environment in my opinion than any normal language class. Instead of focusing purely on worksheets and grammar tests this class made my education and relationship with the Spanish language very personal, and I appreciate that greatly.",
    "Yes! Fantastic course for students who have the conversational skills but lack grammar and writing. You learn a lot and Professor Alexandrov is fantastic and really caters the class to the needs of the students",
    "Depends on their level of Spanish. I think I learned a lot, but I did feel frustrated often."
