   "comments": [
    "If you're considering taking it, I recommend taking a good look at the syllabus first. I went into it expecting to discuss current politics, but the class topics ended up being more theoretical. Also there is a lot of reading.",
    "PLSC 245 is an engaging introduction to the theories and policies that guide urban areas in the US. The first half of thecourse focuses on four urban \"frameworks\" and the second half of the class is structured around three urban \"policies.\" The reading list is manageable but comprehensive and the classes well led. The course consists of weekly reading responses, leading two seminars in the second half of the semester, and two essays.",
    "This class is a good amount of work, and is probably the most difficult class I've taken at Yale. Having said this, it is one of the best. If you are at all interested in city politics, take this, and you will think about the municipality totally differently. Horan is tough, but she will make you a better writer and thinker. I would especially recommend this class for someone who comes from a city.",
    "The class improves as the semester continues. Horan is exacting but her comments are helpful and her grading is not as harsh as the comments would make you believe. The weekly reading responses were helpful because they kept the conversation focused (a problem in other seminars). If you're interested in what political scientists think about the ways cities work and then comparing that to how they actually work, take this class.",
    "I would recommend the course, certainly. I might recommend Big Cities over this course, but that's just one person's opinion and I think it ultimately comes down to which syllabus you find more interesting. That said, I would certainly recommend a course with Horan. She is demanding (not overly so) and worth it.",
    "This class is really tough, but if you put the effort into it, it will be an incredible survey of urban political theory that touches on someof hte the theory and problems in forming public policy. Take this class i you are interested in cities\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is the most rigorous urban studies course offered in the Bluebook. However, Professor Horan is a really tough grader, and I'd only advise you to take the course if you're willing to accept a grade from an aont of effort that will earn you half a grade higher in any other political science or seminar course at Yale. The course teaches on why public policy isn't a solutuon to urban problems\u00e2\u0080\u0094 so don't neceasarily take it if you're just into discussing diffeent policy options.",
    "It's a great class if you do the reading and understand it. I would recommend it, it has changed my perspective on urban politics for the better.",
    "Urban Politics and Policy is a class that deals with the way people think about urban politics, and the effects and effectiveness of different policies in the city. Take this course if you are interested in matters of urban affairs, which you should be. Be prepared for a professor who does not take BS answers. The first few weeks can be a little too theoretical for some, so if you'd like a more hands on class with Horan I'd go with the Poverty course.",
    "I would say if you're a person who's very interested in urban political theory, this class is great for you. I wish we had spent more time on concrete issues because sometimes the theory parts just went over the heads of most of the students.",
    "The first half of the course is a look into urban political frameworks and the second half is a look into contemporary issues."
