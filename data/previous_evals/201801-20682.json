    "The course is very rigorous, but I think that is essential to improving in Chinese.",
    "Strengths: Wang lao shi Weaknesses: Lessons from the textbook were far easier than the lessons that Wang laoshi wrote herself",
    "Meeting every day means the vocabulary is always fresh in your mind, and also gives you a great chance to practice the words in context. On the other hand, the frequent vocabulary tests also demanded that you learn a large number of new words every day, and it often was hard to remember the words we had covered for midterm exams. Perhaps an increased emphasis on the projects and creative usages of words would help both increase class involvement as well as aid in the learning of new words."
