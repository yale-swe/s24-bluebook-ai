   "comments": [
    "This is a great introductory class to higher level French; many of the readings are really enjoyable and allow you to dive into French without feeling like you're struggling too much through the reading. The structure makes participation difficult sometimes; you have to be very assertive and understand everything really well before coming to class, which is often difficult. There's a fair amount of work for a 1 credit course, also.",
    "It is a good basic course to finalize grammar learning and read a lot of French books.",
    "This class will give you a solid review of grammar and vocabulary. The works we read were often more entertaining than not and the films were interesting, though often strange. If you put in the work and make an effort, you will get a good grade and be substantially better at French.",
    "A great class to practice your French and you get to read some really interesting books and watch funny movies. I would highly recommend this class, but be prepared for a lot of work!",
    "If you seriously care about French and seriously want to improve your skills in the language, take this class. There's a lot of work- there are a bunch of tests as well as papers and orals, not to mention a lot of reading and movie watching- but it WILL improve your French. Plus, the books and the movies are all really great. From my perspective, it was DEFINITELY worth it- so much so that I am going to take French 151 (a very similar course and the one that logically follows French 150) next semester.",
    "The course was a good review of complicated grammar points and taught me some useful vocabulary. However, I would have liked to read some more real literature in French instead of short stories.Madame Sherak was excellent at getting the class to engage in discussion of the texts and taught the grammar points very well. I highly recommend her.",
    "In FREN 150, you'll spend most class time discussing assigned books and films, though you'll also have grammar assignments and will be tested on those as well. It's a good class to practice and improve your French, but it carries a decent workload so be prepared to put in the effort.",
    "French 150 has a nice balance between grammar, study of films and texts, writing, and speaking.",
    "5 tests, 5 compositions, a couple plays, 2 novels, 3-4 films and a final. The syllabus is well-constructed with recurring themes for an interesting discussion over the course of the semester."
