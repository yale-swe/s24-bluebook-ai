    "Take it if Frame is still here!",
    "I'd recommend this class. It's pretty easy. You don't have to go to lecture to get the psets - just go to the peer tutors. That being said this will be completely foreign material to you. The exams are open-book so if you study and bring good notes you'll be fine. Professor Frame really wants everyone to do well in this class.",
    "Michael Frame is a wonderful professor and human, and this course is a very good one. It is by no means easy (there are high-level concepts and materials), but Frame has created a structure for the class that allows all of those who work hard to succeed; there are office hours, tutors, and notes online.There is one problem set per week, so the workload is manageable. (It is rather the ideas that are difficult to grasp.) If you would like a mathematical background on which to build, this isn't your class--it will not teach you calculus or algebra. But for a different kind of challenge, it's definitely worth taking. Some of the material presented in the lecture was also occasionally sort of tangential to the concepts at hand, but in many ways this material enhanced our understanding of the concepts.",
    "An painless QR with spiritual growth on the side. This is one of those classic Yale treasures. Join the movement.",
    "I would absolutely, wholeheartedly, and without any hesitation recommend this class to any person at Yale unless they are for some reason against having their lives changed in miraculous ways. The class is a pretty thorough introduction to what is a deep and growing field, and there is no better person to teach it than Professor Frame. Here is an attempt at describing him, although his brilliance defies words: mind-blowing, inspiring, passionate, compassionate, approachable, expert, exciting, devoted, astonishing, unreal, demigod, saint, expert, genius, one-of-a-kind, flawlessand impossibly humble. What is there to say? He is the real thingthe kind of professor you dream of or see in movies but never guess could actually exist. (In fact, there was one class when I literally felt like I was in the scene of a movie where a student has a life-changing epiphany thanks to the teacher.) He is SUCH an asset to the school (and world) and so genuinely inspiringnot only because he opens your mind to the beauty of math\/the field of fractals but because he encourages you to follow your own passions, whatever they are. In him you see a model of intellectual fulfillment, someone who has mastered and found joy in what they study. And he shares all this with you in the most self-sacrificing, almost irritatingly self-effacing way because he is truly unaware of how life-changing and of what a role model he is. Even if you hate math, it is impossible not to be engaged when someone like Professor Frame speaks so excitedly and knowledgeably about it. Take this class or any class with him, but this class if you can. Fractals are a joy to discover, and Professor Frame worked closely with Mandelbrot (who invented the field), so taking the class is kind of like taking theology with Moses, except better. At the middle of every class Professor Frame makes you laugh with jokes from \"garrisonkeeler@prairiehome.org\", and at the end of class he shares with you an inspiring or surprising anecdote, usually about Mandelbrot. Thus, you learn not only the practical math behind fractals and not only their applications but the history of the field from someone who has lived it. There is no better way to see the humanity in the subject. It's humbling. As Professor Frame once said, it makes you feel like a kid discovering the world again. I and many others cried during the last classout of joy for the experience and out of sadness that it was ending. Take it.",
    "I really loved this class. As a totally non-math-oriented person I was slightly worried about taking a class in fractal geometry. However the lectures were very interesting and I found the material genuinely fun. It does get a bit dense at times but it's a really great class to fulfill a QR requirement and tackle interesting material at the same time.",
    "Great class with a wonderful professor. You will look at beautiful, mind-blowing pictures... and actually understand the geometry behind them! Fun, easy class with an extremely inspirational professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as an interesting 5th credit but not if you want a very stimulating math course",
    "MATH 190 was a well-taught course: workload was not too intense (which was good) and the P-sets were helpful in contextualizing the material learned in lecture. The material was also interesting and definitely different from anything I have done before. And of course, Professor Frame is a sweetheart. He was always very helpful after class and told some pretty funny jokes. The course would not have been the same without him.",
    "Absolutely take this class. There's no \"ifs,\" no lingering debate or unresolved question. If you do not take this class or another of Professor Frame's, you are missing out on an absolute diamond of a man. This course, in particular, is a must-take; Fractal Geometry, beyond merely being an incredibly important and interesting nascent field in mathematics, is a Yale original. Not taking it would be like not seeing any animals on a trip to the zoo. More specifically: the class is interesting. Fractals are incredibly relevant in many modern technologies and unsolved mathematical problems, and knowledge of it will only help you. The class is incredibly philosophical. It involves many concepts and ideas found nowhere else in math curriculum. In that sense, it's a great class for non-math-minded students like myself who wanted mathematical thinking without the rigors of calculus. But let me be forthright and say that this is not a gut. It's mistaken for a gut because there's so little work throughout the semester and the actual computation needed to succeed is nothing beyond Algebra I or Algebra II. But the concepts and actual nuanced understandings of the material is quite challenging, and by the end only a few students will be able to admit honestly that they understand everything intellectually. Last, the midterm and final are open notes. It actually doesn't help you as much as you'd think, but it's still a great crutch. Overall, take the class because nothing is more inspiring than Michael Frame's personality, work ethic, and view on life. This class ought to be retitled \"Fractals and Philosophy\" and be a joint class between the Math and Philosophy departments. Really, it's that beautiful.",
    "After the midterm, the gap between the level of the work that we learn to do ourselves and the work that prof frame demonstrates to us in class becomes pretty large--which is not to say that it isn't fascinating. The class doesn't teach you how to think, but it's a fun and often worthwhile way of fulfilling QR",
    "Be careful that you don't let this class slide to the back of your priorities. That happened with me, and I am sad that it did, because there is a lot of beautiful mathematics that Frame does a good job of trying to lead you through. Ultimately grading in the class is fairly easy, and if you do the work you will do well. Good course, take it and do extra reading and there is a lot you can learn.",
    "Yes Fractals was fascinating. If not this, then take something else with Frame because he is the best!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a course with a light workload that you can miss for interviews \/ other events. The material personally was not very interesting and applicable, but class was straightforward. Expect to spend 1-2hrs \/ week on the problem sets and take a midterm and final, which is slightly harder than midterm. Having a chance to listen to Michael Frame speak was also a great experience.",
    "Fractals with Michael Frame was an interesting class, though sometimes, I felt like I was lost in the midst of problem-solving without quite understanding the larger picture. I would recommend this class for anyone interested conceptually in fractals - and I would especially recommend that you make an effor to speak to Frame after class or during office hours to really make the class a meaningful learning experience!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they are interested in taking a math course that is different from the traditional intro calculus classes. The workload is fair, and Professor Frame holds many office hours and is willing to help and answer any questions students have.",
    "it was fascinating, but I had a tough time reconciling the fascinating parts with the actual mathematics, the actual overlap was difficult to make.",
    "Good gut class, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone. It's not necessarily mathematically difficult but sometimes concepts are hard to understand. However, both the midterm and final are open book so that's great. Weekly psets were solved with the help of tutors and they don't take too much time. If you need QR, you should take this.",
    "Not as much of a gut as you might hope, but Michael Frame is inspirational.",
    "Great. Do it.",
    "It's fun, interesting, and not too difficult. Frame is great, and he really cares about you learning the material. I would recommend it, even if you don't need a QR credit.",
    "Fantastic course, more math-based than concept-oriented, but overall still enjoyed the class with it's many real world applications. Definitely recommend it.",
    "A slughtly more difficult gut than I expected, but pretty interesting and Michael Frame is AMAZING.",
    "Please please PLEASE take this class. It is amazing. For students of any skill level. If it's available, you should at least shop it and give yourself a chance to fall in love with Michael Frame. He's a huge reason of why this class is as good as it is. He genuinely cares about you, and his message is so important. Fractals is also just plain interesting. No matter what else you like, there will probably be something in that field that fractals can be applied to. It's so useful to know and fun to learn about. Definitely wholeheartedly recommend more than I have ever recommended any other class.",
    "The class is a good qr for non qr people, but the final and midterm were kind of hard, and the class get get weird when Frame talks about death.",
    "It was an absolute honor and privilege to take Fractal geometry from Michael Frame. He is a wonderful professor because of his ability to answer any complex question in a simple way. Frame was the first professor I had at Yale and now will be one of my last. It is awesome to think that we are learning about fractals like the Mandelbrot set from an individual ho worked with Mandelbrot for so many years.",
    "This class is a fairly manageable math course. Prof Frame has built up a comprehensive website with all his curriculum and teaching aids posted, so even if you miss a lecture you can easily go over the material again. The math can be quite interesting, but the harder math portions are only presented briefly and are not tested. Prof Frame was an engaging instructor and it felt exciting to be learning under the auspices of such a leading mathematician in a unique field. I really appreciated his willingness to answer questions. He was very approachable outside of class times. Oh, and his pirate jokes. I found it hard to keep track of the bigger picture that was the course narrative at times. Prof Frame made an effort to ease the transitions from otherwise seemingly disparate subtopics by consistently reviewing the previous week's material at the start of each class, but still I felt that helped me keep track of things in a linear sense, rather than help me understand the macro view of things. After reading such good reviews of the course I must admit I was a little disappointed with it. I think the main issue for me was with the learning style of this course: I personally found it hard to do (to stay engaged with) a math course in a large group lecture format, with little interaction.",
    "I would recommend Math 190, for people who are interested in taking an atypical math class.",
    "It's a great class if you're looking for a QR credit that's not going to kill you but still isn't a gut. You'll learn a lot of interesting material that you won't find anywhere else, and the weekly psets are always doable, especially if you go to office hours. And if nothing else, take it for Frame - he's insanely brilliant and incredibly kind, he really cares about his students, and even though he posts all the lecture material online its worth going to class just to listen to his stories.",
    "I would recommend it as a class whose subject is not very applicable to the real world but is still worth taking because Michael Frame is a very moving teacher.",
    "It was an awesome class! Very interesting course material, and you learn about more than just fractals! Michael Frame is a passionate professor and makes this a great course. His jokes and stories were great.",
    "Fractal Geometry explores different methods of creating and analyzing fractals. The course looks at many different occurrences of fractals from their occurrences in the patterns of plant growth to brownian motion found in the stock market. I would recommend this course to a student interested in a little looked at part of mathematics.",
    "The weekly problem sets are straightforward and the exam is open note, overall an easy class to do well in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's great for non math majors, yet it's still challenging. Frame is an amazing teacher who loves teaching fractals.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who is looking for a QR credit that requires relatively little work. Do not expect the material to be particularly applicable to anything practical. There is one problem set each week that takes about an hour to complete and there is a course website that is very helpful if you do not understand the material.",
    "I think this class is excellent if you want to learn about Fractals. I know a lot of people took it as a gut, and I think that might be a bad idea. Eventually the work got more difficult, and I'm not sure it was all that easy.",
    "Pretty good, but pretty confusing and you'll never use what you learn. I didn't dislike it, but given the choice to take it given what I know now I probably would have taken something else. I love Frame, but I don't know if that's enough reason to take the class because I could still have gone to his office hours.",
    "Fractals is one of those great Yale classes that everyone should take. Professor Frame is a wonderful teacher, and the subject matter is really interesting. It's definitely not the easiest class in the world, but the difficulty comes more from the challenging material than from the workload. There are weekly problem sets, but they're generally not too difficult, and there's a huge amount of material on the classesv2 page to help if you're confused. Overall-- definitely take this class! You'll never get another chance to learn about fractal geometry from one of the most important scholars in the field.",
    "I'd recommend it. It's a challenging but thought-provoking class that made me see mathematics in an entirely new way.",
    "An introduction to fractals",
    "This class was an easy QR credit that I didn't need, but wanted to take anyway. If you put some work, you'll most likely get an A. Frame is an incredible speaker at times and I felt like I got more out of that class than just knowledge about Fractals. Take the course if you need to or not. Just don't take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Take this course but only if you are serious about learning the concepts. Fractal geometry is incredible and interesting, but I recommend taking it as more than just a QR credit. If you really want this class to be worth your time you need to put effort into it.",
    "Definitely take this class! Fractals is interesting, if more algebra-heavy than I had originally thought it was going to be. If you're going to take the class, don't waste your time; go to the lectures! Professor Frame is a wonderful teacher, and the material is communicated much more clearly than on the website, though it can be a helpful source. Plus, then you'd miss all of his jokes and stories, which, in my opinion, were the real takeaways from the class.",
    "It was a very manageable course. You learn about fractals and about the history of then too.",
    "Absolutely recommended even for non-math majors. Totally manageable amount of work. Fair tests. And frame showed me an interesting field of math that I had never heard of before. Take this class for frame-- he is such a kind and brilliant man.",
    "An amazing course. I loved taking Fractal Geometry in my first semester at Yale. The concepts Michael Frame recounts are so advanced and fascinating, and yet me manages to teach at a very manageable pace, even for someone who might me completely unfamiliar with fractals at the beginning of the course. Michael Frame is a wonderful and engaging lecturer, and the speeches he gives on subjects outside of fractals are funny, powerful, and moving. I absolutely recommend this course. If you pay attention and the work, you will get a good grade, and will learn of a beautiful new way to mathematically interpret the Universe.",
    "Great class with interesting material but not to stressful workload.",
    "A good math course for non-math types, although it still requires a fair amount of work! Visit office hours and tutoring for help!",
    "I recommend it to anyone who does not want to take a traditional math course like calculus or statistics. Be prepared to review stuff and have your mind blown. But keep up with understanding the concepts!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!!! 100% recommend it! This is one of the best classes being offered at Yale and you don't want to miss out on it!",
    "Took this class to fulfill the QR requirement and if you're looking to do the same, this is a great class to do it with. Frame is a great professor and even if some of the things he discuss might seem a bit abstract, the problem sets are usually not that far-fetched. There are psets every week along with a mid-term and final. Both tests were a little tricky but he offers a lot of review and provides several practice tests. The tests are also open notes so you don't have to worry about memorizing a bunch of formulas or anything.",
    "Fractal Geometry is a thorough introduction to the basics of this relatively new field of study. If you are lucky enough to take this course with Professor Frame, please do it. He is an incredible man and it is an honor to learn from him.",
    "A disappointment of a class, because the subject matter is really interesting but all we do in class is go through example problems that show you how to mechanically answer questions you'll see on an exam, but don't really ensure that you truly \"get\" what fractals are - and I have a suspicion that it is impossible, because we wouldn't have enough background in geometry to understand. Fractals is low-commitment class that lives up to its reputation as a gut. Suitable for anyone who has a basic understanding of algebra. Many students do not attend lecture at all. Anyone who does not attend lecture should feel awful about it though because Frame is a Really Good Guy.",
    "It is a good introductory course to a not very well known branch of math. I would recommend it-- for people (like me) who are not particularly good at math, it provides an alternative that uses many of the same skills but is much more accessible.",
    "I think this is a rewarding class to take during your time here at Yale. Of course, it can be challenging, and you should put effort into the homework sets and the tests, but the course material is fascinating and eye opening. I would recommend this to humanities-oriented students only if they are willing to put time and effort into the class; it is not a \"gut,\" contrary to popular opinion.",
    "Such a good class. The material is fantastic--eye-opening in almost the literal sense of the world. It'll make you see things all around you differently. Professor Frame is hilarious, patient, kind, and an all-around incredible human being. You will have to study, but none of the material is incredibly difficult, and it's just a really joyful, refreshing class.",
    "A very fun and engaging math course that does not necessarily require high-level math skills. A great way to break up a rough schedule with an entertaining yet informative class on an apparently quite applicable type of mathematics.",
    "This class is great for those who want to fulfill distributional requirements\/are not STEM majors. The math is fairly comprehensible and the office hours\/tutoring hours are abundant. On average, I spent less than an hour on fractals a week (aside from midterms\/finals seasons). The homework is not intensive at all, but is enough to review the material. Overall, it's an easy course. Frame always reviews the previous lecture's material, which is great for reinforcing and clarifying main ideas. He really means well and it is clear that he cares about his students. It is also great to hear him talk about his experiences with Benoit Mandelbrot and fractals in general.",
    "I would recommend the course because I enjoyed it."
