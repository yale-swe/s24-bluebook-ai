    "YES YES!!! You get to dance in this class. It has definitely been the class that I feel like I've grown the most in. Although I've been dancing all my life, I feel like this class gave me a new appreciation for the art of dance. I learned to look at dance in a more intellectual way, and have developed more of an identity as a dancer.It is a FANTASTIC course and I highly recommend it.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. AMAZING. Cannot say enough good things about this course.1. You get to learn beautiful, challenging pieces.2. Emily Coates is the smartest, most devoted professor you will ever find.3. You get to sweat in class, and thus sweat for credit!4. You get to spend time with other smart students who care about dance and who care about analyzing it as a true art form.TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE AT ALL INTERESTED IN DANCE OR THEATER. It was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale. One word of warning--if you don't have strong ballet or modern technique to begin with, you may find it very challenging at first, but it is absolutely worth the challenge. Take the plunge and Emily will help smooth the transition.",
    "Take it. Do it. Do it. Seriously.",
    "This course was incredible. It was such an amazing experience to pair academic research and studio practice, and I felt that I fully grasped the complexity of TORELLI and TRIO A by the end of the course.It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to examine these works, using both in-depth research and kinesthetic awareness to frame our studies. Professor Emily Coates is a gem of the Theater Studies program - may you be lucky enough to study with her at least once in your college career!I highly recommend this class, and hope to see more like it in the future.",
    "Please take this! Whether you are a dancer or someone who just likes to move, you will love this class and Emily Coates. I did not take to post-modern dance as easily as some, but the methods Coates uses to break down a dance using readings and ideas of what era the dance was set in make it that much more significant to learn. You need to be prepared to be physically and mentally on for four hours a week. This can be difficult if you are really distracted or get ill, because it really stinks to have to sit out. There are 25 pages of writing, so you also should take that into account. This is not just a class for movement, it is for your academics as well.",
