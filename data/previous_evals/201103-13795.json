    "The University facilities were excellent. To improve the paper assignments if would be helpful to provide students with a sample paper that illustrates proper footnotes and image citations asreference. Time was wasted looking into what style was appropriate to use. Some students turned in undeveloped endnotes because of this lack of direction.",
    "I think the resources were adequate - no complaints.",
    "Yes.",
    "Excellent resources",
    "Resources were very good except for the library. Its lending policies do not allow for thorough research of materials. I can often find the same book that Haas will either not lend at all, or lend for only one day, available to check out from another school through Borrow Direct for a 2 month loan. It seems ridiculous that we can get books from another school for months that Haas will not let us have for more than a day. The $5\/day late fee is also much too high and exploitative of architecture students who need to reference the text, drawings, or images contained within for longer than 24 hours without having to constantly renew the material."
