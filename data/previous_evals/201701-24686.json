    "Thinking more critically about systems we may take for granted as musicians Reading more critically and efficiently, especially when the reading assignments are dense and long, but I may not have a lot of time to sit and fully go through every detail on the page.",
    "This class was one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken at Yale. I now have a much deeper understanding of the term \"musical instrument\" e.g. how they can be seen as gendered bodies. I have also gained valuable research skills, and finally learned how to use EndNote.",
    "Critical Organology presents a thought-provoking introduction to methods of everything from old organological thinking to the modern-day conception of how humans and instruments relate and affect one another. The course provides a brilliant means for tackling these concepts, even for those with no prior experience.",
    "A greater understanding of the modern academic landscape, and how to navigate through it."

   "comments": [
    "Many good strengths--it helps students think more critically, and I appreciated the fact that it required active engagement during discussions. All of the topics we covered in the class were also new points of view on instruments. I also appreciated that it brought not just thoughts from musicology but also thoughts from economic or scientific viewpoints. The diversity made it easier for me to connect more topics to music, and see how all of these seemingly different topics can be surprisingly intertwined. I think this also allowed for the diverse array of research topics all of the students came up with! No weaknesses-- this was a great course, and I'm sad to hear that it was the first and last time being offered at Yale.",
    "It is absolutely perfect the way it is I think!",
    "The strengths are many as suggested so far. The only weakness might have been the small class size (of course, also a clear strength in many ways; but diversity of perspective might improve with a few more people in the room.)"

    "Absolutely!",
    "I ABSOLUTELY recommend taking this class. The 6000-8000 word essay might be daunting at first but it is basically the main assessment in this class and we work on it throughout the semester. This class was one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken at Yale. I now have a much deeper understanding of the term \"musical instrument\" e.g. how they can be seen as gendered bodies or racialized bodies. I have also gained valuable research skills, and finally learned how to use EndNote.",
    "The interesyed musician should be forewarned that skimming is a necessary skill in completing the readings, so those who are reluctant to search for just the key points, more or less, might be cautioned against taking the course. Otherwise, of course, you should take it! The material is fascinating!",
    "Yes, but only a very particular type of student. The class was designed to discuss high class concepts of musicology and organology, which is not an immediately accessible or interesting field of study for those who are unfamiliar with it."
