    "This class gave me a more rigorous background for a lot of foundational chemistry ideas i.e. entropy, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, kinetics, etc. I don't anticipate this ever being useful to me, but it's just kind of cool to know.",
    "I was supposed to develop knowledge about thermodynamics and kinetics in this course, but it was presented in such a jumble that I don't think I retained any of it.",
    "A good understanding of basic thermodynamics and reaction kinetics.",
    "learnt more about physical chemistry - understood the underlying principles between some phenomena, such as multi-phase systems and boiling point depression and elevation",
    "Further insight into topics introduced in general chemistry, like exactly what a phase diagram shows and how the slopes of the lines in the phase diagram are determined. Also learned that more birds are killed every year by cats than wind turbines.",
    "Generally speaking, this course taught us about how and why molecules interact the way that they do.",
    "I developed my skills in entropy, phase changes, and atom excitation.",
    "Nothing. This course was a review of thermodynamics and general chemistry. Nothing new was learned, class was not necessary to go to, I could just skim the textbook.",
    "I guess I learned the basics of thermodynamics and phase equilibrium for physical chemistry.",
    "A lot of problem-solving skills",
    "This course provided a decent survey in some basic concepts of physical chemistry.",
    "Course basically shows where the things you learned in General Chemistry came from. Pretty cool, honestly. It shows a deeper, more fundamental layer of chemistry that gives a basis for many of the phenomena that you learn in previous years.",
    "Essentially, we learned the theory\/practice behind physical chemistry, which is required for the chemistry major.",
    "Physical chemistry knowledge was surely developed. Some logical thought was applied in a very appealing manner when treating rate laws.",
    "I learned a lot about physical chemistry. This course was really interesting as it looked at a lot of formulas and topics that you might have learned in general chemistry or high school chemistry, and greatly expands upon them. I really feel like I have a good understanding about how these formulas are derived and what they are fundamentally based on.",
    "A good overview of beginning physical chemistry.",
    "I developed a very thorough understanding of the mechanisms and mathematics behind Physical Chemistry. I learned some really cool chemistry concepts, some of which can be applied to daily life. Most importantly, I learned an attitude towards thinking about problems (especially those \"on the napkin\"-type problems) that will help me in future problem solving.",
    "This course covers a lot of thermodynamics, followed by some electrochemistry. Essentially the course covers the math and physical bases of a lot of phenomena that are explained in a general chemistry course.",
    "The class covered many, but not all, of the topics on the syllabus.",
    "I learned the basics of thermodynamic chemistry including state functions and phase diagrams. In addition, the class allowed one to practice problem-solving skills, especially in back-of-the-envelope style calculations more concerned with magnitude than the actual numeric answer. Problems were mathematical in nature, allowing one to practice and develop skills of algebra and applications of partial derivatives.",
    "I learned a lot definitely, but the course is primarily memorizing and not really deriving much. Maybe that might appeal to you, in which case this is a great class. Definitely learned a lot about chemistry though regardless.",
    "Breaking down general chemical processes with more math and more undstanding of how, why, and important deviations and expectations: in short, true chemical behavior, less summarized and taken for granted Entropy and Thermochem Thinking critically about how to solve a problem",
    "This course taught the funadmentals of Physical Chemistry. This is not the type of course you take for fun, you will most likely know what to expect if you're looking at this course. Thermodynamics, equilibrium, entropy, kinetics, etc.",
    "This class covered the beginning of physical chemistry, including thermodynamics, kinetics and a small dose of photochemistry. I found it interesting and the content explained some of the things I learned in general chemistry in a more in depth way and to a lesser extent helped explain some things from organic chemistry. I also saw how physics applied to chemistry, which was cool.",
    "A good overview of thermodynamics, equilibrium and some kinetics. Also how to write these new course evaluations - they are way too long.",
    "When this course was at its best, the material we learned explained phenomena we see in the world - like, what exactly about mixing two substances makes the freezing point lower?",
    "Knowledge: Gas laws and deviations from ideal behavior Internal energy, entropy, enthalpy, Gibbs Free Energy, Helmholtz Free Energy; focus was on internal energy, entropy and Gibbs Homogenous, binary and complicated mixtures and how they affect volume, pressure and the energies Temperature composition and Pressure composition diagrams (quite fascinating if you understand them) i.e. how different physical states of matter can emerge at different temperatures and pressures if you mix substances Rate laws, equilibria, derivations (very very basic\/below high school level) electrochemistry Skills: Chemistry modeling skills such as gas models, ionic interaction models \/ how to mathematically represent real-world observations and derivations (to a limited, basic extent; we didnt do any modeling but you definitely develop an appreciation for models on your own studying) Comfort with partial derivatives, manipulation of partial derivatives (didnt actually learn this because it wasnt taught well but tried), Eulers chain rule (a lot of this), some integration Estimating complicated real-world and eccentric quantities quickly, some physical intuition about physical quantities (only some) Conceptualizing complicated graphs and figures and their physical meanings Insights (nothing remarkable): All thermodynamic quantities are interrelated (intended lesson but not ultimately that evident) Most physical phenomena can be reasonably modelled mathematically",
    "Learned about entropy, enthalpy, Gibbs Free Energy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was supremely well-organized. This made it a million times less stressful, despite its difficulty. I loved how the lectures and HW followed the textbook, and that I had that resource to fall back on when I fell behind or couldn't attend lecture. The problem-based TA sessions were a big plus, and accessibility (by email + outside of class) was always good.",
    "This course has a lot of interesting material. However, it could be taught in a more engaging, structured manner that does not seem like just a bunch of thermodynamic derivations, but a cohesive, informative course. The problem sets of the course did not reflect material actually learned in class or what was seen on exams, which was very frustrating. The book used for the course is poorly written and causes more confusion than learning. All of these things put together make this course unsatisfying and frustrating.",
    "Could use more organization; professor had some mistakes in his notes that ended up on the board and that was confusing.",
    "Material is somewhat dry at times and not very in-depth, though that's just what physical chemistry is like. Sections were useful to review things that we learnt in class, and we had plenty of material (practice exams, answer keys to practice exams) to supplement learning, which was good.",
    "Strength: allowing students to bring an equation sheet to each exam emphasized conceptual understanding as well as problem-solving over rote memorization Weakness: material covered in class followed the textbook almost word-for-word, to the point that many students chose to read the textbook rather than attend lecture",
    "I thought the assessments were very fair though very time crunched on the midterms. It was helpful that the lecture stuck closely to the book because if I was confused about a topic I could read more on what was being talked about. A more consistently explicit outline of why we're learning things before we derive them is always helpful.",
    "This course could be improved with a focus on solving quantitative problems. The course was strong in covering conceptual material, but very weak in practical problem-solving.",
    "Get a new textbook.",
    "This was an incredibly boring class taught by Professor Schmuttenmaer, who lectured almost exactly out of the textbook. It made attending lecture worthless.",
    "It was helpful that the lectures followed the textbook so closely. All of the midterm exams were difficult to finish in the allotted amount of time.",
    "I felt that this course, although it provided a good survey of introductory physical chemistry courses, was unclear in certain respects. The textbook used for this class, Atkins, was unclear and very hard to understand. Although I would have liked to have used the textbook more, I was severely limited by how the information was presented, and was forced to rely solely on the professor and lectures. In addition, some topics of the course were covered in depth, while other received a summary glance, providing for a rather uneven distribution of time and learning.",
    "I still don't really know what \"physical chemistry\" is and I feel like thats kinda a problem",
    "strengths: understanding cool things that were not fully understood before weakness: covers too much material in too little time (although this entirely depends on the professor I have gathered). how to improve: skip the analysis of models that try to improve fundamental approximations by introducing more variables and parameters (but don't differ in analysis) - clever students should be able to apply these more esoteric equations themselves.",
    "I think this course is quite strong. The teaching was strong, the problems sets were challenging but possible, and the exams were fair. The textbook was usually quite good, but something the wording was very poor.",
    "Follows the textbook very thoroughly which is great. Negatives include little correlation between the homeworks and the test problems.",
    "Its strength lies in its comprehensive overview of concepts. I believe that we learned a great deal during the semester, and our professor was amazing at being able to cover it in great detail. One weakness may be that we \"jumped around\" topics a bit, but I understand that this is a consequence of this being an introduction to p. chem (we needed a global overview of the concepts).",
    "The course is fine but mostly all repeats of general chemistry. It makes it not that interesting if you have already taken similar courses.",
    "Excellent teaching and class notes (written on the board).",
    "The class could be improved by further planning by the professor. Often it seemed he was unprepared to lecture in the classroom. The topics were often taught directly from the book, leading to a dry and uninformative class",
    "The strength of the class was that it was reasonably well organized in the progression of topics and the material covered and expected to be learned in preparation for exams. However, the presentation of the material wasn't always the clearest between the textbook and the professor, which made studying some of the concepts a little more challenging. Overall, the class was good, and fairly standard for a chemistry class, but could be improved by a slower lecture pace and a clearer textbook.",
    "The tests were a bit long. I think they were fair, but it is difficult sometimes to do it all under time pressure.",
    "Its really hard and text book is dense and has so many typos. Is there a better one or edition? Still necessary, easy to miss something in lecture. Also, would be better to write some words on chalk board or have some slides, not all math, it was more easy to get lost when reviewing notes, and when lecturing goes fast, without slides. Also, better proofreading of exams would be nice, small changes and weird glitches, like the discrepancy between the 2 Electrochemical series was annoying to everyone (instructor included) but really took away from my exam time, on an exam focused class. Happened on each exam :(",
    "The actual structure of the course was fine. Weekly PSets, sections with reviews, and 3 midterms with a final. This worked well.",
    "The class is very thorough but moves slowly. I would have liked to cover more content but I do appreciate that everything was taught so in depth. Perhaps some of the math could have been left out (it's easy to follow in the book). The course was also good because it covered examples in current chemistry and had demonstrations.",
    "Lectures were engaging and fun and covered the content well. However we could have gone faster; the course did not get as far as we should have (or to the more interesting topics near the end), instead quite a number of lectures were spent going over things already done in gen chem.",
    "The very last day of class, covering Marcus theory, either should have been left off or some other topic should have been removed to give more time. The electron transfer stuff from the second-to-last lecture was demonstrated and explained (and fascinating) but Prof. Schmuttenmaer flew through the last lecture with little regard for whether the students understood what was being explained. The grading of problem sets was weird in this class. Given that they were where we spend the majority of our time and effort and also where the majority of actually learning the material happened, why were they worth so little?",
    "Lecture closely followed the textbook, which was complimented well by the helpful discussion section. I appreciated being able to review by reading the textbook, as well as the very clear organization of notes and topics, which is lacking in other chemistry courses. Tests were very fair and always on material presented in class. Professor Schmuttenmaer is super enthusiastic and engaging; I enjoyed his demos and lecture style.",
    "Strengths: Professor Sch. is intelligent and a decent lecturer, and office hours can be quite helpful if you find the time. He always has some humor to add in class and often tries to do fun experimental demonstrations (and even test you on them) to enrich the class On balance, the material is limited and never feels overwhelming. If you study on some days during the breaks and\/or keep up in other ways by reading regularly, it is unlikely that you will fall behind Despite the evident flaws (below), the exams are always fair and you have decent opportunities to improve\/keep up a high grade The class lectures closely follow the book with only occasional deviations Weekly worksheets in the sections are quite helpful for additional practice and section never feels like a waste of time. In particular, if you know the material relevant to the week and\/or have prepared just a bit, section can help you keep up and do well Weaknesses: The lectures are still quite boring and tedious. Firstly, despite the fact that Professor Sch. Writes everything down (apparently to pace himself), he still moves too fast quite often. After a few sections, he waits 1 second for any questions and moves on even though it is clear that people do have questions and are confused on a broader sense. Secondly, the lecture feels like a hodgepodge of mathematical equations and relations rather than scientific analysis\/chemical logic. After every lecture, I had to ask so what? because the physical significance of a lot of the math was not made clear. Third, the timing was a bit poorly allocated with the class really speeding up toward the end and harder concepts receiving much less time than easy topics like ideal gases. Fourth, education research continues to show that true education is only effective if it is interactive to some extent. Professor Sch.s lectures are too one-way (much like most lectures in the Chemistry department) and dont necessarily incentivize\/welcome attendance The grading structure is flawed. The problem sets are a pointless 5% of the grade even though they had ~10 questions by the end and ate up a time that was disproportionate to their value -> either shorten the problem sets or make them more important. Too much value is placed on the exams and the entire point of having 3 midterms is nullified by the fact that each exam actually matters so much. There is a rather random 5% assigned to section and we were told that not everyone can get the full grade of 5%, which felt like we were being pit against each other to compete for the 5%. Some of the content needs to be taught much better than it was. A ridiculously large portion of the final exam was dedicated to Maxwell relations but not enough time in class or section was spent on explaining how to prove those. On the surface, they felt like basic mathematical manipulation but we really needed more practice (not present in the book either or in the problem sets). In general, the physical significance of the content should be conveyed more actively rather than just the forced math In general, the only way to understand some of the harder course material was to go to office hours for me. The TA and the peer tutor didnt really know what was going on. When questions became specific and conceptual, I felt fairly lost. A lot of people with a superficial understanding managed to do well because you only needed to do well at taking the exams and the exams had specific kinds of questions",
    "Unclear what students were supposed to be learning most of the time, disorganized. Textbook also unhelpful, full of typos.",
    "I wish there were copies of the textbook on hold at CSSSI because it was an expensive book that wasn't worth it; I ended up consulting the Zumdahl and McQuarrie textbooks as well. It did help that lectures followed the textbook's order of contents, but I wish the transitions between subsections were clearer and that we had stopped between chapters to see how previous content connected to the next topic."

    "I thought this was a really well-done class. It's not the most exciting material and honestly, it never will be, but I found Prof. Schmuttenmaer to be very clear in his explanations, and his enthusiasm and quirkiness was charming. There's not a whole lot of work: problems sets come largely from the book and are worth only 5%, and the rest comes from exams, which are fair but long. The average tended to be higher than in my other chemistry classes, which can be a good or bad thing. I would recommend this class, especially if Scmhuttenmaer is teaching it.",
    "Take it if you require a not-too-difficult SC\/QR credit or need it for your major.",
    "This course was a basic one in physical chemistry that introduced various topics in a clear manner and allowed for application of concepts to new problems. Was overall well taught by Professor Schmuttenmaer.",
    "Most students who take this class are taking it because they have to. Although I am not particularly interested in physical chemistry as a topic itself, generally speaking this was a good course.",
    "You should take this class if your future career is in any way related to chemistry. The material is fairly simple, but important to know.",
    "Yes take it, the professor is awesome and its interesting.",
    "I would not. I think if a student really wanted to learn what this class got into that everything is either in General Chemistry or Thermodynamics which, especially thermodynamics, are more comprehensive courses.",
    "No, it's incredibly boring. You might as well read the textbook on your own - however this textbook, \"Physical Chemistry\" by Atkins, was TERRIBLE!!!!! The book was filled with typos and horrible sentences. This textbook made it more difficult than it needed to be to learn the material. USE A DIFFERENT TEXTBOOK - -- THIS ONE HAS ERRORS, CONFUSING SENTENCES, GRAMMATICAL MISTAKES, AND A DISCOMBOBULATING LAYOUT. DON'T MAKE STUDENTS PAY $100+ FOR IT!",
    "This course provided a good overview of some basic physical chemistry concepts. It is a decent introductory chemistry course, and I would not recommend it be taken on interest alone.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to. Honestly, who \"shops\" Pchem? If you do, you're probably either doing it ironically, or trying to decide whether you should take it this year, or the next. With that said, Prof. Schmuttenmaer does a good job of teaching the often difficult and not-always-intuitive material, and this really is a cool course. I'm just afraid for next semester.",
    "If you love chemistry and\/or are a chemistry major, then you should take this course. It's definitely difficult, but you CAN do it and survive! You will have to do a lot of self-teaching from the book with Schmuttenmaer.",
    "Yes take this course. I learned so much in this class.",
    "After a full semester, I still don't really know what \"physical chemistry\" is \\_()_\/ (aka probably not the best use of your time; take only if you have to)",
    "If you're taking it you most likely have to; however, if you don't then I would definitely recommend auditing it, in which case, it would be a good audit.",
    "I think this course is great for anyone looking to learn more about chemistry. For me, it was a refreshing, quantitate look after a year of organic chemistry. There isn't anything wrong with organic chemistry, but physical chemistry was amazing as it really felt like I learned about why certain topics work the way they do.",
    "Yes! Schm. is a very good and funny professor. It's a hard class, but I enjoyed it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Although problem sets were often difficult, sections and office hours really helped me get through them. Also, there was a lot of focus on applying the concepts to real life. Coming from a non-Chemistry major like me, that was very much appreciated!",
    "Take this class if you need it for your major. If not there is no reason to.",
    "You cover a lot of thermodynamics in this course, and some other smaller topics. Pchem is made out to be a tough scary subject, but if you take diligent notes from class notes written on the chalkboard (with Professor Schmuttenmaer), and review them thoroughly, you can do well on exams and homeworks in a straightforward way. Nevertheless, the material is without a doubt challenging, more so because of the concepts that are hard to grasp; but applying the equations that explain phenomena is relatively straightforward and easy. Professor Schmuttenmaer is a good lecturer and does a good job of explaining concepts, equations, and derivations. As an MB&B major who considered the CHEM 328, I am glad I took this version which was more straightforward (and rigorous), based on things heard about the bio version of pchem. The exams are straightforward, but still challenge your understanding of the material, and the homeworks were mostly questions taken from the textbook.",
    "This course is incredibly informative about physical chemistry.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student in the major as the material was largely from the textbook. The class was a general introduction into physical chemistry, including thermodynamics and other miscellaneous topics, and was relatively fair in workload and material. The textbook can be a challenge to understand at times as certain passages and sections were written poorly, but overall in combination with the class the material was presented fairly well and it was clear which sections were expected to be known for exams, which lessened the stress of studying significantly. This is a fairly standard chemistry class, although it lacks a drop option for exams like many other chemistry classes, and if a student has taken chem classes before then the class should be manageable for them.",
    "lol ok one thing to do in this class is to not study the night before. I would recommend this though as a good science class. It is a good time. Prof is chill. Life is good.",
    "Definitely shop, even if MB&B major. It's more organized than the Bio version, and clear direction. Professor Schmuttenmaer is fair and a funny lecturer - his humor is subtle but great. It's really hard, especially midterm 2-3 material. Make sure you read the text book, or you will be lost come exam time, while you review.",
    "You know if you have to take this. I haven't takent the biology equivalent PChem, so I can't comment on which is better, but if you're a Chem major you're going to be taking this.",
    "I would recommend this class because I found it very interesting and I learned a lot but the work was definitely still manageable. However there are chemistry prereqs and I think taking physics and multivariable calculus would also be helpful. I think most students only take it if they have to, but I really enjoyed it.",
    "A solid overview of first semester physical chemistry; Schmuttenmaer was a great lecturer and never found it a chore to get up science hill at 9am. Demonstrations were fun as well. Problem sets are tedious and only 5% of your grade, and also not very similar to exam problems (which is admittedly justifiable since they emphasise different things and I don't quite get the complaining others have about it). Not as challenging as it could have been - lots of review of gen chem - but the curve is hard (the class is entirely chem, chem engineering, MB&B and math majors so good luck). And in the end I still never understood Maxwell relations. But overall still better than 328 and previous iterations of the course (shopped this and 328 last year and they were both awful), so take this one. It's actually pretty fun.",
    "Prof. Schmuttenmaer is a pretty good PChem professor: his lectures are understandable, if a little fast-moving, and humorous. If you're looking to take this course, you won't go wrong taking it when he's teaching it. Find other people in the class to work with on the problem sets!",
    "The Chemistry department needs serious work in terms of their teaching. This course is one of the better ones luckily. Take it with Professor Sch. if you can. Wouldnt recommend taking unless youre Chemistry\/Chem Engineering. You honestly dont learn particularly insightful things, which is tragic. Even if there is something very insightful, it wasnt hammered home well enough.
