    "I really enjoyed the independence my preceptor allowed me to have during the course of the semester. I also liked how the project that was given to me was one that I wanted to do and one that my preceptor needed help on. It made the overall process very rewarding and I learned a lot.",
    "very helpful (real world) skills learned",
    "Fabulous experience.",
    "Practicum is what you make of it. It feels a little silly to be volunteering thousands of dollars worth of your time consulting on a problem while paying Yale $3,900 for academic credit for doing so AND having to keep a time log and write a book report at the end, but it's better than most of the classes available at YSPH.",

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is a great instructor\/ advisor for this course. She gave me advice and guidance when needed and was very accessible and gave good feedback.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch was good. She encouraged discussion. I learnt from my fellow students. I found the experiences of the students to be very variable. Some were MD's\/seniors who seemed to be in charge of their own projects; others were more junior and seemed not to have much direction from their preceptors in various projects. I am not sure that I learned a lot about how to manage a project, or what pitfalls to avoid at a general level. I think this practicum might benefit from 1-2 lectures at the outset on project management, so that one could write up one's progress along the way, and also meet more structured goals."

    "Practicum is what you make of it. I highly recommend networking hard outside of YSPH channels to find a problem that connects with you. You're going to be giving away thousands of dollars worth of your time while paying Yale thousands of dollars in tuition for the pleasure of doing so. You'll be required to log your time and write up a report that may differ from your deliverable to your preceptor, which will likely be a significant annoyance. It's critical that the project you work on be meaningful to you and help you make decisions about where to go after graduation.",
    "Check with previous students how they chose their project sites. There seems to be extreme variability in the level of interest\/support\/involvement depending on the site."
