    "The BME seminar is not like any of the other classes you take in the major. Once a week you meet and hear from one or two BME professors about their research so that you can ask questions and find a lab for your senior project if you haven't already done so. The class work consisted of two 3 page lit. reviews for a grade and two oral presentations for negative credit. For the final we had to turn in a 6.5 page grant for a project we proposed. Most people based it off their work in the lab. Overall, it is a pretty chill class and shouldn't be too stressful.",
    "Awesome overview of different aspects of research going on in BME. Great lectures straight from the professors at the front of the field.",
    "You meet once a week to listen to two presentations by faculty members doing research in biomedical engineering. These presentations are interesting for the most part, though the presentation skills of the presenters vary greatly. You actually do a lot of writing in this course, though apparently the work load goes down every year. When I took it, we had to do two 3-page literature reviews on a presented topic. For a term-project, we had a 6.5 page grant proposal for novel research. Then there were two 1 page peer reviews. All writing was single-spaced. Take it for interesting presentations, but you have no choice if you're a BME major. Listen to the critiques provided by Prof. Papademetris, and make sure you adhere to the strict formatting requirements for the papers.",
    "You get to hear all the interesting things that professors in the department are doing. And then you propose a novel project, but with enough time and feedback to make it worthwhile, unlike in 351.",
    "BME requirement.",
    "A fairly fun class in which you write a few literature review papers and attend weekly talks by Yale BME professors. Very easy going and nothing to stress about. Fun overall. Will help you prepare for your senior project quite nicely.",
    "You have to take it anyway if you are a BME major. If you are not BME, but you are interested in learning about all the BME research going on on campus then ask to take it. You will have a blast.",
    "recommended, but probably because you have to take it anyway",
    "This course was a good summary for the biomedical engineering department and gave us practice writing papers in a grant format. I would recommend this class to other BME students because it is required for the major."
