   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in the anthropology of health disparities, inequality in America, and (intersecting) issues of gender and race. I had the chance to read many thought-provoking texts that changed how I understand our country and the experiences of people who live very different lives than I do, and face different challenges and inequalities. Class discussions were lively and though the seminar was large, everyone was engaged and brought different and interesting perspectives. Assignments were not onerous but helped me to engage more with the texts. Marcia is a great professor - really smart and kind.",
    "A lot of hard work but nevertheless a rewarding class if you keep up with all the readings.",
    "I loved this course! The themes explored are so powerful and the books chosen do a great job presenting it. A lot of work reading, but not much work on the writing side. The discussions were very well structured - each person takes a turn leading the seminar and Marcia does a great job facilitating.",
    "A LOT of work, but very engaging if you like the topic! The themes and anthropological theories become pretty repetitive, though (structural violence, habitus, motherhood).",
    "I loved the class. If you are going to take it prepare yourself for the reading. It is literally a book a week with no breaks and she says upfront that she expects students to do the reading and throughly.",
    "Intersectionality & Women's Health was wonderful. The reading list is great, and it seems totally apt that Marcia describes the class as a \"feminist reading group.\" The format is student-led seminars, and Marcia gives really valuable input into everything we read. She's great, and feminist anthropology is really great. If the title of the class appeals to you, there's a really great chance this may become one of the best classes you've taken at Yale. It was for me!",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time on reading and for the discussion to not necessarily reward that.",
    "You read a book a week on any topic ranging from meth use in the suburbs to HIV among black teenagers in New Haven. One student presents on the book and writes up discussion questions per week and then the class focuses on answering these in a very round about and complex way. Most of the topics discussed focus on the intersections of race, gender, and class. Book critiques are the main assignments of the class.",
    "Totally recommend",
    "If you care about women and you like awesome feminist books, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a ton of reading, but SO SO worth it. Great discussions, great food, lots of love and talk about how to improve the world. Do it, and you won't regret it. Unfortunately, I'm not sure whether she's teaching it again soon...",
    "TAKE THIS. It was great. It was eye-opening. You could relate to this course from probably any angle. Not all of the books we read were ethnographies, so it is very approachable to someone who has taken no anthro classes but is still very interested in the topic."
