   "comments": [
    "Take only if you have to: you will learn nothing conceptually and do lots of tedious math. The midterm was absurdly difficult with a generous curve, to the point where answering 10% of the exam correctly was a B.",
    "Do not take the course unless you have to and unless you know the professor is really good.",
    "If you have to take it, then take it. Not the most exciting course, but you should know these things as an econ major.",
    "The WORST class at Yale.",
    "Yes; despite certain aspects of the course not being completely ideal, it is still a lot of good information to know for anyone that is interested in getting involved in economics.",
    "Interesting class, but only take if required",
    "Decent class and essential for the economics major. The workload is pretty heavy, the problem sets are difficult, and the course involves a lot of studying, but doable overall.",
    "Don't take this class for fun. You're taking ECON 121 because you absolutely have to - it's a required course for quite a few majors. And if that's the case, do anything and everything you can to NOT take it with Professor Neeman. There's a reason, of the 10% of the class that remained in lecture by the end of the semester, not a single person clapped. Also, find a great TF and go to section. You'll learn far more in an hour of section once per week than in lecture twice per week.",
    "The material is interesting if you like microeconomics, but the class is hard. I'm pretty sure people only take this as a requirement...if you need to take it, it will be fine and there will be a massive curve.",
    "If you can, do not take this class with Professor Neeman. Doesn't teach material that students would benefit from learning. I like the math in Microeconomics, but relied on myself and the TAs to learn the material.",
    "Absolutely no reason to take this class if you don't need it. Take it Cr\/D if you're in a major that allows you to do that. Really boring; just calculus applied to intro micro. The curve is great in the spring though.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is fundamental to understanding how economics works. But make sure you have a good grasp on the math concepts (preferably having taken MATH 120) first.",
    "If you want to major in ECON then you have to take it. Otherwise don't take it. It is pretty boring.",
    "Not a great class. I didn't get that much out of the class, partly because I don't think it was taught well. Also just a dry subject. I would only take if necessary for major.",
    "Do not take this class. Avoid professor Neeman at all costs. Considering how this class went this semester, you might as well have taken it online since you're going to be self-teaching yourself all the material anyways. Horrible experience. Horrible class. The pinnacle of disappointment at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not have to take it. I came into this class considering an econ major, and came out of it never wanting to take another econ class. If you really love econ and are sure that's what you want to do, then you're going to have to take this required course. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs. You'll come out of the class with a fine grade, and the course is actually very little work, but (if you're like me) the feeling of knowing absolutely nothing on a pset or a test question is not worth the outcome. The problem sets were on material that was barely covered in lecture, and we were expected to somehow understand them through intuition. The tests worked similarly, and unsurprisingly the curve was astronomical. This class was incredibly frustrating, both personally, and ethically.",
    "Only take it if you need it for the major. It is a very difficult class.... one of the hardest econ courses I have ever taken.",
    "ECON 121 is very similar to 115, just more calculus. It was required for my major, but otherwise I would have not taken it. The PSets are pretty straightforward, but Prof. Neeman's exams (in particular the midterm) were a bit hard, as they test your understanding of concepts and do not look similar to the PSets.",
    "A multi-year course condensed into a single semester by the econ department. The math is just derivatives and algebra so it's easy to zone out of the class, but to really do well you'll need to grasp the economic intuitions behind the scenarios presented, which is difficult to do because you spend at most two lectures on any one thing, some of which deserve their own class.. Depending on who's teaching it the exams could be easy or difficult - with Samuelson last year the two midterms were simple and the final really hard; this semester the midterm was tear-inducing and the final was manageable.",
    "Has the potential to be a cool class, but it was so poorly taught. Do not take with Neeman.",
    "Terrible",
    "I would recommend this only if you are an economics major, in which case you have no real choice.",
    "A total disappointment overall, but a required one nonetheless. Neeman was an incredibly confusing lecturer. Everything was unclear because we used Professor Samuelson's slides, which have intentional gaps in them to be filled in by the lecturer -- except Neeman didn't do this. He is a good guy, but couldn't convey any information in a clear manner. Attendance in lecture plummeted throughout the semester and I kept going because I hoped lectures would get better - no such luck. We definitely need a better professor for this class next time it's taught -- maybe they should just have Professor Samuelson teach it.",
    "Very hard and unclear lectures, unreal exams and problem sets, especially if you're not a math person; quite a painful class.",
    "Yes",
    "The way ECON 121 was taught under Zvika is very complex. Overall, it was the in-depth mathematical explanations of many topics learned in intro micro. If a student was interested in this advanced math, I would recommend the course. I would recommend taking the course pass-fail if possible.",
    "ECON 121 is a rigorous course in microeconomics, and I would only recommend it to someone with a strong background in math and econ and pursuing one of those majors.",
    "You gotta, but Zvika's the worst",
    "Typical econ lecture. You take it if you need it for your major (though a seminar is better), you stay far away if you can. Google and the book are far more useful than attending class. The second half post-midterm is easier than the first. The problem sets are too damn long. This semester they were completion grades but I'm not sure that's always the case. Honestly whatever. You'll get through it, the curve will probably give you a B or better, you'll have the req under your belt, and then you'll go on to other classes where you actually learn things.",
    "yes",
    "I would not recommend it unless it is a requirement.",
    "Very difficult, don't take it unless you have to.",
    "It's a required course; take it, suffer through it, and get out. The midterm was particularly tough, but the final was fine.",
    "I really liked intermediate micro. I felt like the course while difficult, really challenged me to think. The problem sets and exams were very well written. They showed students how the principles learned in class can be applied to the real world. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Great course on micro, you lol like it if you like calculus.",
    "You have to do it, so deal with it.",
    "Take it part of the major",
    "A warning -- don't take this class with Zvika Neeman. He is a horrific professor. I understand that he is a visiting professor so hopefully future Yalies won't have to endure a class taught by him, but I'm disappointed in the Economics department for letting their core course be taught the way it was this semester. 1. There was no effort put into teaching the course. He used the slides from the previous semester and the next slide was as much a surprise to the professor as to the students. This is why I stopped going to lecture long before spring break. 2. The exams were crazy. The midterm was much much too hard compared to previous years and the raw grades of the class should reflect this. He tried to make the final easy but ended up making it impossible to understand what he wanted us to answer -- I can't imagine how he was allowed to set these exams, which together made up 80% of our grade. I didn't feel like anything I learned from class was tested in the exam, instead it was a game of guessing what Prof. Neeman wanted us to answer. The only things I learnt from this class were through the problem sets and the TA sessions, both of which Prof. Neeman had nothing to do with. This was the worst class I've taken at Yale, and a waste of one of 36 credits. I'm rethinking my decision to study Economics now. If you think this is because I was weeded out by the hard math -- that's not true, I'm sure I did well in the class and loved Intermediate Macro with Professor Peters. I hope this class is taught better next term, and if you're taking it for the major, take it with Samuelson (I've heard the course is hard but taught well).",
    "Take it because you have to, take it in the spring though (curve is easier).",
    "differential calculus",
    "Econ 121 is a frustrating, long process. The theory is cool, but it is presented in a way that is hard to ever grasp or feel confident with.",
    "Hard, take it with the right prof and choose a good TA. Material is challenging but if you ask questions and make the effort it should be manageable.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO AND WHEN YOU DO BEWARE",
    "If you are an econ major you have to take this course. It is definitely manageable, but I would look for more interesting classes if you can take a different course",
    "Thought the material was p difficult and the exams were ridiculously hard for no reason.",
    "I would not recommend it. Boring and does not convey information in a way that sticks with you",
    "Don't take. Econ 121 strangles you with boredom, and you will die."
