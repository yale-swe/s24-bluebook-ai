    "Intersectionality and Women's Health is a very reading intensive course, but the books each brought a valuable perspective to the discourse on anthropology and women's health. The structure of the course was wonderful, and I felt that I had many great discussions in the class.",
    "This class is fantastic - great professor and interesting discussions about very important and relevant topics. We had a fun classroom dynamic that I'm sure Professor Inhorn would replicate. The work isn't bad - two short (4-page) book reviews (you get to pick the books to review from the 10 you read) and a longer (15-page) comparative review, so it's very doable. The class will open your eyes to issues you hadn't thought about before - I know inspired my interest in policy related to women's health.",
    "Take it if you want to engage with these issues, and do not take it if you have acasual interest. You will not be happy",
    "This is a great course if you're interested in women's health in this country. It focuses on the lives of poor minority women, not just their health. You have two short book reviews, a class presentation where you lead the discussion one week, and a longer comparative book review as your final paper. Marcia focuses less on grades and more on the topics discussed so its a low stress environment where you can really focus on what we're learning. You'll do fine if you read and take the time to write good reviews, this isnt a tough seminar at all. It is a long one, though. Its form 9-12 on thursday so if you're not a morning person or dont have an attention span that lasts that long, this might not be the seminar for you.",
    "I would recommend it a hundred-times over! This class would be especially good for students in anthropology, sociology, public health, or public policy. It thoroughly covered the theory behind intersectionality, which is a concept that can be broadly applied to almost any subject for the rest of your academic career, then used a selection of excellent health ethnographies to demonstrate how intersecting axes of oppression affect the lives and health experiences of women in many different environments. Prof. Inhorn is one of the best professors I've had at Yale and she treats the class like a \"feminist reading group\" which makes every three-hour seminar feel shorter than the majority of my 50 minute lectures.",
    "Yes. The books were worth reading and interesting, the assignments were not overwhelming, and the book-review style of the papers was something I hadn't encountered yet at Yale and is a worthwhile skill to have."
