    "You're probably looking at this because you want a SC credit. Do this one. It's pretty good. I heard if you do ASTR135 over this, you will sorely regret it.",
    "Astro 120 is a fantastic class for non-science majors who have always hated science in high school and before. It's new, it's interesting, it's not too hard, and Professor Kenney makes everything fun. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "If they need the science credit, sure.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Sort of easy, but ultimately because of the QRs, a little frustrating.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone looking for a QR or a science credit. The teacher is fantastic and the work is doable. However, be aware that the work can be difficult and the weekly problem sets always took me at least an hour to complete.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Professor Kenney is great and the subject matter is really interesting (black holes, supernovae, relativity), but also explained thoroughly. I feel like I have learned many things about how our universe works and come away with a deep appreciation for the subject of astronomy as a whole.",
    "Solid class for getting a science credit, not too tough. Prof is funny.",
    "This is not a gut class. It is interesting, but conceptually difficult and is essentially a physics class. You have to keep up with the readings and pay attention in class and seek out help on the problem sets which are pretty hard. I learned a lot though and it is good for non-science people looking for a science or QR.",
    "This is a good class for a science credit. You learn a lot about the universe, and the professor is very engaging. The work load is ok and as long as you do everything it is not too hard.",
    "this is a great class to take if you are genuinely interested in the material. the work is not too difficult, but it is also not a gut as many people believe.prof kenney is amusing, and keeps things interesting.there is a lot of opportunity to keep your grade high.",
    "This class includes very interesting topics. The problem sets are sometimes a pain, but it is a good science or math credit. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "astro for dummies :)",
    "ASTR120 is a great introductory class for those who are neither mathematically inclined nor know anything about astronomy. The problem sets are easy (many people get 100s on them), and I found that because I wasn't overwhelmed by math, I could focus on concepts. The class is at first fast-paced, but after the midterm, the concepts get a little more difficult and Professor Kenney slows down. I really enjoyed this class. It would be easy to space out and Facebook your way through it, but Professor Kenney is a wonderfully entertaining professor, and his lectures are thoroughly enjoyable. However, those who've already taken an astronomy class or anyone who is looking for something mathematically rigorous will be bored. I, however, having never took an astronomy class, learned a lot.",
    "Take Astro 120. It can be difficult at times, but section is really helpful and the material is really interesting. You may get really frustrated at some of the concepts, but the course forces you to really think about things. I've given a lot more thought to the universe and what it means and the bigger picture of life. Not a total gut. It gets better as the year goes on, but it's so worth taking to get either QR or Science and Professor Kenney is amazing.",
    "Take the class, learn some science, remember that you actually know some math.",
    "Great SC credit, problem sets aren't too bad, midterm and final are pretty straightforward, a lot of plug-n-chug type of math.",
    "I would recommend astro 120 to a student who is willing to do math for a relatively easy science course that does not seem to lead anywhere. In other words, if you are not a science major and need a science credit, this may be the class for you. If however, you are not good at math, take another class instead.",
    "Whatever anyone tells you, this class is NOT a gut. Of course, it wasn't impossible (far from it) but you MUST pay attention in lecture, you MUST attend section, and you MUST do well on problem sets to make this class worthwhile. That said, this is the only class I've ever taken in my life that consistently blows my mind. The material just kept me coming back, and although I'm far from being a science major, ASTRO120 is just a great class. I highly recommend it. The math is pretty darn simple (just lots of algebra, no calc derivatives or anything like that). Section will help you tremendously if you are at all unsure of your ability in the class: you basically go over all the main topics on the pset for that week. Do your best to show up for Arthur's section since he is by far and away the best TA. Clear, precise, and extremely courteous, he knows exactly what he's doing and what's best for you. Prof.Kenney is also a fantastic teacher - one of the best I've had at Yale. He's very witty (though he might try a little to hard every once in a while), open for questions, and will talk to you about anything. Please go and see him even just to pick his brain on broader topics in science. He is a very intelligent man with a lot to offer. My only real advice: DON'T BRING A LAPTOP! If you do, you invariably will not pay attention to the lecture, and you will miss out on so much interesting stuff that will likely come back to bite you in the butt on the tests. Get a pencil, a pad, and listen to what the man has to say. Then enjoy the class!",
    "This is a GREAT introductory course - the course material is fascinating in terms of finding out things that you always wanted to know about (such as the Big Bang, blackholes, the future of the universe etc).",
    "It is a good introduction to an interesting area of science. It gives enough information to get an idea of what further study entails.",
    "it's not easy. better if you have some science\/math\/physics background",
    "great information, great class",
    "sure. its a pretty easy QR or science credit, with a funny lecture teacher. the problem sets are very hard.",
    "A decent astronomy course. Not incredibly difficult but not a gut course either. Psets take about four hours so it isn't too bad.",
    "Recommend -- straightforward, well organized course.",
    "If you need a science credit take it",
    "I would hands down recommend this class. You will have more fun that you expect and will learn a ton about really interesting topics like black holes and the origin\/structure of our universe.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Professor Kenney is very funny and he makes the concepts easy to understand.",
    "Definitely take this course! It's perfect if you want a semi-easy science credit, but are still willing to work (it's definitely not a gut class - the problem sets can sometimes be pretty hard, and the midterm and final, while not difficult, require studying). Professor Kenney is GREAT - he's hilarious and (coming from someone who's not interested in astronomy much at all) made the material really interesting and engaging. I learned SO MUCH and am really glad I took this class. It's a great overview of astronomy for someone who doesn't know much about it (or anything at all).",
    "Don't take this class. There are easier guts to take. Class isn't hard, it's just more work than you want to do. If you want to learn nothing, hear a few jokes from Kenney and struggle to understand how he's tenured, then take the class.",
    "Good class! NOT A GUT. Serious workload involving weekly problem sets and TWICE-WEEKLY online reading quizzes. Nevertheless, really interesting.",
    "Galaxies provides a great introduction to the fascinating subject of astronomy! However, the start of the class (the first half or so) moves incredibly slowly, almost to the point of boredom. Take this class if you want to learn more about the universe-- it's information that's interesting, but that you will probably never need to use. A good way to fulfill a science credit for non-science majors.",
    "This is a course that will give you background into astronomical ideas. It is an interesting, engaging course. I am a fan of Professor Kenney.",
    "If you want easy science credit, don't take it. It requires a lot work.",
    "Overall I thought this class was pretty fun. I haven't really cared much about outer space since I was a little kid, but this class was a nice time to just sit back and learn about neat things. It's really cool to hear about the limits of what we know, and realize that some of the stuff you're learning about is stuff that astronomers have figured out in our lifetimes. Professor Kenney is actually funny and entertaining to listen to in lecture (I mean this honestly\u0097people actually laughed at the things he said, and not just out of politeness), and the homework wouldn't have been a problem if I hadn't consistently done it the day it was due. I know people complain about this course as a science credit, but I really think it was totally manageable.",
    "No, I do not recommend it. Take a science or QR you have a chance of learning something from and enjoying. I promise there is at least one out there. I regret taking this class.",
    "If you're interested in astronomy, this is an awesome way to get a science credit. Again, problem sets can sometimes be hard, so don't take this class thinking it will be a breeze. But Professor Kenney is great!!",
    "Recommend. Interesting course, not as easy as you think though.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Not the easiest QR out there but not the hardest",
    "If you need a Sc requirement, take this class. Prof. Kenney is awesome and the problem sets are easy. Make sure you study for the midterm and final and they should be easy as well.",
    "Pretty fun class. Problem sets were often annoying (and sometimes graded with pickiness) but I mean, they're problem sets. The best feature of the class was Kenney's lectures, which extremely entertaining. He also writes on the board a lot, which is helpful.",
    "you can learn all the material in this course by watching \"THE UNIVERSE\" with carl sagan. it's available on netflix streaming.",
    "It was a relatively painless way of picking up a QR\/Sc, but I personally don't feel like I learned much that was mind-blowing or lifelong. That may just be me, though. I guess I do understand more than most people would about stars, but it's not really that applicable anyway.",
    "Not the best course if you're looking for a real gut, as I discovered.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a QR credit, though there are probably better science classes if you are looking for a SC credit. That being said, Professor Kenney is hilarious and keeps the class entertaining. There are \"reading quizzes\" before each lecture that you complete online to show you did the reading, and part of your grade is attendance - you get a point for each day you come to class. Problems sets are usually not too bad, and the TAs in section are willing to help.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. It's a pretty course overall, if you just put in an hour or two of work per week (on the problem sets). The readings aren't absolutely necessary, but they may help to understand the material better. He covers most everything in class, which is really nice.",
    "Galaxies. The Universe. Cool stuff. Take it.",
    "Loved it! Prof Kenney is a superb lecturer and the material is fascinating.",
    "Kenney is fantastic! A fun, engaging class.",
    "Take it if you want to Learn about space not if you just want a science credit.",
    "The problem sets every week are a bit of a pain. If math\/physics based problems are not your strong point you will probably have to go to one of the sections each week (which may or may not be helpful depending on the TA). I would not have taken this class if it had not been a QR credit. If you are looking for a science credit do not take this class--there are much more interesting classes available that do not have weekly problem sets.",
    "I think this course is more work than it seems at first. I took it thinking that it would be a very easy way to fulfill a SC\/QR requirement, but it wasn't easy at all. Not that the class was extremely difficult, but it does assign a decent amount of work. Nine problem sets in total (basically one every week after the third week or so), two reading quizzes a week, mandatory attendance in section. If you're really interested in basic astronomy, then I'd probably recommend the course. But if you're just looking for a fairly easy way to satisfy your SC\/QR requirements, I'd look elsewhere. Many people urge in these forms that this is not a gut class. They are right.",
    "Galaxies and the Universe is a great class. I think the things taught in this course should be taught to EVERY SINGLE PERSON at Yale. It's fairly easy but you learn a lot--it humbles you and amazes you at the vastness and complexity of our universe. Professor Kenney is a great teacher, very engaging, sometimes wacky, and quite often hilarious.",
    "overall, i liked the course. it's pretty interesting (especially the second half) and kenney is hilarious!! lectures did drag though, not only because of length but also because of the time of day (2:30-3:45).",
    "Astronomy 120 is a great class to take as a science requirement, but difficult for a QR. The problem sets are difficult and convoluted and require working with extremely large numbers -- you really need to know your scientific notation to do well in this class. That being said, if you're looking for an introduction to the field, this is a great course -- just be prepared to go to the discussion section, even if it's ostensibly labeled as \"optional.\"",
    "It is in alright class. I NEEDED to take it, so I did. It's definitely not something you will struggle with if you do the readings and go to section.",
    "Astr 120 is a course looking at how small we are compared to the vast universe. I would recommend it to anyone who needs an easy QR credit.",
    "definitely. interesting, fun, and chill",
    "Professor Kenney is the man! He makes the class really interesting and clearly has great passion for what he does. If it were any other professor I don't know if I would recommend the class. The subject matter is fairly interesting, and the math and science aren't too hard, but the workload can be tedious. Luckily, Professor Kenney is hilarious and does a great job of explaining concepts and encouraging student interaction in this lecture course! There are easier QRs out there, but this class will make you think about things you've never thought of!",
    "This is a good class to take if you are decently good at physics (which I never took and therefore proved problematic in doing the psets). It gives you a qr, and is not for math or science majors, who would most likely bust the curve. It is not an extremely hard class, and there are many small components that can help your grade. If you work hard and get a good study group, you should be able to get a good grade.",
    "Good class. I would not say it's a gut, but it certainly does not have any difficult math or science in it; it's meant for non-science majors like the description. As a student who used to be into math and science, I would recommend Intro to Cosmology instead of this class if you had any physics in high school. But if you're afraid of math and science, this is the go-to QR\/SC class; there's not much work, and it's an interesting topic."
