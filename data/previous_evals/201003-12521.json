   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for an easy and interesting way to fill your Social Science requirement!",
    "You use ancient and modern philosophers works to combat modern ethical dilemmas in the workplace",
    "great course the integrates real world problems, current business problems, and classic philosophy.",
    "Great class, take it",
    "Informative, not too difficult, straightforward. I recommend it.",
    "Take this class...it's awesome.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel like anybody could find at least one part of this course fascinating.",
    "FANTASTIC CLASS! You learn so much in one semester without even realizing it. Honestly, this is one of the little known gems at Yale. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Professional Ethics is a great course to take. While many students study ethics at yale, it is easy to overlook applying it to the real world. Professional ethics really makes ethics relevant and brings a deeper understanding of the tricky topics corporations and employees face.",
    "Surprisingly I learned a lot from this course. It was a great 5th class where I was spoon fed a lot information about Ethics, philosophy and economics that I hadn't had the time or the motivation to learn on my own.",
    "definitely - interesting class, not overwhelming with work",
    "Basically you study various cases that pertain to ethics in the workplace and apply various ethical standpoints to each case. Professor Carreras does a fantastic job providing a wide array of cases and mindsets in solving each case. I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS.",
    "It's a fun class. You have class discussions about ethics and the ethics you discuss seem way more practical than in a philosophy class where it's all hypothetical. Here you discuss things that really happened.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Not terribly difficult, social science credit, and an engineering credit",
    "Awesome class, very interesting and engaging. We read a lot of current articles and can apply the ethical views we learn in class to each situation. I enjoyed going to class every day and Mercedes is fantastic professor.",
    "Good class.",
    "The readings are enjoyable, the issues are important, and Prof Carreras is one of the best. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class because the material is good to know for any future business leader and the case studies help apply the theory to real life cases. Lots of homework though.",
    "Emphatic Yes.Anyone who wants to enter business\/lead a corporation must take this course.Workload is high. 2 long homeworks a week, a paper, midterm and final. But, grade is generally good.",
    "Absolutely take this class.",
    "Take it for an easy 5th class. It's also pretty interesting.",
    "A blue book gem.",
    "highly recommend it. It is very relevant",
    "This class is pretty easy. The homework can be tedious, but its like high school homework where you read an article and answer questions on it, but it is graded very easily. It was a good 5th class."
