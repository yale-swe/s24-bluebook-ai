   "comments": [
    "This course recounts various approaches to the writing of music history, both drawn from the discipline itself and from other humanistic approaches to writing about the cultures of the past.",
    "Since the course will likely change in its next incarnation, it is difficult to anticipate what it will be like when it is next offered. But the basic focus is on exploring influences related to \"big\" or \"deep\" historiography, with a special focus on responses to the Annales school. All of these are in some sense unrelated to music, but during the week and in class discussions, we work to apply or relate these more general readings to specific issues in music history or even to specific pieces of music.",
    "It's a required course, so my recommendation would have a limited effect on another student's choices. For what it's worth, then, I would highly recommend the course, with only the caution that it requires a large time commitment for both reading and reflecting."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course gave a terrific grounding in the profession, and was also an opportunity to question different subsets of it, as well as work in a different area of the field for the final project. As such, it was incredibly useful in the way that it could relate to the specific area of study I am interested in, as well a nice opportunity to explore other areas of the discipline.",
    "As a proseminar, this course served its function in surveying ways of writing about the music of the past. I would be surprised if any music historian who took the course did not come out with a newfound grasp on a wide range of historiographic techniques and the theoretical knowledge to know each of their weaknesses.",
    "It deepened my my knowledge of my discipline primarily by broadening my awareness of issues in adjacent or subsuming disciplines. That is very helpful, not just for stimulating thinking in general, but also for understanding music historiography within the context of larger issues. I feel I was exposed to a lot of valuable material that will have a tremendous impact on my approach to future reading and thinking about music.",
    "No contribution to my dissertation\/research area (yet). However, I found this class to be very helpful not only with respect to Musicology\/Music Theory, but also as a general survey of intellectual trends in the humanities in the past ~50 years. Although the focus of the course was historiography, the course functioned, for me, as an introduction (and sometimes refresher) also to structuralism, post-structuralism, post-colonialism, cultural theory, and many other intellectual currents. This, for me, was refreshing after a 2-year Master's degree in (seemingly) nothing but music, by demonstrating not just things to do with music, but how our musical studies and methods can be related to broader ideas."
