    "NO. Sorry, Professor SL, you really seemed like a good guy, but I did not like this class.",
    "I think this course is a good introduction to statistics. It is not too qualitative and has a good balance between work and actually learning.",
    "Don't take this class if you retain most of the material from AP stats. If you're looking for a more computation-based statistics course, take the intro course from the stats department instead. This course is mostly application-based, and most of the applications are, unsurprisingly, psychological studies. Very little, if any, time was spent on teaching the details of the formulas used in calculating values for statistical analyses.",
    "Yes, everyone should take it",
    "As far as QR courses go, this class is very doable and has a ton of real-world applications. The course material is relevant and will help you understand the world around you, no matter what field you go into.",
    "If you like dank music, memes, and piazza posts, take PSYC 200 with your man, Greg SL. This prof is epic. He does handstands in class, he uses hype data sets for the homework assignments, and he knows literally every student's name who's ever had an interaction with him. Greg makes the material interesting, he listens to feedback, and honestly there's no reason to dislike the class except maybe the mandatory attendance checked by clicker questions. Take this class. Enjoy a less math-dependent introduction to stats. If you can do it in the real world with a program, that's really all you need. If you're looking for a deeply math-involved stats class, take STAT230.",
    "Psyc 200 is a great stats class -definitely a class to take if it fills a requirement. It's also a class where you'll learn a lot that will probably be useful for you no matter what field you go into. Professor SL is also great, and he makes the class very easy to do well in - you know exactly what is expected of you and it isn't too much, because he releases the midterm and final 24 hours before the test. Overall recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you need to take stats and want to do so in a fun environment.",
    "Stats class with a spin on psychology. It uses a computer program to run stats, and you don't actually do anything by hand.",
    "DEF NOT A GUT. Very hard work, complex topics and not very well thought at that. If you're interested in the subject take it but not for a QR credit. You put in way too much work for the grade you would get. I ended up with a good grade, but felt like spent way more time than i got the value for in terms of learning new topics.",
    "Great course. I am a humanities major and was looking for my last QR credit, I definitely recommend this course to anyone. Professor SL is great and summed up the class perfectly on the first day: it is easy in a good way - in the way that you actually learn something. I didn't want to take a 100-level math course and I also didn't want to take something like astronomy - this is a good class for someone who actually wants to learn a useful skill but not be overwhelmed by the difficulty of the material. Go to lecture and especially go to section and you will do just fine.",
    "A gut class. Great 5th if you want to do it, but don't expect to actually learn much about stats. The homeworks are tedious and unfairly graded. The lectures and sections are mandatory. Prof SL is great however! I wish we had actually done more math though...or that this counted as a So credit.",
    "A great class for someone who wants to learn some basic stats and be able to run tests on their own while understanding what the purpose behind them is. I definitely recommend. It applies to everything.",
    "Don't take this class thinking it's a gut. Okay, it kind of is but like what this class has made me realize is that there's two types of guts. One where everyone gets an A, and one that has very little work. This is one that has little work, but it's like pretty challenging to get an A. You like really gotta know your shit if you want to get an A in this class. The midterm was savage, but Professor SL curved pretty generously (I did well, though, so it didn't help me). The content itself is pretty standard Stats, it's a lot less math and a lot more interpretation of the math. You use a program called SPSS that basically does all the work for you, so you're mostly just writing up and interpreting data. It's nothing mind blowing, but it does make you think about why data could be the way it is.",
    "Psych stats is not a hard QR, but it is an annoying class. The material isn't taught very well. Section is bad. However, there isn't that much work (1 Pset a week, 2 exams, final project). Definitely better than any calc-based math class for non-STEM majors.",
    "This is a good class and it teaches a lot of extremely useful stuff that everyone really needs to know, for school and for life. Seriously, abuse of statistics is a vast epidemic and if you don't understand statistics, you can't be properly media literate, which in my personal opinion is so, so important. The class is not particularly difficult or work-intensive but there were some concepts and parts of the class that were challenging, and you do need to put time into the homework, exams, and project. Also, FYI, for people like me who might be put off by there being a group project, you are allowed to do it alone if you prefer that.",
    "It's required as a Psych major but it's a good course. The psets can be a pain though and the midterm is rough.",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "Take this is you need it for the psych major, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are just looking for a QR, i'm sure there are other classes that might be better. Unless you are good at statistics, then definitely take it because you won't be as confused as I was.",
    "YES TAKE PSYC STATS! Especially if you need a QR or if you are a pre-med that needs the STATS requirement. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take PSYC 200! It's a great way to learn about statistics in a fun (and pretty easy) way. If you can, take it with Professor SL --- he was super engaging and seems like a pretty funny guy.",
    "Take it if you have to for a requirement. It's not super difficult (but I don't think it's a gut!).",
    "I would recommend this course pretty much only if you need to take it for something - be it a QR or for your major. It's not easy! The first midterm is ROUGH, and the grading is harsh on problem sets. They don't take too long, but everything about stats requires a lot of effort. Like you can't miss a lecture without losing points, section is mandatory, and you have to really understand SPSS (the program you use) in order to do well on the exams. It is not an easy class! Don't think that it is. It used to be a gut I think, but now it is not.",
    "It is a good class to help understand how stats work in psychology.",
    "If you need a QR, it's manageable. Not great, but even though I didn't know much about math, I could keep up with a little effort. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't need a QR, not super interesting, didn't find lectures very helpful.",
    "Great fifth class, not too much work or too difficult, and you learn a ton",
    "I would recommend this class because the Professor is very nice and caring and brings excitement to the class. It is also an interesting way to learn statistics.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who's interested in statistics or involved in social sciences.",
    "I would recommend this class as an introduction to statistics, and if the student wants to see the many applications of the field.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a friend! Whether you are taking it for a QR or as a psych requirement, it is a great class and you will get a lot out of it. Not only do you learn about using statistics in a psychology setting, but you read and analyze data from a diverse selection of data sets, and thus get a great exposure to a number of different fields within psychology. Professor SL is an amazing professor and yet another reason to take this class!!",
    "So great. Fantastic introduction to statistical methods for whatever you may need them for. Definitely a worthwhile lecture and class.",
    "Psych 200 is a great way to fulfill any statistics requirement. The class offers an opportunity to become familiar with basic statistical analyses, learn how to run tests using SPSS computer software, and realize the tests' real word applications.",
    "I think that some students came into this class with the impression that it would be a gut. It actually required a lot of work, so students expecting a gut should not take it. However, those expecting to learn a lot who have little to no knowledge of statistics to begin with should take it.",
    "Take it. You actually learn, and while it may be a steep learning curve in the beginning, you'll be a STATs boss by the time the final rolls around. The grading is fair, and the professor and TFs will help you every step of the way IF YOU REACH OUT.",
    "It's a good class! Statistics is such an important skill nowadays, and this class is great because it will actually teach you how to run tests and give you skills that you can apply in the real world. IT IS NOT A GUT.",
    "yes it is a good intro to stats",
    "It's fun and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is an effective way to learn stats concepts and become very good at using SPSS.",
    "I recommend this course to all students, regardless of their major. The topics learned in this class are useful in any field and even to people in general who hope to be informed citizens. There is a consistent workload in that there were homework assignments each week , 2 exams, and a project. All of the graded material is very reasonable especially for those who attend lecture and the lab section.",
    "Take it",
    "I think that this PSYC200 is absolutely fantastic, especially for those who are Psychology majors. Also, a great course for people who don't think they are great at QRs. In this course, you not only get to learn the basic concepts of statistics, but more importantly, you learn how to apply those concepts by thinking about real-world situations and building your own study. Basically, PSYC200 involves weekly problem sets, a weekly section, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final project. The workload is balanced, and very manageable. Professor SL is extremely engaging and really cares for his students, so he works really hard to build a non-traditional statistics course that helps us actually apply the basic statistical concepts throughout our assignments. I actually enjoyed most of the assignments in this course. You get to think about interesting, real-world issues in the problem sets, figure out the statistics in projects of his former students during the midterm and the final exam, and even build your very own study for the final project. As a psychology major, these assignments made me a lot more confident about pursuing an empirical senior project next year. I also appreciated that there's no textbook for the course -- Professor SL taught us everything himself through the lectures and sections, which I really appreciated. There aren't really any weaknesses I can think of. I think the only thing is that you might get a varied perspective of the course, depending on which TF you get. I got Adam, and he was fantastic. Overall, great course that I would definitely recommend.",
    "Psych stats is a good class, but maybe it wasn't as good this year as reviews from past years led me to believe it would be. It's not a very difficult or work-intensive class, and I really loved how in order to do the homework assignments, we got to work with real and interesting data sets and analyze things like the number of unique words 100 different rappers use, and the gender bias in Disney movies, etc. Professor S-L makes the class and the work fun. Sometimes lectures were confusing, but section was designed to take the concepts taught in class and show us how to actually do them - sections were taught in computer labs in which we all used SPSS to work through a \"lab\" (a data analysis) together - and sections really helped clear up everything that wasn't clear after a week of class. All in all, if you need to take stats, I would recommend PSYC 200, but would just caution that sometimes lecture gets a bit confusing.",
    "Learning basic stats principles.",
    "Take it if you are not ready or willing to jump into theoretical statistics and you want a really application-based class. I really loved the project even though we did not get any interesting results because it was something that I was interested in and Greg gives you a lot of freedom to pursue it with your project. The midterm and final are released before the exam, but DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS CLASS. If you underestimate it and do not prepare for the exams\/not study for the exams, you will get a very very bad score and will do terribly in the class. The tests are made with the assumption that you have 24 hours to basically create answers, but without the data set (which is critical to the test), you are really guessing what the results would be. But if you study and prepare well enough, this class should be fair and interesting.",
    "Statistics is an excellent class that you could easily use for the rest of your life. It is not boring, or useless, or pointlessly difficult. It's a challenging, engaging, important class that deals with every issue of modern life we deal with today. Everyone should take it. The professor is hilarious and will do almost anything to prove a mathematical point.",
    "If you want basic data analysis skills, yes. Very practical course.",
    "This class is legit if you take it with Professor Samanez Larkin, but I heard that it's been too gutty\/easy in the past with other professors. With Professor SL though, I felt like it was a fair workload, but also really useful\/informative. Prof SL really taught us a lot of useful skills and a way of thinking about stats that can be applied to anything you do in life. Stats is just really useful for interpreting the results of any studies or papers, and it teaches you how to critically think about any type of scientific studies you hear about in the news or stuff like that. That's key because people will try to trick you all the time expecting you to believe their crap because it's got confusing statistics. Don't be fooled. Take this class. It's lit.",
    "Take this course if you are genuinely interested in psych stats and willing to be proactive\/take initiative to teach yourself concepts that remain confusing after lecture, but don't take it if you are just looking for an easy QR. There were parts of PSYC 200 that I enjoyed -- Professor SL's fun personality, the way that he used specific examples from students who had previously taken the course, etc. Overall, I do feel like I walked away with concrete knowledge that I will be able to apply int he rest of my studies about how to do psychology statistics. However, the road there was tricky. The first half of the semester was especially rough. It felt like the expectations were incredibly unclear so you would do badly on homework and have no idea why, and the concepts just were not explained well at all. That being said, I do think Professor SL did a good job incorporating the feedback we provided at midterms, and the second half of the course was much better. So major kudos to him for hearing us out!",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend PSYC200 to any psych major, or anyone looking for an alternative to STAT100. Everything you learn is incredibly applicable (and essential) to research. An understanding of statistical concepts will make you a better consumer of any new information you encounter.",
    "Take this class, especially if you are not taking any math classes but want to get a better understanding of stats and numbers. If you already took advanced math, this would probably boring for you, except if you have no experience with SPSS, but overall it is definitely helpful for any person interested in the social science.",
    "This is a great applied stats course -- you learn how to work with real world data and can use the skills from this course outside of the classroom.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. The first couple of days are misleading, as it's relatively chill and you don't learn real stats. Come the midterm and you're actually expected to know something when you were taught very little was a slap in the face. Take the other stats class.",
    "It was an overall decent statistics class that I would recommend only to those needing to fulfill a statistics requirement.",
    "A good stats course. Not exactly a gut, so don't take it for that. But you'll learn some useful stuff, and might just enjoy yourself while you're at it.",
    "If you don't think you like statistics, but need a QR, take this class and it will probably teach you reasons to like statistics and reasons that statistics are important. Good class for data literacy, which is important.",
    "A great stats course! The workload is manageable, and the class itself makes statistics interesting and enjoyable.",
    "YES definitely! Useful in every way.",
    "Essentially SPSS 101.",
    "If you're interested in stats or are going into a field that will use stats, this class won't teach you the things you really need to know.",
    "This class had great potential, but it was not taught well. When we were given homework assignments, the TFs would grade them, take points off, and not tell you what you missed. You had to compare yours to \"sample homeworks\" (that weren't even always right) to see what you missed. This was ridiculous!! The class just felt like a bunch of unnecessary busy work. The midterm and final didn't test your knowledge AT ALL it just tested how quickly you can type. I say if you are thinking of this class and the regular Stats 101-105, think carefully and SHOP BOTH (I'm serious).",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych stats to another student--I'm a political science major and took this as a QR, but I ended up loving it and feel like I learned a lot of practical things from this course. The psets weren't too difficult, and there was a good curve on exams. And classes were fun too. I also loved my TF. So yeah, take this class!",
    "I would recommend PSYC 200. The workload is fair, it's well-taught, and you learn a lot.",
    "Would recommend, great stats course",
    "PSYC 200 is fine if you want a very, very basic understanding of computer-based statistical analysis and the grammar of statistics write-ups. If you really want to learn statistics more thoroughly and get a really solid understanding of the material, take a different stats class. It's not a terrible amount of work, and the project is kind of cool, though if Prof S-L is teaching, the midterm might be kind of rough. There is more work than you might expect, so it's not a totally gutty QR.",
    "Very straightforward class with weekly psets that were actually sometimes pretty fun to do (we analyzed interesting and sometimes very novel data sets). It was a very practical approach to stats which I loved, meaning we never focused on theory or equations. Instead, the class is meant to teach you how to perform statistical tests you would actually use in academia. I can now read the results sections of journal papers and get a much better understanding of the statistics.",
    "It's a very useful course for psychology majors and you learn and practice stats quite a lot (as well as writing social science papers). It's not the best structured course and straightforward course with Professor SL, though (although he is responsive to feedback and thus the class got a lot better after the midterm).",
    "Statistics is a good introductory statistics class for students who are interested in learning how to apply statistics and analyze statistical claims in the real world. I would not recommend PSYC 200 to another student. The class was disorganized, and though I feel that I gained some statistics knowledge and became more aware of the applicability of statistics, I think that other statistics classes would be better for students interested in learning statistics.",
    "Difficult class, don't take just because of QR.",
    "Excellent option for stats! The workload seemed heavier than when friends took this version in the past, so expect to put a lot of time into the course and the problem sets (which were graded very stringently- would have preferred more of a pass\/fail or broader system). Prof SL is absolutely great and made the course very entertaining.",
    "It's an amazing QR. Beyond useful, and not too out of anyone's depth. Take it!",
    "The workload is very manageable, but there is a lot of self-teaching involved. Only take the class if you're truly need it.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's very reasonable and will be vital for understanding statistics in virtually any setting.",
    "You will come out of this class with useful skills, but you will hate it while you're taking it, and you will feel like it's a waste of your time. The class could be much more effective if the whole program was revised (especially lectures and homeworks). Also, it is not as easy as everyone says.",
    "Hands down, this class is incredible. It's a straightforward intro to statistics, but Professor SL is the root of why this class is so amazing. He chooses real-world, engaging examples to demonstrate the concepts and to use for the homeworks, instead of canned examples and outcomes--it teaches you to think critically about the stats outcomes in a really interesting way. In addition, Professor SL is basically just a ray of sunshine--he genuinely cares about every single person in his lecture, learns as many names as possible, has a sense of humor, and tackles really relevant social issues with statistical biases too. He cares about how each person in the class is doing and wants to give us the best experience he can--no unfair or out-to-get-you grading here. He's incredibly receptive to feedback from the class as well. So, overall, this course doesn't require a lot of work at all and was hands-down my most enjoyable class this semester. If you get the opportunity to take this class, do it. I went in with an AP statistics background and still got a fair bit out of it (especially in regards to SPSS).",
    "I would probably tell someone else to take it but just let them know that it's not as easy as it may be marketed as.",
    "If you don't have background knowledge, don't try",
    "A good intro a variety of stats tests and you come out feeling really comfortable with SPSS- very fun examples and applications of stats",
    "Yep, it's a good QR credit and you'll learn useful things and bond with half your fellow humanities majors because everyone's in this class.",
    "First pre-Med class I truly enjoyed and in hindsight would take even if I weren't premed",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's seeking a QR credit.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who needs a QR who isn't really a \"math-y\" person, otherwise there are definitely better QRs to take.",
    "Yes. Such a useful class and manageable.",
    "This course is fine. It's not super work intensive, and you learn some very useful practical skills. There were definitely some frustrating aspects of the course though. Lectures could often be unclear, and attendance was taken (and factored into your final grade) by a poorly organized system that did not work very well. It was not my favorite class, but I am also very glad to have taken it. The tools it provides you with are, as far as I can tell, very valuable for many potential fields of study, as well as analyzing other people's statistical studies.",
    "Great class. Take it if you want to solidify your stats background and\/or interested in the material. Definitely recommend.",
    "A great stats class too take. It is not too difficult, and is actually extremely interesting and fun! Take it even if you don't need it for a psych major.",
    "Yes, especially to students who have some basic background in statistics. For people without any stats background (like me), the problem sets took took too long--8 or 10 hours each.",
    "I would not recommend taking the course to expect to get an A, as the rumor went around at the beginning of the year. It is not an easy or gut course, and be prepared to spend many endless hours.",
    "P-sets aren't bad, but the clicker thing is. Project was fun to do. Exams aren't bad.",
    "Take it. Completely manageable class with clear grading. Prof SL is good.",
    "I'd say only take this class if you are a psyc major looking to fulfill your stats requirement. If you are looking for a easy QR, this might be it, but it won't be very fulfilling. In that I mean that it isn't too challenging, but you end putting a substantial amount of time into this and not walking away with a really firm grasp on statistics. Also, the professor tries to market this class as somewhat \"fun and hip\" and it really isn't.",
    "Good class but can be difficult if you are not a stats person",
    "This class is a statistics class that also makes you think about the social consequences of statistics. I would recommend if you like stats or need a QR credit.",
    "PSYC200 is a great way of knocking out a QR. Professor SL is very engaging and even if you don't understand the information in class completely you will still get something out of lecture. At the end of the class, I definitely feel I learned more about how to use SPSS, the statistics program, than I actually understand the different tests in statistics but at the same time I feel I could evaluate data for any entry level job using what I know in class. This class also has a little more work than might be apparent from the first few classes but weekly psets are manageable.",
    "This course is definitely not a gut but it is manageable for non-math people. The lectures were not ever that helpful in explaining the concepts. Most of the actual learning happens in section. If you are a non-math person I would take it if you can't find an easier math or if you really want to learn how to use SPSS for some reason. It is annoying to have a project and a final at the end of the year.",
    "Grading was a lot harder this year. It's not a gut anymore. The psets were hard and the tests were really strange (writing up the results and discussion section of a fake research paper). I think I would've gotten more out of it if I had actively participated\/listened in lecture, although the exams never really test how well you understand the material because they're open-internet and open-note and you get it 24 hours in advance, so you could literally never show up and do fine on the test, which is really dumb. I barely learned any actual stats.",
    "PSYC 200 is an engaging introduction to statistics from a social sciences point-of-view that helps expose students to basic concepts of statistics and encourages them to apply their newfound analytical skill in real-life studies. I would encourage students looking for engaging and useful QR's to give PSYC 200 a go, since the class deals with what I believe is a very useful skill to have while consuming modern day media.",
    "A great and informative course that taught new and applicable material in statistics, while relating it to interesting topics in psychology. Definitely recommend for both pre-med and humanity majors. The project is a fair amount of work, and the weekly psets are slightly time consuming, but the material that is taught is very applicable and useful for the post-graduate job market, especially in medicine.",
    "Great class! Take it if you want to understand stats, but definitely not if you're looking to compute statistics by hand.",
    "It is a statistics course that isn't too overwhelming. We have weekly sections and homework assignments which don't usually take too long. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology.",
    "It's not super fun, but it's not a bad class either. It's pretty average, and it's really not hard, I took it for my major, but it's not a bad class to take for a math credit if you need one. Stats are useful in all walks of life.",
    "If you need to take a stats class for your major, take this one - I shopped Intro Stats and ended up taking this class - good choice based on workload and ability to understand concepts most clearly. If you're thinking about taking this class just because, I would definitely not recommend it.",
    "Good QR - learn some interesting skills in a very manageable class",
    "Listen up, this isn't a gut. Lemme say it again for the people in the back who didn't hear me: THIS ISNT A GUT. So yea, if you're a stats wiz then yea, this course is super easy, but if you aren't STEM at all aka me, then you're gonna struggle unless you keep up. Go to lecture. Go to section. It's not hard but I have no clue how people survived without going to class. I barely survived and I did go to class. The midterm is BS, ignore it. The final isn't too bad. The Psets are sometimes a pain in the butt but I don't think anyone spent that much time on them so I wouldn't say its a time consuming class but more that when you're actually engaging with the material its pretty stressful. If you need a QR you might as well take it but just know it isnt an easy A anymore",
    "PSYC 200 was a great introduction to statistics! It works with SPSS, so it was extremely useful for anyone interested in psychology research. In addition, Professor SL is an incredible professor who makes lecture extremely interesting. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "I took this for the QR. I came out with at best a vague understanding of stats, which is nice, and the fact that it was psych stats made it less boring. I like that I can recognize stats terminology in other contexts now. I didn't really enjoy taking it but as QRs go it could certainly be worse, and Professor SL tries really hard to make it enjoyable, which I respect. The weekly PSETs vary in difficulty but you can get it down (although 6pm on Sunday is kind of a killer deadline). There is a curve (or at least there was for the midterm).",
    "If Professor SL is teaching this class do not take it! It is very hard and you will not learn the material through lectures. This was supposed to be an introductory course but the professor expected everyone to have a lot of prior knowledge.",
    "Psych 200 was a introductory stats course that used interesting and relevant examples from life to explain the basic statistical tests and how to apply them. I would totally recommend this course. I found it very interesting and perfect for obtaining foundational statistical skills. Professor SL and the TFs were great as well.",
    "As a non-STEM major looking for an interesting QR credit, I'm glad I took PSYC200 it felt as relevant as a math class could to my main interest in the humanities. Several times during the course I came across statistics in the real world and really felt like I had a better understanding of how they were derived, computed, and presented. It wasn't always the most riveting lecture, but definitely a relatively painless QR weekly problem sets, a final project, and two tests that you get (minus the data) 24 hours in advance.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT IF GREG SAMANEZ-LARKIN IS TEACHING IT.",
    "Its an intro Stats class with a chill prof.",
    "Very application-based approach to statistics, which is useful for research\/if you're going into science. I think it was a very practical class, and learning to use SPSS was great. Interesting lectures, enthusiastic and helpful professor\/TFs, not too much homework. Would recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you're looking to complete a statistics course. I thought that using the context of psychology for statistical analysis made the course material much more interesting and it portrayed a clear example of how you could use statistical analysis techniques you learned in class in a specific context. The professor is also amazing.",
    "This is a great introduction to statistics and application of statistics, that is very helpful for MCAT preparation and general knowledge for bridging statistic theory and application.",
    "A class you should not even consider taking, unless you love to waste time trying to learn an interesting yet poorly taught subject"
