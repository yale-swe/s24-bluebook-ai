    "If you're even looking at taking this class that means you've kinda reached the end of the Russian curriculum at Yale. Take this class. You'll learn how to talk about relevant things in Russian and any time with Irina is time well spent.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to get practice in spoken Russian and is interested in contemporary Russian problems. Professor Dolgova is also a great teacher: she cares a lot about her students, and she is always ready to explain difficult things.",
    "I'd recommend RUSS 184 01 to other students",
    "Take it if it's offered! More fun than the standard language classes. Lots of talking and reading. Your Russian will improve a lot.",
    "Definitely recommended for familiarizing yourself with political vocabulary.",
    "Absolutely take it. Any chance to work with Irina is a chance you should take, especially at the higher level -- she seems to really enjoy these types of classes, where there's more freedom and flexibility of curriculum. The one-on-one attention is incredible and she goes out of her way to make sure every student is being challenged in a way which is most productive for him or her. Plus, you end up learning a ton about the modern Russian state and its psychology.",
    "RUSS 184 is an excellent course for advanced students of Russian. It is indeed what the name of the course implies: a course on advanced conversation an contemporary media. I would definitely recommend it, mostly for the instructorIrina.",
    "This class was a delightful part of my week! I loved the opportunity to sit down twice a week and refine my Russian skills through simultaneously casual and structured discussions on the most important issues facing Russia today. Irina's passion for her students shines through every class as she makes sure everyone is comfortable and has the opportunity to flourish in debate. The class's focus on practical application was a nice turn away from the more rigid nature of grammatical analysis of lower-level Russian courses, which I suppose is the natural progression for this upper-L5 course. It is not difficult to do well in the course. The homework is fairly easy to get through, and the quizzes are often graded leniently. That being said, this is by no means a course you should coast through, despite it being very easy to. This is a language class in which you get as much as you put in. If you're sincerely interested in learning and perfecting your Russian, this class will only be worth-while if you take it seriously."
