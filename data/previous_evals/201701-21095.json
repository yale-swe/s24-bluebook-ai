   "comments": [
    "The course was a great immersion in Russian literature and Alexandrov was a fantastic lecturer, helping us to really engage in what can be at times dense texts.",
    "This class helps students understand the thoughts of the two greatest Russian novelists, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.",
    "Intensive reading of the text, Russian history and culture, theodicy writings.",
    "This Russian literature class was without question the most incredible course I have taken during my time at Yale. As someone who loves literature, I have never before been in a literature lecture; however, I cannot imagine reverting to literature seminars after this semester. I learned how to get through big novels quickly, I learned how to read a big text closely, and I learned how to extract the major connections and details from such large works. I have raved about this class to everyone I have spoken to, and everyone is so upset that Professor Alexandrov will not be teaching it anymore.",
    "The novels in the course raise a lot of questions about history, how to live, and what matters in life that will keep me thinking for awhile to come. The class also gives students the skills to read books like this, teaching how to approach a text and how to make connections to uncover its less obvious meanings.",
    "I really began thinking about these novels as their own worlds...full of all of the information we need to dive in and explore.",
    "-an incredible guided tour through over three thousand pages of Russian literary genius, led by an astute reader who knew when to get into the weeds, and when to zoom back out to the macro, bird's eye view -improved ability to write about literature on the level of a book's philosophy as well as textural presentation",
    "Who wouldn't want a chance to read four of the best novels ever written? I learned how to read quickly and deeply massive amounts of content, talk about these novels in fun and constructive ways, and also had the chance to listen to a master speak about things that he clearly loves. A joy of a course.",
    "I learnt how to read a novel",
    "This class taught me how to read literature, how to write a literature paper, and how to think effectively about the big questions of the human condition. It also gave me the best book I've ever read - War and Peace - and some of the best lectures and discussion sections I've ever had."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures for this course were consistently fantastic, and the final grade is nicely distributed between essays, a final, and section. The nature of this course is that it will have a lot of reading, so while it was at times difficult to keep up, I wouldn't consider it a weakness.",
    "This course did a fantastic job showing the ideas of these two writers within their 4 greatest works. The lectures were clear, cogent, flowed-nicely, and fascinating.",
    "I think attempting to read all 4 books is a lot - I would have liked to talk about each of them more in depth. Don't know how to resolve that.",
    "I think the class should be an hour or an hour and fifteen minutes as opposed to merely 50 minutes, so as to allow more time at the end for a discussion with the professor or for students to ask questions. Plus, I could listen to Professor Alexandrov speak about these novels all day--and I'm sure he could! That being said, I loved the format of lecture with section, I think the pace at which we were expected to read the novels was fast but do-able, and I think overall the class was brilliant.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. Most of the novels were great, and all were interesting and I was appreciative to have had the experience of reading them. I think focusing more on the text itself in class might benefit the class, as the novels contain so much material that it (expectedly and understandably) felt as if we had to rush through each one.",
    "There's no real way to get around all the reading, so maybe have a short conversation in lecture or in section at the beginning of the course with different reading strategies that have worked for people?",
    "Great reading list and the readings are fairly paced. I think the class might be better in a seminar, but it's a great way to force yourself to read these amazing books. Don't get behind on the readings--if you do that, then you really just shouldn't take the class.",
    "This class will teach you how to read a book. Take it",
    "The course is excellent at making you think about the big questions: what is art? what is man's relationship to the divine? does free will exist? These lectures are all excellent, though perhaps there are too many of them, and the course fails to pick up on other equally important issues, such as women, gender, and sexuality in the novels. Throughout all the weeks of lecture for War and Peace, Professor Alexandrov kept promising to discuss the role of women in the novel, and then he only got to it for half of the last lecture on the book, which was spillover from the regularly scheduled lectures - I would've appreciated more discussion of the women throughout."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is easy to be intimidated by Russian literature, but the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are absolutely worth reading, and this class will help you get through the readings and understand them in a very manageable way.",
    "Yes definitely take this course if you are at all interested in literature or Russian culture. You will learn and read a lot regarding these two writers.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. Must take if taught again.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone at Yale in a heartbeat. Even on the weeks that I was not fully able to keep up with the readings, the lectures were still fascinating and illuminating, and made me fall in love with Russian literature. Not only can I leave the course saying I read \"War and Peace\" or \"Crime and Punishment,\" but I can leave the course saying I understand these texts: I see the labyrinth of connections, the diologic thinking, the Divine (but also human) function of the narrator, and the way I as the reader am supposed to make sense of all that is happening. I could go on and on, but instead you should definitely take this class!",
    "These novels are wonderful pieces of literature--my favorite books that I've read in classes here. It's a lot of reading and takes quite a bit of time to get through them all. But the time is well-worth it. If you're interested in literature, big questions about the human condition, or Russia, I highly recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's very solid, and you get to read lots. You have freedom over what you write about, and the class is straightforward. It was an enjoyable lecture.",
    "Yes yes!! Incredible books, and Professor Alexandrov is a fantastic lecturer. Absolutely take this!",
    "Yes! Finishing a class where the reading is measured in cubic inches? So gratifying. And the lectures were fascinating, keying me into the really brilliant literary minds of our authors and the professor.",
    "If you enjoy reading long books and will actually do the reading, you'll get so much out of this course! If you know you won't have the discipline to get through the long tomes, then don't think you'll get a particularly rewarding experience. Prof. Alexandrov's lectures certainly help guide you through the material and give you signposts that you recognize as you read.",
    "I don't think Vladimir Alexandrov will ever teach this course again, but if he does... you have to take it. I finally took it my senior spring and loved every bit of it.",
    "If you're up for doing all the reading then definitely take it, but probably not the best course for a second semester senior",
    "Yes! great books, don't get behind on the readings though, or you might as well not even take the class",
    "Yes 100% especially if you are a senior",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You'll learn how to think and how to read. Professor Alexandrov opens up these massive books to you in a way that will make them all your new favorites. Don't be scared by all the reading - I thought I would never be able to do it all - but the books are too good to put down!"
