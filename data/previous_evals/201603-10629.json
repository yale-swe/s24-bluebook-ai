   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about arthropods, including what taxa they comprise, why they are important to study, and fascinating\/surprising details about their behavior and anatomy.",
    "Evolutionary origin of arthropods, taxonomy, behavior, predation strategies, parasitism",
    "I learned a lot about evolution, biological classification, and about the effects of climate change on biodiversity - alterations that we might not otherwise be attuned to without paying attention to insects.",
    "Bugs! Or, pardon me, arthropods. Basically, it's a big overview of arthropod physiology, diversity, evolution, and ecology--typical organismal diversity course. Also typical of an organismal diversity course, it features a professor talking about their single favorite thing, so it's great fun the whole time.",
    "This was my first lecture course, and as a result I learned how to actively engage in a lecture without necessarily taking part. At the same time, I became acutely aware of the importance of arthropods, especially in the context of the environment.",
    "This course is super fun and interesting! However, there are a lot of scientific terms to memorize, so try to come armed with a knowledge of Latin prefixes, suffixes, and root words. I learned a lot about terrestrial arthropods, as can be hoped, but the best parts of the class were Professor Wells's enthusiasm and beautiful slides.",
    "I developed infinite more knowledge about terrestrial arthropods than I had before. I learned how a real college biology class is, including the large amounts of memorization. I learned so much about ecology, body plans, reproductive cycles, etc.",
    "This class encouraged a far greater understanding and appreciation for things that are often overlooked or ignored. Learning about arthropods allowed me to literally learn about an entire world that I had often dismissed and see the complexity and beauty in organisms that are too commonly thought of as pests or disgusting.",
    "I learned about the diversity, phylogeny, physiology, and behavior of insects and some non-insect arthropods."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The workload in this course was very manageable overall, and the midterms were fair. I thought Professor Wells' genuine enthusiasm for the topic was contagious, and she really made sure to include some fun video or fact in each lecture. The lecture periods at times felt long when we were getting into details of arthropod anatomy, but I found the behavioral lectures in units 2 & 3 to be very engaging.",
    "I liked the set up for the class, dropping one midterm is nice. Writing the paper on a topic of our choice was really interesting and an appropriate length for what was asked of us.",
    "The lecture is very engaging, thanks to Marta's excitement and the way that she inserts a lot of video clips into every lecture to provide examples of insects and to reinforce whatever she's talking about. I never felt disadvantaged for not being a STEM major, except on exam questions that asked us to design an experiment to demonstrate\/investigate a particular phenomenon. Perhaps I would have found these questions much easier if I were enrolled in the lab, but it would be helpful to talk a bit about constructing experiments in the lecture, too.",
    "Strengths: Marta is amazing, and loves the subject matter, and therefore makes it fascinating. Also, arthropods are flat-out _weird_, so the material never gets old. Pretty typical course organization and exam structure, no homework aside from some readings and one short paper. Weaknesses: Lectures got behind schedule over time, so we had to rush some topics and skip a lecture. Powerpoints aren't the easiest to take notes from all the time; sometimes they're just laid out in a confusing way. Improvements: I'd encourage more thought in how the powerpoint reads--little things like keeping title format consistent and putting numbers on listed concepts can really make a huge difference in clarity and make it much, much easier to take good notes. Otherwise, though, generally great!",
    "Dr. Wells is an amazing and engaging teacher, and the content is fascinating. I especially like the use of videos to explain phenomena related to arthropods. I really cannot think of any complaints.",
    "This course has a LOT of information, and it can be difficult to pass the tests unless you devote a lot of time to studying. Something that could be interpreted as either good or bad is that the (optional) third midterm is right before Reading Period. If your memory is good enough, you can study for the third midterm and ignore that section when you study for the final. If not, it may be best just to skip the midterm and focus on studying for the final.",
    "Professor Wells is delightful and her passion for the subject is so lovely to see. It made the long slog up to Science Hill feel very worth it. I also enjoyed the Arthropod Brief assignment and appreciated the opportunity to supplement test grades with a written paper. I thought the increase in difficulty between exam 1 and exam 2 was jarring -- on exam 2 in particular, it felt like many of the questions came a little out of left field.",
    "This class is super interesting with straitforward material and great presentation. One weakness is that while lectures were incredibly engaging, there was not a ton of engagement outside of class (however, this was also refreshing).",
    "Strengths include the easy to understand lectures and the inclusion of interesting videos to keep the class engaged. One improvement I would recommend is further expansion on the material covered towards the end of the course which spanned subjects such as parasitism and climate change. I feel these are very important subjects that could have been discussed further.",
    "The knowledge passed on in this course cannot be found in another course at Yale. This is the bug course, and that's awesome. The entire design of the course is to get the students fascinated about arthropods, and I'm all for that.",
    "The course was well-rounded and very successfully taught."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in learning tons of stuff about bugs, then take it. That being said, if you're not a biology person, taking it credit\/d is a good way to go",
    "I would definitely recommend this course (if you're not too squeamish about bugs)!! Professor Wells is wonderful, the workload is fairly light (you can drop 1 out of 3 midterms), and it changed the way I think about arthropods I have a much better appreciation for how important and complex they can be.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Relatively chill EEB class, watch lots of interesting videos about arthropods, some lectures can be slightly boring, like about the evolutionary history of arthropods but overall very interesting. Professor Wells is the best, super sweet, super enthusiastic about the material. Very approachable. Three midterms, get to drop one, a short 2 page paper, and a final. If you just review the powerpoint slides and skim the readings you'll be good for the midterms (readings were only tested on the second midterm this semester). Don't have to know the readings for the final.",
    "Yes, absolutely. As everyone on here says, Arthropods is great, Marta is great, take it if you have interest in learning weird bug facts. Be aware that it's not a gut, but if you pay attention and study before the exams you'll be all right. I didn't take the lab concurrently and that was just fine--I definitely didn't learn the orders or families as well as I would have in lab, but that's all right with me.",
    "Yes, I would. This was very interesting course with engaging lectures that included both helpful visuals and complementary videos.",
    "I think I've already recommended this course to most of my friends. I would most definitely recommend this course on the basis of its superb teacher, fascinating material, and low-stress atmosphere.",
    "This is a very fun and rewarding course that I would recommend to anyone. If you're looking for a fun class where you get to learn a lot about amazing varieties of bugs, this class is perfect.",
    "This is a great class! I do somewhat regret not taking the lab, though. It seems like a lot of fun, plus you get to go on trips to collect bugs. This course was a low time commitment for me because there are few assignments other than reading and one short final paper. You will need to put aside some time to study, though, because there is a lot of vocabulary.",
    "This is a good science class. It's not a gut. I'm a social science\/humanities person, so my biggest challenge was memorizing the large amount of biological terms\/concepts for the exams. The exams were fair but definitely not easy. You will need to study a lot for them. Prof. Wells is a ray of sunshine and couldn't be nicer. The lectures are very engaging. Lots of creepy videos of bugs that you can show to your friends to freak them out!! :)",
    "Take this class! The lectures are so interesting and filled with amusing videos and facts. A great way to learn about the natural world from a unique perspective without too much stress. The lab section is also amazing and comes with awesome field trips around Connecticut and even to Florida!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. This class offers you a brief glimpse into the fascinating world of arthropods. It unveils the great diversity and complexity that can be found on a much smaller scale than most of us are used to, reminding that the things we often overlook or discard are often capable of great beauty and interest. Also, arthropods affect us every single day and as such there should be a great importance placed on organisms that have the potential to not only cause us great amounts of trouble but also help.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in the natural world. The workload is light; you don't have to do the readings; the essay prompt is straight-forward; and the exams are all totally reasonable. Marta is a great teacher. Her goal for the course is to share with her students her fascination with arthropods. Drop any squeemishness you might have had about bugs, and come join the fun.",
    "Not a gut, but a great science credit. Marta is one of the best professors at Yale."
