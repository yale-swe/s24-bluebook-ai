   "comments": [
    "Not as fun as it sounds, frankly. Not much work in general but the work there is is kind of brutal and comes in bunches. The work is especially brutal if, as most students in the class do, you ignore the readings and spend class updating your GCal or Facebook stalking. Kinda sprung a take-home final on us at the end too, took like half the class by surprise. Probably more our fault than the prof's though. Faison and Robinson are AWESOME - I think Faison's unit about astrobiology actually had us all paying attention, while Robinson's was interesting because global warming is really fascination. Gishlick, who talked about evolution, was kind of full of himself and condescending...I do not speak for myself only when I say that he was not very likable or approachable. He also graded our \"project\" for evolution really, really tough but his comments on them seemed more like he wanted to make sure that we knew that he was smarter than us than actual constructive criticisms.All of the negatives aside, if you need the SC credit (sup fellow history\/poli sci types), not a bad option at all.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF ALAN GISHLICK AND MICHAEL FAISON ARE TEACHING!!! It is much more work than it appears at first, and you will learn nothing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and hate it! There are better ways to get a science credit than this painful course.",
    "Science and Pseudoscience was an interesting course in when we broke down topics that are discussed a lot in science or that people really seem to care the most about. It was a pretty chill science class for non-science majors and the professors were willing to help if you had any problems in the course.",
    "Yes! But be aware of precisely what this class is,",
    "I'd recommend this class to a student looking for an easy, semi-interesting science credit. Not very many people take the class seriously, but you'll have a few interesting discussions and learn a thing or two. There's a lot on the history of science as well as the philosophy of science, which was really interesting to me as a non science major. I learned the most from the global warming and evolution units -- they were more science heavy and have me a broader understanding of the issues. The astro unit was cool, but not as content-heavy. It's nice having three different perspectives, as they all have interesting perspectives on their respective fields. There are no real exams, only take home projects (including the final).",
    "Science and Pseudoscience is the fetish of reason, the fetish of humanism, the fetish of the Enlightenment. Very little rigor in this class. The professors were clearly ignorant of the horrors of modernity that emerged from the totalitarian power of western rationality. They would do well to read some post-modern critiques of reason. The class was shameless propaganda for dogmatic ideology. The class discussion was always long-winded, and dominated by a couple of pseudo-intellectual YPU types.",
    "This course gives an overview of three topics in current science. I would really recommend it for anyone that does not have much of a scientific background but wants to be informed!",
    "This class was the worst. Don't take it. Professors are inept, problem sets are surprisingly and unpleasantly challenging, help is hard to come by, and class is unbearably dull. Don't do it don't do it it's too much effort for a gut.",
    "I would recommend this class to non-science majors because there is not that much work.",
    "If you need a science credit and are looking for a non-traditional science class then this is the class for you. Just be prepared to do a lot of work.",
    "It's a good science class for non-science majors, although not too engaging.",
    "This class covers global warming, evolution, and search for aliens. The workload isn't heavy. No exams, 4 projects, some psets and reading quizes."
