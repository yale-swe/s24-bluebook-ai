   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. But I would recommend taking a course with Corey if the student wanted to learn about computation in Biophysics. I feel that the analytical part was not useful and I will not be able to use it. The computational part was useful and I wish that I had only more of it so I could use it easily in lab.",
    "Yes if they need computation and math in their research. However, it's not the most useful class if you don't need math in your research.",
    "Students a get superficial understanding of different mathematics which they previously never seen, but the workload is quite heavy.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone looking to learn applied methods of MCB, but not basic applied programming.",
    "Very important information on many math issues you encounter in biochem and biophysics. I think the material is relevant. However be prepared to need a lot of spare time to finish the work.",
    "Best for an intro to Matlab, but maybe don't take it unless you don't mind learning computer programming in a semi-independent manner and\/or plan to use lots of quantitative methods in your research later on. Otherwise other classes might be more relevant.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to brush up your math while learning about mathematical applications in various biological sciences. It was a great course to brush up on math skills while learning about some of the potential applications. One downside I thought was that the focus was a bit too much in structural biology that I would've liked. Most of the people in the class seemed not to be interested in structural biology.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in how some mathematical concepts are applied to the biological sciences.",
    "A broad ranging class that will get you familiar with a bunch of higher level math topics relevant to biologists. The class is worth taking, however be prepared for matlab homework with not a whole lot of guidance.",
    "This course is extremely stressful and a lot of work, even if you have a strong math background. It required far more time than any other class. I would only recommend this class, in its current form, to people who have a programming and math background, or think it will be worthwhile to spend a lot of time on this course, because it will be integral to their dissertation (i.e. it should probably be taken as an elective, possibly in the fall of the second year, if the lab work requires it). Otherwise, as a simplified introduction to math applied to biochemistry and biophysics, it seems to fall short of its goals.",
    "I think it's a good course. It's not easy, but helpful."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course did deepen my knowledge of the field but not my understanding. Too much, too quickly. I do not know if this course will help me. I feel that I will need to take another computational course in order to be able to use computation in my research. I need to do sequence homology searches and evaluate potential secondary RNA structures. It would be nice if the course examined sequence homology.",
    "Overall glaze of too many topics. I would cut down on multiple topics in order to focus more on the classes that are more needed, ie diffeq and linear algebra. Not exactly what I expected and the profs aren't well equipped to teaching math. Need more detail so that we not only know that this math exists but we know how to approach it.",
    "It was nice to see a basic overview of where different analysis used in biophysics stem from.",
    "It contributed heavily. I think it was a good idea to take the course, even though it may affect my grade distribution as a graduate student.",
    "I may end up using these coding techniques (and maybe even the mathematical methods) depending on which lab I join. Regardless, I have a much better idea of FT and linear algebra which I think will be helpful just in general. It's also a good experience to be able to work through a class like this.",
    "This course was of great help in that it re-introduced me to old math topics with various applications in biology. Hopefully when I get to start collecting data, I won't be afraid of collecting large set of data and analyzing it.",
    "It will help me as source of using different mathematical methods to apply to any biophysical or biochemial methodology I can use in the future."
