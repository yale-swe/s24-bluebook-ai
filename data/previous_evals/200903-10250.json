   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course wholeheartedly. As I said above, it provides an thorough working knowledge of Durkheim-Weber-Marx and their work by encouraging an indepth reading of the primary texts themselves. This isn't an opportunity that many courses out there provide. It's also fascinating to see how work done in the course almost immediately benefits and informs work done in other courses.",
    "This course covers many, if not most, of the classical works of the three great thinkers in social sciences. I would definitely recommend this course, because it is necessary for anthropology students to understand well whether and how the thoughts of the great thinkers can be applied to our analyses of the real world.",
    "Anth 501 01 (Classical Social Theory) covers the major theoretical works of Weber, Marx, and Durkheim, and examines how these theorists have informed social-science research in general, and anthropology in particular. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in anthropology as a profession, or in the origins of social-science thought more broadly.",
    "The course is a must for every anthro grad student."

   "comments": [
    "See previous three responses. For the first time in my academic career I was able to commit significant time to reading these primary texts, rather than having to read them secondarily through other materials, ethnographies, etc.",
    "This course helps me understand and think over the important issue of structure and agency. Such knowledge would provide a fundamental framework for future research, both theoretically and analytically.",
    "This was the first time I'd had the chance to engage with many of these texts, and I think this experience will deepen my knowledge not just of the discipline, but of social science in general. I anticipate that the reading of Marx in particular will contribute to my dissertation, but time will tell...",
    "not directly applicable to my research, but necessary to understand and be able to engage with the texts we read in class."
