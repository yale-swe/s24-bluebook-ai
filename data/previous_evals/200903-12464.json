    "Great class, good overview of Chinese politics. Landry is great - really passionate about the material and very engaging in and out of class.Take home midterm and final are long (4000 words each), and in addition to the final paper, you do a lot of writing. Aside from that though, not much work.",
    "The lectures are informative, and you can tell that Professor Landry is excited about the material presented. But because there are few guidelines on what he expects on the graded materials, it makes the class a lot harder than it shuold be.",
    "You will learn a lot of material about current issues in China, but be prepared to write lengthy papers. There is not much work besides reading during most of the course; however, you should definitely keep up in order to avoid getting swamped at the end. If you are interested in China, Chinese history, policies and issues during the 1950s to now, you should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this class only to people who are genuinely interested in China and have some prior knowledge about the country's history and current political and economic systems. The course will be harder without this background information. Otherwise, the course is pretty easy since not all the readings are required and the assignments are just take home essays. Prof. Landry has a tendency to ramble, but overall his lectures are interesting and clear.",
    "Take it if you want an easy grade but don't expect too much.",
    "No, it was a terrible class. You would be better off taking a more interesting class that didn't require more than 4 essays and listening to 50 minutes of random tidbits about the chinese political system.",
    "Landry is not a great lecturer, but it's a cool syllabus and subject that I enjoyed.",
    "I'd recommend it for those who want a general overview of politics in China but not for those looking for deeper analysis and understanding of Chinese politics.",
    "This is a great intro to Chinese politics. If you have China experience, take it as an easy course, but don't consider it a gut- the grading is completely subjective and rather tough."
