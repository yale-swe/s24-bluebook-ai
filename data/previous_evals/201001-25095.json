   "comments": [
    "An introductory lab class in physics. No work necessary outside of the labs themselves, so you must write thoroughly in your lab notebook as you work, but there are no reports to write and turn in afterwards. Topics include mechanical systems, data analysis, circuits, oscilloscopes, etc.",
    "Take it! It's a basic Physics lab that teaches you the fundamentals of lab work.",
    "This lab is pretty awful. You don't do any work outside of class, but this is actually the problem. You have to finish really long, confusing labs in a single sitting while still being expected to produce. This lab is undoubtedly going to change, so next year I expect the labs will be a lot shorter and this won't be as much of a problem. Other than that, it's just something you need to get done. At least there's no homework...",
    "You probably know already if you have to take this. However, if you are between this and 165, take this. It has way less work.",
    "Phys 205L gives you a good, broad overview of how to run physics experiments in the lab. I would recommend it to students who are looking to use it towards a science major; it is a good complement to Phys 201 (less so to Phys 200), given the number of electromagnetism experiments. The downside was that labs tended to run over the timeslot by as much as an hour and were sometimes very tedious to troubleshoot. Otherwise, Phys 205L was pretty much what I had expected in an intro course.",
    "Interesting and not much work (apart from lab times, which sometimes would go over 4 hrs, but was worth it)",
    "Basic intro physics lab. Covers most topics you study in an intro physics class, some with disproportionate emphasis. I can't say I'd recommend it, but who takes a lab because they want to?",
    "Good for learning basics of physics lab techniques in a range of physics fields.",
    "This class is the physics lab for engineers and majors. It's required, I think so my recommendation is more or less meaningless. I wouldn't take this class for fun, but if measuring stuff is your thing then maybe you should consider it. That said, it's pretty well-run and fairly graded. Advice: always read the handouts before class - a student is randomly selected to present on the lab procedures at the beginning of each class and it's painful for everyone if the student has no idea what's going on. Also, make sure as you do each lab that you are actually paying attention to what you are doing, and not just absent-mindedly following the procedures written down, because it will just make it that much harder when you are trying to prepare for the lab practical at the end.",
    "It is a good introduction course to physics labwork. I believe that the amount of work is appropriate. You really don't have to do much outside of class, however you should be prepared to stay later than scheduled for some of the labs as they do take a while to complete. Grading is not very harsh and I do believe that we were well prepared for the practical final.",
    "PHYS 205L is an incredibly arduous course. The experiments always take more time than the three hours that are given, so expect to stay as late as 6:00 pm on some days. The handouts are utterly useless because it is difficult to have an understanding of the experiments without seeing the set-up. The practical is really stressful, especially if the experiment does not work out according to plan. Professors are generally helpful, although somewhat condescending. An okay physics laboratory to take, but I would recommend taking it, unless you have to.",
    "Not great, but not awful. You don't have work outside of class except studying for the final which is nice, but you can sometimes get stuck in the lab for a while.I wouldn't recommend this class if you don't need it, but if you do, it isn't too bad, especially relative to other labs. I definitely learned some things and even had a little fun.",
    "Not a very interesting class.",
    "Definitely take this over 165. Just take it with a friend, it makes it so much better.",
    "This is the more advanced physics lab which is a whirlwind tour through mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. There are no lab write ups, only the notes you take in your lab notebooks which are collected at the end of each lab. The notes are graded on a check minus, check, check plus system, and is pretty fair. Almost every lab runs over it alloted time, so make sure to leave room after this lab before scheduling anything else.",
    "Bleh. Boring physics lab.But no lab reports means it is a very small time commitment.",
    "Take it if you need to take a physics lab.",
    "If the student doesn't mind the length of a lab course, PHYS 205 is great because there is no work outside of class. Plus, the experiments are interesting and the skills taught are useful not only in the lab but for those who want to think clearly and analytically.",
    "Physics 205 got pretty tedious throughout the semester. The labs were way too long to fit into the allotted time period, and I often found myself staying late. However, if you need to take it (pre-med, etc) then it's not the end of the world. My section had a relaxed atmosphere, and I was able to talk to the kids around me and have some fun while getting the lab done. Not an amazing course, but still worth taking.",
    "I absolutely hated this class. It was the worst part of my week, every week. The workload wasn't bad, as there were no out-of-class lab reports. However, labs always took substantially more time than is allocated. The grading was on a ridiculous check, check-plus, check-minus scale. The labs themselves were on stupid topics. Everything we did had to be self-taught. I had to do this lab for my major, so I will (unfortunately) be taking physics lab again next semester. You probably have to take this course too. But if you don't, don't even consider it.",
    "Recommended only if you need it for a major.",
    "Some labs are very very tedious however the topics covered are important (i guess). You do not need to write lab reports which is definitely a plus. Also, you need it to take 206, which seems more interesting.",
    "This class is boring as hell but what's great about it is that you don't have to do any work outside of lab; you do the lab writeups in class. Be forewarned, sometimes the labs can run up to 1 hr. overtime.",
    "You wouldn't take this course unless you need to for your major. All the labs tend to run long, and sometimes the experiments are confusing to set up or carry out. It's not the most interesting course, but it's not awful either. There are no lab reports though, so you put in all your time in lab. I do think the lab helped me understand some topics better simply because I had to wrestle with them for several hours. My Professor (Nikhil Padmanahaban) and TA (Gennady) were both great, super friendly and helpful. I recommend them both.",
    "If you are going to be a physics major you have to take this, but otherwise I would steer clear. Lab was one of my least favorite parts of the week. The labs are long and stressful, and almost always take longer than the allotted time. I never felt like I had the time to get to understand the instruments, and I really wish we had been taught about error propagation and data analysis rather than just having to try to figure it out. The whole course has a general attitude of \"just figure it out,\" which I understand is important if you want to be a physicist, but I think there are certain things, like methods of analyzing data and how to use important instruments that are worth taking the time to explain. I felt like everyone already knew what was going on and I wasn't part of the club.",
    "I would recommend Physics 205L to another student because I think it is the best of the introductory physics labs. I would highly recommend my section with Brian because he is the best TA.",
    "Great class if you wish to investigate physical phenomena or if you are a physics\/engineering major.",
    "Physics 205 covers interesting topics although in a manner that is not coherent. The labs jump around from week to week and the handouts are not clearly written. However, there are no outside lab write ups which are nice. I would recommend this class if you need a physics lab as a requirement for your major or if you are a premed.",
    "The labs are very straightforward- not particularly exciting, but not bad. There are no lab reports, which is a huge plus.",
    "This was a class that, with long lab days and nitpicky grading, was overall a challenging but good class. Must love practical physics to enjoy this class.",
    "If you are truly interested in physics than I would certainly recommend this course. It is not difficult (the only work is the weekly in-class write-ups) and the labs are actually interesting. In fact, I felt the labs often bolstered my understanding of the concepts in question, which we had learned in class already. I would recommend beginning the labs cycle after one semester of physics.",
    "Physics lab is exhausting and aggravating, as you have to cram in a lot of things into a short period of time to avoid going over the normally-allotted three hours. Some of the experiments are kind of neat, but the whole course in general is a bit of an ordeal. That said, there is basically no work outside of class, so it is a contained ordeal. The lab test at the end was pretty difficult. A lot of the time is spent asking or waiting for the TA or the head of the lab for troubleshooting on your experimental setup. As such, it probably makes a difference who you have running your section. I thought my section TA and leader were both helpful and nice people, but the class itself was still very tiring. I definitely felt that second semester orgo lab was easier than this and also more interesting, just because of how the two labs were structured.",
    "The only reason I would recommend taking this class is if you plan on doing physics, in which case it's required. Labs tend to be long and tedious, but you do end up learning what you need to learn (instrumentation, data analysis, etc.) They usually went over the 3 hours allotted, but not by too much. The nice thing about this class is that there are no write-ups and therefore no work to be done outside class, except for the end of semester lab practical. The lab practical really sucks. I had a good lab instructor and TA though, so although this wasn't a particularly enjoyable class, it wasn't too painful either.",
    "This class was such an unpleasant experience, but unfortunately you need it to do anything in engineering or the sciences. I would recommend taking the Monday section to get it out of the way early in the week. Be prepared to stay late every time. On the bright side, no lab reports!",
    "Physics 205L is the worst class I've taken at Yale. It's incredibly poorly taught and frustrating. Each lab includes about 5 experiments. Even when I rushed through the experiments, I usually finished between .5 and 1 hour after schedule, as did many other students. The only instruction is in the form of a handout that you're supposed to read before lab; concepts are never actually taught. The only way you can learn is by asking questions in the lab, but there wasn't enough time for that. The one perk of this class is that there are no lab reports, just the write-up that you do during lab.",
    "Physics 205L is a science lab so it is pretty monotonous, but as far as labs go it is pretty good. There are no out of class lab write-ups and the labs themselves aren't too hard and are sometimes pretty interesting.",
    "Useful lab. It's generally required for a major if you're taking it at all, but it's fairly pleasant. The labs can get monotonous, but while you're there you don't really think about the time. Also, no lab reports is a huge boon - it makes sense for physics, but still, don't take that for granted.",
    "Good class but take it staggered with PHYS201 (not 200) so it is easier to understand material (ie circuits etc which is mainly the lab practical). Grading (check minus, check, check plus) is a bit ambiguous though. Premeds should just take PHYS160 or 180 and lab 165."
