   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it because now I actually know what statistics are. It makes reading scientific papers a billion times easier because now at least some of it makes sense. However, the class is fast at times and the subject matter is pretty dry.",
    "Solid class. JDRS makes stats pretty amusing despite the sleepy after-lunch time slot. Making a study group for the homework will make everything way easier. Midterms were doable study the notes and keep up with the homework and youll do okay. Great QR! Note that this year we had JDRS for both parts of the semester, so I don't know what this would be like with the usual life sciences instructor.",
    "Take it if you need to. Take it with Prof. R-S. Otherwise, it is not a life-changing class by any means, but perhaps just a course in which you acquire good skills.",
    "A good, easy class if you have already taken AP Statistics. Tests don't require much studying, and you can do well even if you don't attend lecture. Regardless, I definitely learned a lot of useful techniques.",
    "A solid intro stat course. You're probably taking it because you're required to, but I'd recommend it even if you're not. The concepts are useful even if you don't employ them academically or professionally.",
    "A good intro to statistics course, would recommend.",
    "Gotta take what you gotta take",
    "This course provides a great and thorough look at Statistics, just be prepared for a fast paced class. But reading the notes closely should be enough to do the weekly homeworks well. Professor Reuning-Scherer makes classes fun, and he and all the TA's are approachable.",
    "I would recommend it, since it was engaging and not a bad QR credit.",
    "Definitely take this if you have no experience with statistics. Prof. Reuning-Scherer is a great lecturer, and he might not always succeed in engaging the class like he would like, but you will get some laughs out of his stories. There are tons of resources available for help throughout the week, and it is one of those courses whose real life applications literally stare you in the face once you start doing the homework. If you're someone who would like a build a certain basic knowledge base of tools for approaching the world, statistics should be included in your toolbox--whether you're going into medicine, politics, marketing, etc. I do recommend STAT 101 over the STAT 105 (Medicine) section though--I feel you learn more of the important statistical skills in 101 while 105 from my impression of it has more of a focus on reading science papers and knowing how to analyze the statistics used for specifically that. If you're pre-med, you'll take plenty of courses involving reading papers--I think getting the general stats skills on their own is very important.",
    "I would recommend to another student who needs stats for their major\/pre-health school requirements or is just interested in learning basic statistics procedures. Problem set due every week, generally very simple, if you're stuck you can get help from JDRS. Two midterms during the portion of the class where all the stats classes are combined. Very simple\/straightforward midterms, similar to the practice midterms provided online. Grading is very lenient on midterms.",
    "The class is manageable and can be on the easier side if you have previous stats knowledge from high school. If not you made need to put in some more work, but it is manageable.",
    "STAT 101 01 is a good class to take if your major requires you to do so. It gives you a basic understanding of statistical analysis, but mostly utilizes MiniTab so I would not recommend it to another student if there is no need for them to take it.",
    "Aaaand if you're going to take this course, DEFINITELY TAKE THE FLIPPED VERSION OF THE CLASS. Sign up for this class, show up for the flipped class the hour afterwards. Here's why: -You listen to video lectures as homework, show up to class for help\/answering questions. -NO in-class MIDTERMS or final exam. Instead, two take-home midterms and a final project. -Flipped class is usually shorter and WAY more chill. The class was as great as a stats class could possibly be, and it was way easier and less stressful than the regular version of the class. You get help directly from the professor, and you learn how to do your homework problems. Highly recommended.",
    "If you're in any kind of science major, take this class! Very helpful and applicable. Not too hard, and very enjoyable. I was dreading this class and now am very grateful I took it. It helped strengthen my lab reports for other classes this semester.",
    "Basic intro stats course. Most, if not all, of the students are taking it because they need it for their major. I took it when Walter Jetz (the normal professor for 101) was on sabbatical, so Jonathan Reuning-Scherer was teaching this section along with 103 (social sciences). I had taken stats in high school before, but still felt that the class moved rather quickly. After separating into the different sections, I was learning completely new material. It's also helpful to work on homework assignments with friends. Homework is also quite different from exams, so be sure to do the practice exams."
