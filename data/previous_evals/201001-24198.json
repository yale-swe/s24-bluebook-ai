   "comments": [
    "cool class if you have any interest in drawing the figure, can be intimidating for non-art majors, but definitely worth taking. it's good to have a different kind of work than papers and tests",
    "YESSSSS! I would recommend this course whole-heartedly with George Rush, but he is leaving next year. If the structure of the class stays the same and a comparable professor is teaching it, i would strongly recommend it. It teaches you different approaches to drawing and works with students at any level. Independent work, and not too much. Great class.",
    "A good class. You learn about a lot of different art materials (pen, ink wash, etc.). You also learn a lot of different ways to render the form. A lot of work, but worth it.",
    "Take it. It's a lot of work, but you'll really see the products of your efforts.",
    "I truly enjoyed this class. It addressed many different approaches to drawing and I believe it helped my personal style evolve. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in art, not necessarily ones just interested in portraying the figure.",
    "I would say I definitely recommend it, but I was informed that Professor Rush is leaving this year, so I don't know anything about how the course will be next semester.",
    "An exhaustive course in drawing the human figure. Not as much a course about the figure itself, but rather how to draw the figure.",
    "totally take it. especially if you are not an art major- it's great fun and will be a relaxing break from your other classes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Figure Drawing to another student. Provides you with invaluable skills and improves your drawing skills exponentially.",
    "figure drawing as taught by george rush focused on concept rather than technique; you learn to imply rather than depict form, mass, etc. not a course for honing technical skills (though, to be fair, which course at yale is?). sometimes felt less about the figure than about spaces\/compositions which just so happened to have a figure."
