   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Dope. Do it.",
    "Yes. Highly recommend.",
    "Lab meetings vary from PI to PI, but I would highly recommend taking PSYC 495 for juniors and seniors who are trying to get a feel for the type of research in which they are interested. You will meet and listen to so many grad students and post docs that it is very easy to become inspired and invigorate your passion for the field.",
    "Working at a lab is a great experience and if you are considering majoring in psychology at all you should definitely try it out. You get to do some hands on work and see all the stages of the research process -things you would never learn in class. Also you work side by side with other psyc majors and grad students which creates an inspiring and interesting atmosphere.",
    "Each person in the lab did different presentations on specific subjects, and it was very enlightening.",
    "This course is a great way to get involved in psychology research at an introductory level. It is really a gateway to the field and thus highly recommended.",
    "Great way to see whether research is for you! the professor and lab manager are always willing to answer questions and get you more involved.",
    "A small discussion based meeting in which undergrads and grad students discuss recently published studies with a professor.",
    "It really depends on what lab you're in, but this is a good way to earn that extra half credit.",
    "Psychology 495 is a great way to get credit for involvement in research without a huge time commitment. You can arrange an individualized plan of involvement with the professor with whom you plan to work.",
    "it totally depends on what section you do- i did the lecture series in child development and social policy and it was great. you go to an interesting 1 hour lecture series each week by someone either in the child development or the social policy field and then either do a two page response paper each week or a 10 page paper at the end",
    "its research for psych",
    "I'd highly recommend it for those who want to get a part of their senior requirement done before senior year. It's a great way to get a head start and study closely with a psych professor.",
    "i would definitely recommend it!"
