    "Eye opening, especially if you are not an art major and are actually an economics major like I am. GREAT GREAT CLASS!!! I loved it!",

    "This is a course dedicated to more abstract\/conceptual sculpture. Do not take it if you are looking to develop certain skills in woodworking, metal, or mold-making. With that said, this course is extremely open ended and will allow you to dabble in any of these processes if you desire. The assignments are thought-provoking and expanded the way that I approach creative thinking and the artistic process. If you want a great break from tough academics and are willing to spend time developing an artistic idea, then you should absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes! So much fun. Daphne's great. So many opportunities to take your work in any direction you want and to spend as much or as little time on it.",
    "Take this if you want to love sculpture! If you want to \"learn\" it, maybe something else...",
    "Great class. You get out what you put in. Take it.",
    "YES."
