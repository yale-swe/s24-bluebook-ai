   "comments": [
    "This class really helped me to look critically at the history of Israeli society and to gain an understanding of both sides of the argument. This class also taught me how to take documents and make meaningful analysis of them and add my own thoughts to the conversation.",
    "Through this course I gained multiple insights into the religious, social, and racial dynamics within Israel. For example, while I knew that Zionism is the ideology that led people to establish Israel, through this class I learned that there are actually many different strands of Zionism that have and continue to come into conflict. Additionally, I have learned how Israel has changed over its short history and, perhaps more interestingly, how Israels view of itself and its history has changed. For me, the class was most interesting when we discussed how the memory of major events in Jewish history has changed over the last 60 years.",
    "We learned everything about the history of the State of Israel, methods of analysis of its different peoples, ways to analyze different narratives, and how to synthesize our thoughts in different forms of presentation (essay and in-class presentations, etc).",
    "I learned how to analyze societal issues and learn about a country from all angles.",
    "From this cours I gained an academic, research based knowledge on the state and society of Israel. I learned the origins of the Zionism, the demographic changes and their influences on society, and I learned about salient traditions or issues of Israeli government and society.",
    "The class successfully taught me how to think with nuance about Israel. I learned about Israeli politics, culture and society, and now find that I have a quite nuanced understanding of the country and life there. The class also gives insight into different perspectives of people living in Israel.",
    "I gained lots of new perspectives on issues within Israel. I feel like I have a much more nuanced and balanced view of domestic issues within Israel. I also have a much greater understanding of the modern-day history of Israel. The class overall was very informative and Professor Roginsky did an excellent job of presenting many different perspectives on a range of topics.",
    "I learned how to evaluate and synthesize sociological arguments and evaluate them in a way that determines what type of biases they may be hiding. I also learned how to evaluate statistics.",
    "I gained an in depth and nuanced understanding of the land of Israel, its people, and its society. I developed better research skills and a better understanding of how to approach and begin research."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that this course is very strong its its breadth of topics and also how deeply it delves into those topics and both sides of the argument for every topic. As a weakness, this course sometimes feels like it gets bogged down in small facts when I felt that the larger picture was much more important.",
    "One of the primary strengths of this course is its area of focus: I found it incredibly rewarding and refreshing to learn about Israel in a context other than the Israeli-Palestinian (or Israeli-Arab) conflict. While yes this conflict is an important component of Israels place in the world, it is by no means the only one and by only focusing on this conflict (as many courses that discuss Israel) we develop an incomplete picture of Israel. Another strength of this course is that it is remarkably balanced. In my experience I have found that it can be difficult to take a strong position on Israel or any of its actions because people will harshly and unfairly criticize not only the point, but also the personal articulating it on a personal level. This class was very different and praises as well as criticisms of Israel were equally welcomed. The only weaknesses I can think of for this class is very specific. First of all, I dont the midterm exam was very fair: there was a huge focus on very small details as opposed to larger themes, and in my opinion the large themes should have been weighted more. However, all of the other assignments were very effective.",
    "This is a strong course. The instructor has worked hard to develop a very clear structure, with topics that touch on a wide variety of aspects about the State of Israel. The course is as objective as possible, and focuses on different narratives.",
    "This course is not biased; Dr. Roginsky's goal is to present issues to the class from all sides and angles. I appreciated how many different topics we covered and how we explored them through readings, documentaries, and class discussions. The weakness of this course is that I wish we had spent more time developing our own opinions and having more debates in class.",
    "The strength of this course is the strong student involvement as evidenced by the class presentations. The weakness of this course is the lack of debate and student led conversation when discussing the readings",
    "I liked the class as a whole, it is well structured for continuous engagement. The reading responses were useful, as were the documentaries. I also liked the presentation. No meaningful changes!",
    "The course is excellent at providing lots of interesting information on a range of topics as well as many different viewpoints on these topics. I would have like to learn more about the 1967 War, the 1973 War, and the 1982 War with Lebanon. These were mentioned frequently, especially in the later readings and it would have been helpful to know more about these topics. The discussion was always interesting and helpful. I enjoyed the class presentations. I felt like it helped me get a good sense of how the issues we were studying were being discussed in present-day Israel.",
    "Strengths: Robust readings with interesting arguments and reasonable amounts of pages, an engaging syllabus that provided many different types of assignments, the presentment of many different types of perspectives Weaknesses: Too much of a reliance on statistics and facts and not as much on analysis of written work.",
    "I feel like on the midterm, there was too much of the grade focused on true or false questions. I prepared many hours for this mid term and was very devoted to the class material and the topics of study, but I did poorly on the true and false section. I feel that this metric of grading based on true and false questions do not accurately depict my engagement and effort in the class. However, the class material and the class itself were great. I always looked forward to joining in the class discussion and exploring interesting topics regarding Israeli society."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students! Dina is an excellent professor and this class really does a great job of helping to understand the roots of many controversial issues in Israeli society today.",
    "Grading was way too harsh",
    "Yes, I would. I would recommend this course to almost anyone because it provides a uniquely in-depth look at Israel and I believe that most everyone has some interest in Israel. However, I would also say that a student should only take the course if they want to learn about Israel beyond just the Israel-Palestine conflict and they are willing to have some of their view points on Israel challenged.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn more about the State of Israel and the different peoples living in, or interacting with, the state. The course is very interesting and objective, and I was absorbed during every lecture. It's also interactive; there's a combination of straight-up lecture and thorough discussion about different perspectives, and students are always encouraged to contribute. The workload was very reasonable and manageable while ensuring that we learned the material.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone seeking to learn more about Israel and the issues plaguing internal Israeli society.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because it is an excellent introduction to all things israel",
    "This class is great!! Professor Roginsky is amazing at explaining the nuance in Israel and the class is perfect if you want to get to know a ton about Israel without biased opinions.",
    "I would recommend this course, particularly if you know very little about Israel. It is helpful in thinking through the politics of the modern Middle East and in gaining a balanced view on issues in Israel.",
    "State and Society in Israel is a great class to learn about Israeli history\/society\/culture in a non-controversial way. Professor Roginsky does a good job of presenting all different perspectives and making it as non-partisan of a class as possible while still leaving room for personal opinions and debate. For anyone interested in Israel, its conflict with Palestine, or Zionism, this class is a must take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, specifically, to students who are not familiar with Israeli history and society. I learned a great amount from this class that I had no experience with before. I feel like Israeli society is now a topic that I can discuss with ease. There are many students at Yale who know a lot about the subject and this class can help you relate to many kids on campus."
