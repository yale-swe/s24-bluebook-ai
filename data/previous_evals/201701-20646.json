    "Overall an extremely dry and boring class but some sections (on education, poverty and inequality toward the end are interesting!) It's basically like a history course on the indian economy and if you don't like the class during shopping period, don't hesitate in dropping it! There is one midterm paper (10-15 pages) and one final (6 essays, 500 words each) and section every week. Attendance and participation in class & section counts toward the grade. There are 200-500 pages of reading in a week (that are mostly very boring)",
    "Learned a lot about economic challenges in India that can be applied to other developing countries. Very cool concept.",
    "Great overview into India and a framework to think about developing countries in a new way. Gave me a new perspective on India.",
    "I have a broad understanding of India's economic history since 1947.",
    "Improved analysis of developmental economics",
    "Basic understanding of the Indian economy, its strengths, its weakenesses, and future paths of growth",
    "I learned how to examine the economic progress made by a single country (India) and how to study a country's economic history.",
    "Learned about Indian economic history and the impacts of structural reforms.",
    "detailed information about the advances India has made in banking systems, infrastructure, poverty alleviation, etc"

    "Make presentations more in sync with lectures! Have more interacting activities in class like group discussions answering a question you pose. Decrease the number of required readings -- no one does them all anyway & no one has time to read 200-400 pages a week. seriously, what the heck!?",
    "The format of the final exam was miserable. Lots to write in a short 24 hour time period. I would recommend maybe changing this to a final paper.",
    "Nice solid overview of India's economy. I wish that the class had used more case studies\/anecdotes\/more zoomed-in experiences of India's economy and less bird's-eye-view macroeconomic material (lectures were very heavy on charts that I could find online myself), but I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Well-organized and engaging!",
    "Many of the topics taught are up for debate, but they were presented as fact. I think I probably agree with the side Professor Mohan took, but the class would have been more engaging if it weren't so one sided.",
    "Lectures can be too monotonous",
    "The lectures are far too short and broad to be particularly helpful for the midterm and final. Essentially, the readings are the only necessary material for the class (and then again, only some of them). I feel that most of what I learned came from the readings and the lectures were just a supplementary recap. Prof. Mohan's insights and personal stories were the best part of the class, although the topics and short lecture time didn't allow for him to talk at length about his previous experience. I feel that he would be far more interesting to listen to in his Central Banking course.",
    "Lectures were pretty repetitive, lots of reading, but low homework load.",
    "Lectures tended to be a bit repetitive. The same themes were repeated over and over.",
    "Interesting material and a very knowledgeable Professor. However, lectures focused too much on statistics and less on the intuitive sense behind them."

    "Honestly, only take it if you're really into learning about the history of Indian economy. You can do well just by working on your midterm and final for like 2 days but it's not worth it if you wish you skipped class every single time. You won't learn that much. Class is very repetitive and boring lecture style.",
    "Cool class. Not amazingly organized to be perfectly honest, but I learned a lot without having to do the readings for the most part. Lecture is good, interesting, and relaxing.",
    "A good course if you want to learn more about India's economy, but not as good as something like Next China for hard-to-describe reasons. The lectures take a high-level macroeconomic approach (because that's Professor Mohan's expertise), which I personally found less engaging, but which I'm sure a lot of econ majors in the room were very at home with.",
    "Absolutely.Great insight into India from an expert!",
    "No. Prof. Mohan is a terrible lecturer and the content is very dry. I regret taking this.",
    "I was really excited about this course, as someone who is both interested in Economics and India. It was a bit of a let down. Classes were just not engaging, which I thought wouldn't matter too much because the material was so interesting to me, but it did.",
    "Although an Econ one, this course should appeal to many other majors.",
    "If you want to learn about the economic history of India, just do the readings on the Syllabus without taking the class. The topics are interesting, but mandatory lectures that aren't particularly helpful make this class somewhat frustrating. Prof. Mohan's stories and insights regarding his work at the RBI were the best part of the class, but the course was too broad to allow him to focus on that in detail. Essay midterm is generously graded and not too difficult to do given the abundance of sources you can draw from. The take home exam was a little difficult since you had 24 hours to answer 6 page-long essay questions with relevant citations (finding data was the most time consuming part).",
    "Would recommend. Overall a pretty interesting course but lectures were repetitive",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about India and its economic history.",
    "Yes if you are interested in India and developmental economics."
