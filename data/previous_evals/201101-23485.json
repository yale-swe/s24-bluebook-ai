   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professors, TA, presentations, structure.Weaknesses: This class is built for undergrads, not for public health students, which is extremely upsetting. The material is very basic if you have any knowledge of global health issues and at times it felt like more of an intro class at SOM than a strategic thinking class at YSPH.",
    "This course is different to most others. You do not \"learn\" academically speaking, what you do learn are useful practical skills on the process of strategic problem solving, policy brief writing and group presentations. I think these are valuable skills that cannot but be helpful in whatever career path someone chooses.I only had one problem with the course. The undergraduates taking it were too many. They are conditioned here at Yale to speak up constantly and talk for long as they possibly can. Whilst some had interesting points to make, being concise is a skill they lack - and that is a useful skill for everyone too. Grad students were often annoyed by this and we wished lectures could go on with less interruption by the undergrads.",
    "The weakness is the group project. Groups like mine put over 50 hours of prep into something that seemed like a farce in the end because of the \"real world\" antics the professors mount to try to ruffle you while you're presenting. For all the work we put in, would be nice to have an actual work product.LOTS OF UNDERGRADS. Would be great to have this course offered only for graduate students.Otherwise, good course.",
    "Fantastic",
    "Strengths:Learning the steps in strategic problem solving was a great experience with really beneficial lectures and wonderful guest speakers. The TA sessions was especially useful in applying lessons learned in class. Sarah was really great.Weakness:Undergraduates in the course. Working with undergraduates on a group project was difficult. One that I worked with was unorganized, showed up unprepared, and only wanted to meet late at night (10PM) and only near the main campus. When he\/she did show up; was unprepared. The final week before presentation he\/she wanted to take full responsibility of the project, and was very disrespectful of others input and time. There was a lot of wasted time (a lot) that could have been used more effectively.",
    "It gave me a clear understanding of the steps toward good policy formation and writing policy briefs and how that plays out in the global context.Some lectures were a bit tedious and I thought over simple for the concepts that were trying to be relayed."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great course to learn practical skills on strategic problem solving. I found the undergrad participation to be somewhat distracting, but overall I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it for anyone, as these skills can be applied to all career options.",
    "If you can stand a class that is a majority of brilliant, Yale College kids, take it. If that makes you shutter (especially considering the LARGE amount of group work involved), skip it.",
    "I highly recommend this course",
    "Gives a nice overview of topics in global health and concepts in strategic thinking, but the real value here comes from interaction with other students and the amazing professors. The ongoing writing assignment was fine but not an incredible learning experience (since I have taken other courses with a focus on strategic thinking), but the groupprojects and particularly the group presentations were incredibly valuable as someone going into this field. The professors are amazingly open and friendly.",
    "I would recommend this course because the strategy methods taught and the professors were excellent but I would be wary of taking a class that involves a group project with undergraduates.",
    "I feel it is a worthwhile course. I felt at times it was hard having both grad students and undergrads in the class but at times that was also a benefit."
