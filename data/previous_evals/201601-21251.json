    "This class is required for a lot of majors, so I guess it's fine to take. If you don't need to take it though, I would definitely avoid it.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. The content is interesting enough, but lectures are boring (and 1pm - 2.15pm is a terrible timeslot). Exams are too easy, and considering the class is curved, your grade may end up being somewhat random.",
    "Definitely take it no matter you want to be an econ major or not",
    "I took this class because I think it's important to have a foundational knowledge of economics, not because it was a prerequisite. I did end up getting a lot out of the class, and I've found myself connecting the ideas learned in class to real life events in the world. Finding a study group who you can do and check over problem sets with is really beneficial. Econ can be a little tough conceptually, but will definitely be easier when you have others to discuss with and bounce ideas around. Professor Goldberg was great, I really enjoyed her teaching style.",
    "Must take course that exposes you to the fundamentals of economics.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE WITH PROFESSOR GOLDBERG.",
    "If you need the QR or are majoring in Econ, might as well take it. Otherwise the class is a little dry, not a gut, and slightly difficult. You'll most likely need to study to do well. Don't take thinking it'll be a blow off or life-altering: neither will prove true.",
    "Basic intro to microecon. Is what it is, take it if you're an econ major obviously or if you want to know some econ for a job\/internship or just life.",
    "Good course (take it with Goldberg), but don't expect it to be particularly thrilling. Solid base in Micro and not too much stress\/work. But if you aren't interested in econ, it won't be particularly enjoyable. It is not a gut but is not very much work.",
    "It's not actually that easy of a QR so be careful - not hard enough to credit-D and surprisingly math heavy.",
    "VERY easy class for STEM people (I had never taken ECON before but it's mostly 9th grade algebra.) You also MUST take 115 with Prof. Goldberg because she is PHENOMENAL. She is the most clear, logical and direct professor I have ever had, and that's coming from someone who has had 20+ STEM professors. She is amazingly helpful and responsive, and makes the class both a good learning experience and a breeze. Go to lecture and listen to her and you literally never need a book.",
    "Standard introductory course. Worth taking to see if you suit the abstract thinking required of microeconomics.",
    "ECON 115 was a good overview course for intro to microeconomics. Professor Goldberg does a good job of temporarily bringing in real examples of what economists do which give a good idea of what majoring in economics could lead to.",
    "I think it is a good intro level course; it moves at a good pace and the work level is not overwhelming.",
    "No, horrible class. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
    "It provides you with fundamental knowledge of Economics. Take it.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 because it provides a background in microeconomics which is something that I think everyone should know a little bit about. I would say, however, that if you're not interested in being an ECON major, waiting to take this class in the spring with Professor Goldberg would definitely be worth it.",
    "It gives you a good overview of the basic concepts of Microeconomics. Professor Goldberg does a great job explaining the concepts and her powerpoint notes are very useful. If you would like a basic introduction to Economics, this course will be good.",
    "no",
    "A must-take class at Yale. It teaches you all the basics of economics, which if you don't know, you should know!!",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to, although you're much better off taking it in the spring than in the fall. Seriously don't take this class if you just need a QR or feel like Econ is one of those classes you just want to take. It's a bunch of abstract concepts combined with pretty simple math. In order to succeed in this class you really need to be invested in it by doing the psets, reading the textbook, doing the practice problems, and going to lecture. However, the course won't inspire you to go on with Econ any further or incite a passion for the subject. Go to lecture because otherwise you won't understand anything just from reading the slides alone. I really regret taking the class because I took it Credit\/D and I'm still not even sure how things will turn out...",
    "Econ 115 is an introductory microeconomics course with an emphasis on vocabulary and mathematical application. Even if you have taken AP micro in high school, I would recommend that you take this course, since I found the material to be taught a bit differently.",
    "If you are going to take micro (and honestly everyone should take an econ class) then do it with Goldberg. She rocks and the class is SO fair. The exams are what you learn in class, the psets, and similar to old exams. Not many curveballs that are unreasonable. Straightforward, interesting, great class.",
    "Intro Micro Econ is a good and useful, not too-hard class. Take it even if you took AP Econ in high school - it does like twice as much material as the AP course. Don't go straight to Intermediate unless you need to - Intermediate is mostly math derivations of the concepts which Intro teaches and solidifies. Exams in Intro were straightforward and almost exactly like the problem sets - no scary things there. Just keep up with the work throughout the semester and you'll be fine.",
    "Solid introduction to microeconomics. I had never taken econ before and I feel like I learned a lot. There were two midterms, one final, and weekly PSETS. Take this course if you want to learn about economics but be prepared to study for the exams especially if you don't put a lot of time into the class on a regular basis.",
    "Yes, take this course though you do not plan to study economics.",
    "The course is kind of a mess. The material isn't very engaging. The lecture notes were not organized and didn't make much sense outside of lecture. TAs were not that great. The prof, Penny Goldberg, is nice but alternates between being repetitive and rushing through material. There isn't any resource provided by the class to help you learn the material, and not much material to help you practice outside of psets and old exams. Upsides: course material isn't difficult, especially with some AP Micro background (but I would say 30-40% of the course is outside of AP Micro). Nice curve with about 40-50% A\/A- and you get to drop 2 out of 9 psets. Light workload.",
    "While I think economics can be interesting and Professor Goldberg was very sweet, I didn't love the class. It's kind of a boring intro class that I sometimes found frustrating because I felt like I wasn't fully taught how to do that actual problems. BUT, it definitely gives you a good foundation in economics and just life in general. I don't regret taking it because its nice to know what politicians and economists are talking about when they say things like negative externalities, cap and trade, etc.",
    "I would recommend even though it's quite boring because econ is one of those courses you kind of have to take in college.",
    "Very standard introductory microeconomics class, but truly important subject matter for everyone to know and a pretty easy class to take if you have any quantitative reasoning skills. As someone that has a strong math background but knew nothing of economics before this class, I found tit very beneficial, I learned a ton, and the work was not overwhelming. The key is just GO TO LECTURE, so many people don't but if you do and take good notes the class is a breeze, and Goldberg is such an accomplished, interesting, and intelligent lecturer it is a shame to not go. Because it is so large and an intro class, it is run like a standard lecture and this is perhaps the biggest flaw to the class as some people are very engaged and some are not paying attention at all, creating a bit of a disconnect in the class. But Goldberg is so intelligent and well qualified to teach the course, so if you are paying attention and coming to class you get a lot from the course. This is a class that everyone should take, as the information is super important and applicable and this class is taught in a challenging but accessible way.",
    "Generic introductory economics class in my opinion, nothing very special. Take the lecture, not the seminar. For exams, study the lectures, past p-sets, and practice midterms. Re-do the problems on the p-sets and practice midterms, because the real exams closely mirror the problems on those. Also go to ALL lectures, it's so easy to fall behind when you start to miss just one lecture!",
    "it's ok, not relevant if not interested in econ",
    "Econ 115 is a good introductory microeconomics course. It provides a solid foundation for future economics courses. I would recommend the course to any student who would like to take more courses in economics or who needs it for their major.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend the class to someone who didn't need it as a requirement. If you have a previous background in economics and calculus, it is less likely that you will struggle in the class. I personally feel like I learned enough to understand basic concepts but not enough to put any of it into practice.",
    "learn basic econ concepts and feel more knowledgeable about how the world and markets work. not too much work if you go to lectures, go over the notes and the textbook, and attend section. useful and fun!",
    "For those trying to survey majors at Yale, I'd recommend this course",
    "The class isn't hard math, just a lot of memorizing of concepts and sometimes difficult when applying them to new situations or scenarios. If you do the work and go to section, it is pretty easy to master the material. Ask questions when things are confusing - often the professor or TAs will either have made a mistake or have a good explanation for something you didn't understand.",
    "Difficult but interesting",
    "I really liked ECON 115 and I definitely recommend to take this class. I had never taken an economics class so I thought the class was overall really interesting, even thought it could also get really boring at times. I would definitely suggest having a strong mathematical background as there is a lot of (easy) math in this class and it's better to focus your time on understanding the concepts rather than try to understand both the math and the concepts. Also, the workload is really not bad at all and super manageable! Professor Goldberg is also a great professor and I recommend taking the class when she teaches it.",
    "Decent class. Felt like I would have been able to learn all of the material in a week or two. The problem sets weren't difficult. Just be smart and stay ahead of the curve. Would probably not have taken the class if I didn't need it for my major. Still, it wasn't a *bad* class. Not much you can really do to spice up teaching intro micro, anyways.",
    "A good introduction to microeconomics. It doesn't require calculus, so the math isn't difficult but it also means that some of the formulas are just given \"as is\" and isn't explained clearly. Weekly Psets that are very manageable (and seems like is graded on completion and not correctness). Take it with Professor Penny! She is a great lecturer. Also, she usually reviews previous lesson's concepts before starting on new material, so actually you will learn everything of the course by just attending one lecture per week.",
    "Econ 115 was a pretty good course when taught by professor Goldberg. The lectures are admittedly a bit boring, however, if you pay attention, you will learn everything you need for the homework and exams. Homework is pretty straightforward and the exams aren't too difficult if you put a bit of effort into them.",
    "An analysis of basic microeconomic theory, evaluated through problem sets and exams.",
    "It's a good introduction to microeconomics, and I found the curriculum is designed to be either applicable to making real-life decisions or being a good citizen, both of which are important. I went into the class thinking I'd find it mind-numbing and uninteresting, but I came out contemplating an Econ major (though your mileage may vary). Highly recommend taking the class with Pinelopi Goldberg!",
    "A relatively straightforward course. Pay attention in class, do the psets diligently, go to section, and maybe use office hours, and you should be fine. Can be tricky at times.",
    "Every student at Yale should take this course to see if economics is the field of study for them. Solid teacher, fair assignments and exams, and you'll be sure to learn a ton!",
    "Lots of good resources on the class website--use them!",
    "The course serves as a good introduction to the principles of microeconomics. However, if you have taken calculus and some multivariable, try to place in intermediate micro, because more math will help, I think, helps with understanding the concepts. Also, be prepared for very dry material and little real-life applications or problems.",
    "Basic econ intro. I would say take it because econ seems like a common knowledge sort of topic that everyone should have some sort of grasp on, but it will not be particularly fascinating unless you are specifically interested in econ.",
    "A very large class that covers much",
    "Take it because it isn't that bad and Econ is important",
    "Good introductory course with weekly PSets and 3 exams, final is cumulative and readings are not necessary if you go to class",
    "Wouldn't recommend taking this just for the QR credit, but if you like Econ it's not terrible.",
    "No. Because this is a required, entry level course, Yale makes no effort to teach the material in an engaging or even efficient manner. This is a failure of the university to deliver the exciting or at least informative teaching it claims to specialize in (especially in Econ!!). The disappointment that is this course shows how little Yale actually cares about students' learning on a foundational level--they know we have to take the class so they don't care about how well taught it is.",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to microeconomics -- not incredibly difficult but provides the necessary concepts. For those with a strong math background I would recommend trying to start with intermediate micro in order to see the more advanced math at work.",
    "Hard. Not my thing but a good class to take in general for life",
    "Intro micro is exactly what you'd expect it to be. It's a dry, no frills intodroctutory course to economics that a lot of people take. Midterms and final could be challenging, but it's all about working together to study, which is a treat life skill in the end. It's also a QR, which is a plus for many.",
    "Good I would recommend",
    "ECON 115 is not the most exciting class, but I enjoyed it. I would recommend the course to students that are curious about what it means to study Microeconomic theory, but not as a gut course. Some of the concepts are more difficult than others, but there is always someone to help you.",
    "A classic economics course you need to take for many other classes or majors. Although it can seem pretty dreadful at the time, once you're through it you'll be thankful.",
    "Very difficult if you've had no exposure to ECON. The most important thing about the class is to learn how to master the psets and midterms. Know how to do the problems.",
    "Mediocrity to the extreme. Seriously, this class is neither good nor bad, well nor poorly taught, groundbreaking nor dull. It's not particularly difficult, so they are sometimes forced to be pedantic in grading stuff - so beware.",
    "I would recommend it only to people that are interested in the subject or need to take it. It is not the most interesting elective course.",
    "Definitely take this course! Econ is just really important to know in order to understand the world. If you are good at math, this class is a breeze. If you are not good at math, it might be slightly challenging but rewarding nonetheless.",
    "Solid intro level econ course. I actually enjoyed it more than I thought it would...the concepts of supply and demand and utility are tremendously applicable to everyday decision making and social processes. Still, pretty dry material, and as someone with calculus experience, I feel like I actually got more bogged down in the concepts than I would have had I been able to apply straight math to the models. Professor Goldberg was a very solid lecturer, and did a good job integrating real-life examples into her lectures. I won't say lectures were ever dynamic or captivating, but the material was presented clearly and cohesively.",
    "An introductory class that is much more challenging that one would think because of a steep curve and arbitrary grading.",
    "Not as easy as would be expected due to the poor teaching.",
    "I would, especially to people with not a lot of Economics background.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to students who think they might be interested in the subject matter or the major, but necessarily to those looking for an easy QR. I think the class is marketed to non-math\/science people as being more manageable since its more conceptual and knowledge of calculus is not required, but this is problematic since many students still struggle with the abstract mathematical concepts involved and more warning of this difficulty would have been helpful at least for me personally. Every student should definitely have some knowledge of market systems and basic microeconomics, and this class is a very comprehensive overview.",
    "absolutely - best class i've taken at Yale",
    "I took the class because I felt that I needed to learn more about basic economics before I formed a strong opinion on certain policy debates and political questions. After taking the course, I do feel much more prepared to weigh in on these sorts of discussions. Although lecture and section can seem a bit disjointed or boring at times, the material is essential for everyone to learn. Take the class sooner or laterit really offers a distinct view of the world and how it should or shouldn't work. If you do take it, be sure to read the textbook. It's only suggested reading, but I found it necessary to really understand the material and do well on the moderately challenging p-sets and tests.",
    "Great course. Well taught with some very interesting material. Definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a straight to the point introduction to micro. If you are considering a major that requires it take it; its gonna be useful and fun if you can make it fun. Don't take it in junior year to \"learn.\" It's too technical to just learn from it.",
    "It's an okay course. Pay attention though, or you'll get lost easily.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Econ ! I took it out of curiosity and learned that I probably did not want to study Econ in the future. The way the class was taught and the lecture slides get too repetitive to keep focus - but I guess it is the protocole for big intro classes like intro Micro. The textbook helps more than going over the lecture slides - and if you want to do well in the class, I strongly encourage you go over the Psets regularly because the exams will be based off the Psets, so no surprise here !",
    "Yes. It's not the most fun class, but it's somewhat helpful. I got to think about social justice and distribution issues from a different approach.",
    "Take this class to get a better understanding of what economics is and why it's important to study. Would highly recommend to anyone, even people who don't think they'd like Econ!",
    "Take this class to get a better understanding of what economics is and why it's important to study. Would highly recommend to anyone, even people who don't think they'd like Econ!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It's a good introductory class.",
    "Introduction to micro economics, teaches you the basic economic vocabulary.",
    "Econ 115 is a good intro micro course. I read the book and found it very interesting and helpful, but you don't need to read the book for this class (many don't) to do well, so long as you study previous exams and Psets.",
    "Go to the lecture even if you don't think you have to! This is a great, although sometimes boring, class about the way economics works in the world. You'll be happy you took it later!",
    "I would recommend especially if concepts and quantitative skills come easily to you. Then the class, especially with Professor Goldberg, can teach you a lot but does not require a lot of effort. Given that I am a history major, I personally found the material to be far less interesting than my other courses but a nice break from reading.",
    "I would recommend it only if they were thinking of economics as part of their major, not as a fun\/useful course to take in general.",
    "Your typical intro survey course - not terribly engaging, but Penny does a good job of making the information clear and relevant. I don't find economics particularly interesting, and while I probably won't remember several details of what I learned this semester, economics provides a valuable way of thinking that is probably practical to have under your belt. That being said, there are probably more interesting electives to take if you're not planning to major in Econ.",
    "I took the class in high school and thought it was better taught then. Though the content is basic, the material is somehow confusing, maybe because it's difficult to pay attention in lecture. I'm not sorry I took the class as a foundation for future Econ classes but lament that it isn't structured better.",
    "I think, this is an essential class everyone should take -- economic literacy is insanely important. However, even though material is very interesting, it is hard to stay engaged in this course because it is quite dry, to be honest. I would recommend to go to every single section (even though they are optional) -- that will make your life way easier. The exams are fair, though sometimes some unexpected questions may pop up. The curve is not the best since a lot of people who too AP Micro in high school take this class.",
    "Micro with Professor Goldberg was a great experience. Interesting, well organized material, and Prof Goldberg is really friendly and helpful if you approach her after class with questions. Having a good TA is critical to understanding the problem sets. The main challenge of the class is tying together the graphs and concepts from lecture with the math on the psets. Sharat Ganapati is an incredible TA -- so good at answering questions and so clear."
