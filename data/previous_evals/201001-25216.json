    "Really interesting class on some fascinating and timely topics. Background knowledge of developmental psychology is very helpful. Beware the graduate students who will try to bulldoze you regardless of what you contribute to the conversation.",
    "I thought I would really like this class, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. The topics are interesting but there are so many eager grad students that undergrads hardly ever speak up and it gets boring listening to the grad students. Overall I would recommend the class if you're interested in the topic.",
    "A graduate seminar that introduces students to key disorders in psychopathology.",
    "Overall excellent class for anyone interested in psychopathology. Helped me reshape the way I think of psychopathology and how it changes over the course of a lifetime."
