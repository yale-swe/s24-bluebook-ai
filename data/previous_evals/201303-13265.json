   "comments": [
    "Psych 518 is statistics for psychologists. If you want to become a professor or researcher in psychology, then you need to know the basic chi squares, anovas, factor analyses and regressions that Jack has to teach you. Not only would I recommend this course, but it's a requirement for success in the field.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was a great intro stats class, and covered most of the commonly used statistical analyses for anyone in psych or life sciences.",
    "Mandatory stats course.",
    "It's required",
    "The wonderful world of stats! Yes! Because its the best!",
    "To summarize, this course painstakingly covers basic ANOVAs and then briefly covers everything else. I would say if you are purely a behavioral psychologist, and you've never taken statistics before (or it's something that is especially hard for you), this class might be useful. Otherwise, this is a frustrating, slow course. I certainly wouldn't recommend it, though it's a required course, so that doesn't really have any bearing, anyway.",
    "A reasonable review of ANOVA and some other stats. Wouldn't necessarily recommend unless you have to take it (which is most of the people in the class) because there are probably more comprehensive stats classes you could take in the statistics department.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Understanding the statistics behind our analyses is really crucial - even somebody who knows the calculations could likely use a refresher like this.",
    "Students learn the details of using the most common statistical techniques in psychology and some more advanced analyses. I would recommend the class.",
    "Psychology 518 01 is a good class for someone who has limited statistical experience and knowledge, and is interested in statistics used in psychology. It will give them a strong understanding of the underlying mathematical elements that go into the basic analysis done in the field. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great class for those who already have a basic understanding of psych stats due to the pace and the majority of content.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone looking to learn the basics of statistics for psychology research.",
    "I wouldn't recommend for someone who already knows how to do ANOVA and t-tests. It would have been very helpful if more data sets were given to students to perform variety of tests without full report writing.",
    "Psych 518 (Statistics) is mostly doing long, tedious mathematical formulas by hand, but Dovidio's lectures make it worth it. Of course, I would recommend it to another student, because it is required."

   "comments": [
    "Since I came to graduate school without a grasp of statistics at all, this course was very useful to me in deepening knowledge of my profession. Though it did not contribute to my research in the typical idea-based manner, it did help me enormously with things like analyzing my research once it has been completed, which is essential to the discipline.",
    "I can finally analyze data properly, and actually know WHY I'm doing each analysis!",
    "Very helpful for reading methods sections of papers and for conducting my own research. I appreciate that the final project let us use our own data.",
    "I appreciated the effort to give us hands-on experience with statistics, including the application of techniques learned in class to our own research. Feedback on our take-own exams was very helpful.",
    "This class enabled me to analyze data from my first studies",
    "Personally, I found this wildly unhelpful. Having taken a very similar course in undergrad, this was almost entirely a waste of time. I love statistics and find the field extremely useful and interesting, but this course didn't offer anything new or useful and was far too focused on one kind of analysis and one kind of data. I don't think it helped deepen my knowledge of the discipline at all. The final project did contribute to my research because Sara helped me figure out how to model the effects in a new way that I think was superior to how I had originally modeled them.",
    "It taught me a little bit of statistics that I didn't already know.",
    "All of the material was applied during the various projects assigned during the class, which makes the course highly useful for work in the discipline and dissertation preparation.",
    "To be determined",
    "I will likely be using knowledge learned in this course quite extensively in my own research.",
    "This course was essential to the rest of my life. Every paper I read and every experiment I run will require the skills, which I learned in this class, so I would say that this may very well be the most important class to my discipline. Furthermore, the section of the course on writing up statistics was incredibly helpful and expect to use those lessons extensively."
