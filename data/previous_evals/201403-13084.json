   "comments": [
    "I was initially worried about taking English at Yale, but this course was fantastic. Emily was a great professor, who in addition to being extremely nice and funny, was very understanding and intelligent. My writing has improved a lot over the course of the semester, and though I wasn't sure initially, I definitely enjoyed and recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. My problem coming into this class was that I felt my writing ability reached a peak in high school and was searching for ways to improve it. This class did just that. If you are shopping for a writing credit or need to specifically take 114 to learn how to write \"the yale paper,\" I encourage you to take this one. You cannot go wrong with the topic because after the first few classes YOU choose a lot of the areas you wish to explore.",
    "In a sentence, \"Everything, no seriously, everything is a remix!\" I would certainly recommend this class to other people because of how thought provoking the class is. Though at first it seems to relate mostly to music, it soon becomes clear that the idea of a \"remix\" exists in almost every form of media known to mankind be it photo or book, song or painting, fashion house or ideology.",
    "I have recommended ENGL 114.06 to fellow students, i think it's a great class. Probably the best introduction to writing at Yale I could have asked for (even as a STEM type person). I would say ENGL 114 is a very cursory through a disparate group of ideas, held together by a strong focus on improving academic writing.",
    "The class is an exploration of the idea that \"everything is a remix.\" It judges remixes, remakes, and mashups of artistic forms on their fidelity to the original and their artistic merit.",
    "It is a class that may seem slightly strange at first because it doesn't follow the same guidelines and procedures one might be used to. However, it certainly ly improves writing skill so it is worth it.",
    "Taking this course was as great in practice as it sounded on paper. I'd definitely recommend someone to take this course (actually, I already have). If you put in the time to do the homework and essays, and are active in class, you will have a fantastic semester ahead of you.",
    "English 114 was an introduction to the academic style of writing that Yale expects from its students. However, I would not recommend that my peers take this class. I cannot speak for the other sections, but I was not interested in many of the readings that we did for class, and I felt that writing more personal essays (such as those covered in English 120) would have been much more interesting. But ultimately, it depends on your interest level in the class topic and what skills you wish to develop in your writing."
