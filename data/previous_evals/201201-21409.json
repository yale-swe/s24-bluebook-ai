    "take it if you are at all interested in the region and its cultural production.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The material is interesting, unique and fun and KI is truly passionate about her class. She has so much time for every student and really helps you get everything you can out of the class. The class provided a very intimate setting which led to great discussion and created a wonderful environment. Its a different type of class but one of which I enjoyed more than most.",
    "This class was a refreshing change from most classes at Yale. It was thoroughly enjoyable and Professor Illakowicz is a great teacher and just a lovely person.",
    "I would recommend the course to people willing to go outside of their comfort zone."
