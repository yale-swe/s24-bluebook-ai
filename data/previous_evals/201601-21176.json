    "This course is the best course I have taken at Yale in four years. Professor Wilkinson is deeply knowledgeable about a diversity of topics relating to South Asia and discussions are always fantastic. Thoroughly recommend.",

    "Great readings and amazing discussions. Take it for Professor Wilkinson alone. Irrespective of your background in South Asian politics - you will not be disappointed."
