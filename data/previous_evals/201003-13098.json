   "comments": [
    "I would reccomend if you are interracial\/hybrid, or are willing to lie, because all you have to do is talk\/write about yourself, and you have an A.",
    "If you have ever wondered about the topic personally this will change the way you look at yourself. If you are like me, and did not identify with the subject but felt an academic interest, it will still change the way you look at yourself. TAKE IT.",
    "Pretty good class. The readings are for the most part interesting and the seminar is not extremely demanding. Often turns into story time, but it makes it fun and often surprises you to figure out where people are from, what races they are, and such. If you are looking for answers, however, probably not the right class.",
    "I was disappointed in this class. We spent WAY more time talking about \"blackness\" and \"the black community\" than interraciality. Also, most of the books we read were written before 1950, and I had been hoping for more of a modern take on the issue. The assigned readings are worth taking a look at, especially if you're interested in passing. But you'd be better off doing the reading on your own; I didn't get much out of the class itself.",
    "Highly recommend for anyone and everyone who is interested in a nuanced perspective to the traditional racial dialogues of the United States.",
    "Interraciality and Hybridity was an excellent course! It is not only valuable as a study on interraciality of the past, but also extremely valuable as a history of race relations in America. If you are looking at this class as a means of self discovery or as a way to find answers, you certainly will find them. The answers, however, may not be the answers you expected. I definitely recommend this course if you are interested in a less structured course that is heavily based in classroom discussion.",
    "This was one of the most interesting courses I've ever taken at Yale. The incredible books we read provided a literary and academic framework which undergirded the open and free-flowing discussions we had in class each week. I learned a great deal from my peers and their experiences with mixedness as one of the few students who was not of mixed race heritage in the course. Prof. Pabst is a fantastic seminar leader whose wealth of knowledge in the field and down-to-earth nature really made the class an enjoyable one to attend week after week. I recommend the course merely for her brilliance and grace. I remember seeing other reviews criticizing the course for coming off as a therapy session for mixed race students. I say that if you have any interest in understanding how people negotiate the gap between cultural and racial backgrounds, this course provides a fantastic set of books and will most likely have an even more fantastic group of students with which to explore these issues.",
    "Take this, much great literature and good discussion.",
    "This seminar is quite good, and a must-take for those who want to think critically and analytically about race relations in modern America. The first couple weeks can be kind of mixed-people-support-group-ey (i.e., \"I was a mixed kid in an an all-black\/all-white\/all-Latino family\/high school\/town and life was sooooo harrrrrrddddd\") but that peters out after the first couple classes, which is a good thing. Take this seminar if you want to move past the stereotypes and commonly-held beliefs about interraciality and mixed-race identity (the tragic mulatto, the one-drop rule), and come to interrogate notions of race and ethnicity more rigorously."
