    "If you are interested in neuroscience methods, you should definitely take this class. Be warned: you will have to learn how to use many computer programs and the early labs are mostly analyzing data that has already been collected. However, the final project is awesome and you get to see that all the messing around on the computer was totally worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want hands-on experience with doing EEGs, Matlab, and various neuroimaging processing software. However, for many of the labs you'll find yourself copy and pasting code rather than actually understanding it! Professor McCarthy is a good lecturer for the theory aspect of the class. Four hours is a little long though, so prepare for long days and possibly coming in outside of class to finish labs (however it's possible to do it within the time constraints - I finished almost all within the time slot).",
    "Yes, this is definitely an interesting class. You learn a lot about EEG and fMRI techniques and even conduct your own study at the end. The workload isn't too bad, just five lab reports and one big one at the end on your study. Going to class for four hours on Friday sucks, but the other people in class make it fun.",
    "This course is one of my favorites at Yale. It is so wonderful that undergraduate students have the opportunity to learn neural imaging techniques and to utilize equipment and resources usually reserved for graduate and doctoral students. I entered the course completely unfamiliar with how fMRI and EEG worked and I completed the course with a wonderful feeling, knowing that I had successfully conducted an ERP study that had meaningful results. I learned so much from this course, and it's difficult for me to describe how much I appreciate this experience of taking the course and being able to conduct a final group project on the subject of our choosing. In the beginning, I was very frustrated as I didn't understand how to use the computer programs, but after a while--with much help from Yi and Professor McCarthy--I learned and improved, and by the end, I felt as though I had mastered many of the techniques. It is a great course, and you couldn't find anyone better suited to teach (or be a T.A.) this class. Wonderful! My only suggestion for how to improve it is to hold class on a different afternoon, as Fridays from 12 to 4 or 5 is difficult. I would absolutely recommend this to Neuroscience trackPsychology majors and other people interested in neuroscience. Even though I don't plan to do research later in life, I loved this experience."
