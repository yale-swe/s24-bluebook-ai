    "Would you like to learn more about Chinese culture through watching movies? If so, this is a good class for you. We have numerous essays due, three tests, and three oral presentations.... but Zhou laoshi makes doing the work worth it. He is the kindest teacher!!",
    "Yes - if you're looking for a class to maintain your Chinese skills but not be overwhelmed by daily homework.",
    "I thought the class was extremely helpful in teaching us the grammar and about chinese culture. I enjoyed the movies that we learned and the classwork was manageable. I would definitely recommend this class for someone who loves learning about chinese culture through film viewings. A caution though, the class time is spent going over grammar points and discussing the films.... films are watched on your own time.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this any other course taught by Zhou laoshi.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and if it had been a one-year long course I would definitely take it again next semester. I think using movies as a medium of instruction is a great way to simultaneously practice language and learn about Chinese culture. The structure of the course is that basically we watch movies for homework and do readings about the movies and discuss the movies in class. The course made me feel more comfortable watching and enjoying Chinese movies on my own outside of class and I think that will continue to be helpful for my Chinese in the future.",
    "Take it if you like to watch films and want a teacher who cares a lot about his students.",
    "YES.It was great overall. I really feel like my Chinese got better after this semester, and I thoroughly enjoyed going to class.Strengths: great class organization, interesting discussions about movies and Chinese culture in general, and vocabulary that is useful and helpful in everyday life (as opposed to being too literary). There were a lot of quizzes, so one individual quiz was not too much stress. The fact that there were a lot of quizzes also helped keeping up with vocabulary; repetition is best for consolidation. The tests weren't too hard, but challenging enough and rewarding at the end.Professor Zhou is great. Probably one of the better Chinese professors at Yale. Very organized, intense, and best of all friendly; he really wants to help you learn Chinese in a fun, enjoyable way while still retaining a level that is useful for real life. He is also very good at leading discussion; he asked probing questions that made us all think and discuss what we thought of controversial topics such as gay rights. He is very friendly and really creates a wonderful atmosphere to learn the language.Weaknesses: An administrative weakness was that the \"jindu\" (syllabus with homework) was updated after every class, which made it hard to keep up with the homework sometimes because we'd have to watch a 2.5-hour long movie for the next class during the week. This is understandable since the class itself is still new, but it was a weakness nonetheless. I was very stressed because I had work for other class that I had scheduled throughout the week, but did not expect homework for the next Chinese class in two days to be so much, which made me pull quite a few allnighters finishing up homework that I had received on a short notice. Some suggestions: if the movies could at least be assigned during the weekends, it would be better for scheduling purposes; if the homework could be assigned at least a week before (which was what happened towards the end of the semester), it would be great.PS. if you're looking for a gut Chinese class, this is not it. It's 3 times a week with a quiz almost every class, lots of small homework-type essays, longer essays, online quizzes, three midterms, two oral presentations, a final project, etc. Not too harsh in terms of grading, but lots of work.",
    "Take it! Zhou Laoshi is amazing and the films are fantastic."
