   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to all freshmen interested in physics, engineering, math, or any field in which they will use physics. The constant use of multivariate calculus in the textbooks and by the instructor should not be overly concerning; as long as one has seen any sort of multivariate calculus one should be okay for the purposes of the tests and homework (and, if one is interested, one could learn the other oft-quoted theorems within a few weeks to better follow the lectures). The course repeats most of AP physics along with diving deeper into relativity and E&M; its homework may not be terribly engaging, but one will review important concepts and expand on them in important ways. There is little reason to take any other freshman physics course, although it could be said that, if one were to wait until one has taken math 231 or 250, one would get more out of the course; a good grade should appear either way.",
    "Easier than 200 apparently. You cover a lot more, but with less depth. Not exactly a thrilling experience, but you should find Prof. Baltay pretty entertaining.",
    "This course starts out deceptively easy, although the teacher tells you that from the start so perhaps it's not all that deceptive. Only take this if you genuinely like physics. That being said, the instructor is great.",
    "If you love Physics, take 260. I shopped 200, and it was okay... 260 is great. However, if you haven't taken AP Physics C, you're going to have a hard time in the class. You don't need math 230 to get through the class, 120 works perfectly well with 260. If you've only done a basic physics class or AP Physics B, you'll have a lot of difficulty with the concepts of the course. I took Physics B, and I'm finishing with 260 right now, and I think I've had a really hard time because I wasn't exposed to a lot of the physics. On the other hand, I'm a physics major, and I love this class just because it's interesting and Baltay makes it amazing. He's a really good guy and enthusiastic about his subject. Basically if you took Physics C and you're placing into math 120, you should take 260... if you've only taken Physics B or below and you're in 120, you'll be fine, but it's going to be hard. It's hard, but very worthwhile.",
    "Physics 260 is a fun intro physics course (not that intro physics courses are really much fun to begin with). It is not difficult, and I have no idea why it has Math 230 as a corequisite. Though Professor Baltay will reliably suggest you leave the class (even in the last week of the course) if you aren't familiar with a particular idea, it seems almost like a bit of a joke since the vector calculus used in the course can be picked up as you go; there is no need to have a background in multi or vector calculus to take this course. I'd say that if you've taken Physics C, most definitely take this course; it's not much harder and is a good deal more enjoyable than other intro physics courses. Just don't get psyched out by Charlie's threats.",
    "Recommended without reserve. Don't worry about math\/physics requirements, you get the most out of it if you haven't done physics C or multivariable before.",
    "Challenging, but rewarding. Not entertaining, per se, but never boring. If you're a math\/science person, I highly recommend this course. The textbooks are good, the professor is great, and the problem sets are just the right length.",
    "Physics 260 offers as much as can be expected from an introductory physics course. It is interesting and well-taught, and there aren't a whole lot of surprises. The homework is really easy.",
    "Good introductory physics course for those with some physics and math background. I came in only having taken AP Physics B and math through multivariable calc, and the course was a good level for me. The course moves fairly quickly through mechanics, special relativity, and then the beginning of electricity and magnetism (it gets a bit more difficult when you start E&M). Prof Baltay is pretty funny.",
    "Physics 260 is great. If you've had multivariable calc (Math 120 or ENAS 151), you're qualified to take it--you don't need to be in 230. Professor Baltay explains everything very well, and he's hilarious. The problem sets and exams are very reasonable.",
    "If you did well in Physics C and Calculus BC (without ever covering any multivariable), this class is definitely do-able. The psets take less time to do than 200's, and you'll learn a lot more (and cooler topics as well). Plus, Professor Baltay is an incredible lecturer. He will try to scare you away by explaining that you should know what gradients, divergence, and curl are. I did not know any of these things at the beginning of the year. Math 230 doesn't even relate much to topics covered in lecture- a multivariable equivalent will do. The time you spend catching up with the multivariable you didn't know (if you didn't learn it) from the start of this class will be better spent than the extra time you spend on physics 200 P-sets (and the time you spend will probably be less as well). If you want the leg-up at the beginning, try to learn how to evaluate partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, spherical coordinates, and cylindrical coordinates. If you have no time then, learn them as they come up on psets.",
    "Take it after a successful AP physics experience.",
    "Great class, topics are interesting and challenging but not overly so. Professor Baltay makes a point to get into the \"philosophical ideas\" behind the physics.",
    "A lot of the mechanics may be review of what you did in AP Physics C, but the E+M portion gets a lot tougher. The best part of this course is the time you spend on relativity; both general relativity and special relativity. Great for possible physics majors.",
    "SPECTACULAR. It was low stress and I also felt like I learned a lot more of the intuition behind relativity and EM. Baltay assumes you've gotten the math part down.",
    "The subject matter was largely a review of A.P. Physics C. The professor intimidates you at the beginning by demanding knowledge of multi-var (gradients, divergences and curls, even in spherical and cylindrical coordinates), much of which you never really use and use in very basic cases when you do. My impression of the class was that it was hyped to be much harder than it was; the class was just Physics C, and not even in much more depth than covered in high school. The lectures were so boring that I stopped going; all the information was in the books anyway. I'd hoped the professor would motivate us to learn outside of class, but the only time I actually did physics was for 2-6 hours the night before the problem sets were due.",
    "I would recommend Physics 260 to another student, conditional upon what they want and their level of preparedness. I personally took it without any multivariable preparation, complemented with Maths 120 and had few troubles. It is a challenging course, but put in the work and you will be fine. Looking for a complete coverage of classical mechanics, special relativity and electrostatics in 3 months? Take 260.Baltay is an excellent professor, who is a leader in his field. However, if you have any questions, I would recommend seeing the excellent TA Kent or college tutors.",
    "A fast moving, in depth, pretty hard but very interesting class in mechanics (newton's laws, momentum, angular momentum\/torque, lagrangians etc.), special relativity, electrostatics, and currents. I would recommend it to people interested in physics or science as a career. Expect to struggle with some of the concepts, but with hard work you will do fine.",
    "This is just a multivariable version of AP Physics Mechanics and Electrostatics, with a bit of Special Relativity thrown in, and the boring stuff taken out. If you like physics and like to learn interesting stuff during class that may or may not pertain at all to the exam, take this class. You DO NOT need to take MATH 230 with this class. You should have looked at curl and divergence once before taking the class, just to make it easier, but I didn't and I was fine. Simultaneously taking or previously knowing MATH 120 material is all you need for this class. The problem sets are not terrible, and the class moves at a followable pace. The midterm is not very hard, and Professor Baltay is generous with curves. Go to class, however, because you will need to be as prepared as possible for the final. It is much tougher than the midterm.",
    "In Physics 260 you cover a lot of physics but you don't have a lot of work. You need to make sure you keep up with the material, not just problem sets; that way tests don't surprise you. I recommend this class if you have a flair for physics or math; it won't be that time consuming and it's quite interesting.",
    "Intensive intro physics was challenging, rigorous, interesting-ish. I think that it was fairly-well executed, though class definitely erred a little on the side of constant proof. If you've taken Physics C, you will have seen a lot of the content before, but Baltay assumes you have; if you're not well conceptually grounded, you might get left behind. With that said, Baltay is great; he has a dry sense of humor, he knows his material, and he welcomes feedback.One thing that's important: it's listed as co-requisite with MATH 230, and that's just stupid. It definitely helps to have math 120 down, but there is nothing in 230 that ever becomes relevant or useful in 260. Thereis a lot of math, and the more you know, the better, but this would makes sense with MATH 222,225,250, or even 120 if you're a quick learner.",
    "If you're looking for an in-depth introduction to physics at Yale, and you're comfortable with Multivariable, this is the course to take. (For the record, it's TOTALLY possible to take this class with Math 120, as long as you've had a sufficient amount of prior exposure to Multivariable before and feel relatively comfortable with it.) The easiest topics in this class are totally understandable, and Prof. Baltay is great about making key concepts clear. The hardest topics, however, will really test you- I found 75% of the content in this course totally manageable, and the remaining 25% extremely difficult. This course is NOT for the faint at heart, but the workload is definitely not horrible. Overall, I found it very fulfilling, and a good experience! Not sure if I'd continue with 261, but I definitely have no regrets in taking 260.",
    "Definitely a good course if you're ready and willing to learn about topics that would otherwise not be covered freshman year. Problem sets get progressively more difficult, so don't be caught off-guard, although they stay within reason throughout. Prepare well in advance for tests, ideally study throughout the course, as material is best learned and learned fully while taking advantage of the excellent lectures, not during reading week.",
    "A version of Physics 200 with less work (weird, I know) but more advanced concepts. Instead of gases, thermodynamics, and that stuff, we do quantum mechanics and general relativity. If you are a student trying to take physics at Yale and manage to read this sometime over the summer, please please please learn some multivariable calculus (Khan Academy will do) and get into 260 instead of 200. We skip all the boring stuff and go into what I think physics is truly about: quantum mechanics and general relativity. This material is simply beautiful, from what I've seen of it. If you think math 230 will give you multivar experience for this class, you're wrong. Put in the effort to learn applications of MV. This class has a reputation for being only for physics majors (and Charlie talks to us as if we were) but take this if you took physics in high school and enjoyed it. I didn't take calc-based physics in high school and still did well in the class, so it's not really a requirement.",
    "Don't believe the hype, it's not that hard. Professor Baltay is the man. If you've taken Physics C in high school, and you're debating between 200 and 260, take 260.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking Physics 260. If you have taken Physics C in high school, or taken Multivariable calc (i.e. Math 120) don't let anyone tell you you shouldn't take the class, as I hear 200 is poorly taught, and from what my suitemates say, 180 is borderline a joke gut science class (I don't even know what 170 is then).I wouldn't recommend taking it if you've never done mechanics or multivariable however, as Prof. Baltay flies through mechanics, and the E&M sections assume that surface integrals and the like are familiar topics. But if you have a flair for Math and\/or physics (either one, both will help), you will be fine. The stated co-req of 230 is absurd, because it is not at all required or relevant. 120 suffices easily.It is a great course, especially for a physics major who wants a survey course refresher to get them excited about some of the cooler physics topics. The treatment of special relativity is especially good, and you come away with an ability to derive of all of SR from first principles, which I personally found very rewarding.",
    "It's a lot of review from AP Physics B and C but it's still an interesting class and Professor Baltay is a great professor. The problem sets aren't too difficult, I would definitely recommend this course to those who enjoy physics.",
    "A math-intensive physics course. If you esteem yourself good at math, and want to take physics, take it. Under no circumstances is MATH 230 a real corequisite, though some multi experience might help; take whatever multivariable class you wish.",
    "Physics 260 is an advanced Physics introductory course. The first few weeks essentially review AP Physics. After that come Lagrangian Mechanics and Special Relativity, the topics I found the most interesting in the course. Electricity&Magnetism end the semester - watch out, because knowledge of gradient, curl, etc. is needed here, and the problems sets taken from Griffiths' Electrodynamics jump sharply in difficulty. Unfortunately, although the material presented in this course was often interesting, many of the lectures were somewhat boring. The tests and problem sets were not unusually difficult. The problem sets take a few hours each week on average.",
    "A good introductory physics course. Take it if you have taken AP physics C in high school and are comfortable with actually using multivariable calculus. It's a great course, and Professor Baltay makes it even better.",
    "A really good \"introductory\" physics class, especially for people who have had some physics background and enjoys more general quasi-proof problems as opposed to the usual plug and chug style problems. The problem sets first semester are very manageable, much easier than Math 230. Multivariable would be useful to have, but it's not absolutely necessary, you could learn how to do triple integrals\/the more important multivariable principles in class.",
    "I enjoyed PHYS 260 more than I expected. It was my first physics class at Yale. Although I had little background in calculus-based physics(I came in with ENAS 151 and a little self-taught physics C), Prof. Baltay's explanation was clear enough for me to follow and understand everything. The course starts off deceptively easy, but gradually picks up pace. And by the end of the semester, we were powering through E&M at a speed faster than most of us could handle. To make things harder, the Griffiths textbook is really opaque and useless. But in the end I still enjoyed the course. Prof. Baltay's lectures are structured and illustrative, and summarize the textbooks really well.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for a good review of high school physics. My high school AP Physics C class wasn't serious at all, so I learned a lot, but I think most people knew it already up until the rigorous treatment of E+M for the last few weeks of the semester... But this class isn't hard; the problem sets are easy up until the last two about electrostatics which can be a little more difficult. And you definitely don't need Math 230 for this class. In 230, we didn't talk at all about divergence or curl or Stokes' theorem or ANYTHING so you'll have to go over this stuff by yourself unless you're in 230 because you've had multivariable calculus already, which was not the case for me, at least.",
    "Physics 260 is a difficult, but great course. I wasn't sure at first if it would be too difficult for me, but I'm really glad I decided to stick with it. I had taken multivariable calculus in high school, but I didn't have a great physics background (got a 5 self-studying for the AP Physics B exam). The course description says you should be taking Math 230 concurrently, but that really isn't necessary. I didn't take any math class concurrently with Physics 260. If you haven't taken multivariable calc before though, you should at least take math 120 or the ENAS equivalent concurrently, because you'll definitely be using that kind of math in physics. The course moves very quickly, but Professor Baltay is a fantastic professor so it's definitely worth it if you can keep up.",
    "Physics 260 is a fast-paced version of Physics 200, while skipping over the minute details. To compensate, the course tackles a more theoretical discussion of Physics, while advancing up to the end of Electrostatics by the end of the semester.Though such a method might invoke heated arguments about the lack of enough practice problems, I think it actually increases one's interest in Physics. Professor Batlay even introduces a bit of Philosopher to engage the class to a further extent.Though Professor Batlay attempts to scare many students way, I found the class manageable without actually having AP Physics Mechanics or E&M classes (I have enough self-studying to pull out 5s on APs). Also, one might find it easier than PHYS 200, given sufficient understanding of Multivariable calculus.",
    "If you have taken BC Calc and are willing to teach yourself some multi during the semester, you can take the class. (Don't stress about the whole Math 230 thing even if you are a physics major.) It's much less work than 200, and in my opinion, a better class. There is less emphasis on ridiculous problems with frictionless sleds falling off a cliff shaped like a pendulum in a reference frame moving at half the speed of light. The class is more focused on the conceptual stuff behind physics, understanding the relationships between work, forces, potential, etc. There is a lot of work integrating (center of masses, moments of inertia, etc.), so be prepared for that. Plus Baltay's the man! Interesting guy (go ahead, google him and read about Pluto.)",
    "This is a math-intensive introductory physics course. I took it as a junior, which I wouldn't really recommend since I am many years removed from the relevant math. That said, it is well-taught (and is, amazingly, kept interesting for the entire long class period.) Professor Baltay is really funny, and the TA (Kent) is really nice and helpful during the weekly problem sessions. However, I recommend trying to solve the problems before coming to problem session- otherwise (at least in my case), you'll just lazily use Kent's answers and shoot yourself in the foot by not actually learning how to solve anything. Overall, a well taught course!",
    "I thought this class was very challenging, but also rewarding.",
    "Definitely take Physics 260 if you are passionate about physics and want to learn about the mathematical backbone that underlies this discipline. Theboard in each lecture is literally filled with equations and derivations and you really get to appreciate the full beauty of how physicists have used mathematics to describe the physical world. There will be a lot of \"wow, thats pretty cool\" in this class!Charles Baltay is a great professor, he is funny, very accessible and good at explaining concepts.You will need Multivariable Calculus to understand this course. Without it, E&M makes no sense whatsoever. I didn't know Multivariable calculus before taking Physics 260, but I did take ENAS 151 in conjunction with PHYS 260 after talking with Prof. Baltay about my math background (International Baccalaureate Higher Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics).",
    "I enjoyed Physics 260. The workload was moderate and the material is fun. It's basically a thorough review of AP Physics C material, with some expansion into special relativity and multivariable calculus techniques, such as the Lagrangian. Prof. Baltay's lectures, though sometimes dry, were generally clear, and I came out of the semester feeling I'd learned the material well. Don't expect either a super-intensive course that pushes your boundaries as a physicist or a particularly supportive atmosphere.",
    "Great course. Covers topics very quickly, though not at great depth (about 10 lectures on mechanics, 6 lectures on relativity, 6 lectures on electrostatics and a little magnetism). I liked Baltay's derivations because they helped me understand where the concepts came from mathematically, though he does make some mathematical mistakes in his lectures. They might not be rigorous proofs, but I do think they helped me understand the concepts better. I thought the exams were fairly easy. At least half of the questions on the midterm and final were directly from lectures or problem sets, so read those over when you study. It's hard for me to say what kind of preparation you need for this class, because conceptually it moves very quickly and having Physics C might be nice, but the problem sets and exams don't go very in depth, so it is probably not necessary.",
    "PHYS260 is definitely for students with a good AP Phys C background. I came into this class without one, and I definitely struggled because Professor Baltay skims over many of the finer details of working out problems. However, if you have a strong AP Phys C background, then this class should be a breeze and the only new material would be the relativity unit which is very interesting. The workload is fairly light (except for the E&M problem sets which were actually very difficult). The midterm and final were also fair and easier than the problem sets.I do warn you that if you go into this class without a strong physics background that you will have to put in a lot of work to compete with the very competitive freshmen who have just taken physics at their HS.",
    "I would recommend the class if AP Physics was easy for you and you like calculus. It's very hard if you don't have time to work on the problems sets slash go to class and pay attention, but you learn a lot.",
    "A little hard but awesome! Not too much work.",
    "The first few weeks are very easy, but don't let this deceive you. It gets difficult towards the end of the semester.",
    "A good course that isn't too much work. Get a study group and you'll be fine on the problem sets, which take 2-4 hours a week (not bad) but a bit long for the E&M section. Seemed like less work than Physics 200, which my roommate took. And Baltay's a boss.",
    "Yup!",
    "The class is good. It's definitely possible to do while taking multivariable concurrently, but be prepared - not having taken multi before makes it much more difficult. That said, I've heard that Physics 200 has just as much work and isn't taught as well; Baltay is a great teacher.",
    "It is a great course for someone if they want a difficult intro physics class, but you definitely should be aware that a very strong background in physics is highly recommended to be in the course. The mechanics section is relatively rudimentary, so the course seems manageable at first, but by the time the more difficult material is introduced, like E&M, the course can get very difficult. So, don't make assumptions early regarding the difficulty and rigor of the course. In terms of work, the psets are fairly manageable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it gives a solid foundation that can be used by all students who consider Physics major.",
    "Take it if you are really interested in physics. It's for people seriously considering a physics major.",
    "Physics 260 is an intense introductory physics course that is quite enjoyable and enlightening if you are willing to put in the time",
    "Provides an extremely solid background in mechanics and electrostatics, but only for those who already know a good deal of physics and vector calculus. So I would recommend only to those who feel adequately prepared."
