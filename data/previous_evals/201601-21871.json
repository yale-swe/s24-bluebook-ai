    "Take it if you have to",
    "I would not recommend this course to a senior. Just kind of an annoying spring semester class.",
    "More pre-professional than most MCDB classes. There are guest lectures that cover financing and investment in biotech startups. Topics are fascinating, but the exams are unnecessarily specific and somewhat disjointed because the class is taught by a group of rotating professors.",
    "Good survey of the different fields at the forefront of biotechnology. Wish we had more time to dive into each topic, but the breadth was great - we even had guest speakers from company founders to venture capitalists, and those points of view were certainly helpful.",
    "Difficult course if you have limited lab experience, but interesting nonetheless. This course will take much of your time and you do not want to fall behind. Well worth taking if you are interested in this field. It pulls together nicely many concepts from past MCDB courses.",
    "Great upper level course- just be wary the course is paper intensive, and a bit disorganized in the alignment of lecture topics, but interesting in its description of the practical and business aspect of current biotechnology companies",
    "A great intro to biotechnologies that might help you to pick a topic to focus on yourself. Definitely recommend. The guest lectures are awesome and hard to find.",
    "Great course for an introduction to modern biotechnologies, their history and their uses. It also was a great opportunity to learn about other parts of biotech including patent law and venture capital. This is definitely an elective and should be treated as a supplement to your studies. That being said the exams can be a little tough, so be prepared!",
    "Biotechnology is a fantastic upper-level science class. The workload is on the heavy side but very fair (weekly write-ups summarizing an assigned scientific paper, mandatory weekly discussion sections, 4 quizzes, 1 midterm, and 1 final). One of the major advantages of the class was the wide breadth of expertise provided through the rotating lecture system. I especially enjoyed learning about the less-scientific aspects of biotechnology (patent law) and listening to guest lecturers. I would only recommend this class for people who already taken a couple of science courses at Yale, as some of the science papers were rather dense, and knowledge from introductory science classes (the Biology sequence, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry) is already assumed.",
    "This was a nice survey course in bio technological applications from different fields of biology (e.g. Biochemistry, pharma, plant biology, synthetic biology, etc.). That being said, this resulted in a slightly fractured course structure that made studying for exams a little difficult. There are weekly papers assigned for section which were another way to see work being conducted in Yale labs.",
    "This is a pretty interesting course and a great way to fulfill your upper-level MCDB elective requirement. However, be advised that this class is more work than the old reviews might suggest. You have to spend a couple hours reading and talking about a Nature or Science paper for section each week, and you'll have to do a writeup for each paper. The exams are also no joking matteryou really have to study for them because the questions are often quite esoteric. The quizzes are usually fair. But overall, the course is definitely average workload or above-average workload.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in biology, want to learn about pharma\/biologics culture, what it takes to start a business, or want to be inspired by great examples of how to be creative to solve medical problems. Overall this course teaches you what biotech is, many examples of biotech, and what it takes to start a business of your own."
