   "comments": [
    "If you're taking this then you have to be here so don't let it get to you too much. It's just little models and drawings. Make it what you want it to be.",
    "If you take this class you are obviously seriouslyconsider considering the architecture major. Dont be intimidated by the work. You will get to know your classmates well and come to enjoy the studio environment and the work you are doing. In this class you will be designing your own work for the first time which i found to be fun and exciting, especially after a rough semester in 154. If you invest yourself in the work you will find success and be very proud at the end of the semester. It seems that those who bought into the assignments and the workload had a better experience than those who resisted it.",
    "This course has improved tremendously in just a year. The workload is just right--difficult and strenuous, but never impossible. You are always swimming, never drowning. Bimal and Trattie were generally helpful, and generally nice, but there is some lingering psychological warfare they can have with students when we are not in their good graces, and that needs to stop before the course can improve. They seriously need to work on their communication, both in terms of when they change our schedule\u00e2\u0080\u0094which seemed to be constantly happening\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in their feedback. If they are being vague to you on purpose, they need to not just be vague and expect you to do exactly what they want without telling you. At least they should say why they are being vague and what sort of processes you need to go through to solve the problem they have brought us. This course needs to be a lot less about changing the windows, or the stairs, or that one door that looks funny from this angle, and more about big-picture conceptualization that gives you the necessary tools, without making a list of explicit demands to you, to make those changes.This course needs more theory. Sometimes, the instructors abandoned rigor. Sometimes, it was enough for them to \"like\" the building, or call the drawing \"beautiful\" and move on. Gratifying, but not helpful. At least say why they see beauty or what it is that the building conveys that makes it beautiful in their eyes. There were three lectures and a tiny amount of reading. We have so little upon which we base our architectural knowledge, and this class absolutely needs to be about widening our view of architecture--especially since it comes right after the Analytic Model.Also, Trattie and Bimal have very different things to say, and sometimes when you switch off with them (not always the case), your building goes in one direction one week, and the other direction the next week, and turns into a camel.",
    "It was the best studio class I have had so far. It is a lot of fun and gives you freedom to start designing. Professors were amazing.For an Architecture student who has to take it, don't stess it too much. Although it is very time consuming and expect to pull quite a few all nigthers, if you enjoy designing it is a very fun experience. I would recommend only for architecture students of course.",
    "Bootcamp. Architecture. Every week. Every day. You're taking this class because you love Architecture and the design process, so cherish it, put your heart and soul into it.",
    "I liked this a lot better than the Analytic Model; we designed our own projects instead of analyzing an existing building, which I liked a lot more since it doesn't throw you into a weird love\/hate relationship with your subjective projection of your architect. You're allowed to be much more free and come up with crazy ideas, and there's a surprising amount of rigor even in the most fantastical assignments. Bimal and Trattie are ridiculously calm and straight to the point, and their criticism usually makes you feel somewhere between \"wow I wish I'd thought of that\" to \"hmm I guess I see what they're saying but also, no\"",
    "Make a lot of sketch models, abandon your first idea for a design and work on iterations, question why you're making every decision you're making, from the arrangement of walls\/ windows\/ sectional differences, to what materials and fabrication methods you're using. Prioritize. Not just in your design, but in your life - that's the only way you'll be able to manage your time to complete this course as a sane person. Finally, remember that you're doing all of this first and foremost to learn something. Making a beautiful model or getting really good reviews in your crit are absolutely secondary and kind of insignificant compared to the value of what you will learn from this class and how much you will grow as a thinker, designer, maker.",
    "The first studio for the architecture major, so it focuses on the basics of both creating architecture as well as creating all the deliverables for presentation. Be prepared for everything to take longer than expected, but also to be more rewarding and enlightening than you could have imagined. You need to be self-motivated to get the most out of this class - seek out the TF's and the professors without hesitation and you will be able to turn out better work faster.",
    "Huge amount of work. Equally huge amount learned. Obviously don't take this if you're not a architecture major. But if you are, it will be the most significant you've taken this far at yale. When you finally crank out that portfolio and look back at everything you accomplished over the semester, you will hardly believe it.",
    "Incredible opportunity to start learning about the design process from a different angle, however it was a huge challenge. If you organize yourself well, you can definitely avoid pulling as many all-nighters as I did, however trust me, the workload will go beyond anything you ever thought a class could possibly assign you. Main tip: always remember the criticism is directed at your piece of work and not you. By not taking things personally you will be able to learn more from what the critics have to say and actually improve throughout the course. Good luck!",
    "You have to take it, so take it.Beware the time commitment. Use the TA's as much as you possibly can. Don't let the rest of your life slide--you might be an architecture major, but you also have a life.",
    "This class will take over your life. You will live in the studio. You will dream of models and drawings and live in an endless production cycle. You will say that you hate it, but really, you will love it. Trattie and Bimal work well together to identify problems and propose solutions for your projects, but try to appreciate them individually and seek them out outside of class. The same goes for your TFs, who will undoubtedly be incredible and helpful and generally beautiful people. My biggest piece of advice is to never stop producing work; make as many study models as you can (they don't even have to be good or even make sense, they just need to express an idea). Don't worry about your project being \"correct\" or \"good,\" just make things that interest you and that other people would like to dwell on for a while.Try to enjoy it while it lasts, because like all good things, it will come to end some day :(",
    "This is one of the hardest but most worthwhile classes I've ever taken. Don't beat yourself up for all-nighters. They will happen. As far as studio goes, Bimal and Trattie are pretty great. I thought that they were fair and generally helpful, open to suggestions. The only thing they won't tolerate is obvious laziness, so as long as you are pacing yourself with the workload and have work to show for your efforts, feel free to go crazy. They have a wide appreciation for different styles and personalities.",
    "Obviously only arch majors because it's so much work, but I liked it more than Analytic Model because you're actually designing buildings and can choose your own ideas to explore. I found it helpful to work across a lot of mediums, make a lot of quick sketch models, and try not to get too stuck in the nuances\/black hole of time that is Rhino. The TAs were great and helpful so go to them for help."
