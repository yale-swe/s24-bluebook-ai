    "i would definitely recommend doing directed research. 10 hours a week is a HUGE time commitment, but it's really nice to have no work outside your time in the lab. you end up doing a fair amount of busy work--making copies, calling families, entering data, etc.--but it's a great way to see how a lab truly works. plus making connections with the grad students and professors is invaluable. lab meetings were also really great--we had a different grad student lead them every week, and it was nice to hear about the variety not simply of the research being done, but also of the different paths that can lead to getting a phd in psychology. i would definitely, definitely recommend directed research, especially in sophomore or junior year so that you can get a sense of what it's like before committing to doing a senior project.",
    "Highly recommend doing independent research. By far the most valuable course work I did at Yale.",
    "If you are a psych major you must do psyc 493. It should be a requirement because it is essential. Such a wonderful experience!",
    "I would recommend this course for someone that has a topic they would like to research enough to spend a lot of time on it. If you are not motivated it will be difficult to stay on task but if there is osmething you want to study first hand that is not available at Yale, this is the best thing for you.",
    "This is course that allows you to get credit for getting research experience (which everyone should do). You have to write a 20 page paper at the end though. Get started on that early!",
    "If you want to begin getting involved in lab work, and are interested in developmental psychology, the social cognitive development lab is truly a great place to work.",
    "Well, it's quite a good way to settle the Senior Essay requirement. I would recommend it.",
    "Directed research classes vary depending on the professor with whom you choose to work. I worked this semester with a professor at the Yale Child Study Center. It was a great experience, and I highly recommend it to other students.",
    "Great course it really depends on who you are working with as they and their work are the ones that make the experience.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Yes.",
    "good",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to any student majoring in psychology. As a non-psychology major I was particularly interested in the course because of the hands-on experience it offered with subject experimentation.",
    "Great experience to have. And the grad students are awesome.",
    "Fantastic course, particularly if you're considering graduate school in psychology. A great way to meet professors and make contacts in a field that interests you. Plus, my research project was a lot of fun!",
    "Yes, this course gives you great hands on experience, especially if you want to practice someday.",
    "Yes!! Do research with a faculty member! It is a great experience.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who know an exact field of psychology they are interested in or even if you just have a vague idea. It helps solidify your interests by immersing you in the field of work. Great for career ideas as well.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in doing psychology research, with some seriousness. Doing it for credit definitely makes it a lot more work that you need to do (time put in), and could get boring at times, but it does actually give you an experience in the research process. It is quite a bit of work, but it isn't really performance-based but more participation-based, so be aware of what you're getting into beforehand!",
    "Definitely take this, especially if you are already in a lab or doing research for your senior project. It's engaging, original work, and you might as well get credit for your time spent in lab."
