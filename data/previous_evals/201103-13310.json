   "comments": [
    "Avilez makes it great.",
    "This class shows thematic connections between many different pieces of American literature across a great time span. I would defintely recommend this class to another student because I found the readings to be very enjoyable, which often made up for the somewhat lengthy amount of time I would have to spend doing the reading.",
    "English 127 is a great class. You read great books, write 3 essays or two essays and a creative project. Classes are all discussion based. I would absolutely recommend this course because it teaches you how to think about literature but is also just really enjoyable.",
    "yes.",
    "The class is a summary of some key pieces of American Literature. I would recommend the class if you are okay with some weeks of heavy reading. The class itself is low key but you should keep up with the reading to stay engaged.",
    "This course has a really diverse set of readings, ranging all the way from old classics like Moby Dick and Emily Dickinson's poetry to more contemporary works like Oscar Wao and Toni Morrison. Also, the coursework is more than reasonable, 2 papers, with the option of a 3rd one\/doing a creative project + one final. Also - take it with Gershun Avilez !Gershun Avilez is amazing ! He's a really fair grader, and is very good at getting the class engaged with the texts. While I felt that on a few rare occasions, we under-addressed the arguments being made by the novel, on balance, we really got deep into these works. Also, his office hours are awesome, he's really willing to talk to you for a long time about racial identities and stuff",
    "A really great class with an interesting reading list. Only three papers, and the final is pretty simple.",
    "Take this class. Some excellent readings you won't see anywhere else, as well as a good background on the ones that are common to every course. Professor Avilez is a gem of a teacher.",
    "If you're willing to do a lot of reading, take this because it is do worth it. All books that will make you a better student too",
    "A great collection of readings in a casual discussion-style class.",
    "You get a good sampling of American literature. Moby Dick seems to be a staple of the class and it is rather slow and tedious, but otherwise we read some authors such as Dickinson and Whitman. A good discussion-based class with a lot of discussion. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good sample of American literature and who wants to experience an introductory english seminar.",
    "I think if you were a strong English student in high school you will have no problem in English 127. It is, however, somewhat reading intensive so if you're not interested in literature in the least I would not suggest it.",
    "Don't feel like I actually learned much. This class was all about how you feel about the books."
