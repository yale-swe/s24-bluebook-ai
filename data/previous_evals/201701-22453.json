    "I am more fully aware of what is involved in classical and advanced water purification systems. I understand the issues with many processes currently being utilized, and potential avenues for improvement. Specifically in my research, understanding what causes the osmotic energy barrier during reverse osmosis, aka the maximum osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization, will be important as I design and synthesize new desalination membranes. This allows me to understand what forces these membranes should remain stable against and what limiting factors I need to address. I also am more fully aware of international health issues, like arsenic in India. I can explore toxins in water and aim to design new membrane technologies that specifically address these toxins.",
    "Very useful for my research, especially all about membranes. Best class I took this semester.",
    "Learned a lot about the physical and chemical treatment process",
    "As an undergraduate, I had studied the basics of water and wastewater treatment, but I appreciated learning about more modern technologies related to microfiltration through reverse osmosis. Beyond the concepts, I learned how to estimate the physio-chemical processes at the particle scale."

   "comments": [
    "Topics were well-organized and covered at an appropriate depth. Some exam questions were not clearly written, which lead to confusion about what was expected in the answer. Improve by clarifying the wording of the questions.",
    "The class is well organized and looking at slides while writing notes keeps the sessions engaging. I have no suggestions.",
    "I think the course is structured very well and caters to interests in environmental engg. Very useful for people especially in water research, not so much for others.",
    "This course is fantastic.",
    "The course is logically organized, and the content is clear. Homework assignments follow along with the lectures. While challenging, students have all the information needed to solve the problems. Some of the notes are a bit outdated and could be enhanced by inclusion of graphics from more recent literature."

    "Yes, the class was taught well. The amount of work was just right.",

    "ABsolutely. If you love environmental stuff, especially treatment of natural water systems and natural processes, this is a great course.",
    "The course instructor is really great.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in gaining a better understanding of micro & nano scale water treatment processes, because it is well taught and thorough."
