   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn more about music and practice intervals, but don't necessarily want to learn a lot of theory, this class is great.",
    "If you need a half credit to fill out a lab or language, TAKE THIS CLASS. And take it with Polina if she teaches it again (make sure you like the TA teaching this class). We learned some theory (nothing you wouldn't learn in 205 or 210), and the majority of the class focused on aural training (dictation and intervals\/chords) and mini projects - presenting your instrument, presenting a piece of music and why you think it is great, etc. Low key, low stress and a lot of fun - Our final exam consisted of a magic show and dinner at Wall St. Pizza.",
    "Solid course in music, take it if you want to learn some pretty darn cool things about classical music\/composition\/theory.",
    "Very useful class. LOVED it. However, the TEACHER is HIGHLY IMPORTANT, so choose wisely. Also, you will have private sessions on keyboard --- choose this teacher even more wisely. If you do your research well, you can find a spectacular teacher (like Polina Sergeevna Nazaykinskaya) and you will have a WONDERFUL class for one semester.Too bad it only could last one semester...",
    "Yes! Is a need for music major anyway.",
    "MUSI 218 was a great way to start practicing ear training, sight singing and identification of features of a piece that make it distinctive and being able to talk about it. You also take a keyboard lab in conjunction with the class which gets you to do real time realizations of figured bass.The class was tons of fun and my instructor, Polina Nazaykinskaya, taught it from a composer's stand point (as opposed to say, a music theory standpoint) and I absolutely loved it! As a music major concentrating in composition, I picked up a ton of techniques from class in addition to useful tricks in sight singing and dictation.",
    "This is a great, fun, low-stress introduction to different genres of music and to theory and ear training. It's only half a credit and you can take it without taking theory concurrently, and I looked forward to it as a class where I'd learn something fun and useful each week, and get to listen to great music and new instruments and styles. The class is small, you get to meet lots of people interested in music, the instructors are enthusiastic, and the piano lab also gave me a chance to try jazz piano and really complemented the class material. Definitely take it, even if you aren't planning to be a music major! It's a fun way to add music to your week.",
    "Sight singing, dictations, etc. Really wonderful class teaching (what for some people, like me) is really difficult material. Polina is great-- always cheery, and very patient with those students that are not given to the subject matter, which makes for a comfortable, low pressure atmosphere. Willing to spend time out of class with students who need help getting up to speed. Also, her husband does amazing magic tricks. Would highly recommend knowing your music theory well beforehand to get as much as possible out of this class. This will definitely be one of my more memorable classes from Yale.",
    "It was an awesome class, but mainly because of the teacher, Polina. If it wasn't with Polina I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it anywhere near as much. We sang pieces, people presented on instruments if they played one, we all played and talked about pieces of music that we liked (from classical to dubstep to soundtracks). It was very little work, only a couple easy quizzes and one presentation and all in all very enjoyable. We had pizza and a magic show instead of a final - that's how great Polina is!Also, you don't need to be amusic genius to take this - I had only taken music 110 and some other students in the class were currently taking 110.Advice: if you're interested, shop the sections to be in a class with fun people and a relaxed, enthusiastic teacher."
