   "comments": [
    "I learned more about writing extended screenplays and how to evaluate them critically and objectively.",
    "This course will not help you to better understand structure (or even formatting necessarily). Professor Lapadula's primary focus is on your ability to craft a cohesive story, whatever it may be. The most valuable insight and skill you will take away from this is learning to craft a 20-30 page story and better understand the process of workshopping, writing\/re-writing, and taking\/giving notes.",
    "Learn how to refine screenwriting\/storytelling skills developed in Intro with Marc and other talented writers.",
    "I strengthened my ability to plot stories and work with full narratives, as well as my ability to analyze others' scripts for weaknesses and make recommendations to fix them. In this course I've definitely gotten better at thinking about stories as a whole and how each scene in a script builds to the full narrative, and definitely also got better at revising and rewriting my scripts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Lapadula is this course's biggest strength. He is very adamant and knowledgeable about screenwriting.",
    "This course does not have many assignments or hard deadlines for your script. You will be asked to pitch an idea, write the first 5-10 pages of the idea, write a full draft, then turn in your final draft. You may be assigned to view 1 or 2 films and write a 1 page response for each. That being said, you will get the most out of this class if you are setting deadlines for yourself and working to get your script workshopped as much as possible. Often times, people would miss their assigned workshop day and we would not have any scripts to go over. If you have another draft of yours ready, you can get more notes on it and make it a better script. Even if you're not a film major, this is a very valuable process and space if you hope to write more in the future. Most people only get their full draft workshopped once before the final draft. I had mine workshopped twice, and I would say the feedback I got the second time around was much more helpful than the first. After undergoing a huge rewrite for my final draft, I found myself wishing I could have workshopped a third time.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the feedback component. Getting to present a script and having both Professor Lapadula and the class offer comprehensive feedback on it was extremely helpful in learning how to identify weaknesses in my work and revise it, in learning how to analyze others scripts, and learning how to best offer feedback to others. Having a group of other writers read your work is extremely valuable. If there is a weakness to the course it's that I wish there were more class time so everyone could present more often and have more revisions of their scripts."

   "comments": [
    "I would gladly recommend this course as I fell like I've gained a lot from it. It's one of the classes that I will remember down the road.",
    "I would recommend this course interested in screenwriting. Especially if you could see yourself wanting to be involved in the film industry, this class will provide you with some insight about the business that you may not get otherwise (Professor Lapadula brings in two managers towards the end of the semester).",
    "This course is intended for film majors in the Screenwriting track who want to do the yearlong advanced seminar their senior year. That said, I was a Poli Sci major -- among many other non-film majors -- who thoroughly enjoyed this course. It's a great opportunity to develop storytelling skills, meet other passionate writers, and network with industry professionals.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is serious about learning screenwriting and wants to improve both their writing and revision skills in that medium. It's not a course I would recommend someone take just for fun because they won't get a lot out of it if they aren't engaged.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing screenwriting, definitely take this course. Marc is helpful with developing skills and making students think about their storytelling."
