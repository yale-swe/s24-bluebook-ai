    "ENGL 115 05 was a course covering many different books that revolved around the topic of Minor Voices. If you like discussion, thinking about the nuances in literature, and improving on your essay structuring abilities, take the course!",
    "Fun class with a great set of readings. The readings can become a little overwhelming, especially towards the end of the semester, but I think it's a great way to get a writing credit, especially with Prof Xiang.",
    "You read a lot, you write a lot. I enjoyed the material of Minor Voices -- in particular Maus, cannot recommend enough -- and felt like a much more confident writer by the end of the semester. Great WR credit.",
    "Great literature course."
