   "comments": [
    "A really good seminar on AI. If I learned a single skill, it was how to have a conversation about technology that was grounded in reality, rather than one had in platitudes or scifi-esque language.",
    "I learned a lot about the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and machine research. This class was such an interdisciplinary study of politics, economics, ethics, and technology. I gained a vocabulary I previously did not have.",
    "You learn a lot about the theoretical arguments about the importance of existential risks, risks arising from advanced artificial intelligence, and the political science investigation of the field as related to cyber conflict, arms races, and autonomous weapons.",
    "I did not learn anything by taking this course. The material was fascinating but we didnt learn anything because the class was so unstructured.",
    "I learned about a subject, artificial intelligence, that is not very well studied but will have great implications on all aspects of society in the future. The course to me was more about understanding artificial intelligence, its capabilities, timelines, concerns and potential effects, rather than learning any knew skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class really needs more structure. Each week has a particular topic, but the agenda doesn't go much farther than that. It's nice in a sense that the students can pick the conversation topics for seminar, but it seemed like poor planning if somebody would pose a question at the beginning and then that would end up being the only thing we talked about for the entire time. I would have appreciated if Professor Dafoe had more of an agenda on what should be discussed in each class.",
    "Often it was unclear what time horizon we would be talking about in class, so one thing I think this course could improve would be to focus from the onset on a specific time period.",
    "This course was an interesting study of a budding and not commonly studied subject. The professor was very flexible with the syllabus and made sure to get feedback. The course also changed in response to current events, which I enjoyed. The biggest weakness of the course was the lack of transparency and clarity with assignments. I didn't really know what the professor expected of the reading responses or the final paper. I also thought the difficulty of grasping the technicalities of AI made the discussion\/course a little difficult, but this may be an inherent issue of the subject matter not the class.",
    "A strength of the course is the material and Professor Dafoe. A weakness of the course was that the seminars were sometimes disorganized with students going on irrelevant tangents.",
    "Strengths: the material could have been interesting Weaknesses: the class was led and structured so poorly that we did not end up learning anything, there was too much reading and we apparently were not supposed to do all of it, we did not get any feedback, there was too much emphasis placed on the final paper, which we did not work closely with Professor Dafoe on",
    "Strengths: fascinating subject matter, good diversity of readings, topics and discussion were very inter-disciplinary. Smaller seminar size (~13 students) was also conducive to course discussion. Weaknesses: the course could be difficult for students lacking the technical background and often descended into hypotheticals because superintelligence does not yet exist. It was possible, during course discussion, to continue to hypothetically imagine things, which often made discussion feel less substantive. The course could benefit from having better facilitated discussion. Students also did not receive much feedback on performance in the course and on assignments throughout the semester. Aside from a short midterm blurb, students did not receive any grades on assignments during the semester, which made it difficult for those students who lack the technical background for the course."

   "comments": [
    "The course is an opportunity to discuss the issues regarding artificial intelligence in a fairly small group every week and is interesting if that is a topic you are passionate about. However, the class lacked some structure and could thus seem a little poorly prepared for at times. That said, it was the first time Professor Dafoe offered the course and it will most likely improve in semesters to come.",
    "Absolutely take this class, great seminar.",
    "A great introduction for those who know nothing about AI and the issues surrounding it and a great deepening for those who come in with some knowledge. It was my favorite class of the semester and always a joy to attend. It really is a discussion seminar so you'll have to do the reading\/reading responses and come prepared with something you want to talk about as well as chime in. AI Safety is such an important topic and you might be shocked about the reality of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the politics of AI and technology more broadly. The class was a great merging of students in engineering, science, political science, and more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because the topic is fascinating and professor Dafoe is a great teacher.",
    "I would certainly not recommend this class to another student. Professor Dafoe does not know how to teach a class, he does not give feedback, and he does not know how to structure classroom discussion in a way that facilitates learning. The material could have been so cool (and that's the reason I took this class in the first place) but it was so poorly taught that I learned nothing.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking to learn about artificial intelligence, but I would be prepared to do some individual learning to actually understand how things work. It takes a bit to pick it up."
