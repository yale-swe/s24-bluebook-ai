    "yes, especially those involved in polymers",
    "I would recommend it to fellow student. Textbook used in this course is a fundamental book in the area of polymer science. We can also learn some experimental things in this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students working with polymers in their research, but I would caution them that the assignments can be quite burdensome. I have found that a lot of the material (particularly after the first third or so of the course) has helped me in reasoning out things in my own research.",
    "This course covered several important topics in polymer physics, spanning polymer structure and statics, and dynamics. I would recommend this course to another student if he\/she was interested in this field specifically. It is very specific to polymer research. It is not, however, an overview course."

    "This did not contribute to my dissertation\/research much. My lab uses polymers to deliver proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. I was looking for a more general course. This course seems to be more geared towards industrial settings."
