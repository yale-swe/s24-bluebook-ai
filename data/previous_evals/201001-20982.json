    "Yes. See Question 1.",
    "If you are interested in how terrorism can affect our state and society, that is, if you are interested in the future, take this course.Reading list is huge, though - and perhaps can be distinguised between critical reading and optional reading - most people don't do all the reading.Perhaps, for next year, two assignment can be given per student - one is the presentation (as was done this year) and two would be a reading summary \/ guide to be handed out one week ahead of presentation by same student.",
    "Great overview of issues pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism. Especially the second part of the class, dealing with contemporary counterterrorism, makes you rethink your basic assumptions about this topic.",
    "Yes, highly recommend. It gives you comprehensive, up-to-date, and extensive knowledge of terrorism and ct.",
    "Yes. It does the job and you won't regret it.",
    "A study of the contemporary threat of terrorism facing the United States and other western countries. While grounded in history, the class correctly focuses on Al Qaida and their associates and 21st century terrorist methodologies. After outlining the threat, the class outlines the policy solutions available to contemporary decision-makers.",
    "This course thoroughly covered the issues concerning terrorism and counterterrorism, including traditional debates and the current hot topics which the United States and the world are facing.I would recommend this course to others because students who take this course can understand the essence of the issues debated in the present world about terrorism.",
    "If you are interested in terrorism or CT, you should take this class.",
    "I would if they were interested either in Terrorism or in policy, though I would say the small group sessions were more useful than the lectures.",
    "Recommended for anyone interested in international security, and an insight into the developing terrorist threat."

   "comments": [
    "My chosen profession is about the management of risk - there is no more relevant issue than terrorism to how we will live in the years ahead - Prof. Gottlieb provided me with a profound understanding of the issue and how it can and will challenge the very fabric of our society, legal system, civil liberties, and national security policy.The ability to view such risk and its effects comprehensively is critical to sound risk management and productive capital investment.",
    "Good information in course material, although some material is a bit repetitive.",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in terrorism, counterterrorism or American foreign and domestic policies regarding these issues.",
    "This class provided a great launching pad from which to move toward an understanding in security. The course was more of an overview than an in-depth study; from here it would be interesting to take a more in-depth study of the topic. Good course.",
    "This course provided me with new perspectives on governments' decision-making on counterterrorism, which were also applicable to other issues.Especially the role of discourse about terrorism\/counterterrorism contributed a lot to my study on presidential discourse.",
    "I learned a lot.",
    "It provided me with a basis that will be useful for my future work experience, as well as helping with policy training which will be important in the jobs I am looking at for after Yale.",
    "It enhanced some general and broad understanding of the topic, the patterns and directions of terrorism, so it's a very good introduction to the topic."
