    "It is italian... you learn more italian...",
    "This is a course that is meant to improve skills that were touched on in past italian classes. It is a lot of work, but you will improve your skills. The teachers are nice and willing to help.",
    "The class is level 3 Italian with more cultural education than was included in the first two levels. I would recommend this class because I have learned Italian very well - the environment makes it almost impossible to walk away with little to no knowledge of Italian.",
    "Italian 130 offers a review of all of the major grammatical concepts learned in Italian 110 and 120. Because the material is therefore not entirely new, you will have an opportunity to really fine-tune your language skills and focus on building your vocabulary. Definitely take this class with Prof. Lorenzini if you can. As a native speaker, she is a great resource to have, and she is extremely warm, gentle, and approachable.",
    "Italian 130 is a repetition of grammar learned in L1 and L2 Italian classes with a focus on practicing speaking the language. Language skills are also honed through literature and film."
