   "comments": [
    "Nothing, this class is a waste of time and effort. They expect you to already know how to do everything for the actual design project by grading you on things they don't teach. The only time the stuff they teach is useful is on the multiple midterms and final. Even then, it's basically just memorizing things like statistical analysis formulae and charts.",
    "I learned a lot about design as an engineer in the real world, with applications to constructing a CubeSat. I feel like a lot of my instincts about design improved dramatically by taking this course, and were complemented by learning actual technical ways to design\/analyze\/manufacture a product really thoroughly. Out of the engineering classes I have taken at Yale, I feel like this one gives the best impression of what it feels like to actually design a product, because you have to use a lot of what you learn in other classes to design a product.",
    "I developed core engineering design, assembly and teamwork skills in this class.",
    "Learned much more about what goes into producing a product and how important that process is to the final product.",
    "A good deal of basic knowledge about the processes of mechanical design. I also had never fabricated anything before, basically, so I gained essential hands-on experience.",
    "I gained machining skills that were very helpful. Not much great in the way of learning actual product design, but as a very basic introductory class, hopefully it set me up to learn more in following product design classes.",
    "I learned many of the necessary forms required for Mechanical Engineering projects. I also learned some truss analysis and impact analysis",
    "Designing and building as a group.",
    "I learned a lot about the engineering design process, as well as tools and techniques used to develop a prototype from an initial idea into a final project. these include learning prototyping, concept evaluation tools, design software such as CAD, and machining methods including milling, lathes, and 3d printing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was fundamentally flawed and after talking to professionals in the real world of engineering for businesses, not just from an academic setting, I learned that almost all the time spent on this class and all deliverables (your weekly assignments) were a waste of time and not actually correlated to real life. If you want to make a product that is the most sensible, you will not do well. This class is looking for absurd designs that would never pass in the real world. If you try to examine this and point it out, they will simply dislike your project more. Your grade is very much linked to whether they like your design, if they don't, even if it is more realistic than others, they will make sure you don't get a good grade.Another flaw is that all the lectures are made to be memorized and regurgitated word-for-word on the exams (Why are there 3 exams in a design class?). They have no basis for your actual project and following all the \"rules\" just makes the design process more convoluted and lengthy. Using silly charts and arbitrary calculations to decide whether an idea is better than another when you can clearly see it is is stupid. It has no strengths other than you get to use the Mech E machine shop and talk to Nick, who actually knows how to do stuff in a no-nonsense manner.",
    "Strengths - really hands-on class, lecture feels applicable and is super engaging, group project-based class, every time I left class or lab I felt like I learned something. Weaknesses - at times the manufacturing techniques covered in lecture felt a little bit abstract and irrelevant to what we were actually doing because while we were manufacturing a single product one time in the class, we were learning about how to manufacture millions of products.",
    "The course honestly is just all strengths. The way the material is presented and implemented into our work was precisely like a real world example and was very helpful in understanding the kinds of things that engineers actually do.",
    "The lectures seemed rushed due to the amount of material vs. Allotted time, therefore it was very difficult to take notes\/learn the material in class. The professor and TAs are very willing to help though and everything for the course is pretty much laid out from the beginning. Organized.",
    "The material we get tested on, especially towards the second half of the semester, is not super related to the design work we're doing on the CubeSat. The tests seem kind of irrelevant, but they also assess useful knowledge for those of us hoping to work in industry. Also, there isn't really enough time allotted for the final prototype stage. Other than that it's a really strong course.",
    "Im not the biggest fan of the CubeSat project. Also, the final is very heavily memorization oriented. I also didnt like that we spent most of the semester doing paperwork and actually built our design in a few weeks.",
    "The success of the group is somewhat dependent on the random people one gets grouped with, which is frustrating, but realistic. Also a lot of the design process felt unnecessary.",
    "this class had both a biweekly lecture and a lab. while i felt that most of the work done in the lab was helpful and constructive, i thought that the lectures were generally only tangentially related to the primary goal of the class (design and build a prototype) and mostly unhelpful. the lectures covered a lot of content covered in other engineering classes, but in less depth. furthermore, i felt that for a project based class, there was too much emphasis on the early stages of the design process. we spent 10 weeks doing low fidelity (read:poster board, hot glue, and popsicle stick) prototypes, concept sketches and cad, and only the final week and reading period developing a physical project. i think the class would be improved by cutting some of the busywork in the earlier parts of the semester, bumping up the schedule for the class, and adding a second build phase, allowing for flaws in the initial design to be improved upon. this would help the class mirror the iterative design process used in the real world, other engineering design classes, and the process that was discussed in the first lecture. it would also make the class more interesting and engaging in my opinion."

   "comments": [
    "No, never. It's horribly taught, the design project is boring and over-done. It gives you 1 credit but is the class time of a lab and a lecture so you should at least get 1.5 credits. You don't learn anything legitimate and none of the stuff is useful in the real world. If your not ABET, take ME 118",
    "I would recommend this to any student who is interested in engineering design and has taken more than one semester of engineering-related courses at Yale. Its a super fun class, the TFs are amazing, Professor Kramer is a really good instructor who cares about you, your engagement in class, and your performance on the project, and you get a lot of experience with a lot of different important engineering skills. That said, if you are a first semester first year taking this class, in my opinion it would be a lot harder because the vast majority of the time you do not have the technical or knowledge background to approach the problems faced in this class that you would have if you took the class a semester or two later. Its a challenging course, and I think you can get a lot more out of it if you take it when you have more experience.",
    "I would honestly recommend this course to not only engineering students but all students, just to learn the ways that engineering can impact the world around us.",
    "Yes it is a fun course to really get a small taste of hands on Engineering. You learn a lot about the process as a whole.",
    "Yes, and not even just for mechanical engineering majors. I think it's a really useful course in a few ways. A lot of people end up in the engineering industry even if they aren't employed as engineers, and this course is a good way to gain basic knowledge of how those companies work.",
    "For anyone interested in product design, this class is a good (and necessary) first step.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who like the year-long project. However, doing the same thing for the whole semester wont be good if youre stuck with a project or group you dont like.",
    "I would recommend this if you want a group project based class.",
    "Absolutely. despite some flaws in the way the class was orngaized, i enjoyed the class a lot, and thought that i learned quite a bit in taking it."
