    "definitely take this if you follow current events",
    "overall it was a good course, though the information is not as relevant as one might assume",
    "A pretty good class! Take it!",
    "Take it. It was probably the most well-taught lecture course I've taken in 4 years at Yale. There was a decent amount of reading, but not all of it is necessary to do well. Only 3 midterms, not cumulative and no final. Bullock is the perfect professor. Precise and always clear about what the takeaway points are from each class and about what he expects on exams. Also paid very close attention to students needs and concerns. Clearly he takes his job as a teacher just as seriously as he takes his job as a researcher--and he does a pretty damn good job at both.",
    "Psychology 332 delves into the big questions surrounding the human mind and political phenomenon. We started off talking about obedience to authority and conformity to social norms, followed this by examining how individuals run through cognitive processes (heuristics) and ended with an observing how political campaigns can attempt different tactics to varying degrees of success.Like with all psychology, everything is relatively intuitive, but it is most fascinating to examine the empirical research which substantiates many claims we think that are general truths.",
    "I'm a senior Psych major that had never taken even a cross-listed PoliSci class in my life. Bullock made the topic approachable and engaging, and his lecturing style is really clear. The grading is precise but incredibly fair, and the workload is easily manageable. I loved this class, definitely take it if you're interested in any of the topics on the syllabus.",
    "I would recommend it more if you a poli sci major, rather than a psych majors. It is politically focused and the psychology topics that are presented are pretty repetitive with other courses.",
    "I had a lot of trouble with the exams in this class. They're really nit-picky and often contain too many questions for the allotted amount of time. The material is really interesting sometimes though.",
    "Take this class!Prof Bullock is wonderfully clear in his explanations of concepts. It is also clear that he is an incredibly intelligent academic and you should definitely talk to him (I didn't but I wish I did).Beware: You should know that the course is about the *application* of concepts in psychology to politics. It isn't about how to be a good\/effective politician.",
    "PLSC 201 discusses topics such as authority, conformity, prejudice, and biased decision making in the context of politics. There are three exams (and the possibility of writing an essay in the place of the third exam). There are about five to eight required articles each week. I would not recommend the class to a fellow student as the lectures are somewhat dry. I would also not recommend the class to someone who has not taken an introduction to statistics class.",
    "Political Psychology was my favorite class this semester. Professor John Bullock is a genius. You read A LOT of experiments \/ papers in this class, the reading load is huge but it's all worth it. The readings are very interesting and Professor Bullock's commentary on them only makes them more interesting. He makes efficient use of your time; lectures are very fast; you definitely will have a hard time keeping up if you day dream, but they are at the perfect pace. Even though they are only 50 mintues long, you learn a lot.It has really changed my perspective on politics.The class is also EXTREMELY FAIR. Grading is all blind, everything is very systematic. There are no surprises. Professor BUllock is fair in his exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially a political science major who's still interested in psychology.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend Political Psychology (PLSC 201\/PSYC 332) to a broad cross section of students. The course is definitely indispensable to anyone with an interest in American politics and political decision making, particularly at the individual level. Additionally, this course should be highly recommended for political science and psychology majors because of the ways it melds theory with experiments and data in an attempt to capture many of the cognitive and social processes that are behind how voters and leaders choose between alternative principles or political candidates. Finally, I would recommend this class to students who simply have an interest in decision-making (even non-political decision-making) since the class discusses many formulations of decision-making models including prospect theory and Bayesian updating. The workload for this class is on par with that of most other Yale courses. There are weekly readings as well as three noncumulative midterm examinations administered in class (a nice break from the usual monotony of midterm and final exam or final paper). The weekly reading could take anywhere from an hour or two to five or six hours or more depending on how thoroughly you read and how acutely you pay attention to detail. The three exams were straightforward and graded very fairly. They all were similar in format and contained a combination of short answer questions and, occasionally, an essay. Students who pay attention in class and understand the reading can easily do well. In lieu of taking the third exam, Bullock gave the option of a take-home essay due at the end of reading period. John Bullock is a really great instructor who combines theory and experiments, data, and statistics well during lectures. He might be scary at first, but he is actually a nice person once you get to know him. Sections also complemented the course well. Do not be intimidated by the strict section policy stated in the syllabus; participating in the section was a lot of fun.",
    "An interesting look at how social psychology applies to the political arena. Professor Bullock is fun to listen to. Definitely some repeat from Social Psych, but still interesting and worthwhile if you've already taken that (especially if you don't know much about politics).",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in the psychology of political choices. This class isn't about politicians or manipulation. You read a lot of studies so if you're uncomfortable with that you might need to rethink taking the class. That being said, the information is very interesting and easy to understand, as professor Bullock covers the most important points thoroughly in class. One of the major upsides is that the class is broken down into three sections with three tests (or a final paper instead of the 3rd test). This is really great because the information load is much smaller than taking a final and you will actually understand the topics in detail.",
    "PLSC 201 is definitely a technical social psych class. We apply it to politics, yes, but consider this more a PSYC class than a PLSC class. If you want to gain valuable knowledge in how political science research is conducted--experimental design, analysis, etc.--then this class is useful, but don't expect it to follow suit with most other PLSC classes at Yale.",
    "A student interested in psychology but primarily in the political science field is probably the ideal candidate for this class. As a political science major, I found the material interesting and different, while easy to understand. Keep in mind though that it's more political applications of specific psychological phenomena, rather than the psychology of political decision-making. Also, the grading felt kind of arbitraryand stressful at times--the class is 30% A or A- and the TFs use blind grading. Still, take it! Bullock is a great lecturer.",
    "Take it if your interested in politics or pschology",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course with a manageable workload. More focused on the psychology side of political psychology, however.",
    "A very strong intro to political psych. Great professor. Nice format with 3 exams. Interesting material. Would definitely recommend, especially if you are interested in the material or are looking for a different type of polisci course.",
    "It's an accessible introduction to political psychology. There's no homework besides 3 in-class exams (non-cumulative). Grading feels a bit arbitrary, but it is blind grading in the course. Bullock is a very good lecturer.",
    "Poli-Psych is a pretty solid course, and if you're looking for an interesting polisci lecture it's a good option. You'll cover a lot of interesting material, and a lot of very well-known experiments. There is a fair amount of reading, but it's not difficult and in any case it's interesting.",
    "Definitely, especially to anyone that has a hard time choosing between poli sci and psych.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class even if you are majoring in something that is not at all related to politics. The theories and ideas we discuss in this class help explain many of the things we see happening in politics everyday. It helps you understand what it really means to be a \"well informed citizen\". Professor Bullock also makes it possible to do well as long as you put in the effort.",
    "Definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course or another course taught by Professor Bullock, because I think it is his unique perspective that really makes the course."
