    "I gave the readings a low rating because I don't know that they truly corresponded to what we were studying. We werent really using a textbook and the readings were not at all addressed in class so seemed mostly unnecessary",
    "I really enjoyed this course overall. I learned a lot putting together the 3 presentations, and really enjoyed the small group feel and discussions. I thought there could have been one less presentation and a little more of Ann's lecturing. It felt like the course was missing a bit of structure, and I think a few more readings would have been helpful.",
    "I believe this course would have been even more useful if a packet was handed out that contained lists of prevalent forest health issues. For example: a couple pages on insects that cause diseases, a couple pages on fungi, a couple pages on the effects of fires, floods, droughts, winds, hurricanes, etc. This would be a 30-50 page packet that could be taken out of class and referenced in the future. There could even be blank templates in the packet that could be filled out by students while listening to classmates' presentations.i LOVED this class!",

    "The emphasis on student presentations was very useful opportunity and provided a wide range of topics to learn about which may not have been otherwise addressed.",
    "The presentations were all so good. This was my favorite course of the year. It was awesome to get to study what I wanted, and learn from what other people were interested in. Fun. Stuff.",
    "Small group discussion and flexibility in choosing presentation topics.",
    "Ann was SO friendly, supportive, and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed her teaching style in this course. The best aspect was having students present three times. These presentations required a lot of planning, research, and practice. Ann's feedback was very helpful.",
    "The flexibility in choosing a topic! I was able to learn exactly what I wanted to, and most student topics focused on issues relevant to today.",
    "Having three presentations was GREAT. I can't say enough about this class design. It allowed me to pursue topics that I'm excited about but also learn what my classmates are interested in. I wish more classes at FES required as many presentations. Public speaking is one of the most useful skills I can learn while at FES.I also really liked having so many outside speakers come in. Always good to hear what's happening on the front lines."

   "comments": [
    "It seemed like there was heavier application and presentation on certain topics (eg forest fragmentation, ticks& lyme disease) especially with the New England case studies that had similar guest lectures. These may have been an opportunity to branch out more in the topics covered in student presentations if the guest lectures are still occurring.",
    "I never received any feedback on any work I did in this course, which is very disappointing.",
    "The supportive materials. The powerpoints are good but it is hard to study them afterward if you missed class or something - so maybe more informative suppor materials.",
    "I thought there were too few field trips (maybe one more would have been nice, just walking around the woods and talking through general forest health issues), and a little too heavy on the student presentation side. I would have preferred to have 1 less presentation and more of Ann's lecturing. She's so knowledgable and I felt like I didn't benefit from it as much in this course. Perhaps more outside lecturers, also?",
    "Two things. First, the packet I described in question 13 and more field trips. It would have been amazing to see a forest or stand that has serious health issues and be asked to identify what's wrong.",
    "The instructor-led lectures could be boiled down even more. Students tended not to pay attention to talk about taxonomy, but would listen when implications for management came up.",
    "Would be good to have fewer people leaving class early for other classes- it gets distracting."

    "I felt like the focus of the course was perhaps a bit more region-specific than was ideal for my own interests in tropical forestry. While many of the concepts apply broadly, there were a lot of individual case studies that may not be relevant in other settings.",
    "Forest health is important for me because of MF requirements and future forest management work",
    "I wanted to have a better understanding of how various considerations of forest health could be integrated into financial analysis. I actually think having an outside speaker talk about this could be really beneficial to the course overall. It would be interesting to learn more about how to translate these risks into business decision making (as it relates to forestland investing).",
    "As an MF, this course gave great insight into the complex puzzle of forest health. It also gave me the freedom to explore the topics I wanted and to improve presentation skills.",
    "This is the first class I've taken on forest health. It isn't a class I'll point to when talking to employers to prove that I'm an expert on the subject, but it is at least a good exposure. For people not focused on field research but more on policy\/communications issues, this is a good biological science credit.",

    "I needed another biological science credit for the MF degree, Ann is a great teacher, and I wanted more practice with longer (over 30 minute) presentations.",
