    "I really enjoyed this class. I did not come from an economics background so the material was sometimes a challenge to understand in comparison to the other students who were economics majors. At first I thought that the reading responses were a waste of time but grew to actually enjoy them because they made me focus on the information in the reading that Prof. Sindelar wanted us to take away. As a whole Sindelar was a very well-prepared lecturer and had a vast array of knowledge. I almost wish she focused more and what she has done in the past rather than other studies that she didn't know as thoroughly. Student presentations were not exactly the best use of time in devoting 3 classes to not well-prepared presentations were not exactly optimal."
