   "comments": [
    "I would take this class as an econ seminar if A. you want to learn about the banking system and B. if you want a class that won't be too draining on your psyche. I used to do all the reading for the class at the beginning of the term, but then realized that if I read one of the more important articles, and had a few talking points about it, I'd be one of the superstars of the session. So no biggie on the reading. And the final paper is so broad that you can make it fun -- choose something that you're actually interested in and go all out on it.",
    "This is a great course, but be prepared to take initiative in learning as the material comes at a very rapid pace.",
    "I enjoyed this seminar - it covers a lot of topics in the U.S. Banking system at a more in-depth level. I especially enjoyed the 15-20 page paper, which allowed me to really understand a particular topic in depth. Professor Perna was very helpful in directing me to a topic that was managable, so definitely make use of him as a resource for this.Decent amount of work - 30 or 40 pages of reading, 2 three-minutes presentations, and the paper.Make sure to be fairly familiar with financial markets before taking this - otherwise you may be somewhat lost.",
    "Excellent seminar and great overview of the banking system. A must for any student interested in a Fed career but also a good course for anyone who wants to add some more color to their intermediate macro class.",
    "I would recommend taking the class. For a senior seminar, it was really relaxed and stress free. I still learned a lot.",
    "Not much workload week-to-week, just a final paper. Take it if you're interested in the topic.",
    "If you need an econ seminar and want to go into banking then yes."
