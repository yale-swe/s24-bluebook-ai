   "comments": [
    "You should definitely take it! The workload is totally doable, and it's totally worth your time.",
    "Interesting course on different works from different literatures.",
    "Global Fictions is a neat class that encompasses many of the most trying issues of a globalized world. The works are interesting, not what you'll read in an average class, and the writing assignments leave a lot of room for personal exploration and for developing historical dimensions of essay topics. Professor Neuman is a passionate lecturer and loves when students come to class prepared and participate with useful, succinct points.",
    "Take this class! It's great if you enjoy learning about history through excellent works of fiction. Make sure to keep up with your reading though, otherwise it will bite you in the backside at the end of the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Good syllabus, interesting, varied approach to literature (based on theories of globalization, cultural\/economic\/religious history, etc.), good teacher. Reasonable amount of work. As a student of literature this class provided me with an interesting and useful alternate approach to reading\/analysis.",
    "Very interesting Professor with an approach unlike any of the English professors I've had at Yale. You may find the course a little buzzwordy, but it is interesting. Might not be your cup of tea but well worth shopping. Personally I liked it a lot.",
    "Global Fictions presents an interesting approach to literary criticism based on drawing on things outside the work of literature, especially historical context and attitudes. While it's easy to fall into standard criticisms of capitalism and imperialism, most of the course allows discussion of the subtleties of the effects at work in the books (and images) we looked at. Workload is pretty reasonable (1 paper during the semester), but reading period\/finals was stressful because most of our grade depended on the final essay and exam. Our year you had to write pretty quickly to finish the final, but that may change.",
    "Global Fictions is a wonderful course that I highly recommend. Even if you have no prior interest in globalization and its relationship to literature, this class provides a wonderful overview--as well as in-depth investigation--of many critical vectors of globalization and present-day issues that are inextricably tied to and represented in literature. Professor Neuman is great and will make the lectures and discussions really come alive. The class is not a huge amount of work, but you will come out of it having gained a lot. Definitely take this class!"
