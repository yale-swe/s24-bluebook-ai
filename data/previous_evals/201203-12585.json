   "comments": [
    "A casual book club with 16 intimidatingly brilliant peers and a witty, down-to-earth superstar professor- don't squander this opportunity. I always came back from class with a wild grin on my face.",
    "This class is everything a history buff ever dreamed of - it takes history and analyzes it in a way that most history students have not done upon entering the class. The class examines all aspects of history, from a historical document aspect in the Yale Archives, to watching a dramatization (Shakespeare in Love). I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow Yale student because it is so interesting and engaging. Gaddis combines his intellect of history with his ability to end class with a bang to create a vibrant seminar atmosphere. His humor is also unparalleled, and any other student would be lucky to have him as a professor.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this seminar for any future freshman who is fortunate enough to place into it. This was by far my favorite class, despite the fact that it is nowhere near what I plan to study here. Everything, from the class atmosphere to the concepts for the papers was highly enjoyable, which resulted in the class as a whole being extremely comfortable yet challenging. I feel that I genuinely retained what I learned from this course, and it won't beone of those classes from which I forget all the information two years down the road.",
    "TAKE IT. its john lewis gaddis, cmon. be prepared to do a LOT of reading though--well actually, be prepared to try to do a lot of reading and then skimming\/sparknoting instead",
    "There is a lot of reading to do for this class (including Tolstoy's War and Peace). The class is very writing based--the grade is based on 4 papers, which isn't too bad. The seminar is very good, the discussions were interesting and engaging, and Professor Gaddis is a great professor. Take it if you enjoy thoughtful discussions and don't mind doing lots of reading!",
    "It's more work than my other 3 classes put together and the class is overrated.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that everyone can get something out of. The class environment is sometimes intense, but each students eases into it in their own way over the course of the semester. Whether or not you do the reading, there are ways to contribute to the discussion and to the analysis, that probably was the best part of the class to me. Professor Gaddis wasn't out to police us, just to challenge our thinking and our way of doing.",
    "It's a frustrating seminar. You may not get what you want out of it, you may be killed by the amount of reading, you may leave the class uncomfortable. Most people I think find it worthwhile though just for the sake of getting to know Gaddis. If you're in it to improve your writing I'd say choose something else, but if you want be dumbfounded by the complexities of histories and read War and Peace, then go for it.",
    "If you can get in, TAKE IT! The waiting list is incredible and peopleshow up on the first day anyway (doesn't really work unfortunately) but if you are fortunate enough to get in the course is an incredible introduction to what Yale has to offer you. This class isn't limited to those with a specific interest in history, since we really redefined what history meant to us and it makes you think about academia and the world in a whole different way. You'll understand what that means once you've taken the course.",
    "If you get into What History Teaches, take it. I can't put my finger on specific things I learned, it's more of a paradigm shift of opinion about history. The class discussions were really fun, and I'm glad I read (most of) the readings since they were interesting and reputable.If you don't get in, don't worry. The work level is ridiculous for anyone, even an upperclassman. Of course no one reads everything, but sometimes it's sad because the readings are cool. Also, sometimes the discussions feel a little... engineered. You won't feel like you're missing out if you're not in the class.",
    "It is all about history as it is written rather than the facts of History. I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "Class discussions are excellent. I enjoyed having a famous professor in a seminar setting my first semester at Yale. Papers are unrelated to what we discuss in class, and expectations for the papers are often unclear.",
    "What History Teaches is an incredible course\u00e2\u0080\u0094as much because of the stunning reading list as because of Gaddis's tendency to weave interdisciplinary references and images into discussions; as much because of the inspiring writing prompts as because of the distinction made between \"history\" and \"the past.\" This course will probably change how you understand the field and study of history\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, even if it doesn't, you'll read some great examples of histories and historiographies, and you'll discuss them under the guidance of one of the best in the profession. If you're lucky enough to win the lottery for the course, there is no question that you should take it.(All that said, you should enter the lottery for this class for the right reasons. YOU SHOULD NOT ENTER THE LOTTERY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE IN A ROOM WITH JOHN GADDIS. You should consider taking this only if you've read the syllabus, seen that the material aligns with your interests, and are willing to engage thoughtfully with all of the reading, with your classmates, and with the close study of historiography. For those fitting that last description, it would be an unforgettable experience.)",
    "A good HU and WR credit. Definitely take this class if you are lucky to get in!",
    "I definitely would. A study of the studying of history- a great way to start your career at Yale.",
    "This was a fun and thought-provoking course, but be prepared for a huge amount of reading. The four writing assignments were actually in the realm of creative writing, rather than directly relating to our readings. This caught me by surprise, but was ultimately enjoyable. Having a seminar with Gaddis is incredible; do it!"
