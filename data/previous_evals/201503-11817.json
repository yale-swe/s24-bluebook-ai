    "This class is definitely a must for students considering going into engineering, and still extremely useful for students not planning or unsure about choosing an engineering major. The workload is manageable for the most part, and it doesn't really pick up until the last few weeks during the final project. With some good time management this is also manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENAS 118 to another student",
    "Awesome class, exactly what I was looking for to get me started in the CEID and confirm that I was interested in engineering. Recommended to all. Instructors are incredibly helpful, especially Dr. Wilen. They put in the extra hours and love to teach you new skills. Favorite course so far at Yale.",
    "ENAS 118 is a very challenging class but it is also a lot of fun. It has quite a bit of computer programming but this should not be a deterrent factor while shopping for the class, I had no experience with it and did fine on the homework and I feel like I learned a lot. I did not know whether I wanted to go into engineering before and if such was the case which type of engineering I would go into and I feel that after ENAS 118 I have a better answer to this question. Through several modules, each dedicated to one type of engineering, the class does an amazing job at presenting what engineering actually is. One the things that is very appreciable about ENAS 118 is that you actually feel like you are learning and applying this knowledge to the real world and it feels great. The class is a lot of fun: the homework involved building a box or programming a video game. One of our labs consisted of making chocolate, which is always a good thing! This class is an absolute must take.",
    "ENAS 118 is an introduction to all the different types of engineering fields so that one has a basic understanding of each to have in their toolbox and to be able to work with them in the future. I would definitely recommend it since it is a very interesting project based course where you come out feeling like you have made a difference and an impact.",
    "ENAS 118 is more of a project and less of a course -- you won't learn much from lecture, but you will learn things if you choose to incorporate such things into your project. The quality of this class then depends on what you're interested in getting out of it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone - it truly is such a different course from any other intro-level course at Yale, and I feel like I learned so much from it, both from an engineering aspect and from a teamwork aspect. Both of the profs are very approachable and involved in students' final projects, and I had a great experience with the TAs as well. Whether or not engineering is a field for you, it's a great insight into the field as a whole.",
    "It was a great introduction to the types of engineering with a real experience of what it's like to work with a client. I would definitely recommend this course to anybody interested in engineering who isn't sure about what type they want to pursue! This is also great for people not interested in engineering because it is a great experience.",
    "Fantastic class that I would recommend for anyone considering engineering or looking for an elective that is challenging yet rewarding.",
    "This class is awesome, providing a different but no less important kind of work, where you get to do hands-on projects and learn important skills for engineering. The CEID is an amazing space, and despite the early morning lectures, it was completely worth it to take this class. You learn a lot about different kinds of engineering (though not all, we kinda skipped BME and skimmed Green\/Environmental Engineering with lectures but no lab). The final project is a lot of work but you learn a lot and it's awesome if you have a great group, which you are likely to. Definitely don't be intimidated if you think you don't have enough prior experience, there might be some coders or people who can make an amazing wooden box, but overall nobody knows everything and you'll have stuff to learn and contribute. This class gave me a much better idea of what being an engineer might be like, which was extremely helpful. The TAs are awesome and the professors are also awesome.",
    "If you're a freshman considering engineering, take it. If you're a humanities major looking for a rewarding and fun non HU class, take it. If you have a stronger STEM background...ehhh you can probably take something else.",
    "A survey course that exposes you to all the different types of engineering offered at Yale. A very engaging course and great for exploring options, whether interested in engineering or not.",
    "It is an ambitious class; however quite disorganized. You will learn a lot of applicable skills you won't learn in any other course. The problem is that at some points problem sets are quite confusing. If you want an overall understanding of engineering -- it is a very good course to take. Workload is pretty manageable and it completely differs from any other course you would take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are considering engineering in any way but cannot decide if they really want it or not. This course allows people to see if they really want to be an engineer and if so what kind of an engineer. The course allows you to experiment with every branch of engineering and test if you like it or not.",
    "I really enjoyed the class for its real world applications and exposure to new techniques and technologies during labs. I felt like lectures were a bit of a waste of time in discussion format, because my fellow students and I didn't have a lot of specific knowledge about the different fields in engineering, asking us for examples didn't really help us learn anything new. In addition, because the lessons learned in lecture were never really used again, there wasn't a lot of incentive to study the material. However, this class introduced me to coding, and had us making games with arduinos, chocolate melters, and more. I'm really glad I got exposed to the resources of the CEID and engineering as a freshman. This course makes me consider engineering or CS as a major. Would recommend as a 5th class, because even though the workload is heavy, I feel like it's more fun than academic.",
    "To those asking what classes I'm taking, I call this an \"intro engineering class that takes a look at different engineering disciplines\" but it's a little more than that. It does indeed spend about a week or two per discipline (comp sci, mech, electrical, chem, and some others briefly) but also orients one to the capabilities of the CEID (the workshop itself, laser cutting or 3D printing, and Solidworks) and introduces one to management and working with a team on an engineering project. I recommend this course to everyone seriously considering a practical (vs theoretical) STEM major, especially those deciding between disciplines or looking for experience in working on a project.",
    "ENAS 118 is a survey course that covers many different types of engineering. It doesn't do very much in depth on any of these sections, but it does a great job of giving you a taste of each and then tying them together. I would definitely recommend ENAS 118 to another student because I feel like I learned a lot and had a ton of fun in the class (the CEID is also really awesome).",
    "ENAS 118 is a great course. I would recommend it to someone that is interested in engineering but I would warn them that it is has a heavy workload towards the end because of the final project.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENAS 118 for a student interested in engineering. It was a great way to get hands on experience with the design process, and it was one of the most valuable parts of my first semester at Yale.",
    "It's a survey engineering course where you get to learn a little bit about different types of engineering, and at the end, there's a final project with a real client which is really cool because you make a product that they will actually use. Yes, I would recommend it. It helped me figure out my interest in engineering.",
    "I would summarize it as a fun and relatively easy class until the last 3 weeks where it is still fun but very hard and time consuming.",
    "I really fun and hands-on survey of what's out there in engineering. We dabbled in programming, chocolate-making, and circuits--all in one class. I highly recommend it. You have to put the time in, but it's not crazy and the work is fun. The group project probably depends a little on your group, but it's structured enough that I don't think it could go too far wrong.",
    "Very fun course that primarily exposed me to the CEID and all the wonderful things it can do! Definitely recommended if you're interested in doing something different from pure academics. It can be quite a lot of work, but it all works out!"
