    "Take this!! Definitely top 5 classes I've taken while at Yale. If you're a junior or senior Chemical or Environmental Engineering major, you must take this class. This is the second class I've taken with Professor Kim, and it confirmed that he's the best Professor I've had at Yale. Oh yeah, did I mention that there's a free spring break trip? This year we went to Nicaragua. The class doesn't feel like that much work throughout the semester, but looking back, we accomplished so much. This year's class only had 6 students, and we all got really close and bonded, especially during the trip. There's nothing like hands-on experience in a developing country.",
    "GREAT CLASS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT It's a lot of work - you really need to own your project and carry it through the whole semester, but you'll love whatever you're doing by the end. There were only six students in the class when I took it, which was super fun. We all became good friends by the end of the semester.",
    "Where do I start in describing the greatness that was ENVE 410, Nicaragua, beans, tona, water\/air quality, and the man - Dr. Kim? I don't know, but this was an incredible semester with an amazing class, and a ridiculous group of people who you will become v close with (it turns out engineers are actually fun people, too!). I cannot recommend this course enough - let's start with the professor, who will turn out to become your friend. You will eat with him for at least 20 times through the semester in Nica and in NH. Professor Kim is caring, passionate, understanding and tough. He demands a lot from the class, the students, but at the same time is very understanding with what we have time with. You will learn a lot, much more than what traditional classes would. However, this class involved a lot of legit work, and the quality of our presentation was order of magnitudes better than the ChemE\/EnvE senior final presentation, which says a lot. Apply and be prepared to work, have fun, and wrap up your Yale experience with this class (i think this says a lot!)",
    "Environmental Technology in the Developing World is one of the best classes that Yale has to offer. As a chemical engineer, I have had to deal with a fair bit of challenges over the years, so I know what I'm talking about. There are few classes at Yale that change your perspective, push you outside of your comfort zones, and engage you the way this class does. The class is broken in to several one-class-per-week 3 hour class periods. The first 8 to 9 classes include guest lectures, opportunities to master a certain task (microbial analysis, air quality analysis, water quality testing, nanoparticle rejection, etc.), teach your teammates what you have mastered, and prepare for the main part of the course. The main part of the course is the Nicaragua trip where the whole class (Professor Kim, two TA's, and 6 students) spend a week conducting field tests. The strengths of the class is the amazing professor (Professor Kim is a genuinely interesting individual, who cares deeply about the well-being of his students and the success of the trip). The course also benefits from the multiple resources at our fingertips- the CEID (Dr. Wilen helped cut several cross sections of ceramic pots for our project), the wet lab (you get to conduct field experiment and run test modules for all of your class mates during the weeks leading up to the final trip), and Professor Kim's lab (some students conducted MS2\/bacteriophage testing during the weeks following the Nicaragua trip). The course can be improved by having a design component - something that students build in class and get to deploy in Nicaragua. Perhaps designing new filter, or brainstorming a way to address cultural problems (like water storage in a large tank). Or perhaps building an incubation kit so that more samples can be taken and used in Del Agua kit tests. Either way, I have full faith in Professor Kim's abilities to build and improve the course over time. He is an incredible professor and one of the \"all-time\" greatest professors that Yale has. I think Yale is very lucky to have him. Take this course. Take this course even if you are a second-semester senior. Take this course even if you don't need more credits for graduation. Take this course even if you are tired. Take this course even if you already have a job. Take this course even if you are already admitted to graduate school. Take this course if you want to learn. Take this course. Just take it.",
    "YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS. PROF. KIM IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT YALE. HE IS SO MUCH FUN, CARES A LOT, AND HIS PASSION FOR HELPING OTHERS IS CONTAGIOUS. Seriously, this is an amazing opportunity to travel to a developing country and see first hand the issues that arise with water and air quality. You will be able to design what types of experiments you want to conduct and the class partners with NGOs to hopefully make their work more impactful (or at least give them some data to consider). Take this class. You will not regret it."
