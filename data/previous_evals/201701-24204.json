    "Great course, you learn a lot about sexual selection, human biology\/the reproductive system, the biology of love and attraction, as well as some of the cross-cultural studies of these topics.",
    "I learned a lot about biology and sex that wouldn't have been apparent from a popular science standpoint.",
    "Great intro to reproductive ecology and evolutionary biology. Fantastic professor and TA",
    "I learned a lot about sex, love and reproduction.",
    "This course is great if you want to learn a bit of everything in the realm of sex. Where I got the most out of this is the ability to look at sex and love from a perspective outside of psychology. I thought it was great to get varied perspectives on the topic, and I learned a lot from our discussions on the biological basis of a lot of these topics.",
    "I developed more interdisciplinary methods of thinking of biology, evolution, humans, and society.",
    "I learned a lot about the evolution of sex but did not develop many skills or insights.",
    "This class was interesting for learning a evolutionary approach to thinking about the topics listed as the course title.",
    "This truly was an interdisciplinary class and I learned a ton of new things I wasn't expecting to. I feel like I have a much better understanding of evolution and the ways that we constantly continue to evolve. It was interesting to see how the science of evolution can also be applied to the interactions and workings of various societies.",
    "Understanding the evolutionary and biological development of traits relating to sex, love, and reproduction!",
    "I learned a lot of new things about the human reproductive system, how to view the world with scientific skepticism, and about the biological basis of love.",
    "I learned how to start tackling heavy, scientific reading assignments.",
    "This course taught me the importance of incorporating an evolutionary mindset, not only when thinking about biology in a classroom setting, but also when thinking about daily experiences throughout everyday life.",
    "I learned a lot more abi human biological process and sexual process that often gave many misconceptions",
    "I thought this was a very interesting course. I learned a lot about the reproductive systems of both sexes and the evolution of sexual intercourse for reproduction."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings were a bit excessive in length, though the topics were interesting and relevant. Lecture was always engaging and the guest lectures were fun too. This class has a low workload which is great, but you really do gain a lot of new information and insight from it.",
    "The guest lectures were very good and interesting. However, the normal instructor's lectures could seem disorganized and the pace was fairly slow. I think most of what we talked about in the course was very surface level and therefore after taking the course I don't feel that I learned a lot out of it. However, the content was interesting so it was somewhat enjoyable even if most of it felt like a review of things already learned.",
    "The course is overall very fun and engaging, but the readings don't always seem to inform the lectures. I really appreciated the illustrative activities and meditation that we engaged in.",
    "The professor was great, enthusiastic, and really committed to making sure we learned concepts, rather than memorized facts. He was engaging and made sure to include lots of different ways of presenting material - lectures, visuals, videos, movies, discussions, readings. The lectures were hard to follow because I felt he jumped around a lot and called on people, rather than simple explanations of new terms. There was a lot of emphasis on participation, but there were a lot of people in the class so I felt like I didn't always have an opportunity to talk. Also, it was unclear how much we were expected to take away from the readings, since they were often much more detailed than the lectures. I learned a lot, but was disappointed with the structure of the grading and the class at times.",
    "I'm really glad a course on this topic is taught at Yale. It felt a little disorganized at times but the professor really does care about the topic and students.",
    "Strengths- lectures, meditations, course objectives Weaknesses- lack of transparency about grades.",
    "Strengths: There are a LOT of topics that are covered with different perspectives, which makes the topics go a bit more quickly in case there's a topic you don't find interesting\/have a hard time understanding. Additionally, the topics are covered in enough detail to be able to discuss them, but not so much detail that you feel overwhelmed - it was a good balance. Weaknesses: Sometimes the topics seemed a bit disjointed week to week. Additionally, the amount of your grade that is put on just showing up and not on engagement was frustrating.",
    "The strength of this class was how interesting and engaging the professor made the material, as well as his approach to teaching as a partnership. The only weakness is that it was based largely on readings, so if you couldn't do the readings for a meeting, you might not get a lot out of that meeting.",
    "The way the exams are done and the practice tests and the way times the forms are turned in.",
    "Professor Duque is by far the biggest strength of this course. He is an amazing and caring professor that you can tell wants to be there to help the students. He is passionate about what he has to teach and also stresses positive mental health. I really enjoyed the 5 minutes of meditation at the beginning of each class. The biggest weakness of this class was the little communication\/feedback on our grades. Knowing where we stood in the class and how we could improve would have been helpful.",
    "This course was rigorous but I feel like I am coming out of it having learned a lot. I was caught a little off guard as it is quite science based and many of the readings (almost all) were scientific literature. Although I struggled to immediately feel comfortable, I eventually adjusted and figured out how to go about this class. There needs to be more feedback earlier so that those adjustments can be made sooner thus not impacting our grades as harshly. It would be nice if there were some assignments throughout the semester so that the grades weren't so heavily based on the midterm, final, and participation.",
    "Wish the readings were more condensed to get a better grasp of each before class. But other than that, the class is incredible!!",
    "Strengths: professor really listens to the students' feedback on how the course is running, very willing to adapt to the students' preferences if feasible, I love the 5-minute meditation that we do before every class, I also really appreciate how participation can be accounted for by writing comments and sending emails because I'm a fairly shy person and speaking publicly in class is sometimes difficult, presentation PowerPoints were uploaded on time and very easy to study from, list of objectives listed for every class made studying for exams very easy, no exam during finals week Weaknesses: structure was a bit disorganized, jumped from place to place in topic sometimes, readings could get a bit overwhelming at some points, reading responses were due at an odd time, not many tests\/assignments to be evaluated on and this term, there were only 2 exams and the 1st one didn't happen until a lot later in the semester, so it was sometimes difficult to know what our grade was and how we stood in the class (but again, after bringing this up to the TF and the professor, they tried to fix it as best they could), didn't have a TF until like the second month of the term or something",
    "Very interesting, engaging readings.",
    "This class has a great lecture style and I really enjoyed meditating before class. The only weakness I can think of is the time the readings were due: 6PM on Wednesday. It would have been nice to have had until at least 8PM to complete the readings.",
    "I did not like how our grade depended on the midterm and final only(participation counts but in relative terms no). There should be smaller tests to take the pressure off the midterm and final.",
    "This course was a wonderful blend between a science and social science course and was truly enjoyable."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend. Lecture is great and the workload is low, so it's a great 5th credit. You also really learn a lot, however I will say that some people did not expect the course to be so bio\/science-y and we did not get to any kind of cultural anthro type of content till the end of the course so just know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "Interesting content and generally good class. Lectures can be disorganized and the pace is a little slow. Additionally, the participation requirement is a bit ridiculous for a lecture and seemed to result in people talking without really saying anything worthwhile just to fulfill the silly requirement that we occasionally talk in class. Good way to fulfill a requirement though.",
    "How to explain my thoughts on this class... Eduardo really cares and wants you to learn, and the material is very interesting (particularly the readings). Certain aspects of the class were... less great. Having a participation grade in a lecture of 40 people is strange, even if they try to accommodate shyer people. I think the fact that we meditate at the beginning of every class might give you an indication of the style of teaching. At times, the course felt disorganized, but if you put in the work around the exams, it's really not that bad. Some in the class felt that, with the emphasis on scientific studies and evolution, etc, that it should be a Sc credit. I disagree - it's definitely an anthro course and not a science course. However, it might be helpful for humanities majors to go in understanding that biology is an important part of the subject and therefore is part of the course.",
    "Even if you think you know a lot about sex and sexuality, this is a pretty illuminating course. The teaching staff is incredibly invested in your understanding and success and the subject matter is super interesting!",
    "I learned some really interesting concepts!",
    "Yes, but I would recommend taking a general bio course before or risk some of the heavier material going over your head!",
    "Yes, it was great.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course to another student, but I wouldn't necessarily not recommend it either. If you're interested in the topic, then it's probably worth it. If you're looking for a gut, find one that doesn't grade you on whether you show up or not.",
    "Take this class!! If you're in humanities, it's a good intro to evolutionary topics in an approachable way. If you're in STEM or especially EEB, it's a really great way to think about sides of evolution you won't in other classes. You learn about evolutionary influences that aren't strictly biological yet still change the way humans evolved. If you're premed in EEB, this class would be a super interesting to look at human development.",
    "No.",
    "Yeah! This is a great course and I would recommend any class with professor Duque.",
    "I personally wouldn't have taken this class if I really knew what it was about. Although I am glad I saw it through, I was hoping to get a much more sociological base from this class but instead feel like I covered more E&EB than SOCY. Also, as a very non-science type person, this was an unnecessary stress to me as science classes are certainly not my strength and this was essentially one.",
    "Take this class!! It's not terribly hard and you'll learn the coolest conversation starting facts with this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I have to warn them that though this falls under a sociology credit, it is quite biology based, and that was a little concerning to some of the students in the class who didn't have a foundation for biology. A lot of the students wondered why it wasn't counted as a Sc credit actually. It's a great 5th class to add onto your schedule. The topics of the course were interesting but the flow and execution of the material was a bit disorganized at some points. But the scope of the topics we talked about and all of the case studies and evolutionary hypotheses covered were really fascinating.",
    "Yes, if they were interested in the evolution of sex, reproduction, etc.",
    "This class is amazing and I definitely would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would say that you should take it if you are a beginner in scientific inquiries. The material isn't great, but manageable to a non stem student. But that is my opinion. It could be much better for someone else passionate about sexual selection.",
    "This class is applicable to every student, regardless of major. The content is so interesting and relevant.",
    "i wouldn't recommend this corpse just because the grades are archaic and you don't really receive input on how you are doing in the course and how your grades are affected up until you take the midterm which grading can be unclear and unfair given that there was never a precedent or an expectation requested out of the responses that one was required to give.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I thought it was very interesting and I really enjoyed the professor."
