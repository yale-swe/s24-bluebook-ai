    "I improved my Chinese immensely! Chinese L1 and L2 are both very rigorous and serve to create a solid foundation for your Chinese learning. In Chinese L3, you have a new textbook with even more words, language, and grammar structures! I improved my speaking, listening, and reading skills greatly! I'm on the road to speaking Chinese even more fluently.",
    "I developed my Chinese speaking and writing skill.",
    "Builds confidence in everyday conversations, useful grammar structures, and relevant vocab words.",
    "I learned a lot of new Chinese vocabulary and grammar patterns. I improved my accent and pronunciation. I learned vocabulary about parties, travel, relationships, illness\/hospitals, job interviews\/business, and homes. I also learned how to write (and pronounce) a lot of characters.",
    "Greater knowledge of grammar and sentence structures. More confidence in speaking Chinese and improved listening skills"

   "comments": [
    "Great teachers, great structure of the course! No weaknesses (except maybe that the textbook you had to buy for the whole year, and I won't be taking it next semester and had to pay for the next book)",
    "Strengths: daily repetition, lots of variety in activity and assignment type, Sun laoshi is really great. Weaknesses: I found it odd how much emphasis was placed on repeating and memorizing exact sentences from the textbook; I think more emphasis on creating our own sentences using those grammar points would be more useful.",
    "Strengths: Everything. This course is extremely structured in a way to target all of your Chinese abilities. Weaknesses: None. It's a very tough course so you have to be committed.",
    "Very good structure and resources",
    "One strength is that the teachers and TAs are super helpful and passionate about what they are teaching. They create a really supportive environment. One weakness is that the workload is very heavy.",
    "The course sticks strongly to the textbook, which is definitely a weakness, although I see how it can help. But what ends up happening is that students only learn very specific vocabulary and only memorize certain sentences\/structures used in the text and don't apply those structures much to free conversation. A strength is that the teachers push you to do a lot of talking in class, and you learn a lot pretty fast. The course forces you to engage, which is good. The oral tests are pretty difficult--I'd like to see more free-response questions on them rather then quick multiple choice. And doing more stuff outside of the textbook would be great.",
    "Strengths are small class size and the very structured curriculum. Sun Laoshi was also one of the best parts of the class, she was forever helpful and warm and a great educator."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Improved my chinese a lot.",
    "Yes, if you are really committed to learning Chinese. It's a real commitment because it is everyday and there is daily homework and near-daily assessments, but it is really very manageable. It is very well-organized, and Sun laoshi is great.",
    "I would 100% recommend this to a student who wants to genuinely learn Chinese. If you are taking it for the sake of \"the language requirement\" then you might want to reconsider.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. This course made me feel confident in my ability to learn Chinese and the teachers are very helpful.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it if you're willing to go to class every day and do homework every day and take short quizzes every day. You'll learn a lot of Chinese in one semester, and compared to other classes, you almost don't even realize how much you're learning because the class meets every day. And the professors are all really nice and understanding (as long as you're a pretty good student). They're very smart too. Writing characters is fun, you're gonna wanna like doing that if you're taking this class.",
    "I would absolutes recommend. The workload was much greater than my other classes but if you are willing to put in the work, you learn so much over a short amount of time and it is very rewarding"
