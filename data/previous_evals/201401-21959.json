   "comments": [
    "Good learning experience. Interesting techniques\/skills learned. Nothing like the miserable, incredibly high stress environment of general chemistry lab courses. Skills will definitely be applicable in future lab work\/courses, and what we did\/learned in lab definitely strengthened my understanding of topics covered in lecture, often giving me an understanding I would not have otherwise had. Work load is very manageable. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Take it because you have to. Honestly a pretty chill lab, especially compared to gen chem. There's not a ton of work between labs, and each individual lab isn't that bad really. Not too hard to get an A as long as you follow the guidelines they give you in the documents at the start of term.",
    "CHEM 222L is the first semester of orgo lab. You learn a lot of lab techniques used by chemists and perform several syntheses. If you like lab work or want to go further in the sciences, this class is a must.",
    "It's not as painful as you would expect an Orgo lab to be.",
    "lol you have to take it anyway. don't be intimidated, it's not bad at all.",
    "It's a good lab. You'll really internalize a lot of common lab techniques and the procedures themselves are not terribly difficult.",
    "After taking gen chem lab, orgo lab was extremely fun. The atmosphere is so laid back, and you receive more autonomy in your experiments. The lab correlates pretty well with the lecture course, so you get to see in-class concepts from a lab perspective, which is also very helpful.",
    "This was a genuinely great course. The labs were sensibly written and thoroughly explained. The lab reports weren't excessively difficult, nor were the PLs. It's still a half-credit course that felt like a full-credit of work, but it's a full-credit that is actually manageable within the workload of your average science major.",
    "Only if you have to obviously. Time consuming and you breathe in chemicals.",
    "Fine course, take w\/Orgo. Actually feels like .5 credits which is nice for a lab.",
    "CHEM 222L is not bad compared to the earlier chem labs. We frequently got out of lab 1 or 2 hours before the end time of 5PM. The grading for this lab is a bit harsh, however, so do not take it looking for an easy A.",
    "This is the first semester organic chemistry lab, which is way way more relaxed than the general chemistry lab and might actually be fun for you! If you're reading this, you probably need to take lab, so go for it! You'll actually like this one because most experiments won't take you a full 3.5 hours and you'll be super happy to always actually be MAKING things in lab! Also, they won't take off 20% of your grade for low percent accuracy, which was a huge stress reliever (so don't freak out)! You'll also learn lots of great skills that you'll use repeatedly throughout the semester!",
    "Good lab, best I've taken.",
    "This is a great lab - interesting and not too challenging.",
    "Refreshing to have a more laidback lab after gen chem. Not very stressful during lab, and the write-ups were also not bad at all.",
    "CHEM 222L is a great lab course and will help reinforce organic chemistry concepts in practice. I would definitely recommend it to other students, since it is much less tedious and more enjoyable than other labs courses.",
    "I loved this course! It is low-stress, you most of the time will end lab early, and it is very possible to do well by staying on top of your work! Take it!",
    "This is a great lab! You learn a lot, it feels like you're doing real chemistry, and you don't write a lab report every week. The people who rave about how much better orgo lab is than gen-chem lab are not lying, and you'll probably make lab friends as you wait for things to heat or crystallize or distil.",
    "Orgo lab is fun in substance, but paperwork heavy. Really do read the course packet, and really do write all the lab notes stuff down. It's a pain, but you do have to.",
    "This lab is great. Just make sure you stay on top of notes\/reports from the beginning",
    "Not exactly a class to recommend per-say, more a class that one takes because one has to.",
    "Obviously just take this class if you have to. It's not that bad.",
    "I would describe it as a complimentary lab course to first semester organic chemistry that teaches important lab techniques for synthesis and extraction. I would recommend this course because it made lab enjoyable and stressed the knowledge of each step of the procedure so students would have a firm grasp of the topics discussed in organic chemistry lecture.",
    "Chem 222L is an introductory Organic Chemistry Lab that teaches basic laboratory techniques and pairs well with the Organic Chemistry I lecture course. I would definitely recommend taking this course in conjunction with the Organic Chemistry I lecture. Some of the topics, especially toward the end, pair well with the synthesis questions. The course is very manageable and expectations are clearly articulated.",
    "yea, you have to take it",
    "This lab is so much better than general chemistry lab. If you are taking it, you are probably doing so for [premed, in which case, orgo lab should be the least of your worries.",
    "Take it. Great course. Informative and fun. TAKE IT. Even if you don't like chemistry (I don't), it's just a great course that's lots of fun and not too hard.",
    "This co-requisite lab to CHEM 220 is really laid-back compared to the gen-chem labs. Be prepared for the final test, however, because students often fail to ask the questions at the end of each lab manual until the week before... bad idea!"
