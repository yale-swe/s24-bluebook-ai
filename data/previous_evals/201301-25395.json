    "In the same way that I summarized the course in answer to question #1. I would highly recommend the course, especially for those who are not familiar with the Spanish language.",

It's a valuable skill for anyone who uses Spanish as a secondary research language. Students looking for greater mastery should probably look elsewhere.",
