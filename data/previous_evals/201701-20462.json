   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned to close read passages with an eye to word choice, imagery, and the larger context of the passage in the work. I also learned to write papers carefully grounded in the texts we were reading and I received extensive feedback on my writing. I also gained a solid sense of some of the main writers of in Western Literature.",
    "Professor Levin's DS Lit section gave me a greater appreciation for the beauty in literature and an increased ability to explicate the ways that beauty is manifested. By this point in DS, it's also possible to see the threads of images or themes as they continue through works across time, which is also really rewarding.",
    "Great improvements in analysis of literature texts and writing of analytical essays in close communication with such texts.",
    "I learned how to manage heavy reading loads and balance efficiency with close reading. I learned to keep my analyses of texts as close to the text as possible while achieving depth.",
    "I have a working knowledge of the arc of Western literature from the first novels to realism. I've seen how works from antiquity inform literature today, and I've become better at recognizing elements and themes that change and stay the same over time.",
    "I improved my writing organization as well as my overall understanding of the development of Western literature.",
    "I learned a great deal about general history of Western literature. Professor Levin does a wonderful job of situating each text we read within a larger framework, as well as calling attention to how various authors respond to each other.",
    "I learned a lot from this course, and not just about the particular books that we read during the year. Alongside all the various specific interpretations and messages we drew from the works, I also developed a far better understanding of how to interpret and really look into a story, looking at what the author didn't describe as much as what they did.",
    "From Petrarch I learned how to suffer passionately in my love (lust) and then cop out at the last minute for the Virgin, from Don Quixote I learned how to read and then go insane (DS for ya) and imagine a lover for myself (oh and also how to throw up into people's mouths and get beaten up continually), from Faust I learned how to ally myself with the Devil, etc.",
    "I learned a lot this semester in DRST 002 001. Similar to the first semester, I became a more avid reader who learned to look at the texts more closely. Because of readings, I felt engaged differently in this class than last year's. However, I think the result was practically the same- I became more empathetic and grew my capability to understand other individuals.",
    "This class helped me largely in my close reading skills-- I feel that I am now able to read a work of literature and understand more about the work and each authors project. This course helped me appreciate writing and literature in a new light."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be more coherent in its selection of books. It wasn't always clear why we were reading a specific book by a certain author or how the books flow together (why we were reading a given book after another book). The course definitely improved my writing and my ability to read literature. It was great to have so much time with such an experienced professor.",
    "This course offers a small, close discussion section that is very engaging and collaborative. Professors are extremely accessible and offer an abundance of guidance and help in essay writing. The course really has few weaknesses if any.",
    "The course could incorporate more cross-textual comparison. The other two DS sections require you to compare texts on almost every essay whereas literature did not as much.",
    "I really enjoyed the DS Literature syllabus. I do feel as though Omeros was a huge work to tackle in a single week, especially in the last week of DS as finals approach. I'm not sure it is possible to discuss it in snippets, as we did, in a really worthwhile way. Maybe it would be possible to give it two weeks, or one and half? Perhaps Chekhov's Three Sisters could be read in less than a week?",
    "The course moves very quickly, which is both its strength as it covers a lot but also its weakness as it moves past things very quickly.",
    "The reading list of the course is amazing, but at times, the syllabus feels rushed. This is true, in my opinion, across all DS classes, but I do think that literature suffers the most. Professor Levin does an excellent job of ensuring that her students pick up on the essential elements and developments of each text. Nonetheless, you could spend an entire seminar (or lifetime of scholarship) on any one of these books, and we spend at most 4 sections on a book. On another note, writing three essays does help your writing, to the extent that you learn how to write well under significant pressure and with time constraints. With that being said, there is not much opportunity in DS lit to go back to previous work to revise or deepen your understanding of a specific text. Of course, you try to have several drafts of an essay completed before the due date, but with topics being sent out a little over a week in advance of the due date, and back-to-back paper weeks, that admirable intention is not always realistic.",
    "Like any DS course, the strength of this course is intimately tied with the strength of the DS program as a whole, which I think is particularly strong. The staggering of essays, the interrelation between the topics covered in all the classes, all of it was great. For this particular course, I think a major strength was that we got to read the entire book, and so got a log of context for the parts we did close read. The flipside of the coin, however, was that the inability to closely read the entirety of many, if not all of the works we covered limited the understanding we could attain.",
    "Bring back Proust! Oh and please take out The Tempest and Three Sisters. Apart from that, the syllabus is pretty great.",
    "The weaknesses of this course were the time constraints. If we had more time to read each book, we the students would be able to have deeper and more meaningful discussions about them. The strength was the class itself in the sense that we were able to read and analyze these works and hold discussions concerning them. I don't think that there is a better way to do unless MORE TIME were added to the course. (what I mean by more time is revert to something similar to UChicago's or Columbia's study of the Western canon.",
    "This course had a large amount of reading, but Professor Levin was terrific at breaking down each work to specific section to focus on which tremendously improved the quality of the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the books on the syllabus. The seminar-style learning with an often senior\/high quality professor is a great way to read these books. And DS is a great way to meet other people interested in talking about these books both inside and outside of class.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course. Continuing in DS was definitely the right choice for me. The second semester lit lectures, especially, were fantastic and I loved getting to the point where we could see which previous ideas a work was building off of. Professor Levin's section wasn't always the most exciting discussion, but I definitely learned a lot from her and enjoyed the readings.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a great introduction to some very significant texts and does a great job at teaching students how to interact with and write on such texts. The class is demanding in workload, but really pays off in the end and is very rewarding.",
    "Yes, although with the warning that you have to be very invested in the course to have a positive experience.",
    "I would recommend DS overall, but not for the second term literature track specifically. I felt the first semester syllabus was more cohesive, and that second term felt like a mish-mash of great works. Though reading them was really wonderful and I would do it again, the whole--reading them all in one course--did not feel much greater than the parts. That being said, it was absolutely the right choice for me and I would speak positively about it to others. The works on the syllabus were really a joy to read, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have taken part in DS.",
    "Yes, I would recommend all of Directed Studies to any humanities inclined student.",
    "Definitely take this class if you love literature, or are interested in intellectual history, and especially if both apply. While the syllabus does feel rushed, it is a wonderful introduction to some (emphasize) of the highlights of western literature - and can provide students with a good idea of what they might like to devote more time to later on.",
    "Would highly recommend, for reasons previously given that generally pertain to DS",
    "Yes, I read some of my favorite books ever in second semester DS Lit. Do it!",
    "I would (and have) recommended Directed Studies to all upcoming Freshmen because it forces us to consider the perspectives of other individuals and it provokes thought. All of the Books are good brain food.",
    "Yes, this literature course was my favorite class so far at Yale. Professor Levin understand each work on a greater level of detail and is able to explain and help students see more into the project of each author. She is amazing at improving writing and gives wonderful suggestions."
