    "This was a required course for graduate students. It helped me pay attention to smaller details in text (conjunctions, tenses, etc).",
    "Helps a lot with knowing vocab wnd syntax",
    "The course is invaluable for my dissertation which will be on the Plato's stylistics.",
    "Obviously the concepts learned this semester will play a tremendous role as I prepare for the Greek translation exams, and my readings of Greek for my dissertation and future research will benefit immensely. Would that I had learned a fraction of what I gained from this course in my survey class this semester!"
