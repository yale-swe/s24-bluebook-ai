   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to anyone with an interest in the Francophone Caribbean or postcolonial theory. Again, though, I wish we could have covered a broader range of topics and authors.",
    "Fren 935 is a survey of Aim\u00c3\u00a9 C\u00c3\u00a9saire's major works with a focus on his Cahier. I would not recommend it to someone who would be looking for a broader introduction to Francophone or Antillean literature, nor to someone who would be interested mainly in C\u00c3\u00a9saire's poetry.",
    "The course surveys Aime Cesaire's work as an author and politician and the political and critical reactions to his work. I would recommend the course to another student, as it gives good perspective on a significant figure in francophone literature and the politics of decolonization.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. French 935 delves into the life and work of the important Caribbean figure, Aim\u00c3\u00a9 C\u00c3\u00a9saire. Professor Miller creates a lively classroom environment that greatly enhances the readings, which he selects with great care."

   "comments": [
    "It introduced me to an area of study that I may want to pursue in the future, which is to say the Francophone Caribbean. Even if I can only really claim familiarity with one of its authors, that alone is a useful start.",
    "The course gave me a better understanding of the interaction between the politics of decolonization and assimilation and the birth of francophone literature as we know it. I consider this essential base knowledge for anyone studying French literature."
