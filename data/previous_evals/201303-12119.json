    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It covers an amazing amount of material, the discussions are compelling, and I feel that I have a much deeper understanding of the topics we discussed.",
    "History 709 is a thematic study of the African American Intellectual tradition beginning in 1941 and ending in 1999. The course uses specific intellectual projects as primary sources to capture a specific historical moment, the problems of the day and corresponding ideas designed to address those problems.I would recommend this course to any Twentieth Century Americanist, or anyone with an interest in Twentieth Century Intellectual history.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. The readings, paired with Holloway's genius, allowed me to fully engage with the texts and group discussions. The paper assignments are fair and create space to further generate ideas and opinions on class themes: the role of the Black intellectual, etc. I highly recommend this course. I learned so much and it truly influenced my personal opinions and artistic practice."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with a sense of the always fascinating and often maddening questions that shape much of recent black intellectual history. I think that the ideas we discussed will be central to my future research.",
    "I feel this class gave me the text and language to forumlate clear statements about my visual practice and life in the context of Black intellectualism. I want to be an artist-intellectual who understands the history of study and writing that created opportunities for my agency now--I thoroughly enjoyed learning in this course. This class has reinvigorated my commitment to my work and the study of Black theory."
