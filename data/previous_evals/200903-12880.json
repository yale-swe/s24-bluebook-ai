   "comments": [
    "For me, this was a great course to master the finer details of conversation. Profesora Safille was very thorough and I found myself using much better grammar when speaking, so my fluency definitely increased. I think the best part was the small familial atmosphere that our class developed--I feel like I really got to know everyone. Profesora Safille is really really passionate, to the point of being a little scary on the first day, but turns out to be a fantastic teacher. Some of the assignments could be a little tedious and the grading a little tough, but overall a worthwhile class for keeping up your Spanish skills and becoming a better speaker. I would highly recommend this teacher.",
    "Yes, if you want to keep up your spanish. It is not that hard, but can get boring at times. Take it with Safille if you are going to because she makes class always very lively and fun to go to.",
    "I'd definitely recommend Spanish 150. The work out of class consists of reading articles or stories as well as some writing assignments (which do actually tend to take a fair amount of time) and in class, you just have to talk. Sometimes the discussions are with the whole class (11 people, in my section) and other times with a small group of 2 or 3 people. The over-arching themes that are covered are pretty interesting as well: immigration, family relations, the environment, etc.",
    "I would recommend this as a great course for people entering college spanish from AP. It is not difficult, but it is a good way to improve speaking skills. Along with the open discussions daily, the few writing assignments help to make sure that you do not lose any writing skills that you have acquired. The subject matter is interesting, and Barbara Safille has wonderful energy.",
    "Don't expect your spanish to improve, but it is good for maintaining your spanish and just to talk and it challenges you. My grammar definitely did not improve",
    "Take this class if you want a low intensity Spanish L5. It is a big time commitment, like all language classes, but its only worth it if you have a good group of people willing to talk and also a good instructor. Barbara Safille is a rockstar and will make every pointless assignment at least a bit interesting. Also, my Spanish improved a lot, which I think is the point...",
    "This is the first L5 class I've taken, so it's hard to say if it makes more sense to take this or to go straight into a more themed course. I'd be more enthusiastic about this course if they changed some of the assignments, including the book we had to read.",
    "I would recommend it for students looking to practice their Spanish and improve it. For students who already feel comfortable speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish, I would say to go ahead and take a Spanish L5 course that focuses on a topic and is taught in Spanish (like literature or film or law, etc...).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially with Profesora Safille, because it made me more comfortable with speaking, improved my vocabulary and understanding of Spanish grammar, and had a stimulating and diverse syllabus and an excellent professor.",
    "This is a discussion based course that is complemented with weekly written assignments. It is a very interactive course. I would recommend this course to another student if you have a very strong base in grammar and vocabulary and want to increase your comfort level with speaking and writing in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend SPAN 150 to another student because it improved my speaking ability, listening skill, and self-confidence. But I want that student to understand that SPAN 150 is not as helpful and more work than they would expect. The individual classes were very repetitive. They were almost always the same formula: discuss the reading questions the students did for homework, then discuss the larger analysis questions on those readings. Another weakness was that the homework writing assignments demanded more time and attention than what is normally expected in a \"conversation\" class.There were no written tests, but there were quizzes on grammar and vocab, in-class oral assessment activities, and oral exams."
