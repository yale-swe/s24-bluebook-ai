    "INTENSIVE SOCIOLOGY MAJORS UNITE--- so great to learn intensely about what other sociologist study. very supportive environment. WONDERFUL WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. do the year-long essay. literally the most rewarding academic experience of my life (and I haven't turned in my esssay yet so I'm even saying this as we come down to crunch time!)If u have an interest. a spark. you can write an awesome paper on it! we studied such different things and it was so great to see how people's passionswere actualized in this process!",
    "I will miss this class - it was a really rewarding experience to work alongside my classmates. We were supportive of one another and became a little sociological family. The projects were diverse - everything from scandal in China to protest in Tunisia to education in Nebraska - so you learn a lot from your peers as you go, too!",
    "I highly recommend doing the year-long senior essay for anyone thinking of doing any kind of research in the future, whether in grad school or at work. \u00a0It's a really supportive environment and an incredible learning experience; definitely a great way to end your Yale career. \u00a0It's a lot of work (be warned: it'll make your second semester pretty stressful), buy the end result is extremely rewarding. \u00a0I'd suggest coming up with a topic over the summer so you can hit the ground running - you'll thank yourself later if you get a head start.",
    "Do the intensive major! My thesis project was the most challenging but also most rewarding experience of my academic career, and this seminar was what made me so happy I chose the sociology major. It was incredibly rewarding to complete a large-scale, self-directed project on a subject I was passionate about and to do so in such a supportive setting as this seminar. The class does an amazing job of creating a structured program to keep you on track while providing guidance and encouragement, and going through the process with your peers is helpful and supportive. Dr. Smith is awesome-- both really helpful and hilarious, and our TA was great too."
