    "A rather easy class. All you are graded on are problem sets, a midterm, a final presentation and paper. The problem sets are not really related to what is taught in class, rather all you need is google and a calculator. For the midterm, the professors gave a list of 20 possible questions a week beforehand, out of which they asked 7. So you only needed to prepare those specific questions. The final presentation and paper are on a topic of your choice. Therefore, you don't really need to pay attention in class at all. If you are looking for an easy science class, this is it.",
    "G&G 205 was an interesting science credit and a class I really enjoyed",
    "A good course overall if you need a science credit. It can also be very engaging, since the topics we covered are nothing but relevant. For the final paper topic and presentation, I just wish we had more time to present without rushing through--but overall a course I came out of getting what I expected going into it.",
    "I would take this course. It is pretty interesting to take a look at the world from a very different perspective (geology) and the material is extremely relevant. Also... no final. Nothing else to say.",
    "It's a good choice for a science if you aren't really a science person... interesting material too-- applicable to real life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The work load is manageable, the professors are great, and the course covers very interesting material that is very relevant to the world today.",
    "This course is a survey of many different topics concerning energy (for the first half) and the environment\/non-energy natural resources (e.g., water and rare earth metals) for the second half. While there is not too much depth into any particular subject, you get a very wide breadth of knowledge, especially regarding the current energy situation and potential solutions. The course is extremely interesting and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "For those looking for an relatively easy science credit: go for it. I didn't recognize a good number of the people doing presentations at the end of class cause I'm pretty sure they never showed up.For those looking for a detailed, meaningful study of natural resources and sustainability: look elsewhere.",
    "Definitley one of the best science credits by far for a non sci major. Useful stuff",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. This is by far the best science class I have taken at Yale. It is not much work and I have learned so much.",
    "This is a great course to introduce you to the natural resource and sustainability discourse and this is a great science credit course. It is well taught by both professors (though it can be dry at times), the material is interesting, there is not that much work (4 problem sets that were easy, midterm which had good curve, final project and presentation). The only problem isthat just attending the lecture does not help you learn the material and the problem sets don't enforce material.",
    "Is a hydrogen economy legit? How does geothermal energy work? Can the world sustain more deepwater drills? Why is virtually all the world's lithium in Bolivia? Ever wanted to see the inside of a Yale power plant?These questions and more are covered in Natural Resources + Sustainability. If you ignore the fact that it's a 9AM lecture on the edge of campus, this is a really solid course which provides a comprehensive overview of current sustainability practices and prospects for future behavior. This is not really a geology course although there is somewhat of focus (necessarily) when it comes to resource extraction. Nor is this much of an emphasis on math, physics, or chemistry so non-science majors need not fret.There's a midterm in which the possible questions are made availab;e beforehand and a 10-15 page term paper. P-sets every 1.5 wks. No mandatory reading. Two awesome field trips.",
    "A good class to take for non-science majors looking to complete the distributional requirement. Not too dense.",
    "This class is a broad-based survey of issues facing the use of natural resources, integrating that with sustainability andenvironmental impact. This is especially great for policy-minded students. This is not a policy course, but it does show you the science behind some of the hottest policy issues for energy and the environment. It gives the student a factual basis and method of evaluating policy ideas that is really instructive and fascinating each week. Highly recommended, especially to fulfill a science credit.",
    "A great introduction to various natural resources on earth and different sustainability practices to help us keep Earth livable for future generations",
    "YES! I enjoyed this class a lot! Great: solid course structure, solid lectures, good pace, good workload, and very important and meaningful subject (natural resources in this time and age!). Everything, from problem sets to powerpoints to student presentations to research papers, was good and helped me learn the material. So glad I took this class. I also got to fulfill my last Sc credit requirement. Professors are very cool, engaging, knowledgeable and approachable. They are also good lecturers and their teamwork is great! You'll have fun and learn a lot!"
