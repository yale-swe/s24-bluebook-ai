    "If you are a music major, you have not choice. Personally I am not interested in memorizing tons of Indian, African, Caribbean and Indonesian music (including their titles in the original language, the context, the musical characteristics, etc.)There are four listening tests, three 5-page papers and a final 20-page paper.",
    "A really, really broad summary of a couple of musical cultures, with a special focus on talking about why white people will never understand them. The teacher is asked to learn a bunch of material she does not know, since the scope of the classis so broad. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Given that it is a required course for the major, whether or not I recommend MUSI353 is somewhat irrelevant. However, were it not required, I would recommend this course to all music majors, as I feel it is important for musicians to understand how there are a variety of ways to conceive of and produce music, and to realize there are other musical traditions that are as rigorous and well-developed as the Western classical tradition. Furthermore, Professor Weiss is a great lecturer who brings an energy and enthusiasm to the material, and makes class discussion interesting and fun.",
    "DO IT.",
    "I love music from all over the world so I was really excited for this class, but I think it might be my least favorite class in of the four semesters I've been here. Here's why:-the professor didn't organize anything and we would have no idea what we would be tested on-there was nothing said in that class that I couldn't have learned on wikipedia-we didn't have a chance to talk in discussion sections- we spent many of them just going over term after term-I feel that the tas cared too much while the professor cared too little-the class is the perfect setting for all the bad stereotypes of Yale students (pompous, grade grubbing, sucking up)That said, if you're a music major, you don't have much choice. At least it's not a ton of work, and I know someone who neverwent to class and did fine...If there is any upside, I still have some of the music we studied on my itunes and I listen to it sometimes. It's good stuff!",
    "No, I would not recommend this class. It was a survey format that professor didn't want to teach. Furthermore, the class was frustrating and disorganized and would've been even more so if I hadn't taken it Cr\/D\/F.",
    "Do it! I initially hated it, but I came around eventually (as, I think, did everybody else). Yes, it's a young course. Yes, it's a bit disorganized and very general. BUT, it's a chance to get exposed to new musical cultures, sound palettes, and ways of relating to music, all with a fantastic professor. Sarah Weiss is one of the more intelligent, accessible, exciting, and genuinely wise people around. And there is value in the constant process of going back, changing gears, and approaching a new music throughout the semester. It's the experience of being a foreigner, time and again, and dealing with it in different ways every time. For me, the experience of being a foreigner to the Caribbean was hugely tied to the cultural issues, not the sound palette (which was largely uninteresting), and the exact opposite was true of my experience of being a foreigner to Southeast Asia (mind-boggling sound palette, not the culture so much). If you put some good thought into this course, you can and will get a lot of it.",
    "Great great great course. Fun and interesting for non-music majors as well as music majors.great survey of interesting musical cultures that you will find relevant to your own everyday musical experience.definitely take this class if you are even a little bit interested in learning about non-western music.take is with Sarah Weiss if you can! She is fantastic.",
    "Worst class I have taken at Yale. Sarah Weiss is just clueless when it comes to any world music which isn't from Java, and it shows, because instead of learning about other music cultures you just have inane debates about the meaning of white people \"fetishizing\" \"exotic\" music. This is at best a decent class in ethnography, but it would be a stretch to even call this a music class at all.Take it with Veal. He gave one guest lecture, and all of the sudden it was clear what this class would be like if someone who knew what they were doing was teaching it. You might learn something about music.On the bright side, you're actively encouraged not to do any of the readings, and the papers are about as well-defined as saying \"go write a paper about music,\" so you can get a way with less than an hour a week on this one. You should probably go to lecture so it looks like you care, but you can still make like everyone else and read e-mails the entire time. You'll probably learn more doing that than from listening.",
    "MUSI 353 is a nice survey of certain world musics (but not ALL world music, obviously). If you're planning to learn about music all over the world, this isn't quite the right class, but if you're just interested in learning about music of certain foreign cultures, this is great. You'll learn about African, Caribbean, Indian, and Indonesian music, and one other area of your choosing, but not too much else. However, there are other ethnomusical discussions that do broaden the scope. Lots of the concepts learned in this class are applicable, for example, in films about other cultures; I find myself pointing out aspects of Indian music, in Indian films, etc. It's quite entertaining. Overall, this is really a good class, and take it if you have any interest in music or other cultures.",
    "The overwhelming opposition to this class shows just how necessary it is in a class of pretty bigoted, close-minded music majors. The students might not think that they've gone through a transformation, but I've witnessed it. A slight de-centering of our understanding of music is not epiphenomenal to the major, but essential to it. Thanks, Sarah!",
    "Prof Weiss is one of my favorite professors at Yale. I went into it already interested in ethnomusicology (since I took another class with her before), but she managed to get even my resistant classmates interested. If you're a music major, of course this class is required, but don't worry, you'll like it. And if you're not a music major, it's still totally doable, as long as you have some understanding of music.",
    "Interesting class, not too much work.",
    "You have to take it, but unless it's changed greatly, it's going to be painful. You cannot possibly cover the music of the whole world in any detail in a survey class, so keep expectations low.",
    "Topics in World Music is an interesting class. It covers four subject areas, this year Africa, Latin America, India, and Indonesia, and delves into the music cultures of these places. It also uses these case studies as a way of raising issues relevant to the study of any music tradition, including Western music - diaspora and migration, the idea of canon, ways of conceiving rhythm and tonality, etc. Sarah Weiss led us in quite philosophical discussions that really engaged students with the ideas and preconceptions they brought to the class and many students left truly changed. I came to the class as an ethno buff who had actually studied much of the music before, so I didn't learn much. But for someone who hasn't studied the music of non-Western cultures before, it can be a really valuable experience. Challenge yourself and go for it. Sarah and the TAs will be with you all the way."
