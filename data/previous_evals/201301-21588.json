   "comments": [
    "If you're considering taking it, do so. It's definitely manageable and Zhou Laoshi is a really good guy.",
    "Yes, take it. Especially with Zhou laoshi. You will continue learning a lot. It's a demanding, yet rewarding class.",
    "Pretty similar to 154, but for some reason this semester, the professor decided to assign substantially more homework than in the fall. I felt like this was more reminiscent of the 1.5 credit class workload, and I'm not sure whether that was a great choice for 2nd semester senior year. That said, Zhou Laoshi is an excellent teacher, and as always, I learned a lot in his class.",
    "Chinese 155 is a great class. It's a clear continuation of 154, and Zhou Laoshi is wonderful. The topics (Food Culture, Architecture, Confucianism, Democracy, Chinese-Taiwanese relations) were interesting and Zhou Laoshi often included newspaper articles to diversify from the textbook, however it is still a language track class. It is a methodic, manageable and relatively low key way to continue improving in Chinese. We also got some good speaking practice with the periodic speeches\/presentations we did of our essays.",
    "It's good to learn grammar basics but a lot of what you learn slips through the cracks. It's a lot of work and a big time commitment."
