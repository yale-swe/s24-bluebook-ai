    "meh",
    "They scheduled the environmental health sciences seminar over the F&ES research series. WHY?! I kept having to miss one or the other. PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE RESEARCH. SCHEDULE THE SEMINAR SERIES AT DIFFERENT TIMES.",
    "great",
    "Great course to know the latest research in the field of Environmental Health Sciences",
    "The strength of this course include students' participation, the weakness is that once some students prepared their presentations, perhaps they do not focus on other students' presentation.",
    "I did not gain too much from this course. There were a few subjects that I was interested in but it was very toxicology and genetics heavy which was hard to follow without a strong background in those topics.",
    "I think that rather than presentations focusing on simply conveying the material in the assigned papers, the presentations should focus on the connections and the relevance of the material to public health and environmental health.",
    "This class should not be mandatory for EHS students, or we should get one credit for taking it. None of the students do the readings, because we are stretched way too thin with coursework. We should only have about 4 lectures each semester, and we should not be required to present in journal club.",
    "Great",
    "Speakers are usually quite interesting. Discussion usually flounders so seminars are not so interesting.",
    "This course is very informative. It provides the students good opportunities to be familiar with latest research progress in various fields of epidemiology and toxicology. Additionally, students in this class could have opportunity to discuss different scientific issues with professors and experts in their fields.",
    "Since this course is not for credit, it is difficult to put additional time into it outside of class. I like the idea of reading journal articles and hearing presentations from experts in the field. I think the course would be improved if instead of student presentations on the papers we had a group discussion (i.e. something more involved and participatory)"

    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0didnt listen to us when we asked for other speakers just said that we should be exposed to other speakers she dismissed our request gave us a lecture on why we they choose who they choose ( doesn't care about what we think)",

    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0Great and professional",

    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen is enthusiastic about environmental health and willing to work closely with students who are struggling with their presentation material. She makes an effort to choose diverse material, to the extent that she is able to control it. She has great expertise in multiple topics and is able to foster interesting discussion.",

    "unnecessary",
    "Honestly? I kind of resented this course. It takes time every week but we get no credit for it. And everyone's so overbooked from their five other classes that no one does the readings and then the discussions are pretty useless. I vote that it meet only every other week and just include the actual speakers.",
