    "Take the language. Beautiful language and an amazing professor!!",
    "I would summarize Turkish as a wonderful language (with regular grammar and consistent rules) and the class as even more wonderful, with a focus not only on the language but also on the people. The instructor is also amazing, and worth it if only for Etem.",
    "Definitely take Turkish! It is an awesome class, an interesting language, and not too much work. You can work as hard as you'd like without panicking about your grade, but you'll want to work hard to please Etem and because it's interesting. It's nice to have such a small class, conducted in English, and not to have people who have already learned it but are missing something like in intro Spanish and French classes. Take Turkish it's the best!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for an interesting language to pick up and have a great time learning. The work load depends on the TA he brings in from Turkey, but the time he took us all out to eat Turkish food in West Haven really sums up the type of guy Etem is - fully invested in his students happiness and education!",
    "Turkish is one of the best languages to take at Yale. Compared with my experiences with other language courses, the workload for Turkish is very manageable. Etem takes great pains, to make the class fun and accessible to everyone. If you're deciding on a language to take, PICK TURKISH!"
