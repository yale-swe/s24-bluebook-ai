    "yes, you probably have to but its a good class. its a half credit and the workload reflects that fact. plus jan is awsome",
    "Unfortunately, if you're not an ABET student, you may not want to take this because it's only a half credit. However, I would advise you to take this with Jan before you take Fluids Lab or Mechatronics because Jan will improve your lab writing a lot.Overall, I recommend the course because there is zero homework outside of the three lab reports you write, and none of those has to be particularly painful. Good class.",
    "This is a very good lab. The workload fluctuates from being nothing for a couple of weeks to a hard week of writing a 15 page lab report with a partner and later editing, but the experience working with interesting machines in the lab, figuring out some of the underlying science and learning how to write about it better was a worthwhile one. I would think this is one of the better labs for ME students to take. Jan is great.",
    "This a nice course in materials science. Some of the material is repetitive from MENG 280 and 285, but you will learn a lot about actual lab instruments and about writing papers.",
    "If you are considering taking this, you probably have to take it for the MechE major. It is a good course and you really learn how to write a structured lab report. Prof. Schroers did an excellent job meeting with students and discussing how to improve the format and structure of papers which will be important for the rest of your college career. (especially for fluids lab if you are MechE) It is a good course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in materials science and the experiments behind it. The class isn't too demanding and I found the labs to be pretty fun. A great lab for mechanical engineers.",
    "Learn about annealing, cold working, hardness, SEM, AFM so pretty cool! I would recommend it because you learn how to write comprehensive lab reports.",
    "Interesting class that focuses on the ability to write a lab report and deliver a presentation. Very practical.",
    "Solid class, no work at all most weeks but when it hits, it hits hard.",
    "If you're reading this review, you probably have to take the class for the major, but this is a very light lab class that allows you to review materials science and solid mechanics concepts in a more interesting applications-based environment. Professor Schroers takes the half-credit seriously, and makes the workload and timeline for this class seem like a half-credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to mechanical engineers."
