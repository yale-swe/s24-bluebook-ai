   "comments": [
    "A through overview of major themes among Christian mystics and the precepts upon which the Catholic Church based its accusations of heresy. I also learned to quickly draw major themes from primary sources.",
    "This course provided a robust insight into Christian mysticism and Church theology. Each week provided the proper historical context of a Christian mystic and a selection of their writing. The class was more of a religious studies course than a history course. Little to no historical research skills were developed through this course.",
    "I learned a lot about Christian history",
    "I gained a ton of theoretical and practical knowledge about Church teaching and Catholic theology, an appreciation for the monastic and mystic tradition in Christianity, the comfort to grapple with deep questions of theological discourse, a knowledge of many saints, and a grasp of just how much our modern culture has been influenced by developments in the Church.",
    "I learned about the history of Christian mystics and their engagement with heresy and orthodoxy in the canon.",
    "Introduction to Christian Mystics of Western Church in Middle Ages.",
    "I received an expansive and diverse introduction to many famous and not-so-famous Christian mystics.",
    "Learned history of Christianity and its traditions as well as practiced reading complicated texts and contemplating humanity and divinity. Very interesting and very different from my other classes. I enjoyed reading some mystics. I think this will also help me understand depictions of mystics and other religious figures because the visual references will be clearer to someone who has read their works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course was its content. The course exposed students to a breadth of Christian mystical writers and theologians. By doing so, I felt like I gained a baseline understanding of Christian mystics. Likewise, the focus on female mystics was a nice touch. The weakness of this course was its organization and structure. The class could benefit from more organization. Furthermore, I wish we would have spent more time defining what Christian mysticism actually is and what is considered orthodox and heretical in the Church. We spent a lot of time skirting around the issues that I wanted us to engage in. I understood the arguments of a dozen or so mystics, but not the overarching theme of christian mysticism and what makes it accepted by the church.",
    "I thought it worked as it was",
    "The strengths of this course really lie in Professor Eire's fantastic teaching, the way in which you can be immersed in a completely different worldview and come out understanding theological terminology from starting out with little or no exposure to such ideas. Another strength was the small size of the class; my lecture only had 15 people, so it was really more like a seminar than a lecture, and there's a lot of personal interaction to be had. I don't really see any weaknesses with this course, other than that it would probably not appeal to someone who wasn't interested in religious or intellectual history, or would have a closed mind about approaching ideas covered in this class.",
    "The course was great. No complaints.",
    "Strengths: -Good focus on primary texts -examination of mysticism on several levels: historical, theological, social, political, and artistic -Good professor, very knowledgable and friendly -Exams are very reasonable Weakness: -Not much feedback on papers",
    "Fantastic course! Professor Eire is a gem, full of knowledge and great stories. Very relaxed and understanding to studentls' needs.",
    "I liked the small size of the section, which helped make me feel comfortable to speak and share and helped me learn to follow other students' lines of thinking too. I liked that the readings followed a generally chronological order and it was interesting that we read all male authors first, then all female authors second. Although, we did not focus too much on gender, it added another interesting level to our analysis and helped draw in students who found the distinction fascinating. It was challenging to plan a section time, but I really enjoyed attending. Lectures were visually engaging and the narrative was lively. I would have liked if we would have been able to make use of the Beinecke, though I am not sure what they have about mystics."

   "comments": [
    "You'll learn a lot and you'll love the professor.",
    "This course is a good fifth class if you are interested in the material. The primary thing you will get from taking this course is an opportunity to read wonderful, classic mystics. However, the class is not particularly intellectual challenging and will not grow you as a historian.",
    "Yes",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any Yale student who wants to take an interesting HU course, a wonderful course in religion, or is a Catholic and wants to learn more about a dimension that many may not know is a part of the faith. But really, if you just have an open mind, are have an interest in religious\/ecclesiastical\/monastic history, or want to learn basic, but highly important and a variety of Catholic theology or theological discourse.",
    "I would definitely recommend to anyone at least moderately interested in the topic. Professor Eire is great, and he makes the class relaxed and interesting. We discuss several Christian mystics as well as and the social and historical context surrounding them. The exams are based heavily on the readings, and much of the lecture material is never actually tested. There was very much an atmosphere of learning out of interest and not for the grade.",
    "Excellent course. Eire is brilliant and knows so much about the theology and history of Middle Ages Christianity. Don't feel that you need a Christian background to enjoy the class-- I'm a science major who identifies much more with Eastern religions and I walked away with some incredible takeaways. Some of the readings are just breathtaking (e.g. Eckhart) and should be required reading for any person of faith. This is definitely a class where you get what you put in. It'd be easy to basically coast and use it as a gut, but you'll also be pretty bored unless you really engage with the readings. Honestly tho I'd view this as the best class of college on account of Eire's intrinsic love for the material and for teaching, and I'd definitely give it an A, recommended for any person of faith",
    "Yes, take this course, 100%.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the history of Christianity and to anyone interested in thinking about the distinction between humans and the divine."
