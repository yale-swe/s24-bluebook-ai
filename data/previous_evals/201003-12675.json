   "comments": [
    "A history of the emergence of Judaism and the evolution to Judaism as we know it today. I would definitely recommend the class! It is incredibly interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class as an easy fifth class but only if you plan on going to lecture. It is completely impossible to do well in the exams without sitting through Ivan's rambling streams of thought. Two midterms and a ten page paper are easy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "I really enjoyed History of the Jews to the Reformation. The greatest strength of the class is that it emphasizes themes over individual dates. Another strength is that because Jewish History is so intertwined with European and Middle Eastern history, I learned a significant amount of history in these regions that was not applied to the Jewish people. The workload was very manageable because there were only 2 tests and a final 10-12 page paper. I would recomment the course to another student if they feel as if they could listen to an hour and fifteen lecture on the subject. Many people can't do this, don't show up to class, and complain when they get poor grades. There are a lot of readings but they weren't necessary for doing well on the tests. Take the class...I thought it was great.",
    "Overall, this is a very good course for anyone interested in Jewish history. Don't necessarily take this just because you can get a ROW credit for it (although you can)\u0096\u0096a lot of the information from the class gives you at least a very broad idea of the major power shifts in ancient and medieval Europe and the Middle East, it will be much more interesting if you have a particular interest in Jewish history. It's a pretty low workload, however. I fell way behind in readings in the second half of the course, but it didn't really make a difference come exam time. A fair number of people seemed to have taken this classand then never shown up to lecture, which is a bad idea because they then came into class for the tests asking everyone else very basic questions that they would have known the answers to had they come to lecture. Professor Marcus sometimes goes on slight rants or rambles, and he rarely gets through the whole outline of people and events he puts on the board at the beginning of each class, but he does a solid job of giving you the information you need. Two exams and a ten-page paper based on close reading of a couple of primary sources make up the only work in this class\u0096\u0096no final!",
    "I would recommend it only if you are interested in listening to lectures that are pretty dry. so... maybe just if you really want to learn about Jewish history.",
    "Yes if you want a class with a little amount of work. Two hour tests and a 10 page paper is a pretty easy load of work.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in Jewish history. The work load is manageable, but I would advise doing a lot of studying for the tests, which I thought were moderately difficult.",
    "Basically, you get to know a ton about the Jewish people's history. I really liked it coming from the Jewish perspective. Knowing about where I might come from was really cool.",
    "Good solid class. Professor Marcus is vastly knowledgeable and conducts a pretty engaging lecture. The classwork isn't really onerous at all. Ultimately, if you're interested in Judaism and the Medieval period, this class has a lot to offer",
    "I'd recommend this class if you're actually interested in the history of the Jews. You actually learn a lot but going to class can get tiring because of lecture length and it's just pure lecture. Professor Marcus was hilarious though, but only if you paid attention. Very doable class, except lots of reading.",
    "Yes, as a history major,I would recommend History of the Jews from Biblical Times to the Reformation to another history student with any interest in 3000+ years of Israelite\/Jewish religion, culture, identity, politics, and society.This class had relatively engaging, but occasionally hard-to-follow lectures. Professor Marcus is extremely knowledgeable, passionate, and has a sarcastic sense of humor, but he occasionally lectures too quickly or jumps around the material too much. The class had no sections, which was a great feature. There were two straightforward and relatively fair midterm exams except they demand a lot in only 1+ hours of time. The paper was excellent as I only had to critically analyze 1 primary source document. And there is a lot of reading - I recommend skimming or skipping most of the material assigned in the course book. However, you should carefully read and re-read \"A Short History of the Jewish People\" by Raymond Scheindlin because that book beautifully summarizes most topics we cover in lecture.And last but not least, HIST 219 counted as a pre-Industrial credit and could be used as either a Europe or Rest-of-the-World credit depending on how you fill out the \"Department of History Geographical Distribution Application,\" which can be picked up from the Undergraduate History Office (HGS 237)."
