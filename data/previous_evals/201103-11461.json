   "comments": [
    "This was a great class. A good way to learn about sustainable institutions in the case study of fisheries and Maine, but there was room for diverging discussion when it came up. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A class that studies institutional structure and approaches to management of common pool resources. It's a great class, good seminar environment, and not stressful or too work intensive. One memo a week and a final paper. Be prepared to read a lot about fish and lobsters though...",
    "Yes I would recommend it--learn about issues that are not only relevant but also interesting with a great professor.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in environmental policy at the local or regional levels and don't mind taking the first of the semester to study the theory behind common resource management and policy.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who wants to think about sustainability from an atypical perspective. The focus on fisheries was great to understand the complexity of sustainable resource management. Be prepared to get into a lot of discussion about the Maine lobster industry, but be assured that you'll learn a lot from this specific case.",
    "Highly recommended."
