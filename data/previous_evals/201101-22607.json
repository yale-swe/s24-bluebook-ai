    "Good class--lots of fun books\/movies. And good professor.",

    "Good class, a lot of busy work though. It's not hard to do well in the class though as long as you do all of your work - the amount of work is an excellent reinforcement and really hammers the concepts into your brain.",
    "Great",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking to improve your grammar.",
    "Yes I definitely would. It has brought my friends on leaps and bounds.",
    "Take it if you would like to review your grammar. Speaking is emphasized but you'll find that it is a lot of work. Make sure you do the work because it will improve your fluency, even though it's a pain.",
    "I would recommend it. It helps you improve both your grammar and oral communication while you read works in french."
