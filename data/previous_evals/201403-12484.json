    "Either if you've taken and enjoyed Music 210 or you have a flare for music theory and analysis, take the class--you won't regret it.",
    "An OK class, only take it if you're interested in theory. If you're looking for classes that will allow you to take lessons for credit, take MUSI 218 or 219. The workload is reasonable, but if you analyze pieces slowly or doubt your own ability assignments can take a really long time. Other than that it's very dry. The unit on sonata theory is interesting - as is the little time we spent on formal analysis - but the class falls into minutiae too often and we spent a lot of time looking for proverbial needles in haystacks, i.e. single chords that illustrated a concept in a larger work."
