   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend both DS and this section. DS in general: its a lot of work, but the content is fantastic, the professors and classmates really outstanding, and the papers really aren't that bad. You will learn so much and feel so fulfilled after taking it. Master Brenzel is the best; so thoughtful and caring, and truly wise. The reading is tedious, but between section and lecture you learn a lot about it. Papers aren't easy, but he'll help you learn what to do.",
    "TAKE PHILOSOPHY WITH BRENZEL. He is the absolute greatest. Words cannot do him justice. He will be the Socrates to your Plato.",
    "I will recommend the class. Just for Brenzel! He will really make your DS experience so much less distressful!",
    "Philosophy with Professor Brenzel was a delight. I'd highly recommend Brenzel.",
    "Though there are a lot of them, the DS Philosophy readings are completely worth the work. I highly recommend taking the course, since you will be better grounded in the basic building blocks of Western thought.",
    "I think the philosophy section is the best of the three fall sections. The reading is fairly light, though difficult, and the lectures are consistently very helpful.",
    "DS Philosophy is often confusing, but when everything \"clicks\" at the end, it is an amazing journey. Trudge through Aristotle and laugh through Sextus. Master Brenzel is kind, knowledgeable, and gregarious. Try to get into his section if possible!",
    "Yes, I recommend DS to everyone. Prof. Brenzel knows what he's doing and is a great guide when digging through the works. Also he is a tough paper grader, but the improvement is certainly worth it and your final grade won't suffer even if you aren't the best at writing papers.",
    "Personally, I don't think I'll pursue that much philosophy in the future, but that actually made me really happy that I got the chance to take this class. It's a great introduction to the kinds of questions philosophy asks and how we can go about answering them. This class has inspired many great conversations with DSers outside of class. Master Brenzel is a phenomenal professor and person. Not only did he lead a wonderful section; he ate lunch with our whole class after class several times and had us over to dinner. He's going to push you to think about the ideas that these texts pose in broader contexts than the texts themselves, and he's also just a wonderful person to know. And super fair and helpful about papers. I'm so glad I took this class!",
    "DS Philosophy was incredibly rewarding, especially for students like me who had never before been exposed to philosophy. Master Brenzel is an incredible professor and person, and he takes time to interact with students both inside and outside of class. Don't switch out if you get him!"
