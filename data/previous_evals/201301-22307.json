    "I enjoyed this class. Sometimes a bit slow, but was enjoyable.",
    "If you're an undergrad, I wouldn't recommend this class. The only reason I chose to take it was because of the useful review of probability (I learned almost as much from this in three weeks as I learned from my Theory of Statistics class in two semesters) and because the other stochastic class was taught by a guy who didn't know how to project his voice and consequently put me to sleep within 10 minutes.",
    "Take this class! First, Tatikonda is an incredible teacher, very down to earth and honestly feels like he's just another student explaining something he's passionate about. Second, you'll learn quite a bit about a lot of the math that underlies statistics and control. Third, it is taught like a graduate class but it is very welcoming of undergrads. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a graduate class, even though it is cross registered as an undergraduate course. Sekhar (the way professor likes being called) is the nicest guy ever! He is very busy but likes spending time with his students answering questions during office hours. I was one of the few undergraduate students in the class. The class was tough but very rewarding. Sekhar always made sure that we cared about learning, not about the grade we were getting in the class. The textbook is hard to get used to. However, as the semester ended, I kind of liked it. The TA, De Wen Soh, is also very approachable. Overall, the class is very low stress and you learn a lot from it. Do not let the material accumulate and you will enjoy the class a lot. Again, Sekhar makes the class very enjoyable!"
