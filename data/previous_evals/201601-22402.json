    "Definitely if you want to learn what computer network is really about.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless (s)he has a particularly strong desire to learn the subject or had some previous knowledge. I imagine that for students who really connect with the material and professor, this course would be a favorite. Unfortunately, I found the workload of the course to be so large that there was very little time to learn anything else.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course if you have a big interest in systems and computer networks. If you are only looking for general knowledge, this course might a little too intense, especially because of the work load.",
    "Supreme course for learning network concepts and programming practice. Take it!"

   "comments": [
    "Even though the topics covered don't directly relate to my research, I found that they were essential to complete my education in Computer Science, and many of the underlying principles covered are applicable to different areas as well. I learned not only about networks but also about Java and concurrent programming.",
    "It teaches me so much about network. More importantly it teaches me there is so much I need to learn by myself."
