   "comments": [
    "Meeting with the writing tutors was helpful and not something I would have otherwise chosen to do. Having my second draft be seen by at least three different editors was great too. Exposure to different styles of feedback is great. The in-class writing exercises, not so much. Maybe it was the specific questions we were asked, or maybe it was the time constraints, I dunno.",
    "The strengths are getting writers published, improving writing skills, and getting students interacting with professional environmental journalists and communicators. I think that classes could be a bit more organized and communication between students and the TAs could be improved, and the classes could be better structured to maximize student engagement.",
    "The class meeting times were not very useful, so there is room for improvement there. Maybe there could be more guest speakers or writers could work directly with their editors.",
    "Overall, this course is good. I would put less work on the editors, it was hard to write and edit with deadlines that moved very quickly. It was more work than a typical one credit course. I would also add more guidance on specific effective writing techniques."

    "Take this class! It improves your writing skills, gets you published, and helps connect you into the world of environmental communication.",
    "It's a great opportunity to get some practice writing articles and to produce some short publications, while working with your classmates and motivating each other. You won't get to know your classmates very well just by taking this class, but you will learn from each other in the editor comments.",
    "I would tell them that it is more work than one might expect."
