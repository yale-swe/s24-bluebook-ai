   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class, but I would inform the student that I struggled considerably at the beginning of the semester. I have never written a research paper before and the transition was difficult. But the class did its job; I learned how to write an effective research paper",
    "it is a little time consuming, but you will be able to improve a lot if you put in the effort",
    "Take another writing course.",
    "I would summarize it as a fascinating overview of a particular topic (depending on what 114 class you take) with a focus on different kinds of writing in the context of that topic.",
    "Learning how to write academic essays.. Yes, for pragmatic reasons",
    "English 114 is a good course to take if you want to improve your writing skills and learn about writing essays while still having a lot of guidance. As opposed to some classes, where there might not be the opportunity to turn in drafts for feedback, this class allows students to turn in a rough draft before the final, allowing ample time for revision. I would recommend this course to anybody who wants to become more confident in their writing skills.",
    "If you are planning on majoring in an area that will require essay writing then it might be a good preparation for that. If you are majoring in a science, there is no real benefit to taking it other than getting a writing requirement out of the way.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENG 114 Section 11 to another student, especially if they were interested in urban studies (like me). It was a great class that really helped introduce me to college writing through a topic I enjoyed learning about."
