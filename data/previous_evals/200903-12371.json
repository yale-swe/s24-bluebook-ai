   "comments": [
    "I cannot recommend this course in good conscience. I leave the lecture dissatisfied almost every time, frustrated with my half-page of confusing notes that are only tenuously related to the period in music history that we think we might be trying to learn about.... What is very refreshing however, is the course's approach to testing. The exams emphasize the broader trends in music history and rely less on robotic memorization of tunes than on keener perception of musical devices and philosophies. Despite my dissatisfaction with the teaching methods, I am in fact leaving this course with some great new insights into how music is composed and performed.",
    "I don't think that I could recommend this course, given how frustrated I have been with its organization. That said, I think that what parts of it I was not frustrated with were absolutely fabulous and moving.",
    "Absolutely, whether you are a music major or not. In fact, anything Professor Brodsky teaches.",
    "Yes. Definitely 100% without a doubt. I already have told everyone who would listen to take it.Even if you knew nothing about music like me. Or even if you are a music genius, it will still be a fun chill class.",
    "I would only recommend this course, if taught by Prof. Brodsky, for someone who has a strong interest in early western classical music. I do, so I am still glad I enrolled.",
    "TAKE IT!!! Prof. Brodsky is awesome!",
    "Take this course if you want to learn a lot about the history of western music from 800-1800 AD. Don't expect to remember many specifics, although you will learn many. The workload isn't very difficult, and you'll be able to both read about and listen to classical music that you otherwise probably wouldn't be exposed to (unless you're some sort of musical historian or church choir member). The textbook is the biggest hang-up - two dictionary-sized volumes of music history. But if you're up for a lot of reading (and maybe some skimming) and put the work in, you'll get a lot out of this course.",
    "Great course - showed me and taught me how to appreciate lots of beautiful music. Little workload. You need to like music in general in order to like this course. Also Prof. Brodsky is a great guy and a really interesting lecturer.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I had absolutely no music experience, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I looked forward to Professor Brodsky's lectures. He is a treat.Take this class, take this class, take this class.Clear enough?"
