   "comments": [
    "REALLY GREAT SC CREDIT!! The premise of the class is to understand the wider concepts in fairly basic chemistry, rather than memorizing lots of random facts that you'll probably never use again. Dr G is a great teacher and is very approachable and always looks out for the welfare of his students. I only wish they could either move it off science hill or later than 9 a.m.!! Not only would many more people take the class, but people would be able to benefit from it much more easily. All in all, though, great class and nice easy way to fulfill a SC credit.",
    "Chemistry 101 is a good class for any student who is not a science major and is looking to fill one of the science distributional requirements. It is a general chemistry course, which emphasizes the application of chemistry to the real world. I would highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "Definitely take this course! If you took chemistry in high school, you'll be well prepared; if you took AP, you'll probably be a little bored. The \"pure chemistry\" aspects are emphasized much more than the environmental aspects. With a weekly\/bi-weekly problem set, two midterms and a final, the workload is definitely manageable. I would definitely recommend this for your first semester at Yale or as a fifth course. Dr. G is great, too! A painless science credit.",
    "Chemistry 101 is much like a high school level chemistry class. Much of the same material is covered. If you can remember Chemistry from high school, the class shouldn't be too bad, but if you can't, then expect to do work outside of class to try and catch up.",
    "A great chemistry class for people who don't remember anything from high school chemistry. I wouldn't recommend it if you have any kind of chemistry background.",
    "Don't take this class expecting it to be easy, because it isn't. It's actually a broad (but intense) survey of everything chemistry related and Dr. G is a very tough grader. If you're willing to put in the time and energy, you'll do well, but if you don't have the time or aren't willing to put forth the energy, this really isn't the science for you.",
    "If you need the Sc credit or if you've got a strong base in chemistry but don't plan on majoring in it, then go for it, the class should be relatively easy. If you're a liberal arts kind of student with a weak history in chemistry, however, be careful. The learning curves spikes where, for most of the course, the information is standard and easily learned, and then you find yourself in the midst or organic chemistry towards the final third of the class.",
    "Chem 101 is a great and painless way to fulfill the science requirement for non-science majors. It's worth the 9a class time. The workload is reasonable. The midterms are very applicable to lectures and problem sets. Dr. G. is fantastic and always around.",
    "It is a good course for non-science majors and people who have taken some chemistry before but do not want to go into full chemistry.",
    "Basic introductory chemistry class. Material is all in the textbook and further explained in lecture, problem sets more or less every 1.5 weeks, two midterms and a final exam that are tough but fair. If you want to fulfill your science requirement with a straightforward class, this is a good option. Professor makes chemistry as fun as it can be and is great about answering questions and helping with problem sets. I appreciated the fact that it was a legitimate science class and that as a non-science major I could actually get something out of it, but without being too overwhelmed. It's not a breeze, but definitely worth your time if you are trying to get that science credit.",
    "It is a good class as long as you're ready to do real chemistry. It's not a gut science class and you'll have to work pretty hard if chemistry isn't your forte. The chem is good general knowledge and its applications are interesting.",
    "If you have not taken chemistry and are looking to fulfill a science requirement, avoid this course. If you have taken chemistry, it is probably a doable science requirement credit.",
    "This was a solid science course that teaches the fundamentals of Chemistry. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a manageable science credit during an otherwise difficult semester.",
    "Chem 101 was a great class and an easy way to complete a science credit. If you liked chemistry in high school but don't want to take gen. chem. with all the pre-med nerds then chem 101 is for you. You learn one chapter a week and have one problem set a week. There's not much reading and the topics are really easy to grasp if you have a basic understanding of chemistry fundamentals, and even if you don't Dr. G is a great teacher who has the ability to put any topic into simple terms.",
    "Chemistry 101 gives an overview of chemistry. It requires an amount of work comparable to many other Yale courses, but I think the rewards it brings more than justifies the committment.",
    "Yes. Dr. G makes the material very interesting.",
    "Great",
    "Chem 101 is not hard, but it is not a course where you can ignore. I would not recommend the course simply because I feel there are better science credits you can take."
