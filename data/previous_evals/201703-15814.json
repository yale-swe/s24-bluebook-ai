   "comments": [
    "Anthropological perspective on the workings of science in the laboratory as well as in the field; perspective on the entanglement of science with the \"social\"; a triadic analytical window to approach science through the interplay between knowledge, image and place; analytical writing; excellent feedback from the instructor etc. etc.",
    "This course is heavy on reading and class discussion, so, in terms of skills, it teaches one how to read quickly and deeply. I appreciate how flexible Lisa was in terms of the final project. One can essentially pursue whatever project they want. I found the initial readings for the course very interesting. They offer a helpful framework for thinking about science, \"the field,\" objectivity, and the laboratory. These were a great introduction to the course. Overall, I thought the course provided insight into the different ways that ethnographies can be conducted. This is a valuable class for an anthropologist who will themselves be headed to \"the field\" to study science and technology in some capacity. The reading that I liked the least was the Donna Haraway book. Haraway obviously has a lot to contribute to the field, but her style of writing can be labyrinthine and overly academic at times. Perhaps this isn't a reason not to read her, but, in my opinion, her writing makes the conveyance of her ideas all the more difficult.",
    "This was a FABULOUS class for several reasons outlined below: 1. Dr. Lisa Messeri is extremely helpful in guiding us through the literature of this exciting genre of scholarship - Anthropology of Science and Technology - its history, nuances, and politics. My encounters with this literature were sporadic and ad-hoc until I took this class, and now I definitely feel like I have a systematic understanding of this sub-discipline. 2. The syllabus is very thoughtfully put together and covers specific sub-themes that were important. Not only did the syllabus work as a useful map through the literature but we also deliberated retrospectively about each book we read (at the end of the semester) and how it falls with respect to various themes. This was super useful to solidify our understanding of how the various scholarly works are linked and work together. 3. We read many relatively recent ethnographies, and many first books, helping those of us further along in our doctoral studies think carefully about how to write about our fieldwork. 4. Each class was extremely interesting and fun. We did several small exercises throughout the semester (like writing small field notes and observations about science and technology) that helped us draw in our own observations into the themes we were discussing. 5. Dr. Messeri is a kind and generous mentor who shared many extra references and ideas in office hours and over email. She is an excellent and welcome addition to the faculty of the Anthropology department at Yale. Knowledge, skills, and insights I developed: an understanding of the field of Anthro of Sci and Tech, a familiarity with key scholars and main arguments, relationship of this scholarship to my own research Skills and insights: Clearer thinking about how my own work relates to knowledge production and place. Through the exercises in class I got to practice writing in different styles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is excellently designed and covers a broad range of things through a set of interrelated texts, which are discussed in the classroom alongside the sharing of notes as well as reviews written by students. I do not see any weakness of the course.",
    "This course was wonderful - no suggestions on improvement!",
    "The strengths of the course are the fascinating books that Lisa selects, the fun little ethnographic assignments that she assigns (they break up the class discussions nicely), and the other students in the course. This course selects for a small group of students who are highly invested in the course topics. This makes for great discussions. The weakness of the course is in the overall framing. Here's what I mean: The first day of class was good in that it took a big picture approach to understanding what an anthropology of science and technology is. The second (?) to last day of class was also good in that it synthesized everything we had read for the course and related it to the overarching goals of the class. However, I would have liked for these lessons\/take-aways to have been teased out a bit more during classes, especially during the middle weeks of the course. It would have been helpful to discuss each week's reading within the larger context of the course and an anthropology of science and technology. The overall thrust of the course became muddled for me at times.",
    "Strengths: excellent professor, fascinating topic, great syllabus Weaknesses: none that I can think of (I wish we didn't have to end it after one semester!)"

   "comments": [
    "Most definitely!",
    "Yes, absolutely! This class was an excellent (and thorough) introduction to the theory and methods of anthropology of science, with many insights to take into other fields and inquiries.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! The books\/topics are inherently fascinating. Lisa Messeri puts a lot of effort into choosing the readings each week. She is a fantastic professor. A course like this really relies on the quality of the professor and the students. In both respects, I found this to be an excellent course.",
    "Absolutely! Loved this class, and would recommend it to any student interested in these topics."
