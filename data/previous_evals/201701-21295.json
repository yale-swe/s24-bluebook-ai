    "Chinese vocabulary and speaking improved a lot, as well as essay writing.",
    "Lots of Chinese vocabulary and a insight into different aspects of Chinese culture.",
    "I greatly improved my Chinese speaking, writing, and reading abilities. I seemed to have regained most of my Chinese writing abilities from when I took CHNS 153 four years ago. I also got much better at reading and recognizing traditional Chinese characters.",
    "This course enabled me to meaningfully expand my vocabulary in advanced Chinese",
    "CHNS 163 allowed me to keep up my Chinese and explore important topics surrounding contemporary Chinese society. I believe I am a better (and faster) critical reader after 163, as well as a lot better writer! Speaking definitely has not improved, as the class is definitely not centered around speaking. Overall, great way to keep up advanced Chinese levels."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very solid and predictable structure, not too much work, Su Laoshi is very lax about being busy and extending deadlines Weakness: can be too rote and boring at times because the curriculum is SO old!!! Improvements: New curriculum that is more applicable to China in the 21st century (versus the late 20th or very early 2000s- China has grown and changed so much since a decade ago!)",
    "Strengths: Had a rigid structure but also allowed for flexible discussions that were very interesting during class. The students also all got to really know each other well. Weaknesses: Sometimes we wouldn't get through all the material we were supposed to on a given day, though we usually caught up at some point.",
    "I had a great time in this course, despite it being a lot of work. The compositions and exams were a great way to assess our retention of the text. However, I don't think the dictations were the most relevant way to study Chinese characters. In the future, most of the writing will be done on the computer anyways, so pinyin would be all that we will need. The dictations always added so much stress to the class, and I don't think it added much to my retention of skills I will use in the future.",
    "This course was very much fettered to the textbook and went about covering the material in a very generic way. The volume of words we were asked to memorize felt infeasible at times. However, I enjoyed this course overall",
    "Strength definitely lay in professor Su's ability to engage students with important and interesting topics; you're 100% there during each and every class. He shares many anecdotes and personalized knowledge and really cares about your success. This class is especially good for those who wish to improve reading and writing. The textbook is interesting but the format can get old quickly. I wish there was a bit more variation in the tasks\/homework, but I think Su subscribes to the idea of repetition as key to Chinese (which is partially true). There definitely is not enough speaking practice to keep up your oral confidence, and I wish there were more built-in practice opportunities."

   "comments": [
    "Yes-- be ready to work hard for dictations every week, but if you do what you are expected to and do it without procrastinating, this is a very chill class and Su Laoshi is willing to grant extensions!",
    "Would definitely recommend as a continuation of 162 sequence; Professor Su is just a great guy, and you tackle much more complex topics in this part (such as climate change second semester v. music first semester).",
    "Su Laoshi is the nicest Chinese professor at Yale!! I really struggled in the course in the beginning, but he helped me so much in catching up to the class. This course is the best one to take in between the intermediate advanced level Chinese to the literature courses (one of which is also taught by Su Laoshi). There is quite a bit of work for the course regularly, but that makes each of the three exams seem like not much. There is a prequiz for each lesson (every 3-4 sections) and a dictation (memorizing the characters) after each lesson. Just be ready to put in a lot of work and get a lot in return! Su Laoshi was also very fun to take a class with. He loves to talk about his past experiences as an intellectual during the communist regime. All in all, great class!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone seeking to improve their vocabulary in advanced mandarin",
    "Definitely would recommend, especially if you're looking for a more casual and fun learning environment and keep up Chinese, but maybe not if you want to study really intensively and learn a ton of new stuff."
