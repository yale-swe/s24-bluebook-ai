    "The course was very well taught - excellent choice of topics. The guest speakers were all excellent.",
    "This is a great course that provides a wide range of relevant and interesting topic related to cardiovascular disease and stroke.",
    "I really felt that this class was a welcome change from the traditional finance-based courses that I was taking at the School of Management. It was new, relevant material (who is not concerned about their health these days?), and it was taught in a fresh way with lectures by the professor peppered in between talks given by guest speakers. However, I wish there were greater dialogue between the professors and students. Further still, while the students are on the topic of addressing the issues associated with diagnosing and treating heart disease, why not have the students come up with innovative ways to do so?"

    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Excellent.Dr Lichtman is a great example of how thoughtful, persistent, and thorough inquiry can get at some very tricky questions in public health.She shares a vast knowledge on the current evidence, in many significant areas of cardo epi (eg, stroke in younger and underserved populations, national risk-adjusted standards for stroke outcomes), always elucidating the limitations and potential directions for future research.It was a great pleasure to be in her class.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Very well-informed professor who truly cared about our learning experience. Was sometimes hard to get hold of though and some delay in responding to questions or returning assignments. Very good though!",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman is a wonderful professor, very patient and kind, and she is very passionate about her researches",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0The instructor is an incredible expert in the field and it was great to be in her class. However, a major weakness is the fact that the last assignment on designing a study really came out of nowhere - it was not originally listed in the syllabus - as the original assignment was to write a 3-page editorial... very different from designing a study of 8 pages. This was a good assignment but really needed to be assigned to the class at a much earlier date.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman is an excellent instructor with relevant real world experience. She is warm and easily approachable. She is among the top professors in EPH.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0The professor is excellent. She is obviously a knowledgeable, highly-respected and -accomplished individual within her field. However, as a student in the School of Management, I often felt that the material was taught toward Public Health students. There is, naturally, nothing wrong with this approach, but greater detailaround how papers are read, how they are written, and how lectures are taught would have been greatly appreciated, particularly for me, a student pursuing his MBA. Perhaps a lecture devoted to just this process of reading papers and learning to ask questions and think critically about the issues would have been ideal."

    "Very good class if interested in heart disease; really makes you knowledgeable about the subject and forces you to exhibit your knowledge through assignments.",
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy learning more about cardiovascular diseases and the research opportunities out there in this field",
    "The best class I've taken at EPH",
    "This course is very good, but it is not for any student to enter. My recommendation for a fellow student would be to sit down with the professor beforehand, establish some set of expectations and reasonable goals to achieve by the end of the semester, and then address and re-address these expectations and goals throughout the semester (perhaps every 3 weeks). The material is extremely interesting, but I, at times, felt distant from the course. The professor is also very helpful and willing to guide students, so please be encouraged by that."
