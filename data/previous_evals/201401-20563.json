    "It's a good seminar with a relaxed atmosphere and riveting subject-matter. If you are at all interested in WWI then you should take this class. The themes covered in it provide an important cultural bearing both for understanding how 19th century cultural themes spilled into the 20th century and how those cultural tendencies fused with and into the memory of WWI into the post-War world. It's not a particularly difficult as a seminar, which is always refreshing so that you can focus on enjoying the material and the class as oppose to stressing about your GPA. The readings are great and not superfluous, all of them will add to your understanding, and the Professor and TA both epitomize how lucky we are to be at Yale with people who love what they study and as a result know it inside out, backwards and forward. I didn't take Jay Winter's class prior to this but a few people did and I know that can be a nice compliment to this as well, although you are analyzing the same event from a radically different perspective. Definitely take.",
    "Take it! Professor Cabanes is amazing, the material is really interesting and, while there's a lot of reading its so worth it and enjoyable.",
    "This is a very good class. It is cultural history, which is its own thing - don't come in and expect you'll talk about military history a lot. Also there's very little on countries that aren't France, Britain, and Germany, although you could write your paper on something else if you wanted to.",
    "This course is great if you're truly interested in World War I, as it is an in-depth study of all \"cultural\" (non-military) aspects of the war. Topics explored include: rumors about the war, the home front, women in the line of fire, children at war, religion and faith, shell shock, missing bodies and the mourning process, and veterans. If WWI does not interest you, however, you might find yourself a bit bored. That being said, the readings were very interesting and helped shed light on the First World War, which is often overshadowed in historical memory by WWII.",
    "It was alright. If primary source material is something you are really interested in than take it."
