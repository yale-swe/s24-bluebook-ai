    "Recommend for IR students.",
    "The course provided a solid overview of the time period and yet left me with many unanswered questions. I would recommend the course.",
    "yes--great course",
    "I will wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. This seminar is a must-take course for students in IR, History, and Political Science. It will also be tremendously beneficial for students in any other discipline. The course offers in-depth insight and analysis of a very important time in both U.S. and world history which shaped so many aspects of international relations. This course is not just a necessary overview of momentous dates and influential actors. The Professor's lecture, readings, and discussions provide new perspectives that will allow for more profound analysis of both historical events and current affairs in international relations."

   "comments": [
    "Offers a different perspective into the studies of IR and transnational history. Good selection of topics and reading materials.",
    "The opportunity to do a final research paper on a subject related to my concentration has certainly deepened my knowledge of the discipline and contributed to my research.",
    "wonderful foundation\/skills of evaluation",
    "I learned from the course just how influential this time period was in shaping today's global governance and international relations. It has given me new insight into specific events and a broader perspective on how so many aspects of international relations are linked to one another and can be explained by events that occurred between 1914-1991, in more ways than one. For my future research, this course has equipped me with the tools to make connections and provide analysis that examines the issue or question from many different angles."
