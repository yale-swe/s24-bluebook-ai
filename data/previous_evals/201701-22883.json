    "Great class. I think the TAs should do a little more to moderate the conversation, though.",
    "I think this course is very well made. Any courses that are designed for the graduates (like the Principles of Neuroscience and Bioethics) are superbly good. We had a nice stimulating discussions throughout the semester, trying to identify the ethical conundrums we face in science and how we can partially deal with them. TAs were great, the invited guests were great, Dr. Greer was great.",
    "More emphasis on encouraging students to think outside of the box in the discussions. Several class periods seemed like a rehashing of the same debates that have occurred a thousand times instead of going in new, creative, or innovative directions."
