   "comments": [
    "If you're this far in the Russian sequence, you're probably gonna take this regardless of what I say. That being said, I really enjoyed this class, but be warned - unlike your friends in other L5 classes, you will work your ass off in this one. Lots of class-to-class homework, but it's worth it because you learn a ton (especially new vocab) and Irina is really forgiving if you're late\/short on things. Basically the class boils down to reading some things or watching some things and then discussing those things for 50 minutes with a really chill and intelligent professor. Take it.",
    "I would strongly recommend RUSS 160 to a fellow student. However, I caution those in quantitative majors to stay on top of the work and plan ahead. Keeping up with the work for this class and managing to turn in multiple weekly problem sets is difficult but not impossible. It is well worth the effort.",
    "Yes, if you want to build up your Russian skill further more.",
    "A great class. If you've made it this far with the russki yazyik, you'll have a blast.",
    "If you've made it this far, you know the Russian language department at Yale is composed of fantastic professors, and Irina Dolgova is no exception. This is a continuation of grammar with an emphasis on acquiring a fair few new verbs and building general reading\/speaking\/writing proficiency. The choice if you're reading this review is probably between a literature course and this grammar course. I'd say take both if you really want to do the literature, but don't drop the grammar. Unless you're really proficient it's quite helpful and Third Year (L5) just didn't have time to teach you everything.",
    "Yes! Irina is great.",
    "This is a pretty intensive course in Russia that will both do great things for your Russian and require you to put a lot into it. Take it if you're willing to put a lot into making your Russian better \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0and you want to spend time with one of the best Russian teachers around.",
    "In sum, the course not only greatly improved my Russian, but I also learned a lot about contemporary Russian society, more than I ever would have expected. I highly recommend this course to anyone."
