   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend unless you have to take this for your major (which you probably do). Psets and exams are both frustrating and both the lecture and textbook are not super helpful...",
    "Hard.",
    "A necessary evil, but the instructor really did a great job in making the class more approachable! In my opinion, after 2 guest lectures from Nordhaus, I found Peters to be the superior Intermediate Macro professor. The class does go a bit slow, but I really enjoyed his treatment of major topic in macroeconomics, like inequality and unemployment.",
    "Take if you have to.",
    "Only take if you have to for Econ major. if not, don't bother.",
    "Nice guy, awful teacher. Assigns a book but disagrees with it. Disorganized, tons of mistakes in lecture slides, takes 2 months to return a problem set. In fact, I'm still waiting on my last TWO problem sets as I write this evaluation a week before the final. Also, some of the TF's personally admitted they know nothing about macro. This is evident in their problem set grading mistakes. The bigger problem, however, is they'll also be grading your midterms and finals. The professor is too busy\/doesn't care enough to grade them himself. BEWARE.",
    "Atrocious class but hey -- it's required for the major.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Otherwise don't take it.",
    "A class that is hard work but incredibly intellectually stimulating and relevant to the macro economy that we are living in. A great class if you won't to gain a more in depth understanding of how the economy is affected by macroeconomic topics like unemployment, interest rates, and inflation. It's theoretical in nature, but Mr. Peters did a good job applying the material learned to current events.",
    "If you're an Econ major you have to take it. Otherwise, don't. It's awful.",
    "This class was a mess- the syllabus constantly changed, a third of the problem sets were just never graded, and the exams were all over the place. The final was the hardest test I have taken at Yale (far worse than Intermediate Micro) and frustratingly we had no practice exams. Econ majors have to take this, but I would wait to get a more organized semester. Peters is a very nice guy, but this was really out of control.",
    "Challenging but worthwhile.",
    "Take it with Michael Peters as the instructor if he continues to teach it. Im not sure I would have had the same understanding of the material with anyone else.",
    "If you're an econ major, you have to take it. Probably the most interesting of the intro\/intermediate sequence.",
    "This class was hard. Problem sets, tests, everything. There was not a lot of overlap between the lectures, text, and problem sets\/exams. I would not recommend taking it with Peters honestly...it was pretty math intensive and disorganized. Problem set solutions were sometimes unclear\/incorrect.",
    "It will inform you on pretty much all you need to know when it comes to the macro economy",
    "This class is a challenging course on macroeconomics, which combines concepts, graphs and math to fully understand each topic. I would recommend this class only for students genuinely interested in econ and with strong math skills.",
    "Very hard! Don't take this class unless you love econ, or unless you have to. Not that much work (only 6 problem sets), but the problem sets and exams were very difficult, with material we hadn't learned on their- to test our intuition.",
    "You have to take it for an Econ major. It seems like who teaches the course any given semester makes a major difference for the quality of the course.",
    "Decent class where you will learn macroeconomics. Very little work and half the class gets an A\/A-.",
    "I would recommend ECON 122 to another student because it helps to know the models that explain what happens in the real world.",
    "The Fall semester class is tall and blond. The entire class will be surfing the internet during class, though, so the wifi speed is slower than it is for other classes. So, it's a tradeoff between the curve and ability to check Facebook.",
    "It's required for the major. Not an incredibly painful class, but not one that I would take if I were not required to do so. I would recommend taking it with Hordhaus, as the course is tried and true. While Peters was by objective metrics a solid professor, his naively heavy weighting of the final and selection of a textbook that was more functional as a paperweight than as a source of information showed his teaching can certainly improve. For me, Peters' lecture style was not the most intelligible because it was hard to parse what was important and what wasn't.",
    "Aaaaa its hard. I loved the material, and the problem sets were fun. However, it was embarrassing how the Econ department dealt with this class: TAs that did not know the material, problem sets that were not corrected two months after they were submitted, poorly conducted section. Thank God Michael Peters was a great professor (funny, smart, engaging, very dedicated) because that is the only reason I could deal with the class. Don't buy the textbook if its still Mankiw because Peters does the class entirely another way, and don't bother going to section.",
    "122 is a course you have to take...so there isn't much to say. Michael Peters taught the class very well but the tests were very hard. Much harder than the psets...",
    "Definitely don't take it unless you're an econ major. I think I would have preferred to take it with Nordhous.",
    "It's a requirement for the Econ major, other than that, it doesn't help you develop a way of thinking and is a lot of unnecessary work.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!!",
    "Recommended depending on the professor. Essential to understanding economic policy.",
    "Pretty standard required macro class, I wouldn't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Intermediate Macro was taught by a brand new professor this year, Michael Peters, a young, enthusiastic German PhD who made the ladies swoon and exhibited a somewhat unfortunate lack of proofreading in his lecture slides (e.g. \"sh1ts in the AD curve,\" \"short-fun fluctuations\"). Sadly, he came into the class with just a bit too much idealism and seemed unprepared for Yalies' tendency to shop for clothes during lecture and complain galore over logistics beyond his control and having to do math which was a prerequisite for the class. Even more sadly, except for the amazing head TA Monica, he was accompanied with a bunch of sadly incompetent SoM students who did not excel in areas such as knowing the course material. Thus most sections were useless, Psets were not returned in a timely manner, all assignments and the midterm were graded inconsistently, etc. Many of these factors were unfairly projected onto Peters, however, who is a lucid lecturer who cares about the craft of teaching and gives the active student plenty of chances to participate. I will be looking for his courses in the future.",
    "This course had its goods and its bads. Michael Peters tries hard to get the material across, but the way he taught the Solow Model (first unit) was pretty bad -- and then the first midterm covers through the Solow Model and that's it. It ends up being a painful situation for everyone (the average on the midterm was something like a 40\/75). That said, afterwards, I personally thought his lectures got better and better through the end of the class. The problem sets (for some reason there were only 6 for our class) were pretty annoying because they had errors and you could never figure out what exactly they were asking for. The final was fairly hard, especially (surprise surprise) the Solow Model question, which, from what I've heard, pretty much wrecked everybody. Overall, an okay class -- you basically have to take it if you're any sort of Econ major, so no point cribbing about it.",
    "don't take this unless you have to....",
    "Decent class, a lot of it is a review of intro macro with a couple unique twists on the IS-LM model",
    "Take it if you're an econ major. If you're interested in the subject matter just stick to intro macro",
    "have to take it for econ",
    "As a course, ECON 122 is more math intensive and theoretical than the classes before it. The math can often get quite tricky, so I would brush up on algebra skills. This semester the course was disorganized because the professor was new and the TAs were not great. This had potential to be a great course and I am sure with some improvement, Michael Peters will master it.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. It's pretty difficult, especially the impossible final.",
    "If you are an ECON major, you would have to take it. Brace up!",
    "For both the intermediate Econ courses here at Yale I found the material very manageable and easy enough to grasp but the exams tend to be unnecessarily hard. There is a generous curve so you should be fine if you study, but I'd rather be more concerned about learning and understanding the material than focusing on beating a certain percentage of the class in the exam to get the grade you want.",
    "Econ 122 was very enjoyable. The material was harder than I expected it to be but it was a fairly pain free class. Michael Peters is the man.",
    "If Professor Peters teaches the course again, you should go for it. The material can be challenging but he's very organized and clear. Anything you're confused about after lecture he does a great job explaining after lecture or in office hours. Also he's extremely responsive to student concerns. If you email him with any questions or problems he'll get back to you within hours. Standard economics curve- easy B+ or A-, harder to land an A. If you find some friends to check the problem sets with and fully review your notes before the final you'll be fine.",
    "It was a hard course in terms of material but Professor Peters was a great lecturer and engaging which made it bearable. If it wasn't for him, it would have been much more difficult. It's a requirement so i'm glad it was still engaging and I learned a lot.",
    "ECON 122 is a good course on Macroeconomics, much better than the introduction. You learn the Macro models in more detail -- the business cycle, IS MP curves, the solow model. A more in depth analysis of many of the topics covered in introduction. The exams were much harder than expected this term, but that might change. Peters is a great professor, best econ professor I've had so far so take it with him if you can.",
    "This is intermediate macroeconomics, plain and simple. Professor Peters is very nice and makes an effort to make the material interesting and understandable so I recommend you take this class with him if you have to.",
    "A good idea might be to take it with Nordhaus instead. Though Peters' slides were generally clear and helpful, having a textbook to follow along with would have been ideal. Mankiw wasn't quite the same and neither was Jones. TAs were abysmal (SOM students, not Econ grad students as they usually are).",
    "Harder than you expect, but well taught!",
    "A great course if you attend all or most of the lectures. You'll learn ton of stuff that is helpful in understanding macroeconomic debates. Everything you learn in class is relevant.",
    "This class is a major must-take for a reason. Do it, do it well, and reap the benefits. I entered this class with a preference for micro and the decision-making side of economics, and I left it with a desire to build the rest of my time around understanding markets and relevant policy (not to mention the fact that studying for this class helped me study for and, in turn, land a trading floor internship). My only regret is that I didn't dive in with both feet from the beginning.",
    "It's Peter's first time teaching the course. He is super knowledgeable and really cared about his students. Despite spending too much time on real world macro which restrains macro theories and offering too few problem sets which hardly encouraged learning, I think, he will change the course structure in the next time he teaches it.",
    "Typical macro. Do the problem sets and go to lecture and it'll be fine. Final was pretty fair. Midterm was really hard.",
    "Do NOT take this class with Peters. The class is far too mathematical, the exams are illogical and challenging, and you won't learn anything conceptually relevant to macroeconomics. Definitely take this class with Nordhaus - Peters teaches the class in an extremely inaccessible manner, such that you don't actually learn anything.",
    "Often the required econ courses are not very great, but I thought Michael Peters did a very good job of making this course interesting.",
    "This was a horrible class. The tests are really really hard and the final was harder than diamonds. Take it with easier classes, pay attention like your life depends on it (bc the lecture notes themselves are painfully devoid of the useful details), take it with friends, and hang on for dear life.",
    "I would recommend taking this class in the fall with Bill Nordhaus, although this version was a decent alternative if you need to take it in the spring. Also, the curve was VERY generous, probably more so than in the spring, so that is something to consider. The class was frustratingly unorganized though. The professor would spend the first 20 minutes of class on current events and then rush through the pertinent material so fast that it was often confusing for most people. Also, it took weeks to get back the problem sets, and we still have not received final grades, even though they were due a few days ago. The TAs were generally unhelpful and graded several exams (including mine) incorrectly because they did not bother to fully read students answers. Monica was great though and took time to do regrades and have very helpful and well-planned sections and office hours (try to get her as your TA if possible). Also, the problem sets made the simple material unnecessarily confounding, because the questions were worded ambiguously. Overall, the material is not particularly challenging theoretically or mathematically, but the class got confusing because the textbook was very different from what was taught in class. Reading it added confusion so most people didn't. Because of the generous curve and the low work load (only 6 psets, a midterm, and a final), the class was fairly low work but still annoying at times due to the lack of organization.",
    "Much more intense than intro macro.",
    "I am not a huge fan of macro as a subject in general, but my experience in this class with professor Peters was overall pretty good. He is a clear lecturer and his lecture slides are pretty good for the most part (although there are some places he will skip steps so it can be hard to understand 100% of things if you do not go to lecture). Homeworks and workload are are very reasonable. Tests are quite difficult though, and I do not feel like studying for many hours was any more helpful than if i had only studied for a couple. Overall, if you are an econ major you have to take this, so taking it with Peters is a pretty good option.",
    "If you're interested in economics, this is a very applicable course to take.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a very good introduction into important macro principles.",
    "Necessary for economics majors but highly unorganized at times.",
    "Its necessary for econ majors so if you want to major in econ then take it. If you just want an economics course then there are probably more interesting classes to take.",
    "Not really that much harder than intro. The concepts are the same; the math is more annoying but it's still IS LM AS AD. Peters is a good lecturer and seems like a cool fellow--but be forewarned that he will ask a question and endure the awkward silence for as long as it takes to get an answer. Get a good study crew together; it'll make the problem sets a lot less frustrating.",
    "If you're an Econ major, yes. No otherwise. I didn't feel like I learned almost anything that I didn't learn in intro macro, but the course was still very frustrating at times. That said, I was not heavily invested in the class and probably would have enjoyed it more if I had put more focus into it. Both exams were challenging, especially because there was no practice posted for the final. Only six problem sets, one of which you could drop.",
    "Quite standard fare for a core course in the Economics major. You go in knowing what to expect: six psets, a midterm, a final. Intermediate Macro was not as difficult or headache-inducing as its sister, Intermediate Micro, but neither was it as rewarding - it's not one of those classes that teaches you to be a better student or that you come away feeling like you've learned and gained so much throughout the course of the semester. Professor Peters did do a great job for his first semester of teaching, though: he meticulously prepared lecture slides and really tried to convey the concepts in an interesting way. It really was the subject matter itself and maybe a few nights of sleep deprivation - not Professor Peters' teaching - that made me zone in and out of class and turn off my brain at times. Take this course with Peters if you desire a predictable, medium-workload economics core course taught by an earnest professor.",
    "Most of us took it as a requirement. But I would recommend the course as Professor Peters is a really knowledgeable professor and does incredible research. Though he will probably find more competent TAs and organize the structure a bit better the next time given the experience this time.",
    "It was a good class with Peters. Most likely you will only take it if you have to.",
    "! Do not take this class with Peters!!!!!! Wait for a semester if you have to, to take it with another professor (preferably Nordhaus). The class had arbitrary grading for psets (ridiculous for an intermediate macro class). The exams were very hard. However, the worst thing about the class is the wasted potential of the class. My friends who have taken it with Nordhaus told me it was the best class they had ever taken. The questions on the exams and psets were more qualitative, macro based and applicable to the real world. This class was a glorified intermediate micro class that claimed to be macro.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a good class to really consolidate the models from intro macro, and finally get to the themes behind them - inequality, development, policy, etc.",
    "ECON 122 is a tough course with tough material, and of the more difficult classes out of the requirements for the Economics major. But, at the same time, I found it to be a rewarding experience, because, at the end of the term, you are able to get a much better understanding of the recession, Fed practices, and other macroeconomic policies critical knowledge that students should gain before they leave Yale."
