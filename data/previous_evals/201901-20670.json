    "Lab skills!",
    "I learned a lot about several different living groups, and I learned valuable ways to research differences among groups. I also learned about important traits within groups.",
    "Honestly amazing intro to ecology!",
    "Best lab I have ever taken!!!",
    "I learned valuable laboratory skills, such as microscopy, dissection, observational skills, and how to keep a lab notebook. I gained insights into the vast and beautiful diversity of life and the functional traits that lead to such diversity.",
    "This course was extremely interesting and it taught me about the different component of evolution.",
    "This class was an awesome survey of many of the different disciplines of biological study, a great option for an underclassman looking to find a preferred area of research, or an upperclassman who wants to pull together a lot of the biological concepts they have learned",
    "I had never taken an evolutionary class before, and I felt like that was a good into for that.",
    "Better understood phylogenies and animal\/plant morphologies",
    "So many"

   "comments": [
    "The teaching staff were very enthusiastic about learning and about the course material, which proved to be infectious! However, the assignments and projects felt a little disorganized and the expectations on assignments were not always clear.",
    "Great course",
    "Overall this was a really good course. It was fun and engaging and the TAs and professor really cared. It was also a very supportive environment, and everyone was really enthusiastic about the material. I genuinely enjoyed it and learned a lot and I'm really glad I took the class. However, some of the assignments felt like busy work, and the time it took to complete sections of the lab reports often didn't correspond to the points they were worth. The instructions in general were also often a bit vague, and it's a small thing but having the files for the class more organized on canvas would've been helpful. Also because of the large amount of topics covered, the TAs didn't always understand everything fully and weren't able to answer questions. However, overall it was a really supportive, interesting, and collaborative class.",
    "Strengths: Marta, the TAs, the class, everything is amazing. The fruit feast? phenomenal. The level of care for the students? Outstanding. Weaknesses: I wish that we had more field trips! I love them so much!",
    "I don't think that there are many, if any, weaknesses at all to the course. It was fantastic.",
    "This course was extremely engaging and fun to go to every week. It was also well organized throughout the semester",
    "All strengths, this class was fantastic, really engaging experiments, a reasonable amount of work expected, lots of support from teaching staff and professor Wells. All around great class :)",
    "Fantastic lab. Both very interesting, educational, and enjoyable. A productive learning environment that was both supportive, and encouraged students to take risks and learn by experience.",
    "This class was amazing. Every lab was very hands on, so I felt like I was actually learning. Also, Professor Wells and the TAs were very helpful. It is a very nice experience when you can tell that the professor actually enjoys the material. The only thing that I would change about the class is the organization. The why that the files for the class were uploaded was disorganized.",
    "Lots of practical, hands-on experience that help you be familiar with phylogenies and morphologies of plants\/animals.",
    "Strengths- the professor, the TAs, the hands-on learning Weaknesses- the hours"

   "comments": [
    "absolutely!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Marta is AMAZING and the class is fun and interesting. You do really cool things every lab, like look at animal skulls, romp around in a stream, or eat a ton of really cool fruit. The lab reports are a little tedious but you only have to write like four full reports all semester. The quizzes are also pretty easy so the overall workload is not high. It's a really fun lab and makes me wish that every lab at Yale could be like this one.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This was probably one of the best classes I will ever have taken at Yale. Marta is a wonderful soul who pours her heart into teaching this material to students. The labs are amazing hands-on experiences, and the field ecology trips are a rare opportunity to get outside of the classroom for a Yale class. All of the labs and projects were high-yield and very informative, and were greatly augmented by the specimen analysis that happens every week.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would. The professor is really kind and the material is interesting. It's also one of the few classes I've taken where I got really hands on experience, and actually felt like I was learning relevant things.",
    "Yes yes yes.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "For anyone looking for a fun, engaging, stimulating, and FUN (yes I said it twice!!!) biology lab, one must take this course. You learn so much and the labs catered towards not only teaching you, but making sure you are enjoying what you are learning as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Professor Wells is amazing and very fun to work with. The dissections were very interesting and I learned things that I would not have in other classes",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this course. Professor Wells is such a kind, wonderful person to be around, it's nice to have a class that you can look forward to each week! The final project is really fun, I enjoyed writing a lot of blog posts for the class (you don't have to if you don't want to!) and I didn't feel like the quizzes had any sneaky questions designed to sink you. The course is really fair and enjoyable.",
    "Yes! Great lab, with a passionate teacher.",
    "Yes! If you're okay with getting your hands dirty (well not literally, you can wear gloves) this is a really fun lab! You'll get to experience a little bit of most of the EEB lab courses at Yale but in one class. There's a bit of work but nothing terrible, and it was fun to do the final project.",
    "Absolutely. It was not too much work but a lot of fun.",
    "Yes! Do it!",
    "Yes, v fun and informative"
