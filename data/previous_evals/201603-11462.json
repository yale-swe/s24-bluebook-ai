    "I learned a lot about error analysis and its role in experimentation.",
    "This class is a great opportunity to get an experimental insight into the topics covered in class. It's also usually fun, although some labs can be a bit intense.",
    "While this class does help to complement the topics covered in lecture, the main focus seems to be error propagation and data analysis. Unfortunately, the techniques used in class are not always the same, and, in fact are contrary to what is described in the first two chapters of the textbook. Students are expected to understand certain error propagation rules for a lab before the correct (non-provisional) version has been covered in the problem sets. This didn't make much sense to me and led to a lot of confusion.",
    "I leanrned how to derive statistical error, and that was the most useful aspect of the class. Using logger pro was also helpful. Covered alot of material we didn't cover in PHYS 180 and that was a pain.",
    "I learned how to use a lot of basic physics laboratory equipment, and learned how to perform basic statistical analyses and error propagations.",
    "Honestly, not many. This class had very vague instructions that even the section professor disagreed with in the way questions were worded. It was unclear what was expected.",
    "It definitely solidified a lot of my physics knowledge with practical understanding. It's been really helpful in my physics course.",
    "I learned how to use a variety of lab equipment in a physics investigation context, as well as how to properly propagate error in different situations.",
    "In this course we used a variety of a equipment, so I became familiar with using multimeters and various electronic cables. We also used Logger Pro extensively, so I am also familiar with the program now as well. I learned the importance of being aware of uncertainty and error, and incorporating that into my data calculations. I learned the basics of writing a lab report. I also learned how to work with a lab partner to efficiently complete a lab.",
    "I learned to efficiently and properly record laboratory data, a skill that I can use for future laboratory work.",
    "This course provided a decent overview of essential physics concepts and lab practices. The most informative parts of the course for me were the sections on error analysis.",
    "This class allowed me to develop strong analytical skills, especially in regard to error propagation which isn't overtly difficult but does require a fair amount of practice. In addition, this class served as a general overview of topics in traditional physics but didn't require a lot of studying on the background.",
    "I reviewed some basic statistics and how it is applied to physics labs.",
    "More error analysis than physics",
    "We used physics experiments to learn error analysis and how to interpret data.",
    "measuring and propagating uncertainties in measurements, how to use various instruments such as oscilloscope, torsional oscillator, gyroscope, etc. Some knowledge about circuits.",
    "I learned about how to apply the concepts I've been learning in physics class, how to use numerous devices I'd never before seen, and how to analyze data to make conclusions.",
    "I learned how to utilize many different pieces of equipment in the lab in order to solve problems. I also explored many physics topics I was previously unfamiliar with.",
    "I learned about different pieces of scientific equipment and how to use them, as well as how to take good measurements and calculate error propagation.",
    "By necessity, I gained a greater ability to keep more organized notes while also learning to be more thorough in recording processes. Additionally, I found that by the end of the semester I had gained helpful experience in recognizing sources of error. Finally, while very straightforward, the problem sets proved effective at reinforcing topics such as error propagation which was heavily emphasized throughout the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was often a lot to get done in a lab period, but I thought the material was usually pretty interesting.",
    "For one or two labs, the equipment that I was provided with was deficient. Apart from these annoying incidents, there wasn't much to complain about for this class.",
    "The course could be improved b going over the pre-lab from the very start of lab before the experiments are started.",
    "I really liked how this class exposed us to a wide variety of equipment and instruments that are important for basic physics experiments. I'm happy that I now know how to back up the theoretical concepts I learned in class with actual data and error analysis, and I think the range of labs provided us with a good overview of many different concepts. However, I think the class could use better organization. A lot of the prelabs and experiment guides were outdated and confusing without the mini lectures at the beginning of each lab. I think it would be helpful to update these documents, as well as provide us with a better way to prepare for lab each day so students in the future can better estimate how much time each lab takes so they don't run over time.",
    "This course is pretty disappointing. The prelabs oftentimes fail to properly explain concepts. One major problem is that the course expects you to have a basic understanding of the material covered in two semesters of lecture physics, yet most of the students in my section were in the process of taking their first semester of physics at Yale. Additionally, while my professor was always helpful in explaining core concepts about a lab, it was clear they had not took the time to read the lab itself, and were generally not able to answer specific questions about procedures.",
    "I didn't like the structure of the labs. They were long and boring. Sometimes repetitive and unclear in their instructions. The teaching team was good, but the content was rough.",
    "The labs are way too long. Most are intended to take at least 3 hours, without factoring in the pre-lab lectures which always take about half an hour, so we end up leaving almost half an hour late far too often. At the beginning of the course, the workload is way too much. This course should reduce the workload to an actual half credit's worth workload, otherwise it is just unfair to the students.",
    "Experiment guides could be written better so that they are easier to follow.",
    "Better planned out experiments are key.",
    "As stated above, the class lab manuals were unclear. Lab experiments were too long and the TA was always forced to stay 30-45 minutes after every experiment.",
    "I haven't taken a lab before this so I think earlier feedback at the start would be more helpful. Otherwise it was very solid outside of small things like equipment problems.",
    "Especially with the initial courses, I found the course to be quite confusing. There were many instances where the packet of instructions was extremely confusing, but was immediately clarified by the TA. More clearly written lab instructions would be extremely helpful.",
    "This class introduces physics concepts with labs that are quite interesting and engaging, which is one strength. I think some of the prelabs were a bit difficult and\/or confusing because I wasn't always sure what they were asking me to do, since the wording could be unclear. Sometimes questions in the prelabs asked us to do things that were complex and that the prelab didn't always clearly provide context for solving these questions. I also wish that the lab was worth more than half a credit because the work done in this lab class was definitely as much as my 1 credit classes.",
    "The teacher and graduate student assistant were very helpful in explaining lab material during the laboratory period. I would recommend that office hours be added so that students may ask questions about the material on the prelabs.",
    "The course is really boring, but I'm not sure if anything could be done to improve it. I never left lab feeling like I had done something intriguing or particularly informative. However, it's definitely a necessary evil. One improvement could be the clarity of the lab handouts. There were certain labs for which the handouts were practically useless. Even my professor and TA had trouble understanding what exactly we were supposed to do, which extended our time in lab.",
    "The strength of the class is that it promotes student independence, but the weakness is that it has a lack of organization in the conceptual topics covered as well as in the logistics of the course. It could be improved by keeping the aspect of the class regarding student independence while providing more organization to the class structure, including slightly more detail in the experimental outlines. In addition, the experiments were not planned for time well, and many experiments ended up going over the time allotted, which tied into the poor organization.",
    "I do think the class gave me a slightly broadened view of basic statistics. That is, a more holistic understanding beyond the more theoretical details we'd learn in a stats class.",
    "If the course was 2 days a week where one day was going over the concepts and teaching the error analysis and the other day was the lab then that would be more enjoyable. I felt like I taught myself everything.",
    "The strengths of this course are the way the experiments allow us to practice data analysis while exploring introductory physics topics. This course could be improved by releasing lab and prelabs earlier, and making all the necessary Taylor readings accessible, not just the first two. I also think that some of the prelabs were confusing, perhaps they could be clarified; the mini review sessions at the beginning of the class were very helpful.",
    "There was a ton of material we were expected to teach ourselves outside of class in order to complete the pre-labs and the problem sets. This is definitely out of line for a half-credit course. We also had very little instruction regarding the preferred format for the lab summaries and lab reports, resulting in an unavoidable grade penalty, at least for the first few weeks, before the preferences were made clear.",
    "I enjoyed this class. I think it did a nice job of providing a system every week (pre-lab,lab,lab, report,reflection) that helps us to understand our new concepts. I wish the pre-labs were posted before Sunday afternoons. I also wish the pre-labs were easier to understand. Often times, they give too much unnecessary information that is difficult to understand.",
    "The class was very well supported by faculty who were there to answer any questions and were willing to stay late, which was great. Also, the material was eventually easy to understand but initially confused me based on less than informative prelabs",
    "I think that the greatest strength of the course was that it was highly effective in conveying the topics which were the focus of much of the course: error propagation, systematic vs random error, developing a measurement plan, and so forth. In that respect, I think 205 was a highly useful class. I enjoyed the balance between focusing on the methodology and focusing on the physics behind the different experiments. It did seem however that the topics did not line up necessarily with any introductory physics sequence, but I am unsure if this is also the case in the earlier introductory lab sequence."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. It's interesting if you are into physics.",
    "205L is really poorly designed. There seems to be a lot of emphasis on 'creating your own plan' in the experiment guides, so if the concepts weren't already clear, the experiment didn't help. A lot of the pre-lab reading\/question sheets are tedious and at times difficult to read or understand. They didn't really help prepare for lab most of the time and sometimes actually made concepts more confusing. It seemed more designed for someone who already had a much more thorough and strong background in physics, instead of for someone concurrently taking the class. As a result, there wasn't much, if any, overlap with the course material. The short explanations given by our professor and TA during the lab were much more helpful. Some of the experiments seemed kind of poorly planned, sometimes equipment didn't work and we were stuck waiting for the professor or TA to replace or fix things or there wasn't enough of a certain piece of equipment for everyone to perform the experiment at the same time. So, even though this lab has a shorter scheduled time than, for example, some of the chemistry labs, there were a few days where most of the people in our lab had to stay late to finish things. There are a few psets due in the first weeks of lab; they aren't terribly time consuming but were kind of frustrating, as the equations given in the textbook were not the ones our professor wanted us to use. There's not a lot of guidelines for the weekly summaries, but they're pretty easy to get the hang of. The most time consuming part was probably making sure that the lab notebooks were complete for each week, because a lot of times we ran out of time to write the information\/analysis that would have ideally been filled out during the experiment. Overall, not the worst course ever, but it has lots of room for improvement. I don't really feel like I learned much from the class, as the concepts that I understand well now are the same ones I already knew, and the ones I had trouble with are still unclear.",
    "It's a fun class. The workload is very manageable and the TFs are helpful.",
    "The final was extremely fair and practical. The lab reports are also fair. Some of the pre-labs require a lot of previous knowledge but it that grading is based upon completion rather than correctness, then it would be better.",
    "PHYS 205L is a very time-consuming class, especially if you don't already have a good foundation in physics. Many of the prelabs and experiment guidelines were outdated and confusing, which required more time for self-studying to learn some of the new concepts. The guidelines for lab notebooks and reports were also pretty vague, which made the class frustrating at many times. However, in retrospect I appreciated being able to learn how to use various types of lab equipment. I have never really done physics experiments in the past, so I liked having the opportunity to see how we can create experiments and confirm that physical objects do behave as theory suggests using a hands-on approach. I think I was able to learn a lot of useful skills and concepts in the class, but the lab could be made much more enjoyable and less stressful with better organization and clearer guidelines.",
    "Most people who take this course, take it as a major requirement, so they don't have a choice. I would strongly recommend that anyone who doesn't have to take this course should avoid it.",
    "No. Dont take it. Take 165L",
    "Take this course if you have to. However, expect a lot more work at times than half a credit is worth.",
    "This lab is a lot of work outside of class. If you want a challenge, then take this instead of 165L.",
    "I would recommend if you need to take as a requirement. Lab handouts are clear and explain what needs to be done. It is kind of frustrating though because the labs are not organized by topic, and do not follow the topics studied in an intro physics class (in my case phys200).",
    "Do not take it if you can avoid it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because the workload was ridiculous, the material very challenging, and the instruction below average.",
    "Definitely not a bad course. Once you get used to the style of how things are done,the course becomes a lot easier and smoother.",
    "Yes -- the course itself wasn't very well organized, but the content (especially in the latter half) was extremely interesting, and the quality of the TA and professor really made up for it.",
    "I would only recommend this to students who have a strong background in physics and need this for their major. My physics background was not as strong so some of the concepts were confusing and I had little understanding of them. However this class was more focused on teaching students on how to take measurements and understand the uncertainty in those measurements. For students who are willing to put in some time to practice these skills and learn these physics concepts, this is a good class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student entering STEM fields, and for many it is a requirement. It enhances laboratory skills that are crucial for research.",
    "It is definitely not a course to take for fun, but if you need to take an introductory physics lab, you may as well take this. I think I learned more than I would have in P165",
    "I would only recommend this class if you really want to take PHYS 206L, as the class is not the most well organized class, and there is a fair amount of stress involved in the class. The workload is not that bad, but there is a fair amount of work that is expected to be done in the lab, which is part of the stress of the lab. The experimental notebook is a major source of stress as there is little guidance in what is expected in the notebook, but notebook grades form a major portion of the grading in the class.",
    "I came in to lab expecting it to be a time sink, but I emerged relatively impressed. 205L is not a ton of work, but I did learn a few nifty quantitative tricks that will make me more comfortable applying statistical knowledge to future labs or my own life.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course at all - it isn't engaging or rewarding and in no way develops an interest to further learn about physics.",
    "No, only if you have to take it.",
    "Yes, this course provides a nice companion piece to a physics class in that it's very easy to see how concepts are applied, rather than simply dealing with everything within our heads.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student because the professor and teaching fellow support allows students to achieve on topics which might have previously seemed too difficult.",
    "I would recommend taking it, but warn them that although it is only worth half a credit, the workload is about the same as a full credit class.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student who is interested in taking a lab sequence that will place a fair amount of emphasis on the physics as well as on the methodology. I recommend that students interested in the course come in having taken an introductory physics sequence, since I found the material from 180\/181 to be very helpful for grasping the concepts discussed in the pre-labs and labs themselves. I would also emphasize that the workload is considerable and that the .5 credits for the class are not necessarily indicative of the amount of time that might go into the workload."
