   "comments": [
    "It is a decent L5 course. I do not have any complaints but I feel like my Japanese didn't improve much. The teaching materials left much to be desired.",
    "If you've taken Japanese 150 before, you know what to expect. It follows the previous incarnations pretty closely. If not, and you are a freshman coming in with Japanese experience, be ready for a decent amount of work the day before classes, lots of character memorization, and lots of reading practice. It's a really fun class, and as long as you put in the work on a regular basis, not that difficult to do well in.",
    "Be prepared for some engaging readings and discussions. Definitely a lot different than the way L1 and L2 are taught, but then again this is much more advanced Japanese. Very worthwhile class.",
    "If you place here it would probably be a good way to meet the language requirement. If you have taken the lower levels this will be a good way to keep learning or at least maintain.",
    "This class is for students who are already pretty good at Japanese but want to further develop their proficiency. The class focuses less on learning new grammar or vocab and more on practicing reading, writing, and speaking skills.",
    "Though the course can be a bit of work and frustrating at times, especially if you have not previously taken a Japanese class at Yale, I would highly recommend it. I feel exponentially more confident and knowledgeable in my Japanese after taking this course.",
    "The workload is heavy, but the materials chosen are interesting so that makes homework less of a chore!",
    "JAPN 150 is an intermediate-advanced level Japanese class that focuses on improving speaking and reading skills. Each class consists of a conversation about the materials that students have studied for homework; students will get the most out of the class if they prepare homework thoroughly and think briefly before each class about what they did and didn't understand and try to make use of the structures studied in class on their own.",
    "Great course for continuing your Japanese language study.",
    "Very good class, you will learn alot. Homework can be a bit heavy and a little confusing with the various resources it draws from. A big time commitment, but the teachers are great and the class dynamics are really enjoyable and rewarding. The class is challenging but teaches you alot and goes by quickly. Highly recommmended."
