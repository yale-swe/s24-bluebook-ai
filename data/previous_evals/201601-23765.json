   "comments": [
    "1000000% recommend this course. You learn in a way that is different from (and I believe, more meaningful than) most courses at Yale. This course has prepared me with more knowledge I know I will take with me into the real world compared with any other course I've taken at Yale.",
    "A lot of personal thinking and sharing. Highly recommend if you are willing to put yourself out there.",
    "Amazing! Take this class!",
    "This class is a lot of REFLECTION, so be prepared to think a lot about your own experiences in your life. The workload is minimal - just two papers and weekly reflections - and the reward is unbelievably large. Prof. Berg is great at facilitating difficult conversations, and you learn so much about the peers in your class. Once again, be prepared to think a LOT about your own experiences and how they relate to greater principles in life. Basically, this class felt like an intellectual society rather than a class, and papers were really thought-provoking and have made me much more aware of how I think about the world.",
    "If you're willing to be open and honest with your thoughts and feelings, you will truly gain so much from this course. This course will motivate you to better understand yourself, and that understanding not only comes from you as an individual, but also your relationships with others. I highly recommend this course for any student who is willing to embrace this honesty, as it will help them reflect on themselves and better navigate their transition into early adulthood. As students enrolled in a four-year college, we're exposed to so much in such little time. If you approach this class with an open and honest mindset, you will gain a much better understanding of yourself and how you want to navigate your place in this world. Even as I leave this class, I feel inspired to continue to reflect upon myself and my relationships with others. In that sense, this class have motivated me to continue to engage in this type of self-reflection for the rest of my life.",
    "Just take it! This class will challenge the way you think about yourself and the world around you, all while keeping you in a supportive and kind environment. Berg is a brilliant teacher you'll never feel like you're being lectured-at or talked at or talked down to. Sometimes you'll learn things almost subconsciously, and other times you'll learn things and you'll just go, \"Oh! I get it,\" and it will be the best feeling in the world. It's obvious that Berg cares about his students. I'd recommend this class to all upperclassmen.",
    "CSPC 340 was a class unlike any other I have taken at Yale, in the best of ways. If you take this, you will learn to be mindful and reflective about your life and the various \"others\" (people, ideas, institutions) that you come in contact with on a daily basis. You will come to see your classmates, and by extension all Yalies, in a new way after hearing your classmates' written work, which is presented at each class meeting. This is the first class at Yale from which I have left feeling like a part of a community. I truly hope that this is offered again for the benefit of future students.",
    "I would definitely reccomend it.",
    "CSPC 340 is a class that forces self-reflection and encourages personal growth. I would only recommend this class to a person interested in either of those outcomes. This class does not seem to be designed for a student who is just \"passing through\" for the sake of a letter grade. It is made for a person who truly wants to understand themselves and the transition into adulthood more concretely.",
    "It was a great course and I wish that all Yale College students had an opportunity to take something like this. In the middle of our early adulthood transition, we need to have time to stop and think about our own lives, why things are changing the way they are, what is influencing our lives and how we will be in a couple of years. Our busy schedules never allow such reflections. With this class, however, I saw myself forced to think about my own paths to where I am today and about the ones I will take from now on. Better yet, I learned some principles in psychology that explain why I feel the way I feel and why I act the way I act. It was amazing! Professor Berg is a very approachable person, and his experience guided the class. He achieved good balance between explaining things and letting us talk and discuss among ourselves. I had never gotten to know my classmates in a seminar as I did in this class. This class is how much work you want to put into it, how much of the reading you want to do and how much you want to write for your weekly reflections. But don't be fooled, it's not a gut. I usually found myself saying: oh, I'll write one to two pages double-spaced this week and ended up writing almost 2 pages single-spaced every time. I wrote a lot and spent a reasonable time with the class. But in return, I learned a lot from analyzing my own life too. Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE",
    "Take this course! IT IS A MUST TAKE IF YOU GET IN! The course will help you figure out which questions to ask yourself and others, how to engage meaningfully with the \"other\" in your life, and how to relate more productively to the thoughts that cause you anxiety and discontent. Best class I've had at Yale.",
    "Take this course if you can. It is an amazing course and gives you insight into a lot of your relationships. Professor Berg is a wonderful teacher, and the activities were always engaging and thought-provoking. There was never a day where I wasn't excited to go to class.",
    "CSPC340 was a good class, primarily because of how perceptive and insightful Professor Berg was. From studying his observations and analysis, I found myself becoming more capable at untangling my (and others) reactions and feelings by identifying ambivalent biases and insecurities. I would recommend this class if you hope to improve your self-analytic ability and are comfortable sharing personal reflections and reactions with others."
