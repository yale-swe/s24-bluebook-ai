    "A continuation of L1, you should know what that means if your reading this.",

    "This course is very good. It is good for learning the Italian language and culture, but at the same time is not too stressful.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it with Professoressa Iacovella - she is the greatest.",
    "Definitely continue with Italian 120 if you've already taken L1. It's not a very stressful class, and you learn a lot about Italian culture even though it's only L2.",
    "Yes, it is a great, but challenging,class that really improves your skills. You finish all of the grammar in the italian language and also learn about cultural and political topics such as immigration."
