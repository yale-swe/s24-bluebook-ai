    "The class is an in depth review of the theoretical principles that guide the study and an excellent overview of case studies.",
    "A great opportunity to learn about pre-industrial crafts in ancient societies and the different social and political implications of these processes.",
    "A great introduction to issues surrounding craft specialization. I highly recommend this course, even to an archaeologist that doesn't think craft specialization directly applies to their research. Any material culture analysis ultimately must consider questions of production, and specialization."

   "comments": [
    "Yes the course has made me think of differnt ideas that aid in our understanding of social development. This will be widely applicable to my studies and future work.",
    "It is very useful because I had the chance to review theory and data about craft specialization around the world. I gave the opportunity to crosscheck the information of my study region with other realities and current perspective from a theoretical and empiric perspective.",
    "It gave me a whole set of new questions to think about and a familiarity with a number of important resources and references."
