    "I would definitely recommend it! It's such an overlooked issue in the world today.",
    "Very good class. Good to be informed on an important topic.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you can get in. It's such an interesting class, and so important to learn about. Also, Dean B is the nicest, best professor ever.",
    "Definitely take it. The workload is reasonable and the readings are really interesting. She picks a really strong group of students so class discussions are great. Take it.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Genocide and Ethnic Conflict is a wonderful class. I looked forward to attending it each week. Dean B does a great job of creating a good balance of reading, discussion, and movie screening. The course is run in an excellent seminar style \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the majority of the class is based around discussion (and Dean B carefully picks a group with a variety of perspectives and experiences), but when a student has a specific question, Dean B lectures briefly and wonderfully. The course has many, many strengths ranging from the very interesting material to the interesting guest speakers to having the pleasure of spending time with the magnificent Dean B once a week.Dean B is amazing. That really says it all. She cares so much about her students, and she does a wonderful job of teaching a difficult subject. She is very understanding and flexible, and she really wants her students to get the most out of the course. Dean B is easily one of the best professors and people I have encountered at Yale. Her personal story is fascinating, and she is an expert on the course material because she has so much direct experience with the subject. I wish I could take ten more courses with Dean B, and I really wish she were my Dean. Dean B\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teaching style is a perfect example of how more Yale professors should want to go about their careers. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interest in the material.",
    "Hard to get in but one of the best courses I've taken at Yale so definitely worth a shot.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in! While the topic may be a little heavy, Dean B manages to keep it from getting too depressing in class. The discussions were great, the readings were very interesting, and the workload was very manageable.",
    "I recommend this class to all Yale students.",
    "TAKE IT. it's amazing."
