    "I learned the history of colonization and state building in the middle east and north africa, as well as theoretical frameworks used by social scientists to study these regions. Additionally, I deepened my knowledge of how the history of states in the region might be useful in explaining modern political trends.",
    "history and socio political knowledge of ME",
    "Alternate ways of thinking about political order beyond state-centrism, and maintaining a non-involved perspective, though we did discuss the ways in which \"involved-ness\" influences our analysis and categorizations.",
    "I have gained a crucial new perspective towards the middle east that I intend to use in the future.",
    "Middle East and historic background approaches",
    "I am able to analyze current political issues from a sociological standpoint and see issues as more multifaceted. I improved my reading and analysis skills as well as how to contribute in a seminar class."

   "comments": [
    "Loved that I got a better historical and sociological understanding. I thought the course could have benefited from a class covering the state and society under post-colonial authoritarianism.",
    "This was a good course. I enjoyed the readings, the assignments, and also the types of questions we were asking. Because there was so much background information, I wish professor Wyrtzen had prepared longer more formal lectures and spoken for about half the class. I think hearing him speak more would have been really helpful to put the material in context. However, the class was great and we had more discussion time because he did less of a formal intro, so that was also useful.",
    "good reading list, better discussions",
    "Strengths: Prof. Wyrtzen and Luke make a great team, great readings, great conversations Weaknesses: in the beginning of the term, Prof. Wyrtzen used a couple of classes to lecture, which I think was helpful to many who don't have a background in the middle east but it sometimes felt a bit long.",
    "I think the class was very engaging and structure was very well organized. I think increasing the amount of time we spent on the different sociology lens would have aided the course overall."

   "comments": [
    "Wyrtzen is really cool, if sometimes a little scattered. Definitely helps to have Middle East background knowledge coming in",
    "I would recommend this to another student, especially one who has background in the region. This might not be a great introduction to the region, but after having taken an intro course and with a region you are interested in exploring it could be really useful.",
    "It was OK, probably some better courses on the middle east at yale",
    "Yes - an important course in terms of area studies, but also with a strong undercurrent of meta-analysis that is critical for any social scientist.",
    "I would definitely recommended if you are considering doing any kind of work that requires real engagement with the middle east. It gives you a very important sociological perspective to the region, one that is not necessarily given by security or poli sci classes.",
    "Yes! I loved the class overall, it gave great historical context to the region as well as helped me analyze current policy issues."
