    "If you're going to take Ichthyology, you should DEFINITELY take lab with it! We actually had time to go through all the major groups of fishes, which we didn't have time for in class. Perks included a field trip to catch local fishes in the West River, a peek at a coelocanth, and the chance to improve either your fish illustration or fish photography skills.",
    "If you like fish take it. You get to do some field work, but be prepared to study a lot for the final. Otherwise, the class is not too much work.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "This was my favorite lab at Yale by far. I am a bio major and have taken tedious and unnecessarily long MCDB labs. This lab rocked. We really got to learn about the lecture material hands-on in a fun and relaxed setting. The lab is mostly based around looking at and identifying preserved fish. There are weekly quizzes that are very fair. The only other grade is the lab practical, which requires memorization, but is very fair. But at the end of the course you really do know a ton about fish!",
    "I would recommend the lab in a second. Although it is a pain to memorize all the fish for the lab practical the rest of the semester is relatively easy and a really fun addition to the lecture. I can not imagine taking the lecture without the lab and would highly recommend that one takes it.",
    "Ichthyology Lab was definitely the best class I have taken at Yale. The TAs who teach the course (Prof. Near is not involved at all, although he is listed as the professor for the course), Christen and Alex, are both amazing teachers. They're nice and they're incredibly helpful, knowledgable, and passionate about fish! Alex baked cookies for us at the final!The class has a very relaxed atmosphere. Half of each class is devoted to concepts about fish (external morphology, internal morphology, bones, meristics, feeding& locomotion), while the other half of the class is devoted to learning the morphological characteristics of specific fish by looking at preserved specimens. There's a quiz on the concepts each week, and then the final consists of identifying the fish that we learned over the course of the year.I think that everyone taking the Ichthyology lecture should take Ichthyology Lab, as I think the lab allows you to understand lecture much better, especially since the lecture doesn't cover many aspects of fish. For example, you don't learn external morphology in lecture until the middle of the year, and I felt I understand the beginning Ichthyology lectures much better knowing what fins were what and such. Also, Ichthyology lecture spends like 1 1\/2 lectures on the Acanthopterygii, which comprise like half of all fish species. Lab, on the other hand, spends about 5 weeks on them, so you'll be much more familiar with the most derived and most interesting clade of fish. So if you want to learn about interesting fish like lionfishes, seahorses, ocean sunfishes, boxfishes, porcupinefishes, flounders, and tunas, you'll only learn about them by taking the lab. You get to look at and feel lots ofreally cool, weird fish (plus we got to see a special, historic coelacanth) in this class, which is really cool.There were several field trips, though some were canceled. We ended up going trawling off the coast of Stratford, and seining in the West River and a nearby lake. These field trips were lots of fun, and educational about how to go about collecting fish.Take the class!",
    "This is by far the most fun lab credit I have ever taken at Yale. If you have any interest in fish, you should take this class."
