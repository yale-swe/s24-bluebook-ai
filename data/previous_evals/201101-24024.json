    "Tina Manis not listed in feedback selection.",
    "(My section critic was Tina Manis. Her name does not appear on the pull-down menu above. I cannot submit my responses without selecting a critic, so I selected Alan Organasci, who was not my critic.)I was generally satisfied. My critic was an encouraging person to work with. I wish we had had more group pin-ups.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0My section critic was Tina Manis.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Alan is very receptive and encouraging. Definitely one of the best studio critics I've had.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Over all in the organization of the semester I think that the first project was an interesting one but that I also wished I could have explored the other two sub topics as well. Given the time I understand that that is not possible, but if there was some way to work this out it might be useful. Also I think that there were some problems with the set up of the assignment, for example light not being given the business card that they needed to work with on the project until very late or not at all, and for sound only a few people in studio having an iphone they could test with. People who had the iphone became aggravated with having to lend it all the time and the third years hated having the listen to it going off. Maybe the light box could be to light an object of your choice and sound to isolate the worst noise at the highest volume on your phone.The mini project that we did in the middle of the hostel project was frustrating. I found that the constraints didn\u0092t well suit what I had set out to do and the disrupted my ability to work out what I really wanted to explore with the project. I understand the intent of the assignment but I felt it forced a specific solution that was not always applicable to our projects. I guess it just made sense for some people projects more than others but for those people it didn\u0092t help it just slowed the project down. I also think that is dictated a solution about the rooms and the practice rooms pushing into each other which I don\u0092t think is really the only solution or necessarily the most interesting. It felt a bit as if Alan had a type of solution in mind and was pushing us all in that direction rather than letting us explore more to find the angle of the project that interested us. I came to him with a couple of ideas which he called \u0093not architecturally generative.\u0094 This comment, given thought enough explanation, was stifling and though I asked for clarification I never felt he gave me a satisfactory answer or example. Also, towards the end I came back to some of these ideas to and really did inform my project.Overall as a teacher I enjoyed Alan\u0092s enthusiasm and dedication to us but found that in the second project he didn\u0092t give us enough time\/guidance with the set up of assignments to get our bearings before moving on. I also felt I had to ask a lot of questions to get him to explain what he meant.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0The heat sound light project had merit, however it didn't require two weeks of exploration to apprehend its point about materials properties and environmental factors. Moreover, limiting the materials palette exclusively to chipboard was ultimately self-defeating. It constrained the project to geometric and formal logics when dealing with environmental factors is often driven by material considerations. As a result the project felt more like a science experiment then an architectural investigation.The Hostel project was good, though the required representation at the final review were needlessly if not limiting. Requiring a half inch model, a quarter inch model, and a panoply of plans, sections, and other drawings, made for thoughtless and perfunctory models or drawings at the review. Some projects are planometric, others are more sectional, some show well in half inch models, others in quarter. A blanket requirement made all the hostels seem like cookie cutter designs. For some projects it would have made sense to push one drawing, a great illustrated section or a really well crafted quarter inch model and let the others fall away.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Alan was great. He obviously knew what he wanted to see from each student, and encouraged exploration in a particular area. I enjoyed how straightforward he was when he felt certain approaches or techniques were not being effective. He mastered articulating weakness, almost to a fault - so that I always knew what was not working, but lacked clarity on how to proceed. I always trusted that hewas giving me the advice I needed because I saw it in his own practice and his own work. He really opened my eye to a new way of thinking about space, particularly in the nesting or co-hab nature of the second project. He really worked with me through a number of iterations so that I understood many approaches. This was very helpful for me. I think Alan was a very good fit for me, and I learned what I wanted to learn this semester - an deep understanding of details, materiality and the role of these things relative to the entire function of the design proposition.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0I greatly enjoyed working with Alan. He was able to push, but still leave room for exploration.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0I was very happy with Andrew's teaching, he provided consistently clear and helpful feedback. However, I would have appreciated a more directed approach and more pressure to adopt a position early in the projects.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew Benner's comments were always helpful and insightful, sometimes almost too much of the latter such that I felt inadequate (and I mean that as a major compliment to Andrew)! I really appreciate that Andrew never prescribed specific design solutions or ideas and instead planted seeds for me to resolve myself. Though it is at times frustrating to rarely get a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, this process absolutely made me think critically and also made me much more invested in the projects as my own work.I definitely felt that Andrew never had any design agenda when he commented on my work, and in retrospect I think I recognize his feedback as part of a longer marathon--that is, my entire career at YSOA and beyond--rather than about specific projects along the way. Surely the lessons I take from this studio will serve me long after this semester.Andrew is a great critic.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew Benner was really helpful in our first several projects at the beginning of the semester. They were relatively enjoyable designs and I felt that my design sense grew as a result of the excersizes. My issue was rather with the critics of the building project. The problem with building project this year was that all of the critics, the course lead professor as well as the clientpushed BORING architectural ideas. The mundane was encouraged rather than exploration of the new ideas that we are supposed to be coming up with since we are at one of the best institutions of architecture in the world.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Had a wonderful semester, the only comment that i would make would be to be more vocal during student reviews and be more forceful about directing comments in a productive direction.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0I wish Andrew were a little more firm in his criticism, I often felt a little lost as to what he expected out of me.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew provided excellent guidance and thoughtful criticism throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer was available most of the times and she tried to offer to offer feedback on any occasion, even outside studio. Despite her efforts, however, she had trouble communicating her ideas in relationship to specific projects. Although she showed the ability to identify problematic projects, she seemed lack the ability to identify what the critical problem actually is. Most of the time,her advice didn't help solve issues within the project, nor did it provide a direction for future exploration. In addition, it seems that Jennifer's thinking is often based on architectural tropes, her showing a strong preference for already tested, safe ideas or concepts.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer is a very well versed critic with competence in both the practical aspects of architecture as well as the conceptual ones. Jennifer is very good at making her students feel respected in their opinions which she takes seriously. However, Jennifer can at times be ambiguous in her individual criticism allowing the student to come to their own conclusions about the quality of their projects. This can be helpful and can build confidence in the right students but can also leave one feeling uncertain about their direction and skeptical of their overall standing.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0I sometimes found it difficult to understand the feedback and I felt there was a lack of forwardness.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb was responsive and dedicated to spending time with students. His criticism was always productive and helpful, although sometimes abstract and hard to understand or apply directly to my project.Often his criticism was very helpful, but his tone could be condescending and off-putting. It seemed like he had preconceived notions about each of us from the first day of studio, and then was unwilling to allow our performance or interest to sway the impressions he had about us. This was often frustrating, but ultimately I think he is a good critic with lots of knowledge and inspiration to give his students.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0J. Moore is very knowledgeable and puts forth a great effort to encourage students, however, his patronizing attitude can very off-putting and counterproductive. While a great educator, architect, and human at heart, J. Moore can use some work on his interpersonal kills.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb is a very sharp critic and I feel very fortunate to have had him. That being said, I have a couple suggestions for improvement.Joeb should try to be less proscriptive about students projects--presenting students with options on where to take their projects. Rather than simply saying \"this is exactly what you should do,\" he might try saying \"you could approach the problem like this, or like that, or like that...\"On a different note, many students found him to be rude and unprofessional. Asking students in reviews if they had architecture backgrounds or not is not a good idea. Neither is talking about how poorly some students are doing in front of others. Joeb could improve his credibility as a teacher by taking a more professional tone in relation to students' work.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb was an extremely informative and involved critic who made himself available to students at any time. I really learned a lot from him. My only quibble is that he does not always listen to what students have to say and even during reviews will speak for the students.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb is an extremely skilled critic. He is able to provide clear criticism and direction on student work, as well as help students develop the concepts behind their work. However, this skill has its drawbacks; his criticisms are perhaps too easily assimilated by students. At times, a slight over involvement on his behalf may hinder students ability to discover their own solutions to design projects. Overall, it was a pleasure to work with Joeb.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb was an excellent critic. His knowledge and understanding of the discipline of architecture is particularly remarkable, specifically in relation to representation and graphics. He challenged me to question my work while demanding a high level achievement in the quality of the work itself.However, there are two issues that would improve the quality of his teaching, both pertaining to communication. It is often difficult to understand the intention of his comments as they sometimes come across vague and unclear. I think a certain level of clarity would be achieved if Joeb would spend more time listening to students instead of talking.Additionally, his conversational tone was often demeaning and blatantly sexist. He should not share personal opinions about the quality of students' works with other students. He makes his \"favorites\" known to all of the students, which creates an unhealthy studio environment amongst peers.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb was always very encouraging and motivating.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0I appreciated Trattie\u0092s positive and encouraging approach over the course of the semester. She was able to tailor the discussions to the project and the student\u0092s design intentions, and seemed to truly care for her students\u0092 design development.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie Davies was wonderful. She was able to communicate to me spatial ideas without the academic jargon that makes architectural concepts difficult to understand as a student. She was also confident enough to tell me what to do when I was lost and in need of direction. Other critics seem to shy away from this kind of instruction for fear of mis-instruction or over-influence, but Trattie has the confidence to offer her own sensibility to a project.She was also willing to help guide me through the educational process of graduate school with no hesitation to meet me outside of studio to offer feedback. Through her thoughtful evaluations and insight I feel I learned n enormous amount this semester. I had no previous architectural background and am much better equipped to critically address spatial problems than I was in January thanks to Trattie.I hope that Trattie becomes a fixture in the school as she is a boon to any institution.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie was always encouraging of my work if at times unable to get me to produce exactly the right thing. While my concept was hard to define, I appreciated her effort to work with me on nebulous ground. I also appreciated that she did not require students to work in a specific way, but instead was receptive to each unique process and methods of production. That said,it would have been helpful to have been reigned in a little instead of spending so much time exploring.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Katherine Davies was extremely receptive and sensitive to one's manner of generating ideas and work flow. She was helpful in providing guidance and in opening up further paths of exploration for any conceptual interest.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie embraces individuality and encourage us to explore things that each of the student is interested in. She respects our own way of working but constantly tries to push us design in models and hand sketches. She emphasized on space making and experiences, a departure from many of the form driven critics from last semester. There are times when she doesn't seem to remember our project from previous desk crits. Sometimes she seems to have a lot on her mind.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Professor de Bretteville was a frustrating critic. Although he is fascinating to talk to about architecture in the abstract and is clearly very knowledgeable, it is difficult to get any concrete feedback about a project. He was not very available or organized, letting us know at the last minute that he wouldn't be at desk crits, or rescheduling for odd hours and last minute desk crits that oftenled to hurried discussions or an inability to meet with him at all. When we did meet, he seemed more interested in discussing other students and architects than the project in question. When he did talk about projects, there was rarely constructive criticism. Although having a hands-off critic was nice in that you could guide your own work and discover what and how you wanted to, it was frustrating not to be able to get real feedback when you did want it. He is also very set in a particular aesthetic or mode of viewing architecture. In final reviews he seemed to place value judgements on projects and would state how he would have done things differently or was disappointed by something. While it is totally fair to both have a point of view and to be critical, it was frustrating that none of these things were communicated at any point during desk crits, and instead all real criticism seemed to happen at final reviews.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0An excellent critic!",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter de Bretville was an excellent conversationalist who, while occasionally provided insights into design methodologies and ideas through anecdotal narratives, a lot of the time, these were only very tangential to the problem at hand.If you came prepared with an idea, it would often get critiqued adequately in very pragmatic terms, but with there would rarely be any sort of push in a direction for development conceptually. This lead to more or less resolved projects with very little design interest and sometimes glaring issues as they were simply not brought up during critique sessions.Ultimately, I found that I often ended up having to resort to asking other critics and developing much of the project myself without strong critical guidance in terms of design process. While it led to projects, they are probably my worst projects, and while I appreciate a Socratic method of instruction and freedom, the lack of any strong or even hint of direction for someone who is still new to developing design sensibilities is more of a handicap than a benefit.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter de Bretteville does not have a great reputation amongst most of the second and third year students here. After having him as a critic, I can see why, but I would entirely disagree with their assessment. Most studio critics here are very explicit -- in lieu of encouraging personal exploration, the studios function more like an office where the critic gives deadlines for each meeting and a slew of deliverables to be presented. Peter does not do this. In fact, you could go through an entire semester without building one model for him. It would be your own fault though. In Peter de Bretteville's studio, he allows you to develop crazy ideas and he never turns a student away from what they want to study. He fosters an environment where students are free to wander away on tangents. I think this is essential for this sort of degree program. In exchange for the free flowing environment he creates, the student must take on the responsibility of producing work even if it has not been assigned and no deadlines are established. I think this is reasonable. I came to every desk crit with updated models and drawings, and I think that it was incredibly productive. Others came with their ideas, and Peter never turned their ideas down--so at the end when their final crits did not go as they thought they would, they blamed Peter for not being more critical. It is their own fault though. As students we should take more responsibility for our educations. Peter is a fine critic, he just treats us like the adults we are.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter was very enthusiastic in our desk crits. He has a wealth of knowledge in architectural history and contemporary design, which helped me become more critically reflective of my work. Sometimes Peter wasn't critical enough of my work, so my designs would temporarily stagnate. The pace of his studio was not overly rigorous, but I believe it progressed very evenly and appropriately for how I design. Overall, I enjoyed the semester very much under Peter, and I think the scale of the design projects played well to his strengths.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter was a wonderful influence on my design. He seemed to internalize my process and his excitement of that was very motivating.",
    "Instructor: Tina Manis \u00a0Tina was a fabulous critic to have for second semester--she was both demanding and understanding. After all discussions I was left with the impression that she had really listened and engaged, never handing out canned responses. Her honesty was a breath of fresh air for the studio environment. I would highly recommend her for a future position as a critic at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Tina Manis \u00a0Overall I enjoyed having Tina as a studio critic. The following are minor points, made in the spirit of constructive criticism:>>Tended to fade down the stretch, during studio time; was noticeably more engaged during earlier meeting times.>>Individual exit interviews would have been nice.",
    "Instructor: Tina Manis \u00a0I learned an incredible amount from Tina. She is was very good at pushing me out of my comfort zone and helping me to clarify what my ideas were about. She is a very enthusiastic professor who gets involved in her students work and encourages them to learn from each other and from outside materials she suggests, and seems to tailor her teaching style to the specifics of the student and the project, which is very helpful. Additionally, we had a unusually high number of family emergencies in our studio and Tina was able to handle these very well, being supportive and understanding of the students but also encouraging them to finish their work to the best of their ability. I learned a lot from her and I am a little sad that she was only my professor for half of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "The first assignment is stupid. And not related to the next one or the building project.",
    "As a first year student I was expecting to have more design oriented exercises. However the overall approach through the entire semester was geared towards a predetermined idea of the building project. I was highly disappointed.",
    "The hostel project was well-timed in our education, and provided a scale and level of complexity that allowed us to really engage with the problems it presented in a thorough way.The first project was less engaging, and, although I'm pleased with the final result of my process, I don't think it was a valuable three week exercise. Much more valuable would have been an investiagtion of dwelling (similar to the project done in previous years where two people have to occupy one 10'x10' cube) in preparation for the building project house design.",
    "The expectations were very high and rigid in relation to the overall organization of the studio and to the ambiguity of advice provided by the critic.",
    "I expected to be ableto advance my graphic and computer skills and to begin to engage with the critical issues surrounding the typology of dwelling. Though we were encouraged to engage with phenomenological issues throughout the semester, i found there was less emphasis on conceptual clarity and rigourous analysis which i found to be a weakness of the studio.",
    "My expectations for the studio were extremely high given previous years work, but they failed to meet expectations. The first project was very confined and uninteresting. The Hostel project was good, but could have been helped more witha stronger concentration to a thoughtfully crafted intersection, such as the 16x16x16 project from last year.",
    "I had hoped that the studio course just prior to the Building Project would have tackled issues of constructability and livability; however, these issues seem to have given way to more conceptual agendas and abstract architectural concepts that were never linked to the realities of building. In particular, the first assignment seems to have been a typical first-year undergraduate project, and issues of sound\/light\/heat that the project raised were limited to the experience of an i-Phone and block of ice, not the possible real-world repercussions of the experiments conducted.",
    "My expectations were to be pushed in the pragmatic aspects of construction in preparation for Building Project. These expectations were met.",
    "I wanted to learn a lot and work hard. My expectations were met.",
    "I felt a bit confused on the design expectations for the semester. On the one hand, there seemed to be a desired emphasis on constructability and building components (the wall section requirement, the conceptual thrust of the first assignment), but there was not enough time to explore these topics in-depth, nor was critical feedback in those directions. I actually prefer a more conceptual design studio, but tooka little while to realize that I did not have to be designing a buildable proposal in 6 weeks.",
    "See above",
    "I expected longer projects, which aside from the first warm-up exercise, was more or less satisfactory in terms of length. This served as a good transition to longer semester-length projects in the coming semesters.In terms of material, the program and scale was interesting enough.",
    "After first semester, I suppose I expected the studio to function mostly the same as it had before. There were some things that fell below my expectations though. I would like to comment on the studio coordinator, Alan Organschi. As compared to Ben Pell, Alan Organschi was very disorganized. We would here of deadlines and schedules the night before something was happening -- even sometimes hours before something was happening. I also disliked his approach to the final review. Ben Pell had every other critic invite jurors to the reviews. I imagine if you had a critic who took the studio in an alternate direction, that this made the final review less of Ben Pell\u0092s personal mission and more productive. The way Alan framed the studio to the jurors was pushinghis own mission for the project. On top of that, my jury in particular was stacked with people Alan had invited who also shared this idea.(The idea that Alan pushed his students to develop was the notion that by throwing program together and negotiating their intersections, that the space was inherently richer. I disagree, and pursued a clearer scheme where distance provided the necessary buffer between program. The jury acted like I had ignored the \u0093point\u0094 of the studio, as Alan had presented it. I resent the fact that there is one \u0093right\u0094 answer pushed by the studio coordinator. He was too political. He pretended to be neutral, but was very calculated and political.)My expectation for the studio was that we would create a nice place for humans to occupy, not a clusterfuck of space where humans climb through tunnels, music rooms pop out of the building \u0096 a formal study of \u0093crazy\u0094 space. Not that I think students should be discouraged from this sort of design if they wished. As Dean Stern said in Makram\u0092s midreview --Why can\u0092t you just design a nice ____? Why do you have to intersect the primary program with another completely foreign program?",
    "The educational value of the first project \"heat,light,sound\" is debatable. Perhaps this project should be rethought for next year. The hostel project was interesting, yet produced a great deal of very similar design solutions. Perhaps some of the zoning regulations are too restrictive and could be loosened up.",
    "I was not sure what to expect from this studio. I gained confidence in working in plan and sections, as well as dealing with studio prompts that felt more grounded in reality than last semester. I think it would be more productive to do several short (3-Day to 1-Week) exercises dealing with an abbreviated, but human program (I.E. not ice cubes) prior to the hostel project. I know one studio section spent a week or so working on a module that defined their hostel project. That exercise would have been beneficial for me.",
    "I wish I has been pushed a little farther to explore new modes of representation. I felt that my final presentation could have been more interesting with more substantial criticism about how to represent my work.",
    "Each studio is different and therefore hard to predict. The condensed format with only two projects made it difficult to get into any sort of a rhythm, and the projects were overly prescriptive. It was difficult to tell how much of the prompt to follow or ignore and as a result I felt my work was too restrained.",
    "I had really high expectations this semester. I felt that I would be designing things that I liked, and would have a better understanding on how to approach them. Instead, I was fed a wide variety of advice that was not consistent with the direction I was working towards. I was always certain what did not work according to my critic, but often left a bit baffled on how to proceed. Thus, I would dive into one extreme interpretation of what my critic wanted, to find out that it only tangentially related to what was expected. I often felt at a loss of progress and understanding. I should have trusted myself more this semester rather than invest too much confidence in my critic to lead the way. Lesson learned.",
    "I expected the prompts to be challenged more critically through our designs. Looking across the studio, especially regarding the second project, everyone's design looked almost identical. I also expected more critical feedback regarding my design process and not simply feedback on my projects. In general I expected a more liberated environment for exploration and found the focus on a checklist of deliverables rather limiting.",
    "Above all, I expected a better level of organization from the studio coordinator. Information and assignments were often sent out at the very last minute, without any notice.",
    "Second semester studio is too condensed due to its tight schedule. The first project is a total backward step from the basis we established by the end of first semester. It is just not vey architectural; many of us ended up with a high school science project, which is hard to be critical at architecturally. The second project would be helpful if it were longer. Admittedly it is the most legitimate and meaningful studio assignment that we have received so far.",
    "My expectations were usually met except that I was often unclear how I was doing during the studio.",
    "This course had less continuity with the first semester than I might have liked. The introductory exercise was quite interesting and enjoyable, but didn't seem to have much in common with the content that followed. Additionally, if the individual designs for BP are to be included in student portfolios as a significant piece of work for the semester, they should be better emphasized during the course.",
    "I didn't have too many expectations going in to this semester, however I was expecting a certain level of freedom or perhaps less child-like treatment. The \"freedom to explore\" granted us in the first project felt both demeaning and frustrating. In the end, the first project was more a cause of embarrassment than an in-depth study of either heat, sound, or light.",
    "I wish the second project (hostel for musicians) were more conceptual and less concerned with restrictions and zoning laws. If the aim was to prepare us for BP, then it wasn\u0092t as successful.Also, I believe the first project (light, music, heat) was not very interesting.",
    "I didn't really have many specific expectations coming in. I enjoyed the studio and learned a lot. The studio well met my general expectations for a studio course."

    "The Library lending period is too short nor does it have enough copies of key texts that are often used by students. Relative to other comparable institutions, the Arts library falls very short.",
    "The library is always a pain. I will say it again: they are not interested in learning. If they were, they would allow you to take a book out more than 24 hours, and they would have longer hours, and they would not shut down their scanners 15 minutes prior to closing, and they would have a nicer attitude towards students, and you could check out more than one book at a time. I would also like to complain about our TA. I think that this class could use two TA's and I think that they should force Alan to be more organized. As it was, Oz was not very computer savvy, so she was not qualified to handle all of the computer submissions and general tech TA duties. She may have been a favorite of last year's class, but I think that TA's should be held to a standard for the amount of money they make. Of get two if it is too much work for one TA. She did not help the chaotic atmosphere of this studio.",

    "In general, the school's facilities are adequate. However, the library's hours during finals week are unacceptable. The fact that the library closes at 5PM on a Friday during finals is absurd. This closing hour is understandable during the regular academic term, but entirely unacceptable during finals.",

I also found the heat\/sound\/light project to be incredibly frustrating (especially the sound part, as everyone in the building was forced to listen to the same ringing over and over again) and thought it should have been shorter.",
    "Yes. Except, for readings, can a course reader be made available? Or can the V2 resources be more consistent?"

   "comments": [
    "Could have more group pin ups. I like to see the work of others- not just individual desk crits.",
    "Outside experts, especially SOM people and the workshops they have provided were the least valuable aspect of the studio.One on one time with the instructor and small pin-ups amongst our section were the most valuable.",
    "The desk-crits with Joeb were the most valuable part of the studio because Joeb was easy to engage with and get productive feed-back from one-on-one.The SOM lectures and workshops were the least valuable aspect, with the exception of the presentation lecture (which was helpful and engaging).",
    "Pin-ups and workshops were generally very helpful.",
    "I was largely disappointed with reviews at the end of the semester. I found the organization of review day to lead to a rather rushed and hectic experience for all involved, and this affected the quality of feedback, particulalry for those presenting later in the day.",
    "I often prefer pinups over desk critics because (a) the quality of work is generally higher and (b) it permits students to think critically not only about our own work but about that of our peers, as well. Sometimes seeing how someone else is grappling with the same design problem can sponsor ideas of our own.",
    "I found the mini pin-ups, with 2-3 students, to be the most useful, as they encouraged a certain level of completion for the work prepared, and allowed students to respond to the feedback of their peers and their critic.",
    "I really enjoyed the hostel project, both in terms of the overall scale and specifically awesome site, but I think the sound\/light\/heat project should be replaced with something else. I like the 1:1 scale of it and the mediation between the body and environment, but the whole thing is just too gimicky.",
    "Small group pin-ups are always the best.",
    "The most valuable aspect of this studio were the juries who were very blunt and vicious. This can be a good thing, sort of a \"school of hard knocks\" attitude that gets one to criticize their process quickly.",
    "I feel that everything had value.",
    "The first exercise was kind of irritating - particularly for those with an undergraduate background in architecture. I think that a more in-depth and analytic approach to exploring issues of sound, light, and temperature would be much more valuable than the 'see what you can come up with' approach -- most of the projects would've benefited from research and information that the coordinator could've made available to the students, who often didn't have the extra time to do all the leg-work independently.I appreciated the pace and scope of the second project - seemed just about right",
    "Pin ups in smaller groups were good and desk crits were good but might have been better if we did two at a time. I wish we had done more in depth site analysis and precedent studies as a group.",
    "Aside from more practice in the studio, I did not find much value in the two projects. The first one was slightly absurd as the limits for the size of light aperture for the light project was too restrictive to create any interesting lighting effects without breaking the rules, the sound projects did not really do that much to alter the variable tone of the sound-emitting device, and the ice projects mostly just sat to get soggy and wet.The second project was much better as it forced us to think of how to pack a bunch of program with very strict requirements onto a very peculiar site. Whilethis was a great exercise in planning, I felt that my project ended up being conceptually null for reasons stated above.",
    "Most valuable: desk crits with Peter and the mock pinup we did before the final review with Peter.Least valuable: The first project. It was a total waste of time, and any honest student will tell you that it did nothing to inform the hostel project.",
    "It would have been nice to have more class discussions. Although I valued my desk-crits with my critic, I think it would have been valuable to discuss some of the course readings as a section.",
    "Individual meetings are by far the most productive. I do support the occasional small group pinup. Building project is great because you work with so many critics at the same time. It might be useful to once or twice a semester have the critics do individual desk crits with a different instructor.",
    "Pinups and desk crits both very valuable. For the hostel project the 3 person group pinups were particularly helpful.",
    "I would recommend either shortening (down to one week) or completely eliminating the first project (light, sound, heat) and instead extending the time frame of the second project (hostel). I think this would allow students to develop the second project further via an extended exploration of something like \"co-hab\" or another small scale intro to the project that is similar in scale to the first project but more readily relatable to the hostel project.",
    "The desk crits\/individual pinups were good, there was an implied formality to meeting in the 4th floor pit that was productive in pushing work forward. Though on occasion, and especially at the outset of the studio, I would have found it easier to establish a working relationship if meetings could have taken place in a smaller more private setting. If not a desk, then some other pinup space in the building.",
    "The small group pin ups we did were really helpful. While it was difficult to stop designing and produce so that I had something to present, it was also a good way to see what others are working on and get student feedback in addition to the critics. The first project (sound\/light\/heat) was a really bizarre project and I didn't get much out of the exercise.",
    "I found the reviews most valuable because of the variety of feedback and the clarity. Michelle Addington was also a key part of the studio, but I wish she could have been more involved.",
    "We almost exclusively had desk crits in our studio, which were valuable, but I wish we had had more group pin-ups. I was very unfamiliar with my classmates' projects.",
    "I found that desk crits with our section critic were the most helpful as well as our small group (3 person) pin-ups. The rotation of desk crits with pin ups were appropriate for each step in the process of the studio projects.",
    "What I found really helpful last semester that is missing this semester are lectures given by each critic. Last semester even though each of us only had one studio critic, we actually got to know the others. Based on the understanding of what kind of work they did and what they believed in, we were given to freedom to approach them when we needed to. This semester it felt as if each of us is confined to our own group. We know the other critics by their names but not their work.",
    "Desk-crits were the most valuable part of the studio and the all studio meetings and lectures were the least valuable.",
    "Desk-crits have always been most valuable to me, the one-on-one advice with a trusted critic being ideal. Overall the least valuable aspect of studio was the first project in total, the final jury for which seemed a waste of time and simply a pedagogical hoop to jump through rather than anything illuminating.",
    "More time could have been spent on a single project rather than dividing the first half of the semester into two projects.",
    "The workshops were very valuable; it's wonderful to interact with\/listen to professionals from other fields. The first project was enjoyable, but a bit odd--which is not necessarily a bad thing. The Hostel project was educational and enjoyable."
