    "Jon Andrews and my classmates are definite strengths of the class. I look forward to spending four hours with them every week. Jon is clearly committed to his students and knowledgeable about putting together small independent productions. He effectively communicates this knowledge. He and my classmates have killer senses of humor. Weaknesses? A window would be nice in the classroom--some natural light + vitamin d. More field trips would also be nice.",
    "Strengths: Complete creative control, John Andrews as a Prof, Developing ideas week by week. Weaknesses: As the course develops, I found myself only there to hear the feedback I was being given on my own project and the other three hours of listening to criticisms of other students project felt like largely to be a waste of time. It would seem to make sense to have the course only be an hour long where general knowledge could be imparted with individual 30 minute meetings for more specific feedback. I know that in general it is good to learn from others mistakes and such, but part of it seems like a waste of time, especially because the class is so long."

    "If you want to make a thesis short film it's the only way to go. Jon Andrews is a really good instructor and will give you tons of personal feedback. Meetings are long and can be tedious, but if you suggest ideas to Andrews on how best to spend class time, he is usually quite receptive."
