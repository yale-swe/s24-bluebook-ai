    "AFAM 160 is a general introduction to the atlantic world, the development of slavery, and its decline\/abolition. The first half of the class focuses on slavery while the second half focuses on abolition as the name suggests.Students learn how things in various parts of the Atlantic world shaped slavery and abolition. The class focuses more than just on US slavery. The class discussed the Haitian revolution, how the slave trade affected Africa, and briefly the Caribbean. The readings are roughly one book per week more or less. Some weeks the reading assignments are shorter. The reading assignments are eclectic; they include novels, academic writing, slave narratives, slave advertisements, primary sources, and transcripts of speeches etc. The assignments consist of one fifty minute identification midterm based on lectures and readings, a 8-10 page research paper, and a lengthier essay based final. Students must also post on the class website every week. If you do most of the reading and attend class, you will be fine. Prof. Woodard provides study guides and review sessions. It is a great class for anyone who wants to more about slavery and the process of abolition.",
    "Basically a crash course in African American history up to abolition and I would recommend it",
    "This course provides a very nice overview of slavery in the Atlantic World between 1500 and 1888. The course was a good amount of work, reading one book a week but not too stressful. I would like to have spent a little more time on the actual abolition movement as opposed to the Age of Revolution but overall the class was well structured and very informative.Professor Woodard is a very accommodating and understanding professor. She takes student suggestions very seriously and is flexible with the schedule. She can be a bit long winded at times and had some trouble finishing class on time, but is overall a very engaging professor.I wouldrecommend this class for anyone interesting in slavery or the Atlantic World between 1500 and 1888.",
    "AFAM 160 was an in-depth history course on the Atlantic Slave Trade, the Modern Atlantic World. If you are interested in those topics, then I would definitely recommend the course. Otherwise, the material may seem boring.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, because the content was rich and interesting. The major themes are still occurring in the 21st century and are important to understand. I really liked the fact that the class was so small, because we could many questions. I would say that sometimes the dates and events were confusing during lectures, but it is not too important to learn the dates by heart. The class is designed so you grasp the important notions of the class instead of memorizing facts."
