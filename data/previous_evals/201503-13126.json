To me there seems to have been overlap between some of the material, so after a while it felt like we were treading repeat ground, particularly toward the end when we had gathered that crowd theorists were saying the same things about crowd...over and over again (i.e., crowds are easily manipulated, etc.)."

    "While I appreciate class presentations and think they are excellent tools for getting everyone to participate and become responsible for the material, I wonder whether a method aimed at capitalist market trade design presentations (the pecha kucha) is the right method for a presentation about different subject matters around mass performances. Might there not be a more organic solution? Impose a time limit, yes, by all means, because brevity is of the essence; however, don't impose a slide limit\/time limit for each slide. It gets to be too static for the development of an argument, which doesn't always take the shape of a product presentation."

    "I didn't know anything about crowd theories before taking this class, so that really fulfilled a large gap in literature, and I definitely learned more about authoritarian governments and how theater\/performance plays a role in the dispersal of government ideology. Now I'm seeing fascism at every turn. My question, though, has to do with mass performance itself. I'm still a bit confused as to what classifies as a mass performance. For example, while hell houses are definitely part of the crowd theory section of the course, how do they qualify as a mass performance? They seem to be very different from the Spartakiads and other mass gymnastics-like events."

    "As mentioned above, still having a hard time putting together the crowd theory with the mass performance theory. At times the class felt more like crowd theory than it did mass performance. How are they brought together? Maybe it's my fault for not parsing it out, but perhaps a more overt bringing together of the two and having a semester-long constant defining of terms might help."
