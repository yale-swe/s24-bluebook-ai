    "It was a great overview of the intellectual history of intellectuals. I thought the syllabus was great!",
    "I learnt various perspectives on the role of the intellectual that I was then able to apply not only within this class but also to my areas of study in other classes. The class also pushed me to work to understand difficult texts and learn how to synthesize and integrate what was being said across various individuals.",
    "I discovered much more about the concept of the intellectual than I had thought about before.",
    "This course left me with a better overall standing of what it might or might not mean to be a public intellectual, of the history of the public intellectual, and of the responsibilities that come with being a public intellectual, to name several things. I also left the course with a greater overall grasp of European history (largely Western Europe)."

   "comments": [
    "I wish time was managed a little better, or the readings shortened. It was frustrating to not be able to get to all of the authors, almost every week. I also wish we had to post reading responses, not every week, but a certain number per semester. I always like knowing what my peers are thinking, and this definitely helps to ensure that people are doing all of the reading (or, at least, enough to ensure robust debate).",
    "Though a seminar, the class generally spoke less than the professor did - i thought that was usually useful because of the nature of the texts we were responding to (it was useful to have someone interpret them for us). However, maybe including a mandatory question bank each week where students contribute either two questions or two lines they found particularly interesting in the readings before class to start off discussion would be useful - it would allow students to contribute questions even if they didn't easily connect to what was being discussed during class (which is what adding comments during seminar as it progresses usually requires). I did think the assessments were well spread out and manageable, which was important.",
    "The syllabus is a bit disjointed, so it is hard to figure out a coherent progression of the class. It would also help if Professor Renaud asked questions that guided the class a bit more.",
    "This course does a fantastic job drawing from a very wide range of texts that have continuous dialogue with one another. I have been in few other seminars where previous readings end up organically coming back up in discussion so often. This was a really satisfying element of the class for me and for many others. As to weaknesses, there are few that come to mind."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely, especially for those interested in studying the nexus between people, ideas, and change.",
    "Yes, though I might suggest that they take another broader class in intellectual history first as i think that might increase their takeaway from this class.",
    "This class explores some interesting topics and a lot of really fascinating thinkers. but it doesn't really fit together. The discussion is often a bit dead, and doesn't always cover the most interesting parts of the readings. Also, the subject of the class does match the title: it is about intellectuals. If you're not so interesting in conceptions of the intellectual, this class might not be for you.",
    "When speaking to other undergrads about intellectual history classes at Yale, it is clear that most either love them or hate them. If you find yourself in the former camp, I cannot recommend this class highly enough. If you are in the latter, you might find this course would have you shift into the former camp. If you have no exposure, perhaps consider taking a lecture style course first, though this class would still be no bad choice at all. Professor Renaud does have an incredible knack for taking some of the loftiest of concepts and making them clear in an immediate and succinct way."
