    "This was the first course in which I got a lot of experience with taxonomy in a very classic evolutionary biology setting. We covered almost all of avian diversity in just one semester, and I can identify nearly every bird I see to family in English and Latin, along with pertinent ecological details.",
    "I can now identify the family of birds from around the world.",
    "I got a great overview of all the birds in the world, which is very valuable as I go forward with studies of birds."

   "comments": [
    "The studying is basically memorization, which I enjoyed insofar as my main goal was to familiarize myself with avian diversity, but may not be for everyone. Access to the top-notch Peabody collections was a fantastic opportunity and greatly enhanced my experience with the course, and the field trips were great!",
    "You get a broad introduction to birds of the world. I think it is a little too broad, however. It would be really great if you could focus in on certain groups of birds.",
    "This course is taught in a very old-fashioned way, with a lectured introduction to bird families, along with anecdotes, and then time left over to examine specimens. Osteology was included to some extent. An ornithology lab in general could have been better taught, I think, with a focus on dissections or experiments, but this course was very clearly billed as exactly what it was, a natural history overview. If you're looking to a hands-on introduction to bird anatomy or an introduction to experimental design, this is not the course for you. But this course is very effective at doing what it purports to do, which is to provide a good introduction to bird diversity through specimens and several field trips."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course and would definitely recommend it to EEB majors or those interested in learning to identify birds. The course, by necessity, has a much narrower focus than its lecture component, and those who are looking for a more general and wide overview may be satisfied with the lecture alone. If you're a bird or ecology fan, however, this will be your dream course.",
    "If you want to be able to look at a Flamingo and think \"Phoenicopteridae,\" then this course is for you. This wasn't me. While it was a great opportunity, I did not enjoy the stress it induced. I should have taken this course Credit\/D or dropped the course. It took a lot of time that I really didn't have to give to it. I wish I could have been more dedicated to this course.",
    "Know what you're getting into. Each class, you sit down and listen to Professor Prum give a (detailed and beautiful-photo-laden) presentation on the week's bird families. He often includes memory tricks and\/or personal anecdotes about the families involved. Then there is time left over to examine the specimens that have been laid out on the table, at your own pace. Lab is over when you've had adequate time with the specimens, often earlier than it is scheduled to be done. Each lab period also starts with a quiz on bird specimens and\/or bones. The quizzes are cumulative. You need to know how to identify all the bird families and give their latin names. You can be quizzed on anything that has been presented up until that time, so you actually do need to study outside of class. TAKE THIS CLASS ONLY IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO MEMORIZE A LOT OF BIRDS. There is a lot of memorization. But you learn lots of bird diversity and get to handle some amazing specimens. If you're interested in birds or if you are a birder, this class is worth your time."
