   "comments": [
    "This class is basic information about statistics, and i think it's really important and necessary for the further study.",
    "For most of the class I taught myself the material because I found the professor's teaching style hard to follow. The SAS lab has a lot of variation in quality based on the TA. I kept hearing someone named \"Yasmine\" (sp?) was amazing, but I did not have her. In general, I wish we went over SAS more in lecture because I do not feel like I got a good grasp of SAS from lab, and the things I do understand now are from trail and error and staring at SAS for many frustrating hours.",
    "Difficult subject. Could be explained better for persons like me who have little background in Biostats",
    "Biostatistics is SUCH an important concept, and it's a shame that this class is easily the most poorly taught and implemented course in our core classes.The fact that everybody told me to opt out of this course if I could should have been a sign that I was in for a long semester. The biggest issue is the quality of instruction. The instructor, while a very nice person, teaches in an incredibly convoluted manner that has people walking away even more confused than when they started- even her introductory lectures about how to find mean, median and mode were indecipherable. The professor chooses to do all of her notes via overhead projector, meaning that the lectures are made even more confusing- if you miss writing down something, going back to look at the notes does not help at all. In addition, she doesn't set up lectures by stating the objective or even explaining WHY something is important or what we use it for- she'll give a formula, and that's about it. She also rarely makes explicit connections to the problem sets for homework. The problem sets aren't terrible, mostly because the problems literally ask you to repeat a problem that was explicitly laid out in the book. There are SO MANY opportunities for improvement that I really hope that the professor takes into consideration. Here are my suggestions, right off the bat: -Switch to Powerpoint! Not only will it save her time in the long term (she can reuse them year to year), but it will help the scope and sequence of each class. She can write the objective on the first slide (as in: what should students be able to do by the end of the class? Not just a single word like \"regression\") and can take students explicitly through solving the steps of a problem. She wouldn't even need to reinvent the wheel- there are plenty of universities that freely share the slides they use (I recommend googling \"Johns Hopkins Intro to Biostatistics\") -Treat the class much more like a math class- give us the chance to practice a problem or two in class! Do something as simple as taking us through a problem, putting another example problem on the board, and giving us a few minutes to try and solve it on our own. This will give the instructor a chance to offer immediate feedback and clarify any classwide misconceptions. -Stop wasting paper by printing copies of 20-page SAS handouts. If she makes the switch to Powerpoint, she can simply copy and paste the necessary table onto the slide. -This might be controversial, but one of the reasons why people are generally much more successful at internalizing Epi than Biostats is the weekly problem sets that grade us on completion, rather than accuracy, and allow us to go over the sets in a small group. What if, instead of giving huge problem sets that we don't get feedback on for up to a month at some points, the professor assigned us 2 or 3 weekly problems that we tried to work through on our own, went through and corrected as a section on Friday, and then got it back the following week? This would also go a long way to treating biostats like a math class and ensuring that students don't get tripped up by misconceptions.",
    "strength: technical subject matter weakness: handwriting of instructor not legible.",
    "Great homework structure, Dr. Claus is engaged, the homeworks and labs reinforce what we learn in class.",
    "SAS is extremely difficult to learn, I think a simpler book, such as SAS for Dummies would have made things more bite-sized.",
    "Information is very important, problem sets and exams are fair, office hours and TA ares good SAS lab could provide more instruction, teacher could use powerpoints",
    "The lab powerpoints towards the end of the semester had NO RELEVANT INSTRUCTION on how to complete the lab. The last 2 labs were way too short and the TA did not even have time to finish explaining everything. Labs always feel rushed; the TA would spend the first half hour cramming as much information as she can, and spend the limited amount of remaining time helping people who actually understood what was said. TMWDNR: Labs are always rushed. Powerpoint slides for last lab DID NOT HELP AT ALL.",
    "SAS lab was difficult, but necessary.",
    "I thought the course was great. I walked away with a thorough understanding of basic statistics. It was well taught, and I found the lab component to be really helpful and interesting.",
    "The open book exams are a must.",
    "I think our professor is an OK teacher. However, she is a bit disorganized. It took a while for me to get used to her teaching style so there definitely was a learning curve at the beginning of the semester. Use of PowerPoints would improve the course tremendously. Additionally, I was very unhappy with the lab sections. While lab eventually started making sense, and my TA was nice when I had a direct question, I felt terrified at the beginning of the semester when I got to lab and my TA didn't speak great English, and the info was presented without much apparent order. It would be so much more useful to have slides to refer to and then have someone walk through an example for us to see how we build a program- especially at the beginning.",
    "please don't make it 8:30!! the hw didn't even look like it had been looked at - more feedback would be nice. also more practice problems for the test.",
    "Strength: teach SAS. Weakness: handwriting of the professor.",
    "",
    "It was pretty interesting. I really liked the professor and she was able to teach biostats in a way for me to understand.",
    "My overall assessment of this course is that it may be useful for people that have strong motivation to learn biostatistics. The class is in the morning and the professor speaks in kind of a monotone voice so many students have trouble staying awake. I worked for several years before coming back to graduate school and knew I needed more biostatistics to move in my field. Because of this I would go to bed early before class and bring a cup of coffee with me if I thought I was going to have trouble staying awake. This made it so I got more out of the class than some of my classmates. Overall, there are two main things that could be improved in this class 1. the method of the delivery (I would recommend using a powerpoint and asking more questions in class), the professor's hand writing is often hard to read 2. the frequency of the assessments. Currently there are long homeworks due every 2-3 weeks. I would recommend breaking up the homeworks and having them every week. It's hard to retain the material without any sort of weekly assignment that reinforces it.",
    "Topics were connected, labs and homework were helpful",
    "my SAS TF was not helpful, so I had to go to other SAS sessions in order to get the understanding I needed. The TFs could have more training. The greatest strength of the course was Yasmin, who helped me through it. Professor Claus was also very receptive to questions in class and explained well.",
    "This course was well taught and was a good intro to stats and to SAS. The SAS lab was probably the best part of the class since a lot of exam questions and HW questions required knowledge we learned in SAS lab.",
    "I wouldn't suggest any real changes. I don't know how else one could teach intro to biostats other than how Dr. Claus did",
    "It was not taught in a straightforward and easy to follow manner. I wish I had learned more sas instead of just copying and pasting labs from the PowerPoint",
    "I qualified out of this course based on prior courses. However, I was told that I would still have to attend SAS lab, which was fine. I didn't know anything about the program and I was excited to learn it. However, on the first day of the lab, the TA told us that if we're not enrolled in the class, our work will not be graded and we should not turn it in as we will not get feedback. That was really discouraging for a program that I need to know.",
    "It is hard and almost impossible to follow the notes in class. The exams do not accurately cover what is stressed in class.",
    "This was by far my least favorite class this semester. The midterm and final were structured nothing like her practice exams. A majority of the questions on the midterm and final were much harder than anything we discussed in class, which made the open notes testing style almost pointless. Additionally, the book problems we are assigned for homework are way too long and should be shortened. Furthermore, since we are already given a lot of book problems to complete for homework, the SAS labs should not require outside work and time. We should be able to complete the SAS labs within the allotted one hour lab time, which is not the case by a long shot. This course definitely needs to be restructured so that students are not left feeling defeated after they take an exam in this class.",
    "Weakness: The course is not systematic enough",
    "The material is extremely important. All of the information was built upon very well.",
    "I waived this course based on attending the first two lectures to observe the professor and advice from others who have taken it.",
    "I enjoyed the course, and felt that it provided a good overview of the material",
    "Overall the course was taught well. It touches on many subjects in biostatistics at the introductory level which is very useful. The labs however were not useful at all. The TAs were not very helpful and it depended a lot on self-learning.",
    "I audited the course.",
    "Did not fully explain the mathematical background for much of the SAS code towards the end. The SAS book doesn't follow the class very well\/at all. The SAS labs are horribly designed with poor TAs. This is the first time mamy of us are learning SAS but the TAs couldnt show us the correct code for certain examples. I think it is necessary to teach the correct method first using a Very similar example rather than a different example all together. It forces students to ask many questions in lab ans not all students get the attention from the TA as needed. moat students are asking similar questions in lab too, because the TAs often leave out huge chunks of code thatis needed and then the TAs spend all lab repeating what was missing to students who ask individually.",
    "I wish we had clearer lecture slides",
    "I found the lectures not so helpful, but sessions with TAs incredibly helpful. It would be great if there was a scheduled section",
    "I was auditing this class to learn SAS, and it was unclear to me what was the best way to go about doing this. Sitting in on the labs was mildly useful. Still I struggled to decide how much of the exercises\/assignments to do because it wasn't like I was going to do the write-ups. The tutorials were very assignment and interpretation driven and I wish I understood more of syntax and grammar of coding SAS rather than learn how to adjust code.",
    "The course provided a nice background of SAS and how to code. Additionally, the course gave a good overview of statistics by hand. Overall, the class will be helpful in setting the foundation of understanding statistics for my future research projects. Although the course was beneficial, there were some weaknesses. First, it was difficult to prepare for exams. We primarily learned SAS coding in class, and were then expected to calculate everything by hand on exams. Additionally, the style of teaching was a little confusing. Everything was written on an overhead projector. It was often quite hard to read and follow along with the class. A future suggestion could be powerpoints or perhaps writing on the whiteboard.",
    "Weakness-not designed for students with little to no exposure to biostatistics; poor instructor from instructor; biostats lab is ill run and has little structure\/consistency across TFs;",
    "I felt like I went through the motions with this course. SAS was taught terribly. I don't feel like I know squat about basic statistical methods or SAS after taking this course and I am someone who has a chance at getting an Honors grade. We didn't cover much more material than my college Intro to Stats course did. Really disappointed.",
    "Good course, final exam a bit not representative of the main focus in the class, especially the last 2 questions",
    "The course is good, however the instruction of the course is poor. The professor does not teach the course in a way that students can follow. Most of the learning was done outside the classroom with the textbook and TA office hours",
    "some exam questions not representative of the focus in the class",
    "I got very little marginal value out of the lectures and sections as compared to just reading the textbook.",
    "The class component was initially difficult to tie back to the SAS lab. Conceptualization was prioritized, which made the importance of memorization low. This was an excellent aspect of the class.",
    "The primary weakness of this course was that we were not adequately prepared for the midterm and the final examinations. The course was more appropriate for those students who had previous experience in statistics than those who had never taken statistics before.",
    "I liked Professor Claus as a person, but I thought that the class was poorly taught. The notes she took during class were difficult to follow. By the end of the semester, the majority of Biostats students stopped attending class. It was hard for me to follow what was going on in lecture so I ended up teaching myself the material and relying on other students for help. I would have liked to get a solid foundation in Biostats but this was not the case and it seemed like current YSPH second years at similar experiences.",
    "The overall assessment of the class is that it it should be stated in advance that Lab has separate homework and requirements. It should thus be given its own unit.",
    "Overall, I felt this was a solid introduction to statistics. The professor was patient, the pace was steady, and the exams and work was fair. I felt like the lab course could be strengthened; I didn't feel it supported the material as much as it could.",
    "Improvement in organization of lessons could vastly improve course.",
    "A missed opportunity.",
    "Course quickly moved from simple to complex concepts. Missing a class made it difficult to catch up. Office hours were helpful. Please continue to have more office hours for students with TFs.",
    "The class should be later on in the day, or offer a section later on in the day. Overall the course didnt really build on fundamentals of statistics, rather it taught us how to read sas, something that can just be searched on on the internet.",
    "I think this course has the potential to be really valuable because understanding the statistical analysis side of public health is essential for our careers. However, I do not believe this course has prepared us properly to enter into higher levels of statistical thinking. We are taught material simply to attempt to pass exams instead of fully grasping the statistical nature of the topics. Additionally, with the lab portion of the class, we aren't learning how to code but rather being told what code to put where, when really we should be approaching SAS as if we were learning a new language. Another very large concern I had was the final exam. The test I prepared for and the test I was provided were not even on the same spectrum. I was very diligent the entire semester in putting forth the most effort to this course, as statistics is not my strength academically. It was extremely disconcerting to walk out of the final wondering whether or not I answered one questions correctly as I felt it was not representative of the material covered.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed learning biostatistics. I do believe there could be some structural changes to make the material easier to learn. For example, when then professor presented the material, it was difficult to read and follow at times. There was one day the projector was not working and she had to write on the white board. It was significantly easier to follow and understand the material. Perhaps using the white board or using PowePoint slides in the future would be better.",
    "The course material in most cases did not suffice in strengthening the understanding of the concepts. The course covers crucial topics which lay foundation for future discourses thus should not be left to a single textbook.",
    "The topics were relevant and I think it has somewhat adequately prepared me for work that would require such knowledge and skills.",
    "classnotes are not clear"

It is almost an insult to the prestige of Yale to have such a mediocre instructor to teach a fundamental course in Biostats.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: very nice Opportunities for improvement: I said a lot in my course evaluation above, but to reiterate: -at the bare minimum, make the switch from overhead projectors to Powerpoint. The notes on the overhead projector make an already confusing subject confusing and don't lead well to a well-run class- sometimes, she can go off task or not give examples. This will make it much easier for students to immediately figure out any misconceptions they have (they'll know that they're confused about the content, not just the confusing way that it was delivered), will help save time in the long term for the professor, and just generally lead to a more useful class. -Going hand in hand with Powerpoint- be MUCH more clear with the daily objective and the type of problem students should be able to solve. -Incorporate basics of successful teaching. This includes: 1. Lay out an objective (what should students be able to do at the end of class? What should they be able to say?) 2. \"Hook\" or connect (maybe give an example of a problem that we may need to solve) 3. Introduce new material, with graphs, pictures and examples (include step by step instructions, stopping to clarify any misconceptions). 4. Guided practice: Give an example problem in the Powerpoint, then give students a span of 2-3 minutes to solve it, then go over it as a class. 5. Independent work (obviously you can't give us time to do the problem sets in class, but maybe connect what we're learning in class that day to the problems that this could help us with- \"Now that you know the purpose of a z score, problem 5 should be easy to tackle\") 6. Wrap up\/Connect (briefly restate the objective, what was learned that day, how this connects to public health, and what we'll be learning the next time). -Use a different book. The book being used is out of date, doesn't help connect to SAS, doesn't help connect to the material in class, and makes the problem sets incredibly useless (they literally ask the same problems as the examples in the book, but change the words a tad).",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Why does she use outdated technology?",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0very helpful and happy to answer questions. Please have more office hours to go over concepts not understood in class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I really enjoyed Dr. Claus's class and thought she clearly explained all of the material.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Although Dr. Claus is extremely knowledgeable and well-versed in biostatistics, I do not believe she is the best professor for this course. Particularly, her class notes are extremely hard to follow as they are all hand written with no additional context around formulas or example problems.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof. Claus was very friendly and accessible to answer questions outside the classroom. Providing handouts was very useful for understanding SAS. I do wish the delivery of the material was more organized.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She seems to be very knowledgable and dedicated to helping classes learn. However, her lecture methods are not very effective. Half the time she loses me because I cannot read her penmanship. While I don't think slides is necessary, my suggestion is to have the notes written up already. It was extremely frustrating because I think Dr. Claus spent most of the time writing and I spend most of the class time trying to interpret it.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would like to recommend it to another student because it's important to construct your knowledge and it's all about basic skill.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this class to anyone who is able to get out of it. I took a statistics course in college (years ago), and I still learned more from that than I learned from this course. Unless the quality of instruction changes or a new professor is put in charge, this class will end up confusing you more.",
    "go to class. go to office hours. pay attention, it will pay off. if you miss class you won't be able to decipher the notes.",
    "Great class. If you put in the effort, you'll learn a lot.",
    "It was a mandatory course.",
    "It is difficult, but necessary.",
    "Great intro stats class. Not too challenging and very informative. For undergrads, a great substitute for intro stats.",
    "Perhaps a separate section could be offered for students who exempted from the course and are only taking the lab. Then, it would not be as redundant to go through a full example in section, since students who do not attend the class would not have seen a lab example yet.",
    "Well, as for a core course, it's good. Biostat is very useful",
    "",
    "If you can waive it I would, unless you're like me and know that you will need it for your job and are good at teaching yourself material out of a book.",
    "Go to the lab and try to finish at least the codes there with the help of a TF. It's extremely helpful especially for the second half of class, and if you can finish it in class you don't have to spend extra time working on yourself trying to figure out the codes before the homework is due.",
    "difficult, comes together by the end. go to office hours.",
    "It's a requirement, so don't take it if you don't really have to. But it was very helpful in learning SAS and basic statistical tests. Overall, not a bad course.",
    "Hard class to follow. More helpful when you go to class",
    "Get your work done early! It is maybe the most important skill you develop in your first semester.",
    "I would waive this course if at all possible.",
    "Course is necessary to understand any advanced course material, so I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Difficult course, a lot of work with all the labs and the textbook questions. Sas is really the only component that I feel is well worth learning, as it really applies to the real world. Calculating certain things by hand is not only a waste of time, but takes away from time that could be better spent.",
    "This course provides a nice background of biostatistics. I would recommend it to a student who wants to learn the basics of SAS and stats, however if a student is looking for a more in-depth introduction, I would maybe recommend taking a different course.",
    "Extremely unnecessarily difficult",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "Do not take it if you have any stats background",
    "No - time would be much better spent reading any biostatistics textbook as compared to attending lectures",
    "The course is difficult but able to be understood. Investing time earlier on is important to stay ahead of the course content.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. I would advise any student that I spoke with to try to exempt out of it.",
    "Its required thus you should take it, unless you can opt out. In which case, I would opt out.",
    "A good introductory course - I would definitely recommend it to another student with little\/no statistics background.",
    "I would not recommend this course- I don't feel as though it improved my knowledge of biostatistics.",
    "A missed opportunity",
    "Yes. Good to know the basic concepts of Biostatistics. SAS concepts good to know.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the class and learning the material. It did take me a long time to understand the material and I am not sure I still fully understand everything I learned. In the future, I would recommend students stop and ask questions during class. I think there was miscommunication with the instructor that the students were understanding the material better then they were because we were not stopping and asking questions when we didn't understand a concept. I would recommend the instructor do a 5 minute review at the beginning of every class of the material covered related to the material that will be covered that day for student to connect the concepts. Moving forward to Biostatistics 2, I would recommend students to stop and ask questions at the beginning of class of material not understood for previous classes and to stop and ask questions during class as well.",
    "I think the class is set up well, but the execution needs improvement."
