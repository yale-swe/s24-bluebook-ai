    "Analytical writing; Analyzing texts; summarizing opinions",
    "I definitely refreshed and strengthened my essay-writing abilities, especially for longer essays. I also developed greater critical thinking skills, especially in regards to voicing my opinion and thoughts.",
    "Writing, reading passages, and integrating multiple sources.",
    "I developed my ability to analyze academic reading and hold intellectual discussions about the and apply them to my writing",
    "I gained a insight into many different perspectives on the role and position of animals in the modern world through critically reading many different styles of writing. This developed both my critical analysis and own writing through the essays assigned. I also gained many research and analytical skills when working toward our own pieces.",
    "By taking this course I strengthened my essay writing skills through reading many different readings, writing several rough and final drafts of essays, and sharing ideas and concepts with my fellow peers taking this course. I also gained additional knowledge on where animals stand with humankind, about animal and human consciousness, and issues of animal abuse and captivity.",
    "I learned how to write semi-large papers in a short amount of time and how to analyze readings, specifically in regard to the sources used."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: interesting topics, solid training towards academic writing Weakness: seminar style sometimes could lead the class wander off course",
    "The frequency with which we wrote essays was a real strength of the course, and is probably the aspect of the course that I benefited from the most. Occasionally, I felt the reading we were given were too dense to reasonably read within the given time and I think I personally struggled to understand.",
    "Strengths - awesome material, units and feedback Weaknesses - could have had more discussions",
    "The main strength of this course is that it is seminar style and discussions are student led",
    "I enjoyed the seminar structure of this class and being able to have class discussions about our work and the work we read. I also enjoyed the last few assignments in which we could research a topic of our choice and write about something we were passionate about. However I found many of the class readings very long and hard to comprehend, some of which I think were unnecessarily lengthy.",
    "A strength of this course was how we did rough drafts of our essays before the final drafts to allow us to further develop and explore our topics. A weakness could be how we had some slightly confusing and profound readings on top of writing an essay for a night of homework.",
    "I found this course to be very interesting and thought that it helped my improve my writing skills. A weakness of the course was that we would often have to start new papers before we had even turned in ones we had been working on. We would often have to complete readings that had nothing to do with the papers that were due. The readings were always interesting and lead to great in class discussions but were hard to complete if you were under a time crunch."

    "Completely, especially if they love animals",
    "Yes, it is a great introductory writing course to improve basic writing skills",
    "Yes it has made me think very differently about the animals in the world around us and has been a very interesting class to take. I think this is particularly important in a time when many animals lives are in quite a precarious situation. It was also was great to be able to pick a topic of my choice for our essays.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other freshmen because it allowed me to further develop my essay writing skills to help me as my college career proceeds and the topic of the class was very interesting, especially if you are an animal lover.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are interested in animal rights or animals in general."
