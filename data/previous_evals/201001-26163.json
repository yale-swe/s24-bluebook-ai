    "I would \u0096 and already do \u0096 recommend this class to anyone considering taking up a language at Yale. It was always challenging, but absolutely one of the most enjoyable classes I\u0092ve taken, and was such an awesome way to start the day! I feel like I\u0092ve learned an incredible amount in the past year, and really enjoyed the general atmosphere of the German department outside my section as well \u0096 especially regular events like Kino Dienstag.",
    "Continuation of elementary German -- focus on grammar, vocabulary, and German culture. Regular tests and quizzes ensure that you know the material and get through it in manageable chunks. Take it if you want to learn German...obviously. I had a lot of fun and feel like I have a solid grasp of the foundations of the language thus far.",
    "Great choice if interested in GMAN",
    "Take it! It's fun and not very hard and a useful language to learn.",
    "L2 German is more fast-paced than L1, but that also means that you're moving away from elementary German. I would definitely recommend L2 if you've begun German already. If you've taken L1 try to continue with your classmates and if possible your instructor from L1 in L2, because it makes a very friendly and constructive environment."
