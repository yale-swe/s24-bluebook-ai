   "comments": [
    "By far, the best course that I have taken at Yale. Mark Schlesinger is one of a kind when it comes to health policy and to teaching. He has amazing grasp of the material and is really engaging as an instructor.",
    "This course has no administrative component to it and is not an adequate capstone for students in a health policy and administration program. The policy discussions were too theoretical and abstract. Given the current health policy climate, a capstone for health policy students should include more current policy discussions.",
    "Course really should be tailored to more real world applications instead of a policy bubble. Assignments should be reflective of real world political arena. For example, instead of creating a prohibition policy -- how about let students design a policy of their OWN interest, given that we are taking this class in lieu of a thesis? Furthermore, the final Capstone paper on a transformative action to Medicare is completely unrealistic, and completely irrelevant to someone who is not interested in the aging population.",
    "It is what it is. You have to take it and if you've taken HPA510, you know what to expect. There is a focus on the conceptual processes surrounding policy analysis. There is little emphasis on practical skill building. Readings are often painfully long and we go over them in class enough that you can generally skip them. The three papers (one group, two individual) aren't fun, but they generally have enough direction that they're not difficult to throw together.",
    "Great material, interesting topics. I thought the assignments were good, and I really enjoyed the material covered in this course. One of the better classes at YSPH.",
    "The course taught some interesting and important principles but could have used more real life applications of these concepts.",
    "I wish that the course included discussion on a broader range of health policy issues than just Medicare. I would have liked to learn more about how to tie my health policy education in a more practical way to the things I am interested in. The final paper should have been allowed to be on a topic of our choosing, not required to be about Medicare. I have a lot of health policy interests about children's health, but I wasn't able to explore those in this class because of the heavy focus on Medicare.",
    "As a replacement for what should be the Thesis for HPA students, this course should act as a way to summarize the \"4-course sequence\" touted by the HPA curriculum. Unfortunately, the course lacks any final skills and does not allow creativity among the students' work. Instead of allowing students to pursue their interests for a final activity, we found ourselves half-heartedly writing about Medicate, of academic or professional interest to probably less than half the students.",
    "strengths-conceptual approach, which we don't get in many other classes-knowledgeable professorweaknesses-too many students in the course; needs to be smaller to really get people engaged in discussion-not enough time spent on new and emerging health policy topics",
    "This course is interesting because it talks about policy analysis in a very theoretical sense and takes into account different aspects of the community and human behavior that you normally wouldn't place too much significance on.",
    "The course had definite strengths and weaknesses. If the course was titled \"Advanced Applications of Health Policy Theory,\" then it would have been great. However, I don't think it was necessarily a \"capstone\" experience.Strengths: For students looking for a theoretical framework through which to approach health policy and for useful media strategies to sell health policy - this course did a great job! The best part about this course is that it forced you to think outside the box and to think critically about solving health policy problems. I'm sure the material will be useful, in some way, in future policy work.Weaknesses: The course lacked a practical competent and was too theoretical for a capstone experience. It also did not bring together all things learned while at EPH, and rather, served as an independent course with all new material. It would have been nice to incorporate information from Health Policy and Politics or Policy Analysis.The course was also very assignment-heavy and I think I would have benefited from having one major group assignment and one major final assignment (though, the assignments did build nicely off one another and each assignment helped prepare you for the next). Having to relate the final project to Medicare was also limiting and did not allow certain topics to be explored. As a recommendation for the final assignment, in the future, I think students should have the option to do Mark's assignment (which DOES have it's benefits for some students...in fact, I personally enjoyed it), or alternatively, design their own \"practical\" assignment. This might even mean working with an organization or conducting original research - but the goal of the final assignment should be to make it fit with an individual's career goals.Lastly, one of my biggest complaints was the course size - about 30 students! The course would have been much better at half this size and participating would have been easier\/more comfortable. To encourage participation, Mark should designate 'discussion teams' each class or do more group activities during class.",
    "strengths: class lecture outlines keep students on track and ensure a solid takeaway from each session. (thank you for this!)I REALLY appreciate that this class grabbles with the \"hard\" questions and the professor tries very hard (with experience) to get students engaged in self-reflection about ethical questions in policy.Weaknesses: the burden of readings with relative importance worry me. Lesser known theories (e.g. American compassion argument) detract from the overall message and agruably more important frameworks (e.g. Chialdini). Philosophical points could have been better presented in an organized point-by-point fashion... Even though this is not consistent with the thoughtful approach that derives them, it would allow students an easier time of weaving these thoughts (e.g. Federalism: Toqueville) into the policy analysis.",
    "I was a participant in the course and did the readings, and while I understand what Mark was trying to teach, it is unclear to me that this course was supposed to be the culminating experience of our Policy curriculum. I think there was a general lack of engagement of the students in the class. I think that Mark certainly tried, I just feel that this was not what I was hoping for. Instead, this course should have been re-named \"overview of persuasive writing\". The references to health could have been substituted by other subject matters, indicating that there simply was not a uniqueness to public health.",
    "Strengths: We have good class conversations usually... The first third of the course (the 3 approaches to policy analysis) was great.Weaknesses: Tons of reading but not always clear how reading is relevant... Topics aren't super-interesting. More flexibility in allowing us to choose our own topics for assignments would be appreciated. Sometimes the class is too big for really good conversations - I didn't hear some people speak the entire semester!",
    "Needs to be more practical to prepare students for real life work assignments we would encounter as public health policy professionals",
    "Strengths: readings, emphasis on analytical thinkingWeaknesses: tends to look for a specific answer (both in discussions and papers) and is often obviously unsatisfied with alternative answers",
    "This course would be improved by splitting the class in half and having two sessions of the same course",
    "Would be helpful to provide a clearer exposition of the three early frameworks for policy analysis. A structured framework for each (as the Professor sees it) to which students could return throughout the semester as they develop their final position papers would be useful.",
    "This was an incredibly disappointing course - ASK ANYONE! I came into the course in January with low expectations, due to remarks from previous students, but I had no idea how bad it really could be.How this is actually considered to be a \"CAPSTONE\" course in Health Policy is utterly beyond me. Material is from the 1990s and early 2000s, which would be fine, if this was 2005. The problem is that this little thing called healthcare reform happened recently. The legislation included in that wee measure is somewhat important to how each and every one of us will be performing his\/her jobs in the future.This course is also simply TOO LARGE. At more than 30 students, this is not a seminar - no matter how you arrange the chairs.Having every student write about prohibition from President Bush's prespective is a WASTE OF TIME. Furthermore, having every student try to reform Medicare - of which not one student was interested in if I am correct - was also a WASTE OF TIME.",
    "To think that this is an appropriate substitution for the thesis experience is ridiculous. HPA should get a tuition discount if so! It was at best an OK class. Class size was way to big for the format--Mark should have adjusted the teaching style to match the class composition a bit better. Only the undergrads spoke (mostly to fill the awkward silence), and everyone else worked on their laptops. Painful."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very few professors are able to facilitate a discussion and have it touch upon key points of the readings. Mark does an excellent job at this and his mastery of the course material is refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a good guy, but being in a class with him feels like an exercise in patience. His perspective on what we should be interested in seems directly opposed to what a majority of students were hoping to get out of the HPA program and this course. I think a lot of students would opt to take the management capstone or do a thesis instead if it meant that we could get out of Mark's class.While capstone discussion is better than HPA510, its still a class with Mark, and this is really only one biased (and generational) perspective on policy.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great guy but this class is outdated. I think the HPA faculty should really reconsider requiring the capstone course. It's not relevant for everyone and not good enough to warrant a requirement.Kudos to Mark for putting up with a class of disgruntled HPA folks for the semester. He was responsive to ppl who reached out and was available to discuss everything from class to careers.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I thought Mark could've done a better job leading class discussion. He would sometimes talk for far too long, and students would lose interest in participating. Additionally, Mark should consider cold-calling students to ensure that the conversation isn't dominated by 2-3 students.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great instructor who cares deeply about his students.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0very knowledgeable and articulatesometimes I feel like Mark relies too much on conceptual discussion topics, which is very hard to many students to participate with (needs more of a balance)generally provided only \"vague\" feedback to student questions about assignments; he always says this is intentional, but often students feel that they have too little direction on assignments",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an interesting professor. He's sometimes hard to understand but overall his view points were so different from mine that it expanded my scope of thinking, for which I am very grateful.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a knowledgeable, passionate professor with a particular niche in health policy - thinking in a theoretical, non-conventional way about problems. He is a creative thinker and encourages students to be the same. I really admire him for this. He is great at leading discussion, presenting thought-provoking questions, and answering questions from students. He knows the reading material inside and out and has a gift for understanding and responding to student comments.Mark also provided great feedback on all assignments and took the time to read carefully through our work.On the other hand, Mark's approach to health policy does not work for all students. There was little to no discussion of current events or how the course material would be applied in real-life policy positions. In fact, he seemed pretty removed from the real world and current happenings. Our assignments were dated, and I would recommend that he take the time to update these assignments to reflect current politics and incorporate more current readings.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Oh Mark, something changed this semester. I was always a really big fan of yours, and always a vocal advocate in defense of your style, your care for the students, interesting reading choices, and challenging assignments. But this semester, I started to notice what the others have been saying. The policy students each have a uniqe focus and when they brought up comments to that interest (e.g financial motivations of policy), that they felt it weren't woven into the more philosophical conversation. Others found that the readings were too outdated, and I might agree, or alternatively suggest a more robust selection of even older readings along the lines of democratic history (e.g. Roman, French, Australia? even attempts at democracy in Iraq, if the purpose is to flesh out the different iterations of democratic principles that influence health policy). I was disappointed by the assignment choices because I really didn't feel I could give the last, culminating paper what I wanted to with what I got out of class. This may be my fault, but the number of classmates (6) I talked to also wrote a paper that \"didn't follow the assignment\" and \"didn't include Chialdini or readings from class\". I found this troubling, and suggest that the next time only 1 group paper and 1 individual paper (if longer than 5 pgs) be required. Mark, I really wished we (individually and as a class) could have connected better. Again, I take responsibility for not reaching out more agressively oustide of class they way other students did, for instance about the transexual\/transgender issue, but I also didn't want to attack you or demand something that seemed very ambiguous at the time. Mark has a wealth of knowledge and experience and provides a VERY important, very special part of the curriculum. I highly recommend his courses, but caution students to be prepared for a deeply theoretical discovery of policy-making that may neither be palatable nor relevant for everyone.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I think that Mark certainly tried to convey a difficult to express subject matter, and was certainly a flexible and patient instructor. I think the students were really looking for something more tangible out of the class.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great thinker and mentor, and particularly good at counseling you to challenge your assumptions. Thank you Mark for your support!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Pros: Mark is good at getting us to think about things. He asks great questions.Cons: Mark is sometimes not clear about what he wants us to get out of a particular discussion, reading or assignment.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Thoughtful, contributes to student growth;",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Excellent for a theoretical, hypothetical, Ivy Tower dinner chat - VERY POOR for a PROFESSIONAL school professor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The assignments were also obviously recycled from years ago--please, spend some time to update the readings and assignments!"

    "It is mandatory, but I would not recommend it.",
    "It should not be required. Some people liked it. I wasn't one of them. Don't do away with it, but figure out a better way to give HPA-ers a Capstone experience. This class isn't it.",
    "Good course that will teach you to think in new and interesting ways. This course may also be of interest to those who want to learn more about political science, as a lot of the discussion is relevant to areas outside of health.",
    "This course is required for HPA students.",
    "Since the course is required for HPA students, any recommendation against the course would be futile. If the course were an elective, I would not recommend it.",
    "good course to learn about how to think about policy from a broader, conceptual perspective; very enjoyable if you yourself try to get involved in the class discussions; can be frustrating",
    "It's a good class that'll teach you how to write a policy paper and have it be more acceptable to the public (a necessity for it to ever pass and be implemented)",
    "This would make a great elective course, but to be a great capstone course, I think it needs some tweaks.It is not for all students, but for those with an interest in different approaches to health policy, theory-based political strategies, and media advocacy strategies, I would recommend this course. I would also recommend it to students who enjoy thinking 'outside the box' and thinking creatively about health policy.For students looking for a practical or personalized course experience (i.e. exploring your own interests), this may not be the course for you.Mark is a great professor, but again, not for all students.",
    "Aside from the fact that it is required, I would recommend against the class. I would suggest that any student, if they could somehow craft a project that was acceptable in lieu of the class, they should pursue that option.",
    "Mark is an incredibly knowledgeable guy, but in classes he is more the Socratic gadfly--getting you to challenge your own assumptions--than the policy wonk. This is valuable for health policy training, and I would encourage students to talk with him about your papers and general ideas in health policy. Sometimes I would have liked to see him synthesize a bit more, but overall I think it's good that the class leaves you with more questions than answers. I really liked the reading in general for the course and the organization was well thought out. Class was bigger than ideal, and this definitely hurt the qualityof discussion a bit. Nonetheless, a really fun and thoughtful experience!",
    "Some changes to the capstone would be nice... Especially if there was more clarity in what we're supposed to be getting out of a particular conversation or reading or paper. Also I would like more flexibility with the assignments so that we could choose our own topics or something... Like for the first assignment it would be cool if we could pick our own topic and do the 3 types of policy analysis on the issue of our choosing (subject to Mark's approval)Overall I like our class discussions, and I think Mark wants us to get a lot out of the course. Sometimes it was frustrating because I didn't know exactly what I was supposed to be getting out of it... But learning to live with that the course was fine. I think you just have to accept the ambiguity in Mark's class in order to appreciate it.",
    "Course fosters interesting discussion of a wide array of topics. At times a bit abstract, but in part I think that's the point.Yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "Be prepared to be disappointed.",
    "well, it's a requirement. If there was a substitution available, I would recommend taking it--anything but this. Mark's esoteric style is only a good fit for about 5% of the students, and the rest just suffer."
