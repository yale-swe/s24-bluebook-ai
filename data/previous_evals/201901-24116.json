    "When most people think about corruption, they think of back door negotiations and suitcases full of money in dim rooms. This class goes beyond traditional conceptions of corruption and delves deep into its mechanics and complexities in the modern world. This class is structured with different topic areas for each week to emphasize both the breadth and depth of corruption. Discussions range from the political theory behind corruption to case studies, allowing students to explore beyond what might have initially attracted them to the class. In these discussions, one learns how to speak knowledgeably about the messy nature of corruption while also building a set of mental tools to evaluate and recommend policy action. While it is difficult to \"solve\" corruption, this class provides a background and a lens to work toward doing so.",
    "I developed practical skills about the nature of corruption, current reform efforts, and possible avenues for reforms",
    "This class was a great overview of what corruption is, and the way it is facilitated through the global financial system and expressed in various sectors like art. Furthermore, I got a secondary exposure to topics in political economy such as FDI and foreign aid and the ways that they related to corruption and kleptocracy.",
    "Through this course, I was able to gain an understanding of the foundational sources\/enablers of corruption manifested in diverse spheres of lifefrom politics to business to sports. The various guest lectures from field practitioners also provided me an opportunity to see what it looks like to tackle such a complex issue, and it left me even more intrigued by the field."

   "comments": [
    "The strength is Professor Dezenski. She brings really good guest lectures that are forefront in the anti-corruption movement.",
    "This course was a great introduction, like I mentioned earlier. The readings were varied and really helped expose students to the subject matter. However, at times I wished there was a deeper focus on the inner workings of the global financial system and how it relates to corruption. But this is a minor concern.",
    "The course was a seminar but involved a lot of lecturing - most of the time it was very cool guest speakers who had a lot to teach us, but it did reduce the amount that students could engage in class and with the material.",
    "Strength: Incredible teaching, breadth+depth in corruption topics, guest lectures Weakness: More focus on readings analysis\/discussion"

    "Most definitely. Corruption is a major issue that affects a significant portion of policy implementation. Development programs, state-building, and international relations (and much more) often hinge on corruption, so understanding corruption's roots and manifestations is essential to building a framework to support global political efficacy. Additionally, Professor Dezenski is an invaluable resource in and out of the classroom. Her extensive, direct experience with corruption in a variety of positions informs the way she presents information and encourages discussion. Overall, this class is a great balance of exploration and in-depth analysis. The full experience is magnified with the immeasurable real-world knowledge of Professor Dezenski.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the course and surveying the most prominent networks of corruption. Especially since it is a very difficult subject to study and has a limited amount of literature",
    "If you are an upper student interested in global affairs, poli sci, or anything else of the sort, this course is an essential to round out your learning. Corruption continues to be a major issue globally, and it would behoove students to be aware of how it works, at least at a bare-bones level. This course, as a broad overview, provides more than enough information to be literate in the subject matter.",
    "Absolutely, this is one of the best courses I've taken.",
    "Yes"
