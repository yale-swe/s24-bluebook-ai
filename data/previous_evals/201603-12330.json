    "I learned about a variety of new and old techniques in chemical biology, learned to think through experimental design questions and got a broader understanding of the field.",
    "I was able to tie in a lot of information I learned in biochem with actual chemical processes and reactions. Additionally, I gained a lot of new insight into current technologies in chem bio and molecular bio and the mechanisms behind how they work.",
    "For me, Chemical Biology successfully condensed a portion of a rapidly growing field into a semester long course that focuses on experimental design and analytical thinking. I learned some key ideas in each area and worked on my arrow pushing in the context of biological reactions.",
    "Various chemistry tools and insights into biomolecules, and the newest progress in current research and methods",
    "You learn a lot about the overlap between chemicals and biology.",
    "Learned a lot about the techniques that power the field of chemical biology. Practiced experimental thinking with these techniques. Learned about the different scientific areas that chemical biology can be used to probe.",
    "This was my first introduction to chemical biology, and it made me realize that I find the field very interesting and exciting.",
    "I learned a lot about the chemical bases of many biological processes, but even more about how we would study these using chemistry and biochemistry. I also gained important skills in reading and analyzing scientific literature and designing experiments.",
    "- how to better read biology papers - different techniques for designing biological experiments - how to write an NSF grant proposal - practice giving research presentations",
    "Learned about suite of methods for applying chemistry to biological investigations - survey type course, so hard to sum up.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could have used more clarity. It was not always clear what was required of the students. The course, however, was useful in a way many chemistry courses are not in that it actually taught about laboratory techniques in addition to the underlying science.",
    "I believe the course would benefit from replacing Dr. Crawford with another lecturer. Other than that, it was a good course.",
    "The lectures were interesting and for the most part clear. However, I think students (especially the undergrads) could benefit from more guidance on writing and presenting the final proposal.",
    "Both Prof Crawford and Prof Slavoff are excellent instructors. On occasion, one would cover material that the other had previously lectured on. Nothing egregious, and sometimes the review was needed. :)",
    "Fascinating topics, and close connection to real and current research. Passionate, engaging and approachable professors. Rewarding and interesting psets that I learned a lot from! Morning office hours were a little too early-- by 8 am most dining halls are not even open for breakfast yet. But the professor were flexible with other meeting times, so it wasn't a major issue.",
    "The course was very dry but you cover a lot of material.",
    "As a survey course, chem 421 gives students a good spread of information in the field, but because of this there is no big sense of building upon previous lectures. The couse's focus on experimentation instead of memorization is nice.",
    "Strengths--very reasonable amount of work, good amount of material. Weaknesses--very focused on teaching biological applications for chemists, not super useful for someone already versed in molecular biology.",
    "I thought this class was not as well taught or organized as I wanted it to be, particularly in the first half of the class. It felt as though it were essentially designed for biology students to get an extend themselves into the field of chemistry, but as a course in the chemistry department, I felt that more attention should have been paid to the more chemistry-focused aspects of the field and that the course should have been taught with those with a stronger chemistry background (who may not have had as much of a background in biology). As someone with an organic chemistry background who is really interested in using chemistry to answer biological questions, I did eventually learn a lot from the class, but the way it was taught made it difficult. The notes relied mainly on figures and graphs from papers, and if you were not familiar with the biologist's way of presenting information or with biological assays, you would be really confused about the core details about the class. I think the professors could have very quickly explained how the results could have been interpreted as they went along, allowing all students to gain an understanding, no matter their background. I felt like I was at a disadvantage not having studied biology papers in detail compared to students who had taken only intro chem courses, which seemed counterintuitive for an advanced chemistry course. In a similar vein, I think the NSF proposal was a lot to expect from students who are not familiar enough with biology to know what problems should\/could be solved. Particularly because many of the students in the class are working in biology labs or are chem bio grad students and could just apply course to their own projects, while the chemistry students had to start totally from scratch. I think it was an interesting final project, but I think it's important for the professors to have this in mind, because the proposal was really stressful for me when I don't think it was meant to be. That being said, I did get enough from the course to be interested in potentially doing something related to chem bio in grad school next year.",
    "CHEM 421 was both a challenging and rewarding class. I personally found the lectures to be incredibly cool, sometimes verging on mind-blowing, but it was also very difficult. I wouldn't really change much about the course. I particularly liked Professor Slavoff's teaching style, but I found that both professors were able to adequately present the material.",
    "I think this course needs to put more emphasis on the theory behind the topics covered rather than on experimental design. This is the only chemical biology course available to undergrads, and I felt like the material was oriented more towards grad students. Maybe there could be optional sections so that people could go in and ask questions, especially since both professors are based on West Campus, so it is hard to go to them for office hours.",
    "Profs Slavoff and Crawford teach the individual concepts very well, and are clearly enthusiastic about the subject matter. A major problem I had with the class was that it seemed to assumed a laboratory background that not all students had (and that I didn't have), and that assumption made it hard to do some of the assignments that involved experimental design, and often made me feel like I was behind and couldn't ask questions about experimental work. However, even with this I felt like I learned a lot about biochemistry, chemistry, biology, and how these fields work together (especially as someone who hasn't taken biochemistry, I was glad these all came to work together).",
    "The class is well structured and taught. Each lecture covered a specific area in Chemical Biology. The professors were very good at explaining key concepts, and were also very approachable after class. The Psets were slightly hard (and long sometimes), but there were only 4 and questions were all well thought out.",
    "Strengths: lectures were interesting and clear, problem sets and exams were interesting, papers were really interesting, beneficial to learn about NSF proposals, professors were really engaged and helpful Weaknesses: 8a office hours were really early"

   "comments": [
    "A really good upper-level chemistry class. You learn the principles and techniques of chemical biology and then apply them in psets, a research proposal and presentation, and on tests. Very useful especially if your research relates to chemical biology.",
    "I would recommend the course! The material is very interesting and Dr. Slavoff is a strong enough lecturer to make up for Dr. Crawford. One of the best chem classes I've taken at Yale, in part because of the coherent and interesting selection of material.",
    "I would recommend this course to a chemistry major looking for an interesting but not overwhelming elective to take. There are only 4 psets which made the workload quite manageable but the midterm and final were pretty tough.",
    "Chemical Biology is a fantastic course. The material is very much interdisciplinary between chemistry and biology (as the name would suggest) so I think it can be a challenging at first for chemistry majors not used to bio, but Jason and Sarah are both deft and able instructors with frequent office hours. Take it!",
    "Incredibly interesting class at the least, the professors (Slavoff & Crawford) are superb and teach with clear passion and love to engage with students on topics they are interested in. The topics are very relevant to current research so it's really immediately inspiring. The psets are cool and makes you learn as well without being too difficult.",
    "I don't think that I would. I don't think the knowledge that you get out of it is worth the rather difficult memorization.",
    "Chemical Biology introduces you to biological applications of chemical tools--things like fluorescent probes, unnatural amino acids, CRISPR, DNA sequencing. As an MB&B major, I felt like a lot of what we learned was a slightly more chemically rigorous version of what I already knew from other biology classes (i.e. MB&B 301) and from doing molecular biology research. Still, the class was engaging and well-taught, and the workload (2 exams, 4 psets, and a short grant proposal) was very reasonable. 9am in CRB twice a week was absolutely brutal.",
    "Take the course because the content is cool, but the teaching can be frustrating at times. I really enjoyed learning about chemical biology (and in the end I was glad I took this course), but if you have more of a chemical background than a biological background, this course is not taught to your level\/interests. This may seem counterintuitive considering that it is in the chemistry department, but the professors don't seem to realize that not everyone has the same biology background. That being said, you can still get a lot out of it, and I finished the class deciding to I might want do something in the intersection of organic chemistry and chemical biology in the future. But it can be frustrating to read the notes and not really understand what is being demonstrated, since a lot of them just show the results of biological studies without explaining how to interpret them.",
    "Yes! I took chemical biology as a sophomore MB&B major coming straight out of orgo, and I found it to be far harder and more interesting than any of my other classes. It probably takes a certain type of person to really love the material and put in the time to pour over it for the tests (which were quite hard), but if you really like chemistry and biology, this class can be extremely rewarding. Do be prepared to be treated like a grad student; be organized about studying in advance and start your research proposal early (and talk talk talk to the professors if you're confused about how to begin!) But if you put in the work and are organized, you will get a huge amount out of this class.",
    "This course focuses on experimental methods. It assumes a solid biology and organic chemistry background, so if you haven't taken biology\/biochemistry in while, you will need to do some review work on your own. If you're a chemistry major, this is one of the best chemistry electives I have taken in terms of the organization of the material. But if you are looking for an introduction to chemical biology or a theoretical understanding of chemical biology subjects, this may not be the best class for you.",
    "Strongly recommend. This is by far the best class I've taken at Yale. The concepts are interesting, and the workload is not very heavy.",
    "A really great course! Lots of interesting material."
