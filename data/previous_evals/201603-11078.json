   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about recent Latin American history and the many social and political revolutions there. It helped me think about social changes and view history in a new light.",
    "I learned a LOT of Latin American history and politics, which is valuable to me as an academic (I'm a history major and there haven't been many opportunities to learn Latin American history) and as a world citizen (most of the history we discussed has major legacies in today's world politics and culture.)",
    "The better question is what doesn't this course teach. I learned about the Cold War from an entirely different perspective, read about the history of so many different countries, and gained the skills to analyze a country from its own perspective and tease out the different relevant threads of historical impact.",
    "I felt like I learned a gained a solid survey-level amount of knowledge about the specific countries we looked at: Cuba, Chile, Venezuela, a lot on Nicaragua, and a bit on Colombia and Bolivia. I wouldn't say I learned much about historical methods or theory of historiography, but that also was not why I took the course. I think I got a very good introduction to the complexities of the individual countries' histories, as well as a better sense of the regional dynamics. Felt like I got a great sense of just how complicated and multi-sided conflicts in Latin America were in the 20th century.",
    "Revolutionary Change and Cold War in Latin America is hands down one of the greatest intellectual experiences I have had over the course of my Yale career. A rigorous course, it combines intense written requirements with deep, reflective class discussion. This is not a course that simply imbues you with informationyou will learn to synthesize, challenge, and refine your points of view using some of the most stimulating theoretical and philosophical methods known to academia. If you come in, as I did, with a very Western-centric view of the Cold War, you will be amazed to discover the incredible nuance of so many of the smaller societies you study. In many ways, this course is a history of the untold, the un-emphasized, and the forgotten.",
    "A wonderful, comprehensive course taught from a different perspective than what is commonly offered in other US\/Euro\/Soviet-centric Cold Wat classes.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount from this course, not only about the complex dynamics of revolutions in Latin American and Caribbean countries, but also how to engage and think critically about these histories from a diverse array of sources.",
    "I had a basic knowledge of Latin American history before I took this class, but this class gave me both a theoretical framework and the historical detail to really understand the impact of the Cold War on Latin America. I feel better prepared to analyze not only Latin American history, but also current events in Latin America and US foreign policy past and present.",
    "An excellent, eclectic, and fascinating background in the themes that have characterized revolutionary politics in the region cultural, economic, racial and societal, and to do with international politics."

   "comments": [
    "The materials are fascinating, and each section is super well-organized. I especially like the guiding questions. Although we did not go through all of them, it was great just considering all those questions during my free time. As for the downside, I just think the size of the seminar makes it hard to participate effectively sometimes, but I did like the two debates and the guests.",
    "Strengths--the readings were so helpful; they really got me invested in what we were learning. The assignments also kept me engaged as well as helped me expand my own independent learning and research. The group of people I took the class with also helped me learn through class discussions. Weaknesses-I did like some of the films, but others were kind of boring and it amplified the workload for this class to do a film screening most weeks.",
    "Good overview of political conflicts in Latin America. Wish the professor had intervened more to guide discussions. Evaluation format was very fair and interesting.",
    "This course has no weaknesses and there is nothing that could be done to improve it. This is there greatest course I have taken while at Yale.",
    "Strengths: Good readings, interesting topics, Prof. Joseph did a great job of setting the stage\/framing each week's questions. I particularly liked the more non-traditional classes--debates, speakers coming into class, etc. In retrospect, I quite enjoyed writing the journal entries. Weaknesses: I often felt that the student discussion didn't grow into or towards any bigger questions or take-aways. The student presentations--especially those that only laid out basic timelines--were both quite boring and very unhelpful if you had done the reading. I wish we had had more sources introduced during the class--images, clips, documents--and discussed those in light of the readings. I think this would have given the class discussions more specific questions to work with. Also a few weeks the readings were really excessive--like 200 pages of coursepack reading--which made it hard to actually give full attention to all the readings. Most weeks the reading was very reasonable, though!",
    "Fantastic. Discussion was engaging, assignments were challenging but unique and a pleasure to complete. Reading material was spot-on.",
    "Really great class, a ton of readings though. The Nicaragua book (I think walker and wade) was a little too biased and it may be good to read a bit less from that book and use some more conservative sources to balance it out, though I do think with Nicaragua, especially the readings before the debate, we did get a good perspective on both sides.",
    "Professor Joseph takes on a mentorship role for al interested studnets, which makes him a rare find at Yale.",
    "To me, the readings and films of this course were absolutely spectacular, so that I really enjoyed doing the homework. They set us up for really engaging conversations and, because they often featured multiple perspectives about single events, they were always thought-provoking and challenging. Having really strong material to discuss made the class as a whole really excellent.",
    "Smaller group would be better"

   "comments": [
    "This is fantastic seminar on Latin America during the Cold War. Even though we were only able to spend one or two classes on each country (besides Nicaragua), I feel like I have a much better understanding of the time period and overarching themes. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about revolution in Latin America from both a cultural and political lens.",
    "Yes. Professor Joseph is absolutely wonderful, and the materials are super interesting. I don't see how anyone can regret taking the class.",
    "Take this class! You do not have many opportunities at this school to invest in Latin American politics, history, and culture; to do so with such simultaneous breadth and depth, or to do so with such an excellent and knowledgable professor. It is a lot of work and you will get out what you put in. But you won't regret it.",
    "Absolutely! This is a course that every single student at Yale should be required to take, especially anyone who has plans to go in to policy or simply wants to better understand the world. This class not only provides a deep understanding of the history of many Latin America countries, but it also presents a different perspective on the Cold War. It is important to realize that the U.S. and USSR were not the only two countries during that time period. Many in Latin America were actively trying to improve their domestic situations through revolutions. It is fascinating to learn about the hope, implementation, and relative successes and failures of many revolutions. There is much to be gained from this course and everything you learn is still so relevant to the world we live in today. Some important insights include the importance of culture and local histories, the impact of foreign involvement, and the process of improving a society. In addition to all of the above, Gilbert Joseph is the greatest professor that you could have at Yale. He is not only an expert on the material, but he also cares deeply about his students and their learning. This is not an easy class to get in to, but if you have the opportunity, you NEED to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I thought the material was really interesting, and modern Latin American history is a topic that is really under-studied and under-taught at Yale. The readings were good, the journal-and-paper combination was totally reasonable, and Gil Joseph is a wonderful and caring professor. I didn't feel incredibly challenged by this class, but I still a learned a lot and I quite enjoyed it!",
    "If you take only one history class over the course of your Yale career, for your own sake, let this be it. A stunningly well-crafted course taught by one of the most insightful, passionate, and caring professors at Yale, Revolutionary Change and Cold War will debunk all of your previous preconceptions surrounding the Cold War, and will leave in their wake a comprehensive, provocative, and fiercely intellectual synthesis of Latin American trends during one of the most tumultuous times in world history. The workload is fairly substantial, but if you put in the time, you will reap the rewardsboth academically and philosophically. All in all, a truly wonderful experience.",
    "Take it! Professor Jospeh is a caring professor and the material is extensive. You will learn a lot about the region and period by the time you are done.",
    "this class is really great, but if you actually do all the readings, which I did and it seems like almost everyone in the class did, you're going to really work a lot. The class was superb and I now have a sense of Latin America's history that I'd never been taught before.",
    "yes! take it for professor joseph if for anything at sll",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Joseph is such a knowledgeable and wonderful person, and he leads this seminar in such a successful way by both directing discussion but really allowing the students to take charge.",
    "Highly recommend this class. To me, the best part of this class were the readings and films, which were detailed, thought-provoking, and showcased many different perspectives and ideologies. If you're going to take this class, you should commit to doing as much of the reading as you can (there's sometimes a ton, so even if it's impossible to do all of it try to do a good chunk!). The readings set you up for a really interesting discussion in class. The use of film and fiction in this class make it especially fun. Professor Joseph is sweet and supportive. It was a really good experience!",
    "I would recommend it to another student if he\/she is prepared to do a lot of readings\/preparation for class",
    "Amazing course. Wonderful array of readings and films, and Professor Joseph is one of the best on this campus."
