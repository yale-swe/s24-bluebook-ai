   "comments": [
    "It was an excellent course that provides a good overview of the scholarship in the field.",
    "Would recommend - very well organized and structured with a good representative selection of modern critical theory, well presented by a capable instructor.",
    "We read and discussed art historical scholarship from the 19th-21st century in its historical context, and considered it in relation to students' areas of specialization. Ultimately, we were asked to apply a method in a way that furthered our understanding of a work of art from our specialized areas. I think every professor probably teaches this course differently, and it's required, but if it were optional with Zeidler, I would recommend it.",
    "A good rite of passage for any incoming grad student. Not a course where you learn the entire history of the discipline, nor one in which you understand all its recent critical currents and \"schools\"... but it teaches us to think in different ways. It also helps us \"find our own voice\" or a strain of thinking we might self-identify with.",
    "Through reading key texts, this course considers various methodological approaches to the History of Art. Each week's discussion is based on a different method. The work culminates in paper that examines a work of art using one of the methods. Discussion with others whose backgrounds were different from my own was a highlight of the course for me. The course's strength is in breadth rather than depth, but is an important one for any historian of art."

   "comments": [
    "Had this been my entry into art history, I would not have continued.Intellectually incapable.",
    "It was very helpful in becoming more acquainted with the past scholarship in the field.",
    "Acquaintance with contemporary methodologies is clearly of great importance for any historian in any field.",
    "It has encouraged me to think flexibly about my field.",
    "I think this course was most helpful when we got to do our own writing. I don't think that the 12 or so texts we were assigned in any way come close to giving us a broad knowledge of the discipline, but the course gave us tools for thinking about the discipline, and for reading and writing. Because one of the art historians we read is particularly relevant to my own interests, I found the opportunity to engage more deeply with his texts to be useful for me. I do think, however, that a \"history of art history\" class or a \"critical art history\" class that looks at strains and schools of thought in the last 30 years would be helpful. I also think that a \"writing for art history\" course would be useful. We might benefit in our formation as art historians from a course that, for example, assigned 1 historiography paper, 1 bibliographic paper, 1 research paper, and 1 theory paper. Perhaps we could also read each others writing, or analyze together. Because we don't really get specific training on \"how to write and research\" for art history... aside from our individual seminar papers.",
    "I hadn't read most of the works on the syllabus before, and the course gave me a good background in the history of methodology. In many ways it seemed too short, though, and that the syllabus left out areas of theory that would have been helpful to read. The course provided a taste of the methods, but I think in order to apply them to future research I would need to study them more deeply."
