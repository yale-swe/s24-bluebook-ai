   "comments": [
    "It's a seminar that talks about the relationship between church and state, mostly in America, and how it's changed over time. I would definitely recommend it - it's a great seminar.",
    "Good deal of reading but great class. You will get a lot out of it if you do the work. If you are interesting in religion and how it influences the political world in which we live then you definitely should take this class.",
    "This class consists of two parts. The first half is a blitz review of the literature surrounding religion, morality, public life, and politics including Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, the Founding Fathers, and Charles Taylor\u0092s magnificent \u0093A Secular Age.\u0094 The second half consists of an overview of relevant topics in American politics, ranging from partisan religious politics to the convoluted history of the Supreme Court on church and state. Throughout, Prof. Bilakovics stresses the root questions these ask: what is the goal of government? what role does morality have in government? Whose morality will that be? Why?I would very strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the topic (and who doesn't mind doing some dense reading). It\u0092s a very helpful overview, and you\u0092ll be in a class of interesting people that will have very interesting conversations every week. The reading responses (3) are a little more intense than for other classes I've had (1000 words, or a short essay), but overall it's not bad!",
    "Yeah, came away with a lot of insight on the issues of the course and can carry on a decent conversation on them! Take it, if you can!!",
    "recommend it",
    "Yes, this class has a lot of reading but is great. Bilakovics works through the material well, illuminates a lot about the foundation of our thinking on this issue, and therefore challenges many assumptions about the proper role of church and state separation in the US. If the title of the class sounds interesting to you, the class will too.",
    "Very interesting class, worth taking to better understand the American political system and its relationship with religion and morality. Not too much work, good readings.",
    "yes. possibly the best course I have taken at yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I usually hate seminars, but this course was really interesting. The readings were interesting. Unlike most seminars, it wasn't just listening to other students bullshit and try to impress each other. I liked that the professor put a lot of effort into explaining things, too."
