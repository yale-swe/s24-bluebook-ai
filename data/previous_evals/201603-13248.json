   "comments": [
    "Strengths: this content is of utmost importance and I liked the impromptu teaching style rather than powerpoint presentations. Weaknesses: because the subject matter was organized during class (and not prior in powerpoint slides), it made some more complex topics difficult to grasp. Nothing we couldn't figure out using the book, though. The book is amazing! It's one of the few textbooks I'm going to keep forever.",
    "I think it's clear that our teacher understands this really well. I think the best way to improve the course would be to not have her write out the lecture notes during class but maybe have them typed up or something. I had a hard time reading her handwriting and I wasn't fast enough to write everything down when I heard it, so I felt like I missed a lot of good information that I wanted in my notes.",
    "I waived this course.",
    "The instructor presents material in a disorganized, unclear, uncoordinated manner that forces students to spend a disproportionate amount of time teaching themselves the material outside of the classroom. Her teaching style is completely incongruous with the rest of the YSPH professors' approaches. Her illegible handwriting and use of outdated projectors makes it impossible to re-visit the lecture material outside of class. Lectures fail to build on one another, and each lesson I felt confused, lost, and frustrated.",
    "This course serves its purpose as a introduction to biostatistics. Lectures are well organized. However, I think the labs are hugely unnecessary and I found it easier to learn on my own using the PowerPoints. This is not a critique on the TAs but is more a critique on the structure of the course.",
    "I found little strengths in the course. I learned more from the textbook and my peers than the lecture itself.",
    "A lot of it was focused on reading SAS readout accurately, whereas SAS is declining in usage. I think that the course needs to teach R as part of its requirements as well or instead, instead of as an option.",
    "I waived out.",
    "Integrating the SAS programming with biostatistics was very helpful and gave immediate real world applications.",
    "I liked the computer portion the best.",
    "Great!",
    "I wish we had more frequent homeworks, so that I could have practiced the problems more regularly and in conjunction with learning the new course material each week.",
    "The way she lectures is extremely hard to read her slides. Could benefit from writing on the board or slides",
    "I thought that a strength of the class was its emphasis on learning SAS and understanding\/interpreting the outputs.",
    "I think this course needs some more in-class structure. The way that the professor takes notes is extremely confusing and disjointed. I had to teach the material to myself by reading the textbook because her notes don't make sense out of context.",
    "This course fails to teach the theoretical underpinnings of many of the equations and techniques that asks students to apply. In so doing, it encourages rote application of statistical tools and hypothesis testing (especially at the 0.05 level of statistical significance), which has been intelligently critiqued by the likes of Drs. Deirdre McCloskey, Stephen Ziliak, John Ionnidis, and is increasingly rejected by professional societies and journal editorial boards. As the only biostatistics class many public health students will take, the class has a responsibility to educate students to be more responsible consumers and producers of statistics. It has failed in doing this. This class could be easily improved by incorporating more critical approach to its methods, and by including more mathematical and theoretical background to the concepts and techniques that it teaches. The biostatistics department might even want to consider developing an alternative introductory statistics sequence for interested students that does this.",
    "This course gives me an introduction to sas coding as well as some refresh of memory of college stats",
    "I didn't need to take this class because I was exempted but in the end I was very glad that I did. I feel like I learned a lot and it paired really well with epi. It gave me a really good foundation, and the SAS component was also helpful.",
    "Everything was good except that I can't understand why Prof. Claus doesn't do slides. I missed some classes and found it hard to catch up since her doctorly handwriting is sooooooooo confusing. There was a guest lecturer, Yasmynn, her slides were really good and informative.",
    "Good",
    "Strengths: The lab section of the course was really helpful in learning SAS and how to integrate what we learned in the textbook with real life coding application Thought the tests were fair and the homework was just enough.",
    "You learn the basics of biostatistics; however, the instructor moves very quickly in class so you have to spend a lot of time learning concepts on your own if you are unfamiliar with them prior to the start of the course.",
    "This course would benefit from more streamlined, focused formatting for lecture. It is much easier for students to learn from powerpoint slides that have the pertinent information than from projector sheets with notes.",
    "The instructor's manner of teaching is very transparent, interactive, and straightforward. Despite complex content, the materials were consistently presented in a clear, organized fashion. The homework problems were sufficient to cover the material from class but not overly burdensome or repetitive. The examinations were also sufficient to test the knowledge garnered from the course and book, but not overly burdensome or impossible. I would suggest one small addition. Recording the classes and making the audio files available online would be of some benefit in the event a student has to miss an occasional class. I had to miss a couple of classes for medical reasons and garnered less from the material by not having the instructor's explanation to accompany the class notes.",
    "The lectures failed to convey the information students need to truly understand the concepts we need. There are no slides, no guides, nothing to help us for exam prep, other than the previous year's exams (which did not clearly and 100% correspond to the methods we've been learning).",
    "- Mauricio being a rockstar teacher, and Dr. Claus being so accessible and friendly.",
    "Well organized. Grading kind of unfair.",
    "I think that this course was well constructed. One way to improve this course may be to separate the SAS portion from the main portion of the course into its own separate course.",
    "This course is supposed to teach statistics and basic SAS, but is not very cohesive. The lectures are rushed and topics are explored briefly, without being explained in depth.",
    "It was a great to be able to apply our knowledge through the SAS lab. It was great to see how the lecture series incorporated SAS in addition to the practice we have in lab. This class would be more enjoyable had it been at a later time.",
    "The class was pretty straightforward, although the 8:30 time slot was a bit rough, especially since the format is entirely lecture-based. The workload is reasonable, and the TA's are helpful.",
    "Strenghts- Understanding of basic Bio statistics",
    "Strengths - well organized; deadlines, grading, and expectations were transparent; very well taught (both Professor Claus and the TAs), excellent balance between lecture and SAS lab; instructors were accessible via office hours Weaknesses- none",
    "It was a good course. It utilized SAS instruction. Strength - demonstrated statistical principles through SAS. Weakness - didn't allow students to develop skills in SAS to an extent where we can use it in applied settings.",
    "The course objectives were filled; it provided enough material for an intro biostats course",
    "If you can exempt, exempt. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Just stay clear. You've done this before. Otherwise, it's fine.",
    "I learned a lot of useful information.",
    "Biostatistics in interesting, but we didn't learn much through the course. We spent most of our time keeping up with the intense busy work.",
    "The homework assignment kind of felt like a high school course workload. The contents of the book were interesting in that it related to real life situations, which kept me engaged but other than that it felt like a standard mathematics course. If you can opt out of it, I would recommend doing so.",
    "Strengths definitely are the in-class problem solving. Powerpoints may be better for certain topics.",
    "I felt the lecture style was not very accessible. It would have been more helpful to have power point slides or some way of organizing information in a clear, concise way. I also felt like the hw and labs often didn't match what we were learning in class, which was frustrating.",
    "Solid course. Well organized. Well taught.",
    "Standard basic statistics course. Could be improved by focusing more on real-world applications.",
    "Strengths: - I had a good SAS teaching fellow who made me feel confident about using the program as well as continuing to learn beyond the course. - Though there was a bit of a learning curve for me at the beginning, I found that the lectures were clear when it came to explaining main concepts. The book also helped me immensely in clarifying anything that I needed more information on. Weaknesses: - Not so much a weakness as a suggestion; I thought it would have been helpful to have broken up the homework problems so that we would complete them by week\/topic (rather than having many problems due at once)",
    "Class size is too big.",
    "I audited this course. Overall, I thought it was a good course, but the teaching was not easy to follow.",
    "I wish we had more practice problems to study for the exams."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought Dr. Claus did a wonderful job relaying the information to us. She always tied the examples into real world scenarios, which helped frame the content and helped understand it.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I waived this course.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0While I know she is a brilliant individual, her teaching method is highly ineffective, and causes a great deal of stress for her students who struggle to follow along in class, read her handwriting, follow along with her logic, or understand her disjointed examples. She assumes a level of understanding that simply does not exist, nor should not exist in an introductory course.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The lectures are adequately organized and Prof Claus clearly is an experienced teacher. Her strengths are in responding to student questions. The one downfall is that her notes are nearly impossible to follow. PowerPoints! Please!!!! Otherwise she is lovely.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I found lecture to be confusing and not very helpful in preparing us for the homework and exams. Each lecture was not well organized and it was difficult to connect the dots throughout the course of semester. I suggest using slides, as it was very hard to read her handwriting.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very clear explanations. Very encouraging (and pragmatic) in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I waived out.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Improve handwriting",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought that Professor Claus taught the course well. She was especially helpful in answering questions during office hours\/individually. Her expectations for students were always clear, and her exams and assignments were fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I think Prof. Claus is brilliant but her teaching style is not helpful for me. Her notes need structure, often I am not sure she is trying to solve because she'll go off into tangents or won't finish something all the way through. I thought the guest lecturer (Yasime?) was great because she laid out a clear outline for us. Claus should try to structure her notes, out of context, I can't make any sense of her handwritten transparency notes. The lines between the foundation and the examples she makes in class are blurred and I can't tell anything apart.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof. Claus glosses over in-depth theoretical\/mathematical explanations of questions and concepts that she is teaching. In so doing, she encourages the rote and mindless use of statistical tools.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0At first i was not used to her teaching style but as soon as I understood her teaching method I think she taught this course very well!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was extremely helpful! Her teaching style takes some getting used to though because she is kind of sporadic, but once you look through the textbook and her notes you have a pretty good understanding!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Sometimes it was difficult to read the handwriting, and as much as it kept me engaged, I would have appreciated it if it were done differently. For instance, providing recordings of the lectures would tremendously help (for going back to the lecture notes later). Also, there does not seem to be a good communication between what is discussed during the lecture and TFs. Sometimes, I received two to three different opinions on how to approach the homework problems.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strength: very clear learning goals & objectives, well-structured framework. Weakness: please do slides instead of handwriting!!!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I had a lot of trouble understanding Dr. Claus. There were many times when I felt that the flow of the lecture was scattered and I could not follow what she was trying to do. There were often small mistakes that she made when teaching that I otherwise would not have known if other students hadn't pointed it out; if it weren't for other students, I would have just learned the wrong formula, etc. without knowing that it was wrong. Her teachings hardly prepared us for the assignments. I relied mostly on the textbook to teach me how to do the homework problems despite going to every single class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good at explaining the concepts although I thought her handwriting for lecture notes were a little hard to read if you got lost for a quick minute. I think what would be really useful would be just at the beginning of lecture like a 3 second, 3 bullet point outline of what will be covered today to guide us",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0It would be helpful to use powerpoint notes and go over more examples",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Simply said, the instructor made this course what it was. Her style of teaching, her design of homework and examination questions, and her communication abilities ensured presentation of the materials in a fashion that permitted students to maximize learning the concepts of the class. I came into the program assuming that biostatistics would be my least favorite and most challenging course. Although the content was complex, the presentation of it and the homework, labs, and examinations designed, made me excited to learn more and elevated biostatistics to an area of high interest for me.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Wonderfully accessible. She went a bit fast, but when I went back and reviewed each lecture I was able to sort out what she did!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is very intellectual and inspiring. I like how she organized the class. Writing was a bit unclear at times, but she made biostats easier.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Although it seems like the instructor is passionate about biostatistics, she does little to inspire this interest in students, leaving the TFs to answer most of students questions. Her lack of availability is understandable, having many other responsibilities. However, it is very difficult to reach Claus for any questions outside of immediately after class. Much of the traditional teaching responsibilities are passed on to the TFs, only half of who were actually knowledgeable in the subject area and good teachers. The accompanying SAS labs were very basic and not very useful for real research settings, as most procedures were common knowledge and could be found online.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0A great teacher, always open to questions and knew how to explain everything in a clear fashion.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was an amazing instructor. She made difficult concepts easy to understand through lecture. I would take a course with her again. I liked the packets she provided; they helped me understand SAS.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She presented the material in a straightforward manner, and was happy to answer any questions the students had. Sometimes having the whole class as a lecture could be a little tiring, so it might be good to break it up with some more questions to the class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Huge knowledge base and very experienced",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Excellent instructor! Not only is Professor an expert, she was also so good about explaining things clearly and answering student questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strength - explained principles well, the content was not too difficult. Weakness - class lecture notes were difficult to read and interpret.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very knowledgeable of the material, and great sense of humor. I understand the necessity to write quickly during class, but notes could be more legible",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Thank you so much for the semester I learned a lot of useful information.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an amazing instructor. She explains complicated concept very well, and is really prompt in replying emails.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is extremely hard to follow, which makes the material hard to grasp. She teaches by writing on a projector and her handwriting is hard to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very down to earth and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0It would be helpful if the course were a little more organized. It felt like assignments didn't macth up with the content from our lectures, and it was difficult to follow the lectures in general. The projector slides were at time difficult to read, and because we often switched back and forth between them in lecture, it was difficult to take notes that made sense to study from.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Excellent instructor. Know the subject very well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The lectures were very clear. The lecture notes uploaded to classes*V2 (from the projections used in class) were difficult to refer back to when it came to studying for midterms\/finals (primarily in terms of legibility). Would be great to have those typed out if possible.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor used a projector to provide class notes. Her teaching methods were not very clear, her notes were not very legible, and it was confusing to follow her methods. I preferred to follow the notes of the textbook rather than the lecture notes because I did not find the lectures helpful.",

This class goes into some advanced concepts towards the middle\/end and it was so helpful taking BIS505 and EPI I simultaneously because it helped understand statistical significance as is used in epidemiological studies.",
    "It was okay. I mean biostats is never going to be exciting (for me at least), but it's important to know how to do these things, so it's a good course.",
    "I waived this course.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that this course will be the most stressful of your first semester, you will struggle, you will cry, you will have to teach yourself all the material, you will curse the professor, and then everyone will tell you that it's \"okay because we all go through it,\" which is an absolutely unacceptable response when we're paying so much money to LEARN. If I wanted to teach myself biostatistics I would not have come to Yale.",

    "I would recommend it as a basic overview of stats, but if they don't plan to use SAS (which a lot of departments\/professionals don't, even in public health) it might not be as useful. I wish I had also learned R this semester, but since SAS was used exclusively in lecture it made more sense to do the labs in R. I wish there had been lab sections devoted to R, rather than additional office hours above and beyond lab section.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for all fellow students, as the SAS component is invaluable for understanding how to apply the biostats concepts.",
    "Good introductory statistics course--would recommend this course especially for the exposure to SAS.",
    "Great! I would recommend this class. It help me to build bio statistic thinking.",
    "I recommend it to a student who hasn't taken a statistics course or, like myself, has been out of school for a while and forgotten their previous statistics instruction. I would recommend all students not completely proficient in SAS or R to audit the computer lab portion of the class. I would warn students that the material can sometimes be bit dull, but that it will be extremely useful as public health professionals and will echo through the other core classes as well.",
    "Very difficult, make sure you pay attention, and do not fall behind on the workload, there is very little space to catch up. I would not recommend it, if they had a chance to exempt the course, I would recommend that as a fair course of action.",
    "Willing to help but not helpful",
    "I think this course is important to lay a foundation for understanding epi analyses and learning SAS is extremely important. I just wish there was more structure and outline of the topics so I know which equations to use in different situations.",
    "This course will teach you to plug things into equations and run things on SAS without really knowing what you are doing. If you want to understand the theoretical underpinnings of common statistical techniques, either to be a better practitioner or consumer of articles employing statistics, look elsewhere.",
    "This class is a good course to take if you want to refresh your memory for college stats, and need some introduction to SAS coding.",
    "I would recommend if you don't have strong stats background! Im really glad I took it as a foundational component to my degree.",
    "Not that great of a course. It's too early, so it's difficult to focus on the material. Also, Professor Claus will handwrite all of the lecture notes as she's presenting, which can be difficult to read. But chances are, you're taking this class because you have to. In that sense, it's not terrible. Just not really a class I'd take for fun.",
    "There have been a few disappointments in the logistics of the class, but the material was interesting. It was like a review for me because it had been a while since I took my stats class. If one can exempt out for having it taken recently, I would say go ahead!",
    "It just takes place too early, especially in winters. And sometimes cost of missing class is tremendous since I don't recognize her handwriting.",
    "Good",
    "Easy if you've taken any introductory stats course before. Good refresher if it's been a while and will give you a good foundation for SAS if you came from an institution that used STATA or R. Would recommend unless you're pretty confident you can waive it.",
    "This course is helpful in understanding the basics of biostatistics; however, the pace is challenging. By the exams being open book\/open note however it is possible to do well in the class.",
    "I've waived this course, sorry for my limited feedback",
    "Yes. I would highly recommend this course. The course provides the foundation for biostatistical methods and delivers a perfect balance of concept and application.",

    "The class was pretty straightforward, although the 8:30 time slot was a bit rough, especially since the format is entirely lecture-based. The workload is reasonable, and the TA's are helpful.",
    "A must course to understand Bio stactistics core concepts.",
    "ATTENTION UNDERGRADUATES - if you are pre-med and looking for a stats class, BIS 505 is an outstanding option! I am an undergraduate (not in the 5 year BS\/MPH program). I took STAT 105 (intro stats: medicine) two years ago. BIS 505 is overall so, so much better! (1) The class is very well-taught. Professor Claus is an exceptional instructor. Her lectures are very good, and she is kind and accessible. (2) You will learn SAS - this is a major strength to this class. We had lectures twice a week and computer lab section once a week. I thought this was a perfect balance between learning and 'practice'. (3) Reasonable courseload - don't let the course's listing as a graduate class intimidate you! The courseload was extremely reasonable (4 PSETs, 1 midterm, 1 final). My classmates from the school of Public Health were so friendly! This was one of the first courses I've taken as an undergraduate, where I could really see myself putting all the information I learned into practice! I have nothing but praise for this class, Professor Claus, and the TAs.",
    "Helpful, it is one of few places for first years to obtain practical skills. SAS labs weren't too difficult and challenged us in a different way.",
    "I recommend it to students because it was a great intro biostat course that will come in handy for the people in the field of public health.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. Most of the information taught can be learned online in a clearer fashion.",
    "Very good intro course.",
    "Basic introduction to statistics, with a SAS component. Would recommend only if a student has never used SAS before.",
    "You will learn a lot of quantitative skills and concepts in this course that will be useful for other classes (certainly increased my \"public health literacy\" when it came to critical reviews of research papers). I was nervous about SAS at first, but the lecturer and teaching fellows make it super straightforward to learn (and it also helps with understanding the concepts learned in class).",
    "Yes, important as an intro class.",
    "I chose to exempt out of the course and to audit it instead. I would recommend any student to exempt out of it if they have taken statistics in the past and to audit it instead to supplement any material they may have forgotten.",
