    "Excellent course. Provides and solidifies foundational skills in biostatistics, study design and evaluation.",
    "The course provides overall information about clinical trial. The good thing is that through a final project, student can have a hands-on experience on designing a clinical trial. It helps student to think through the whole process. The overall workload is just at the good level. The weakness is maybe that the class is in the afternoon? It's easy to get drowsy at that time. It will be better to have group discussion session for the final project along the way than just turn in the whole thing at final week. It can force student to think and study the whole semester instead of just write up some random design in the end. Also the discussion can make the course more interactive.",
    "Outstanding course and very good and practical approach to a very complicated topic",
    "Passionate and good experience with clinical trials. The book is pretty good as well. Chapter 4 needs to be broken up and reorganized as it's basically an overview of the whole course and it takes too much time to go over all at once. Homeworks are okay, rather short. They should include questions pertinent directly to our ongoing final project so we can get feedback and be thinking about how these topics relate to our paper. Also couldn't read his handwritten notes to me.",
    "excellent",
    "taught clearly",
    "The course is very useful in learning how to design a clinical trial.",
    "Great topics coverage on clinical trials.",
    "Love the course instructor. Learned a lot in the class.",
    "The course was excellent. The slides were based on only one book prepared by the instructor. This made the course more focused on and more effective for learning what it matters. The format of delivery was also a strength since it allowed for questions at any time. Homework assignments helped to reinforce what we learned in class, and the project was a good opportunity to go over and apply what we have learned in the term. I cant see any weaknesses in the course.",
    "Think it would be helpful to discuss the proposal assignment in detail earlier so that students can meet with the Professor earlier."

    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Excellent instructor. Does an incredible job of instilling a sense of intuition.
