   "comments": [
    "Very information-dense class. Great necessary background for future higher level MCDB classes (which is why it is understandably a pre-req for many classes).",
    "I developed various knowledge about the realms of DNA and RNA--quite a lot of it.",
    "This course taught me about many important molecular biology topics, specifically those that are being researched now and in the future. I learned the incredibly detailed processes and mechanisms of the central dogma, and I also understood the experimental techniques used to study those processes.",
    "I learned a lot about the basis of biology as well as the way that molecular techniques are used.",
    "In-depth approach to molecular biology and its applications. Very cool stuff, and will definitely help to inform a possible career in the sciences.",
    "Studying skills, learned a lot about biology",
    "I took this class for premed requirements and MCAT prep, and I think that I got a great foundation for those goals.",
    "bio overview",
    "Good foundation in molecular biology fundamentals. In depth knowledge on the central dogma and how it was revised.",
    "This is a great course about the mechanisms of some fundamental cellular processes (transcription, translation, etc), as well as how they relate to disease and developing therapies. Highly recommend.",
    "I gained a lot of in depth knowledge about the central dogma.",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this course! The amount of molecular biology knowledge that one learns is excellent, plus we got really really good at reading a parsing complex scientific papers. Also, much of the course was focused on showing the applications and state of the field, which was a great way to stay engaged with the course. Overall, a great course and well worth the 9am start time if you enjoy the material.",
    "I learned SO much. This was an amazing class. You learn about the central dogma (and why it's kind of wrong) from every angle. A must take for MCDB majors. Furthermore, I feel like the weekly papers, while kind of rough sometimes, really made me a better science reader.",
    "This course was really good at both introducing and going into more depth about the field of molecular bio. The knowledge learned was all applicable, and it helped provide an interesting look into not only where the field came from, but where it's current directions are headed."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The TFs are super helpful and the professors are very willing and available to meet with you. The tests seem disproportionately challenging and I wish the expectations about what material would be covered on the test were clearer.",
    "The course has very strong instructors and TAs; they are clearly very knowledgeable and helpful. The tests could require a little less memorization.",
    "Lectures for this course were extremely informative and useful (even those it was hard to pay attention at 9 AM). Both professors had very detailed and understandable slides. However, the homework assignments did not facilitate my learning of the course topics. Also, I wish there were more opportunities to practice answering test questions or to discuss with TAs.",
    "The strengths of this course is its balance of knowledge-based learning and application-based learning. Weakness: 9am in KGL",
    "Strengths: fascinating material, interesting lectures, reading primary literature in section was great. Overall a good experience. Weaknesses: assessments were exclusively memorization-based. Anyone can memorize a few powerpoints and spit back that information on an exam. Scientists have to synthesize and apply that knowledge -- and there was limited opportunity to do that in this class. Also, 9am for lectures is brutal. I was interested and engaged with the material, and I still couldn't keep my eyes open.",
    "The class was well organized. The exams were tough but fair. The papers assigned for sections were sometimes unnecessarily tough to read and didn't improve my understanding much for how much time I spent trying to dissect them.",
    "Strengths: professors and TA's were very approachable and willing to help, content was interesting Weaknesses: the exams were very difficult to prepare for because there were no practice exams\/questions given out and the homeworks were not relevant to the exams.",
    "Should not be at 9am.",
    "There was a lot of material in this course, which was good. I'm glad that the tests were not cumulative, or else the information overload would have been too much. Something that could be better is that the test questions could be more problem solving-based instead of just pure memorization. That's what a lot of the course felt like, just pure memorization and regurgitation, which was frustrating and boring sometimes. If there were weekly problem sets with questions that applied the material (Ex: this mutant gene causes this phenotype, what is the mechanism by which this deficiency causes symptoms?), then that make the material more interesting for me.",
    "fair exams. good set up for hw and exam content",
    "The course was well organized and taught well. The sections were helpful in dissecting the papers. It would be better if the sections also went over key points from the lectures.",
    "I thought that we could have been better prepared for the first exam, and I'm not sure all the reading is entirely necessary to do well in the course, but overall I really enjoyed it.",
    "There is not enough support in this class for struggling students.",
    "Honestly, Professor Isaacs and Professor Pyle were awesome. I'm not sure how to improve it- it was streamlined, well-thought-out, and everyone was so invested in making sure you understood the information. A fantastic class.",
    "I found the papers we had to read for section not particularly useful. Rather than having to read these papers and write weekly reports on them, perhaps it would have been more useful to use sections as a review session instead.",
    "The strengths of the course lie with both the TAs and the Professors. Everyone involved with the course seemed seriously invested in getting you to learn the material involved, and was definitely passionate and interested in the material."

   "comments": [
    "It's better than cell bio if you need a core class for MCDB major. You will use the info learned in other higher level classes almost certainly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is very interested in molecular biology. If you are not very interested, it will be difficult to remain engaged through the difficult, detailed content",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course because of the level of difficulty and memorization required.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for someone who is interested in a mid-level MCDB elective. Professor Isaacs and Professor Pyle are both great lecturers and great people in general (they bought us donuts on the last day of lecture!), and the material is interesting and well-taught. Also, the exam\/homework grading was fair. The smaller size of this lecture (vs. Cell Biology) makes the class seem much more intimate.",
    "It's a solid course with a lot of helpful information for those who want to go into research or medicine.",
    "To another MCDB major, absolutely. Though the material is interesting, not necessarily accessible (or for that matter, interesting), to non-science majors.",
    "I would recommend this course. The material is interesting if you like knowing the nitty gritty of how things work in biology. There is a fair bit of memorization involved, especially of molecular structures, but it isn't too bad. The psets are based on research papers which can be unnecessarily tough to read, but the three exams aren't cumulative, which is fantastic.",
    "I'd recommend this class to a student if they're interested in molecular biology, want a small class size, and are good at memorizing facts from a textbook without practice exam questions",
    "WHY WAS THIS CLASS AT 9 AM?! The material is great, the slides are helpful and the exams test the material in question, but the 9am time slot was brutal. Make sure to get coffee before class.",
    "There is a lot of information in this course, but the three midterms are not cumulative and there is no final. This class is almost purely memorization of mechanisms and facts. The challenge is in the amount of info in each midterm.",
    "prepares you for future courses",
    "If you're interested in learning the nitty-gritty details of DNA, RNA and protein structure and function, this class is for you. (Be warned, though, that lectures are often slow and dry - especially with Isaacs.)",
    "Yes the course is a good foundations course on molecular biology. If you are looking for a manageable core MCDB course, this is a good pick.",
    "This is a great course about the mechanisms of some fundamental cellular processes (transcription, translation, etc), as well as how they relate to disease and developing therapies. Highly recommend.",
    "Not unless you are some sort of biology genius. The class is tough and it can be hard when you are struggling and it seems like you are the only one. There also aren't many resources to help struggling students. Aside from that, the material in this class is incredibly interesting, but the class does cover an insane amount of material.",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this course! The amount of molecular biology knowledge that one learns is excellent, plus we got really really good at reading a parsing complex scientific papers. Also, much of the course was focused on showing the applications and state of the field, which was a great way to stay engaged with the course. Overall, a great course and well worth the 9am start time if you enjoy the material. Both professors work well together and are well-known and respected experts in their fields, especially Professor Isaacs!",
    "YES. If you're MCDB, take this class. It provides an overview of the science material you need, and it also forces you to develop skills critical to research (analysis, application, science reading). The format is clear, and the exams are fair, even if they were long.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in molecular bio. It's a great starting point for learning the basics of the field, as well as learning enough to understand where the field can go and what parts of the field might interest them in the future.",
    "It's a very interesting class with two instructors who are leaders in their fields of DNA and RNA research. The course is lecture format with weekly sections for paper discussion and a few midterms interspersed throughout the semester. Overall, it's a bit easier than cell biology (MCDB 205) because of the sole focus on DNA and RNA topics, but because of this sole focus, the details are thorough and take some time to be fully understood. You're also better off if you understand organic chemistry and can draw structures well."
