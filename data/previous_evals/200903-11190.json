    "Yes I would recommend it. It is a pretty sound intro to the concepts and tools that political scientists need both to conduct their own research and to understand the work of their colleagues.",
    "It's good both for people who've taken some stats before and people who haven't taken any stats before.",
    "It is a pretty predictable statistics course, so I'm not sure what I would describe. Students have to take it, so there is no point in commenting on whether i would recommend it.",
    "I would strongly recommend the class.",
    "A good intro to statistics.",
    "It is basic statistics for people with totally no background. I would recommend people to skip it and start on the next course if they had any preparation for this type of work.",
    "If you need a crash course in statistics, then this might be good. But don't expect to come out of it with an every-day knowledge of statistical analysis that will readily translate into being able to more read journalism more skeptically, or express yourself in statistical language more precisely. The kind of statistical skills taught in this class seem more foundational than practical, which can be especially frustrating for those who know that they will not go on do to any more quantitative work."

    "Statistics is essential for a broad understanding of political science methods."
