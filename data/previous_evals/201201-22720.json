    "Take it if you'r interested in theory.",
    "This seminar is awesome. It's a lot of theory and occasionally classroom discussions grow stagnant, but the material is AMAZING and the course exposed me to some incredible Yale resources I'd never encountered. Definitely don't take the class if you're not highly interested in the function and history of the photograph, because the reading is intense enough to bore anyone not genuinely interested in the material. I actually really enjoyed the final project (a 15 page research paper in which you analyze a set of photographs against a text) and didn't think the workload was overbearing or unreasonable.",
    "I would summarize it as a course in which you get to look at a lot of Yale's great photography collections that you'd probably never seek out yourself otherwise, that can sometimes be a little frustrating in lack of structure. But again, you get out of it what you put in. Reading responses every week can be tough.",
    "Take it if you can get in! it's a great American Studies class."
