   "comments": [
    "Meh. I don't find the subject particularly interesting and Professor Casson is a fairly dry lecturer, so I was never particularly excited to go to class. That being said, the course covers the basic, low-level foundations of calculus, which is a valuable thing to know if you are interested in mathematics or related subjects. The class wasn't hard, 2-3 hour weekly problem sets, 2 midterms and a final, although the grading on the exams was extremely harsh. If you did everything correctly on a problem you get 10\/10 and if you make any tiny little mistake its instantly 3\/10 or less.",
    "Absolutely. this is an awesome class. definitely take it. A lot less work than 250",
    "You are taking this because you need it. Unless you are really good at math, take this instead of real analysis with Peter Jones.",
    "A good introduction to real analysis, to see if you wanna go further into that kinda stuff.",
    "Necessary class. It will teach you how to prove things. Exams are hard. Be ready to put in a lot of work. Prof is not very helpful in office hours.",
    "MATH 300 is a straightforward but difficult introduction to real analysis. When taught by Professor Casson, this course is fair and not too time-consuming. That said, it teaches you to always questions your assumptions in math, and it gives you a strong foundation in proof formulation and reasoning. With regard to the teaching, Professor Casson is a fantastic lecturer. He is very clear, moves slowly, and assumes nothing of his students. Sometimes students smirk or laugh when he pauses and asks things like, \"so how do we know 1\/n converges to 0?\" But Casson gets the last laugh on the test when these trivial assumptions come out to hurt you (he probably does not laugh at your pain, since he is too nice. He most likely winces at harming another human being in any way). Professor Casson follows the book closely, and you know what you're going to get. With regard the the coursework, it would be very helpful to read M. Reed's \"Fundamental Ideas of Analysis.\" Specifically the non-starred chapters from the index. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to be taken seriously as a mathematician. Everything before MATH 300 (except maybe 250 with Howe or 244 with Kaplan) will feel like a walk in the park.",
    "Organized lecture, disorganized office hour + help schedule. Exams were graded on a strict curve, problem sets not returned on time. You could study for weeks and still bomb it, or ace it.",
    "It really helped me gain a lot of information, I would recommend it to another student!",
    "YES! Professor Casson is awesome! If he's teaching it, take it! His lectures are incredibly clear and easy to follow. You can tell that he put in a lot of effort and preparation to make them that way. This is definitely the best math class I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would suggest you take Math 300 before Math 250. It seemed easier than Math 250, and Math 300 would be a good preparation for Math 250, which covers n-dimensions.",
    "Good course. The prof is very straightforward and I think he is a good teacher. He assumes no knowledge of upper level mathematics or of excellence at proof in class, and I think his solutions to problems make absolute sense to anyone of any skill level. One suggestion I would have is the following: in class, we prove many famous theorems that can be found in the textbook, and then homework and tests are usually using these proven famous theorems to prove other stuff. It would be nice to add an example in class of a proof like this, because sometimes the proofs that prove the textbook theorems are very different from the homework\/test type proofs that use the textbook\/famous theorems.",
    "MATH 300 is the perfect class for those who want exposure to a rigorous course in analysis but who arent quite ready for 301. Some would say that all we do is cover first-variable calculus in a proof-based manner, but I think that sells the class short. Analysis isnt just a topic, its a way of thinking about problems and concepts, and Cassons course provides excellent practice at solving problems in analysis and taking challenging, proof-based tests. Professor Casson is extremely thorough in lecture, which is incredibly helpful. On the whole, this is a solid course, and I recommend it to those who are curious about analysis, willing to do the work, and interested in improving their capacities as a mathematician.",
    "You probably don't have a choice, but Casson is perfect for this course. But he's a harsh grader on exams",
    "With Casson, this is a very reasonable class. The workload is manageable and the lectures are very organized, if not exciting. There will be no surprises, and you'll come out of it knowing a thing or two about analysis. But don't expect a fast pace --things that could be done in one lecture will sometimes drag on and on. Still, a good class overall.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. The quality of this course will vary greatly depending on the instructor. It's hard (especially for non-math geniuses competing with people who have taken Math 230). I've come out of the class a much better mathematician, but the pain I had to go through for it was perhaps not worth it.",
    "Math 300 was a great introduction to analysis. I hadn't written too many proofs before Math 300, but this course definitely made me more comfortable with writing them. The workload is not too bad. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if a student is interested in real analysis, this would be a good course to take.",
    "A. Needed for major. Casson is extremely clear with material. But harshest grader at yale and proud of it. He also doesn't give much info regarding exams.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to take it, and it's a better alternative than 301 with Jones. Still, the material is rather dry and the lectures even drier.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who was interested in mathematics. It lays the foundation for many other fields of math and is a great course."
