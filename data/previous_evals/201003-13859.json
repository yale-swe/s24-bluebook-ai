    "Yes. The collections in Beinecke, The Yale Art Gallery, and Haas Library proved invaluable to my individual research.",
    "Yes",
    "all resources were satisfactory beyond the slow response time of the rooms computer and the lack of network access to files. This is a problem across the board for seminar classes and must be addressed.",
    "Yes, they were great.",
    "It would have been nice to have the class in a room which had access to the YSOA servers, so that we could have access to presentations from the classes drive, for instance."
