   "comments": [
    "This is a fun class to take, especially if you are an American Studies major, or just like social and political history. It allows you to use sports as a lens through which to view larger historical issues, and teaches you to carefully look at many sides of an issue. It also makes you think about the effect of storytelling and the media. Be prepared to deal with a lot of issues that don't have an answer or a solution.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great class to learn about the icons in sports and how they both lived in and changed their time for sports and in any cases larger entities like America.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a fun and interesting class with one of the best and most enjoyable reading lists of any class I've taken at Yale. Dean Spooner is a wonderful professor who does a great job leading discussions and ensuring that class is always a lot of fun.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's a lot of work, but it's so much fun and definitely worth it!",
    "This is THE BEST class I took at Yale. You will look at issues of civil rights through the lens of sports -- both specific athlete case studies, or specific sports in general. Each week has a \"theme\" but is also really inspired by current events. There's a lot of work -- a book a week, sometimes a movie or some short clips, 4 reading responses, a midterm paper (basically a set of reading responses), and a term paper, but they're all actually fun assignments (even if you're finishing a thesis or something this semester) and definitely don't feel like work. Dean Spooner really, really cares about students, so take the time to get to know him too!",
    "If you like sports, leadership, or civil rights in any way, take this class! If you like American studies, take this class! It's such a unique and fascinating interdisciplinary course and I'm so glad I got to take it!",
    "Yes, definitely. A great class that I always enjoyed going to and never checked my watch because the conversation flowed so well and I always had something to say.",
    "I would absolutely recommend AMST 307. I looked forward to class every week because the discussion was so interesting. The reading and the movies were also great!",
    "This course was my absolute favorite course I've taken in my time at Yale content- and professor-wise. Be prepared, though, it's a lot of work.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course: great reading list and great professor.",
    "Definitely! Especially good if you have some familiarity with sports and cultural studies.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Definitely take this class if you can get in - the reading and movies are really fun to discuss, and Dean Spooner is a great guy to learn from!",
    "This was a fantastic seminar. Fun and engaging, looking at American culture through a very important lens. A lot of preparation is required (at least a book and a documentary a week, thoroughly read\/watched), but discussion is fascinating and completely worth taking the time to prepare. The course is front-loaded, with reading responses due in the early weeks and a big final paper that is due before reading period. A written take-home midterm and a presentation are also required. DEFINITELY take this class if you can get in.",
    "Lots and lots of readings and movies about sports. Take this class! Dean Spooner is amazing. The discussions are interesting, the readings and movies are fun (even if there is an absurd amount of them), and Dean Spooner is a dean at Yale you want to get to know."
