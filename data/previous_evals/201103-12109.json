   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. You won't get all of the readings done, but you should try to do most of them. Interesting lectures, but minimal speaking practice, and very sleepy class at 9 in the morning!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Mme Girard is very nice and the essay assignments are not too long\/difficult. She helps you improve your essay writing a lot. There is a ton of reading to keep up with, but you learn a lot.",
    "To succeed, you really need to do all of the reading. I wouldn't recommend it only because of the final exam. It's a huge amount of work compared to the rest of the course and it's hard to be prepared if you haven't read each text very thoroughly.",
    "Not a literature seminar in French. It's basically a lecture class with 15 people. There was little to no opportunity to speak in class. Also, there was little close reading\/textual analysis of the literature; I felt we were given more information about historical and biographical context. One didn't feel compelled to do the readings because we would always fall behind and not get to our assigned readings until the following class. The class has potential but needs to be restructured.Also her corrections for our oral presentations sometimes took up the bulk of class time, and our presentations themselves were not that conducive for class.Be warned: you need to eventually do all the readings because the final is an oral exam for which you are given ten questions, each on a different book, and you have to show up to your appointment with all ten questions prepared as you pick a question out of a hat, basically.Otherwise, she's a very lenient grader for the papers (three 3-5 pp. papers).",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they want to improve their reading skills in French because this class is a lot of reading. Unfortunately there are not many opportunities to speak in this class because it is taught in the French style of lecturing. As a literature major who likes discussing the texts, or if you want to improve your speaking skills you may be disappointed by that. However, if you do the work I've found that I improved in reading speed and vocab recognition. I also have a better grasp on how French literature developed.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to someone who is looking more to refine their reading and analytical skills as opposed to their speaking. It's a great, challenging way to earn a language credit.",
    "Yes helpful for reading and writing skills in french",
    "It really is an introduction to French literature - a brief overview of quintessential texts that you will want to pursue further after finishing the class.",
    "Essentially, you read one or two books a week which can occasionally be daunting because some texts are harder than others but overall it is quite manageable. I would highly recommend the course if you're interested in French lit.",
    "YES! Lays a light foundation to your knowledge of French literature."
