    "This class taught me so much about evolutionary medicine, especially considering it was the first E&EB course I'd ever taken. I really enjoyed both the content and the format of the class a ton.",
    "I really enjoyed this course because it has given me a full understanding of medicine from an entirely new perspective.",
    "I learned so much from this class. I knew very little about evolution and medicine coming into the course, and by the end I felt like I could apply it to so many areas of life. I also developed my science writing skills significantly in this course. At first, the thought of writing a long science paper was scary, but with guidance from Prof. Stearns and the fabulous TAs (Evie and Steven), I ended up with a 30-page paper that I was really proud of, and while I was writing it I learned so much about my topic. Also the format of the class was the perfect way to learn a lot without the pressure of constant memorization and cramming for exams. Through each weekly assignment, I spent a lot of time reading and composing responses to the questions, which made me engage in the material very actively. Then, discussing the material in class was a great way to learn even more and gain other people's perspectives. Overall it was a wonderful class!",
    "In Evolution and Medicine, I gained a well-rounded understanding of important concepts of evolutionary medicine. I learned how to synthesize new information and offer my own thoughtful, concise, well-structured insights into complex materials."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths of this course are in the flipped-classroom format, and also the wealth and depth of knowledge that Professor Stearns has regarding the topic. I don't really have any weaknesses to list!",
    "I would say I really liked the flipped style of the class, and I would like more interactive things (more in-class debates) but the student-led conversational style was great.",
    "The structure of Evolution and Medicine is unparalleled in fostering student engagement and understanding. Lectures are viewed on line and ample time is provided to work through difficult concepts in class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Prof Stearns is wonderful. Class discussions are really interesting, but keep in mind that it is a lot of work outside of class.",
    "I would, especially to anyone who is pre-med and interested in health on a scale that is very different from the molecular\/cellular level.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student.",
    "The questions that are assigned before each class took me a very long time to do, if I wanted to answer correctly and completely. But, overall, it was worth the time spent on the material: this was an engaging, informative, and worthwhile class to take, just for the pure pleasure of learning the material. Especially as a premed student, this flipped, discussion style class was a welcome relief from the rote memorization of my other science courses.",
    "I definitely recommend this course if you are willing to commit to it and you are interested in the material. I think it's nearly impossible to not be interested in the material though, because it's so amazing and applies to nearly every aspect of our health. Prof. Stearns is fabulous--he seems a little intimidating at first, but don't be fooled--he really cares about students and may come off as a bit intimidating only because he wants to push every student to their full potential. He holds weekly dinners to talk about topics in evolutionary medicine and give you advice on your paper, and he pays a lot of attention to your assignment responses and your class participation. He always wants to help you improve every aspect of your work in the class, and gives helpful feedback. Everyone in the class learns a lot and seems to end up with a pretty good grade. That being said, you do have to work hard. There are weekly assignments that require a lot of thought, and the final paper takes a lot of hard work but is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had at Yale. In light of all this, I would recommend taking this class when you have a lighter semester (like 4 classes total) because that will allow you to get the most out of the class without stressing out about the workload. It's really an amazing course, and I'm so glad I took it!",
    "I strongly recommend this course. I learned a lot about very interesting topics, such as the human microbiota, cancer from an evolutionary perspective, and pathogen evolution. The topics were extremely relevant to modern-day issues, and I gained a new understanding of health, medicine, and disease through an evolutionary perspective. Interesting course, fair workload, and great professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student willing to fully engage themselves in a seminar-style class. Professor Stearns pushes students to gain as much from the course as possible. His lessons on Evolution and Medicine are interesting, engaging, and well-structured."
