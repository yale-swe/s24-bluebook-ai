    "Strengths: It covered a lot of material and introduced new cadets to the ways that the Air Force functions as a whole. Weakness: A lot of the material was \"by the book\" and was not intuitively connected.",
    "One way that the class could be improved would be to post the assignments more clearly. The readings were posted on WINGS, which is a terrible platform and I could not access any of the documents.",
    "Not much material is covered and it's not very organized, kind of scattered. The midterm and final are on random stuff we never even covered in class because we didn't really cover enough for a big test.",
    "I would have been benefited by study guides and exams more related to content we went over in class more in depth"

    "Yes, it helps prepare you to be an officer in the Air Force and provides good insight into Air Force history. The environment was really supportive for first-year cadets!"
