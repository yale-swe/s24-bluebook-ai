    "This was not my first time doing research, it was definitely my first (and maybe ever) time doing my OWN research. I learned so much about the research process, from conducting good interviews to organizing your ideas.",
    "As a whole, I found the course helped me develop my own self-directed research skills. I also think that the class helped foster an emphasis on rigorous sociological research design and execution.",
    "In completing the year-long senior essay, I gained a better overall understanding of what goes into academic research, especially a long, original research project. In addition to research skills such as interviewing subjects, and analyzing results, this project improved other skills such as my witting, time management, and planning\/organizational skills.",
    "This class needs two TAs.",
    "How to conduct qualitative research in practice! How to write all aspects of a serious research paper (intro, lit review, methods, results, discussion, etc). How to conduct research scientifically in an organized way. How to connect findings to broader sociological research, theories, and phenomena."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- I really felt accomplished having a full thesis at the end and Prof. Almeling was so great, and I can't imaging taking this class without her. Weaknesses -- there were a couple of weeks where I felt INTENSELY stressed, while most of the time I felt great. Setting deadlines and timelines is difficult because everyone is doing different things and a different pace, but I wish there were more deadlines earlier, and less \"dead time\" at the end (once my draft was in the week after spring break, I only worked on it a couple hours tops)",
    "The only way I think the year-long thesis could have been improved is if deadlines were pushed up or more strictly enforced in some way. I think this would have generated a greater initial urgency to complete work at the very beginning of the year.",
    "This class needs two TAs.",
    "Strengths: so great if you love your topic. Huge growth experience. you get to pour your heart into a topic you are interested in and create new findings and knowledge in that area. Get to work with your sociology peers to give advice and support. Weekly\/bi-weekly support from prof and TA. Weaknesses: tons tons TONS of work. And you have to be somewhat self-guided in setting your own deadlines. Even though we had to turn things in at the same time, some people have more work to do for data collection and analysis than others, or more research to do. so you have to self-motivate across long stretches of time when you have no deadlines."

   "comments": [
    "If you're a sociology senior, yes! It might seem daunting at first, but you'll get through it and feel so proud and accomplished at the end of it.",
    "I definitely would recommend the year-long course to any sociology major. Though the work and planning can be daunting at times, completing a 50-plus page original piece of research is incredibly fulfilling.",
    "I would highly recommend completing the year-long senior essay if your schedule permits. It's a challenging yet valuable experience",
    "This class needs two TAs.",
    "Yes if you want to experience research for sociology and have a great capstone to the major. if you're willing to put in a lot of work into a cool project. Yes if you don't have a heavy workload in your other courses."
