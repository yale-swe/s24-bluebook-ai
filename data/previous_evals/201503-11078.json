   "comments": [
    "Robert is very passionate about teaching and wanting us to understand.",
    "Useful to be talked through basic lights and their names, though this was a little too fast for those of us who are new to it! Robert talked us through the design approach for mice and men and this was really useful- we feel we can ask him lots of questions and he's excited to teach. Good that there's practicals, this is essential to those of us who are new. Bringing in guest artists is great!",
    "Having little lighting design experience, the practicals are definitely tough to put together, but it's been so helpful to hear the critiques. Rob's always willing to answer questions and creates a great classroom environment.",
    "Getting reviewed for the practicals and working on concepts, while simultaneously reading a new play every week and discussing the design ideas. Cueing the rep shows is a really nice concept.",
    "Lighting practical is really helpful for me, who does not come from a lighting design background to get hands on practical lighting design. I'm introduced to lighting design and feel comfortable to start exploring the design with the package that I have",
    "I feel like I don't have much more knowledge of the topic than I did when I came into the class. The class feels like more of a technical class than a design class. That could be on part to my ignorance of the lighting design field, but I don't feel I have learned much in the way of how lighting designers make choices or how to go about that way of thinking. I understand the significance of learning how to plot the lights, but am still grasping at how I come to the choices to put a light in that specific place, and why I made that choice for no other reason than I need light there. My above comments are not to imply that Robert is not a great teacher, as he is. He is incredibly patient, and has an intense desire for us to have a knowledge of lighting design. As far as the lighting labs are concerned, I feel terribly unprepared. The critiques and comments received are always great and the suggestions from the three instructors are wonderful, but I have no idea why that was a better choice other than it simply looks better than the one I made. I was particularly frustrated to have to participate in a lighting lab where we were instructed to use color before we had even come to discuss color in class. It seemed so incredibly foreign, and I felt so unprepared. The information learned from that exercise was useful, as we had to go with our gut feelings and reactions for our design choices, but I don't feel the assignment was terribly constructive. The play discussions uninspired, as you can tell half of the assembled class has not read the play. More than knowing what my peers feel about what the lighting should be or look like, I am much more interested in what Robert, Jennifer and Stephen have to say about the lights. I wish there was more participation on the part of the instructors in that section.",
    "I like that we have so many practicles to view, so that we are able to respond to a range of lighting design solutions.",
    "This class was engaging when we really dug into the work of understanding how lighting plots are developed, but a little inscrutable when we were thrown directly into designing plots for which we felt u",
    "The three distinct sections of the class are very clear and are the solid framework of this course for learning the different skill and areas that lighting design encompass. The lighting labs are a great space to get hands on time with equipment and practice setting up scenarios with a team. the opportunity to make the connection between reading plays and discussing them with the large group makes good space to look discuss applications of light. Robert's energy in class makes it visible how talented and knowledgeable he is on the subject. He gives good feedback on the work in class and also generously opens up his process for study."

   "comments": [
    "I would love it if this class was a bit shorter, we got handouts describing in detail how to do paperwork and drafting, and if the lighting labs were not done on the weekends, often on our only day and evenings off.",
    "Practicals should be assigned ahead of time so that groups can plan accordingly- our time is so tight that it's really tricky and has affected our ability to commit to the work. Often the room is not free. The practical assignments if often sent out 2\/3 days before. It would be useful to have someone on hand to help us (perhaps do them in class time) as often it is incredibly frustrating when you can't figure things out and have no help, and then have work critiqued that you don't understand! It would be great to discuss various lighting designers and look at their work so we know how different lighting works in different shows. Just to bring what we are doing into the real world and keep us inspired. Reinforcing practical technique by getting us to do simple tasks in class so we actively respond and have a safety net. I feel this would reinforce what we are learning by allowing us to try an idea and still ask questions as we implement it. The sessions in the rep\/ut come close but the time is way way too fast and the rest of the class are easily disengaged. There is no time to talk through why we are doing things as we do it. Otherwise this would be a fantastic way to figure things out.",
    "I'm confused as to why Intro to Lighting Design is set up the way it is, comparing it to the first-year Set Design and Costume Design classes. It doesn't feel productive to have our class cut short to go into play discussions. Robert's lectures are so helpful, but I often have trouble retaining what we've learned, because it's so fast-paced. It would be amazing to have a full class time. And I understand that lighting design involves a lot of paperwork, but so do all the other theatre design disciplines. The introductory set design and costume design classes are focused on designing, and not on the technical elements. It would be so much more helpful for me to understand lighting design, if we focused more of our time on subjects like color theory, angles, lighting research, etc. Because we don't go into detail on how to design lights, we're often left rather confused and lost during practicals and our occasional cueing sessions. I don't think joining the first and second year classes together is at all helpful. None of our other classes are organized in this way, and I believe the play discussions are often quiet because the class ends up being so big. The joining of the classes creates a difficult atmosphere for both the discussions and the practicals. We're all usually so much more comfortable critiquing each other's works, and participating in discussions, but the lighting design class doesn't feel as comfortable or encouraging. I think it would be so much better to have the 124 class stand on its own, and focus less on paperwork and more on design. (there should still definitely be a technical component, but I don't think it should ever overpower the designing, like it's doing now). After this semester, I think I feel more nervous and uneasy about lighting design than I was before.",
    "A complete follow through of the designated classwork and proper review of homework.",
    "The first half of the class can offer more information. More engagement and time for the play discussion would be appreciated",
    "I addressed many of my suggestions in the above comments.",
    "I would have liked if some of the assignments where done in class. By that I mean we were given some work time to put pencil to paper drawing a worksheet. We watched Robert make one in several classes but we didn't realize what questions we had until we tried it for ourselves. Then the next week when we said we were confused, Robert would do the same thing of drawing one himself. In this way, it felt like lighting class was the movie Groundhog Day. More class with work time would help so that we know what questions to ask as they come up. I would have liked to ask my fellow first year lighting designers but they were always busy with their own classwork for the Advanced Lighting Design class (please see my comments in my response to Question 3.)",
    "Better class organization. Would like a more logical flow through the thing. It was hard to jump right into practicals while still feeling so inept. I can appreciate the desire to vary the pace and content, but it constrained learning at points.",
    "As much as I'm interested in Lighting design, this class is not exactly what I was hoping for. The teachers are great professionals but unfortunately I don't feel that I've learned a lot during it. The homework is usually too long and feels like \"a shot in the dark\" or those with the most of experience have to do most of the work. Also the professor missed a number of classes and the substitutes were unable to follow the class' progress.",
    "The class section in that we spend with Robert needs more structure. The continuity of material we are studying across weeks and assignments are not tracked between classes. This makes it tough for the students, for Robert and also for the subs when he cannot be there. The lack of continuity makes the threat that we are trying to follow difficult and the course spends a lot of time back tracking to re-teach material. I highly urge that this course looks at the level of organization at a syllabus \/ weekly breakdown that Intro to sound design has developed. It very practically has a syllabus and then for each topic\/week a 2-3 page handout\/outline for the material being covered, the assignments and the vocabulary."

    "Aside from Roberts class which is smaller, the class just feels a bit uninvolved and unsupported. I'm not sure I feel any more confident with lighting so far and I believe it's because the practical assignments are always quite last minute and we don't have enough help so it becomes a frustrating missed opportunity. Maybe it's because the class is too big for the practicals. More discussion on the art of lighting- who makes a good lighting designer and how do they do it? Looking at contemporary work to inspire us. The play reading sessions are not great- I love discussing work but I'm not sure the class always read them and the discussion could be more dynamic. Also why the lighting is important- perhaps show examples of how it's been done and discuss what works\/different approaches? More modern plays!!! A better range of work and visual examples of how lighting can be approached in a traditional\/contemporary way and perhaps some history of the art form so we can get our head around the rules? More guest artists!! Also would be nice to hear from Stephen and Jennifer more about their work and how they approach it as they are a gift to have!",
    "A little introduction to atmospherics and special effects and what they do or don't do to the overall process. A discussion of the Met Opera watched during the semester, preferably with the designer.",
    "I addressed many of my suggestions in the above comments.",
    "In all of the other first year design classes, all first years are together but not so in lighting design. The first year lighting design students immediately go into advanced lighting design. I feel unequipped to respond to practicles, or to give my thoughts for ANY part of the play reading discussion. I like that in Scenic Design class, the set design students can help catch up the lighting, costume, and projection designers on model building and drafting. In Costume Design class, the costume designers can help the set, lighting, and projection designers on figure drawing proportions and water color. In Projection Design class, the projection designers can help the costume, lighting, and set designers with animation and Photoshop. But I don't feel like I am able to ask as easily because they are not with us, and it feels like the Intro to Lighting Design class treats us with little kid gloves. In the other design disciplines, we are all put into one class and expected to sink or swim. And we learn how to swim. By me being in a different class than my lighting designer peers, I feel I am being told \"you don't know enough to talk about lighting design yet, just watch and listen as the real lighting designers talk.\" I feel that we can be brought up to speed with the help of the first year designers in the same class form the first semester. If you strongly feel that an intro class really is necessary, perhaps only one semester. In any case, I wish I felt supported to give my thoughts to practicles and play discussions.",
    "I would be tempted to put a more rigorous stamp on the whole thing. First month, just drawings of plots, then practicals then jiumping into actual hands-onsituations"
