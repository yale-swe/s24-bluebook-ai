    "I really really enjoyed the guest speakers. Talking to them was the most valuable part of the course. Meeting professionals in the field, networking, sharing a meal with them: all of this was supremely beneficial to getting international perspectives on conservation.",
    "Rapid Fire Discussions Learning about Bill and Amy's experiences",
    "The use of case studies on complex conservation issues.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps the professors should consider covering the more complex course topics ordinarily left for student-led presentations. At times, students were not able to cover topics in depth because of time constraints.",
    "The class tried to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time, and sometimes it felt like we were having the same discussions in multiple contexts. I think it would be helpful to make sure that we're not repeating ourselves in order to cover more material.",
    "Many of the themes are simply too broad to be taught in one lecture. It would be helpful if readings and discussions were very place-based. For instance, have a lecture on payments for ecosystem services with readings focused on this type of program in Colombia. That way, people can understand how the tool plays out on the ground. As it stands now, the themes are too broad to really take away valuable learning points.",
    "Too broad of class discussions Student-led classes often overlapped too much",
    "I think the course could be significantly improved through the utilization of a single (or few) case studies that consistently run through the semester, through which we could look at the individual topics. I think there could also be improvement in how we discuss the \"big questions\" - I often felt the conversation stayed \"big,\" making it hard to contribute or to move forward with any tangible solutions. Better professor guidance on some of these topics would help."

I felt like the process of putting together a lecture was fun, but overall, what we taught was surface-level, and not very interesting. I think hearing more from Bill and Amy about examples they think are important to discuss from around the world would be more valuable.",

    "Definitely take it! Amy and Bill are wonderful, and very experienced in the field. The interdisciplinary approach is really interesting, and it's also helpful to hear the case studies presented by fellow students. You also get to meet and make connections with really cool guest speakers!",
    "Bill and Amy are awesome and it's worth taking the course just to get to know them. However, sometimes it felt like they had a particular point of view and were less responsive to exploring others. The class can feel scattered and too broad, but still has a lot of merit if you're interested in conservation work."
