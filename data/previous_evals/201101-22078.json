    "This course continues from the previous semester in a similar format with more advanced readings. Whether or not you want to take it depends on how strongly you want to study Korean and your goals with the language. Maybe not the best if you're looking for speaking practice, but good for getting more academic vocabulary and improving your reading.",
    "Korean 151, which is the continuation of 150, will equip you with a large vocabulary set and appreciation of Korean history and culture. In order to fully appreciate the course, however, you need to motivate yourself to participate in the lectures, because you will get extremely bored otherwise."
