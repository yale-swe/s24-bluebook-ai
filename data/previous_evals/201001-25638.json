    "I thought that the wetlands field trip was awesome and I learned a lot, but two field trips were canceled, and the only other one we went on was SO INCREDIBLY COLD I couldn't focus and it was completely useless to me. field trips standing outside in the snow for 3 hours in february are not useful.",
    "9: several field trips were cancelled. The ones we had were a little shallow on information content and narrow in breadth",
    "Question 4: I would say that the workload was lighter than other courses, except that we then instituted a weekly discussion session which required reading additional papers and meeting outside of class, so that added to the time commitment involved for this class.Question 9: Field trips would have run rather smoothly except that they were cancelled and rescheduled several times, sometimes the morning of the trip after students were already at Marsh.Question 10: This course is very valuable to students with similar interests to mine, but it would be MUCH MORE valuable if there was not so strong of a tropical forest focus to the restoration. I know that that is Florencia's specialty, but I think she could do a better job of including examples of restoration projects outside the tropics.You can tell that most students had interests in restoration ecology outside of what was taught because of the wide variety of topics they presented on for their oral presentations and papers.",
    "More labwork with activities would have been very valuable. Ecological restoration in sole lecture form is not as useful as i would have thought.",
    "I really enjoyed this class a lot. I realized that I was learning a lot during the semester, but both during the midterm as well as while preparing for the final assignments, I was very happy to see how much I had gained, and above all, how much more confident I had become in speaking about restoration. It's a topic that is very local, and there are a lot of possible things to discuss in the class, but I was very happy with the focus on tropical and forest issues. There are few classes at FES that teach material related to these fields, and therefore this class was a very valuable part of my education here. Florencia makes herself available to students much more than other professors I have encountered here, and is unfailingly helpful, has great contacts and ideas for presentations and papers, and gives great advice on how to focus these assignments. I am very happy that I have a chance to learn from her here. It's fantastic to hear about reforestation and restoration experiments in class from someone who has worked in this field extensively, and has on-the-ground work experience. This practical knowledge of challenges and solutions is invaluable and only rarely available at FES."

   "comments": [
    "It's very practical and relevant tools for repairing degraded ecosystems were taught. This course is a must for anyone interested in Natural Resource management and rehabilitation of the earth's degraded landscapes",
    "I feel like I learned a lot",
    "That the course is applied and it gives examples of projects that are or were implemented, and the lessons that could be learned from each project. The discussion sessions were very useful. The course was taught in a way that encouraged a lot the participation of the members of the class and that helped the learning and to make more interesting the class.",
    "Professora Montagnini's sunny disposition.",
    "The topic, ecological restoration is very relevant to many of the environmental issues we are facing today. Especially the techniques used for restoration all over the world is very interesting and relevant for many job opportunities in the ecosystem management field",
    "I did not get a lot out of this course, but at least it wasn't very much work.",
    "The subject area&student involvement.",
    "that it included salt marsh and wetland ecosystems too. not just forestry.",
    "The instructor has an amazing range of knowledge of restoration issues. Both Florencia and Alvaro are extremely helpful and always give very good feedback on project ideas. I don't know what we will do here without Alvaro next year - he's been one of the most helpful people I have met here, and is happy to share his experiences and contacts."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "There is so much knowledge being shared on restoration techniques and procedures without commensurate field practice. The course could be split over two semesters to allow students more time to undertake field exercises in restoration projects.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot....about regrowing forests in the tropics. Although there was a little bit of variation with the guest speakers, what everything mostly came back to was the professor's experience in the tropics. I really would have enjoyed a little more breadth. Theoretically we covered a lot, but it just doesn't seem like it in hindsight.",
    "The field trips could be more hands-on experiences by applying some of the restoration methods learned in class.",
    "Maybe more about how restoration programs succeed or fail in the world? There must be some pretty complex challenges out there for multidisciplinary case studies.",
    "This class could be exponentially improved if a problem based element were added to it. The lectures were divided up primarily by ecosystem type being restored. If the professor were to add even a 10 minute problem based learning section at the end of each lecture that would be fantastic. She should give an ecosystem type, tell us the tools\/options available, and guide as through a course of action. I feel that she definitely has sufficient experience in the field of ecological restoration to do this. It would really unify her lectures and make the students feel like they are learning applied\/management skills.",
    "One of the biggest missing aspects in this class is the lack of any examples outside of the tropics. Even if the professor's specialty is the tropics, she cold learn about other areas of the world and present a more balanced picture. I think most people in the class would appreciate that. I think we had too many very similar case studies from the tropics.It would be very helpful if the presentation slides were much shorter and we didn't have to rush through them.Also, the most interesting aspect of restoration to the class this year was the technical methods used for restoration, but we didn't focus that much on that aspect. The last class had very interesting aspects to it, we should have probably spent more time on the topics discussed in the last class, and earlier in the semester.",
    "This course was advertised as being about ecological restoration in general, but the lectures concentrated almost exclusively on neotropical forest restoration. The students had a wide array of interests from arid forests to wildlife to coastal restoration following hurricanes, but none of that was covered. Almost every lecture was about either Costa Rica or Panama.",
    "Lectures that are 90% pictures (from tropical regions), which are of little value to people hoping to learn about restoration in non-tropical areas.It would also be extremely helpful (and would facilitate learning&reading) if Florencia could post all of the readings on ClassesV2, rather than asking students to look up 10 different books in the library. Students may try to do the readings for the first few weeks, but after that it gets too burdensome and they fall by the wayside. I'm sure I would have learned a lot more from the class if I had done more of those readings, but I also would have learned more if thelectures had been more informative.",
    "mix lecture with applied skills. too slow and too easy. we should take advantage of our location and not just do a couple field trips. actual field\/lab work would have been useful.",
    "It was unfortunate that several field trips had to be canceled due to inclement weather. I think some students didn't expect as much focus on tropical and forestry issues, with a stronger interest in temperate restoration. I think that enough information was given at the beginning of the class about what was to be covered, but many students seem to have a hard time really grasping what a course will entail even after hearing about the contents and reading the syllabus. However, to make students happy, it might be good to make it clear a few times what will be taught in the class. I think the discussion session, presentation and paper gave students a lot of opportunity to explore their own areas of interest, but maybe one or two more lecturers could be brought in as guest speakers on temperate issues (maybe grassland\/prairie restoration in the midwest? drylands also seemed to interest many people)."

    "My area of focus is restoration of degraded forest ecosystems and wildfire management. This course has provided me with important tools to succeed in this area and I find it very relevant to my overall career goals.",
    "It doesn't, exactly. It's just something I've been interested in for a long time. However, I think that it does fit in with social ecology - a lot of the aspects of restoration are ecological and technical, but a lot of aspects are social and political as well.",
    "This course was focused on restoration. It is helpful to know different ways to restore different ecosystems both for policy making and to help build resilience. Also as ways to give other economic sources of income to communities.",
    "Fits pretty well for practical application of social ecology.",
    "My primary academic focus is ecological restoration in the tropics. This is a course I was very much looking forward to.",
    "i felt that i have taken environmental science courses since high school and never taken one on restoration. this was to fill that gap. it did teach me a lot about agroforestry that i didnt know before but overall it was missing the applied skills i had hoped to obtain.",
    "For me, it was a key class - it's one of a few classes that actually talks about management of resources on the ground. I had a foggy idea of some of the material, but had no theoretical framework to organize my ideas with. Also, I've learned so much about the details of experiences with restoration now that I can be much more confident and convincing in discussing these issues with others, whether they are experts or not. I wish there was a way to extend the class to include a practicum - for example,a one-week trip to a restoration site, with active participation of students in restoration work, to gain more on-the-ground experience."
