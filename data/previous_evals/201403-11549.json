    "I think it is a very good course to get practical experience and apply some of the things that you learn in coursework.",
    "I think that it's more valuable if you don't have a lot of experience working with organizations in your desired field. So if you have little work experience or are changing fields.",
    "GREAT CLASS. The learning is so applicable, hands on and gives you great experience for stuff you care about and will also put on a resume and can use as an example for future employers. Very glad I took this class.",
    "With this class, it all depends on your project, client and teammates!",
    "How valuable this course ends up being depends on your experience with your client, which is very hard to predict.",
    "The projects make the course. Choosing a project that is a good fit for you is key, and you likely will have plenty of struggles and challenges throughout the course but that is the nature of client-based projects. Luckily Josh and the other professors are well-equipped to help you solve those problems and give great advice but largely leave the decisions and actions up to you.",
    "The quality of the course entirely depends on the project selected and the nature of the relationship and expectations with your clients. In our case the workload was quite light, and even though the clients were very happy with our work, we could have easily produced more than we did."

    "Working with an actual client is a valuable experience that is hard to get in traditional classes",
    "The opportunity to practice engaging with clients is invaluable alone, but being able to do it in a supportive context with faculty supervisors and peer support made it that much better. I am very glad I took this course and just wish I had signed up last year.",
    "The opportunity to work with a client on a project that had more than just academic worth.",
    "Working with a client in a topic that's of your interest.",
    "Getting experience working as a consultant for a client in a field of interest. I also enjoyed the guest lectures.",
    "I got to explore a new area that was related to my area of interest and was given a lot of leeway to define the deliverables, which was great.",
    "Josh was exceptionally responsive to students' interests and concerns and gave well - targeted, thoughtful, and helpful feedback throughout the clinic. Allison and Lisa were very engaging and friendly as well, although I interacted with them less frequently. The class topics and readings were well - designed to complement the clinical experience. I also appreciated that class meetings and reading assignments were pared down to give us more time to focus on our projects. The guest lecture on environmental litigation was especially great - definitely a course highlight for me.",
    "This course is highly dependent on the particular project you work on. However, I enjoyed the array of lectures that were presented to the class.",
    "Great projects and topics to choose from.",
    "The great amount of room and flexibility with working with the clients, and the training given on how to work with clients.",
    "Having the opportunity to be a student consultant was great. The skills I learned from hands on learning were very useful, and the opportunity to actually help a real organization was very satisfying.",
    "The strength of the EPC is the opportunity to practice interacting with a client and experience a different paradigm for work and research than one is maybe accustomed to.",
    "The best part about the protection clinic is the \"real world\" experience. Being able to work with a client through a class is unique and very valuable. I enjoyed my project a lot, and learned a great deal with regard to both the content of my project and the process of working through a project.",
    "I like the independent nature of the course. I would take the course again.",
    "Working with an actual client, having deadlines and responsibilities that were actually meaningful to the client",
    "The projects are amazing , it's difficult to choose just ONE.",
    "It is difficult to separate the class from the client work in this review, however, I'll give it a try. This course is a great opportunity for students with interests that FES doesn't really cover, or those who want some resume-building experience. I liked the opportunity to engage with an outside client and get some background in envi law."

   "comments": [
    "More coordination with clients to make sure expectations are clear from the beginning.",
    "Not all team members were equally dedicated; not a ton of accountability.",
    "I thought some of the in-class lectures were fascinating, and I'd encourage more guest speakers (not that the class instructors are not interesting) but getting that outside perspective is really helpful.",
    "It would have been nice if there was an introduction to scientific research workshop at the beginning of the semester similar to the environmental law research workshop that introduced students to helpful databases, etc.",
    "Client student communication. Involvement of the professors to stay involved and ensure that both the client and student are communicating effectively and well.",
    "A little more prep with the client on what they should expect to contribute and what they want. Although there were good lessons about how to manage clients from the lack of support, but I think we could have gotten a more substantively stronger deliverable if there was more clarity from the get-go.",
    "Some lectures were not helpful or necessary. The one sessions where we discussed \"problems\" we had with clients might have been more helpful if it was more structured. Or we were talking in small groups.",
    "I strongly disagree with the non-disclosure agreement. It impede's student's ability to identify whether the class is appropriate for them, while offering very little value to the client. A client should be capable of drafting a project description that doesn't disclose or impair their whole litigation strategy. That seems like a pretty basic skill. If the client thinks greater secrecy is in order for the students working on the project, by all means have them sign an NDA before they begin working. During course selection, though, we, the students, are the paying customers, and this policy limits our ability to access the education we have paid for. No other clinic requires them to read the syllabus, and every other clinic posts their syllabus online.",
    "Workload was too heavy!!! 120 hours was impossible to achieve-- even with travel.",
    "Lectures were a bit slow, many were not relevant for the work we were doing for our client. The project we were assigned sounded very appealing, but once we got to work it became clear the work was much more suited to law students, so as a non-law student I felt like my strengths were not being used.",
    "Some of the class sessions could have been a bit more engaging. Some of the sessions were just time allotted for question and answer, but they didn't have enough content to fill up the entire session time.",
    "Client communication and expectations throughout.",
    "The lectures are somewhat remedial and aren't all that useful. Some were fantastic though so it was inconsistent which was lousy.",
    "While many of them were interesting and delivered well, the lectures are pretty scattered, subject-wise. It rarely seemed coordinated and seemed to miss some important bits (international law, citing legal text, etc.) Most of us were not law students and the \"boot camp\" didn't address all the issues I found I needed to know for my project. My client project did not go particularly well. Our client was pretty unresponsive and involved and this was really disappointing for me. I ended up feeling like a just wrote a group paper that my client had no interest in or time for. So better screening of clients would be good!",
    "I think the instructors could set higher expectations for the students. If clients are happy with a small product at the end of the semester, the instructors should be prepared (early on) to offer suggestions to increase the workload."

    "Yes and no. I certainly learned a lot about a new topic and I am grateful for the project based opportunity, however, this course ended up being outside the purview of my studies here and I sunk a lot of time into work that has now given breadth instead of depth of knowledge.",

    "yes!",
    "Apparently I don't like client projects. It seems highly unlikely that a client will have any understanding of what constitutes academic rigor for a masters student and be able to provide an appropriately framed project. It seemed like every single project was way too much work or way too little, or just something that a student could never accomplish, because they don't understand their own requests or what our goals and limitations are.",

    "I was lucky to have a very supportive, communicative group that were all invested and interested in the project and who worked together very well. Although I do not prefer group work, it was both helpful with the scope of many of these projects as well as realistic in many real-world scenarios. I can imagine having a very different experience had my partners not been so well matched.",
    "The ability to learn from peers is a definite advantage. Scheduling is always difficult and meeting each other's expectations is troublesome too.",
    "I worked with one other person and so it was easier to coordinate, and had someone to bounce ideas off of. We worked pretty independently which was good because we both were away a lot and had other commitments.",
    "Advantages of group work in this course were ongoing in - person communication about our project (whereas we had regular but less frequent phone calls with our external project coordinator) and neatly divided responsibilities for our final product. Disadvantages were lack of a teammate with significant background in business for a relatively business - focused project.",
    "This course is entirely dependent on group work. This gave an opportunity to generate a much more comprehensive work product than would have been possible alone, and gave experience working on a consulting team. The disadvantages were the usual ones around coordinating schedules and approaches to work.",
    "I enjoyed working with my partner and the workload was adequate for two people.",
    "Group projects always have the same advantages and disadvantages. One one hand, you have someone else to share the load and bounce ideas off. On the other hand, scheduling is a nightmare and at some point you're either going to drop the ball for the team or end up carrying the project. Group projects generally suck.",
    "Exchanging ideas and sharing workload.",
    "Group members had skills and experience in areas I did not, and vice versa.",
    "Group work: ye shall manage it in thine own way.",
    "I thought that my group was great. Everyone did their part and we worked very well together. The only real disadvantage was finding times to meet--we had very conflicting schedules.",
    "The entire project is group work based. I had a good group which definitely helped making the project enjoyable.",
    "Team dynamics and cooperation were very important.",
    "Depending on the project it can be hard to divide up the work fairly and meaningfully. When you do it right things go smoothly, when you don't then one team member can be over-worked or under-worked and not getting as much as they should be out of the course.",

I think I had a very positive experience because my semester forced me to plan early and keep up on my hours from the very beginning. This allowed me to end on a less stressed note and feel relatively well prepared for client check ins along the way. Time management is key and logging 8-12hrs\/week is crucial to having a less stressful time with it.",

I would advise other students to choose their clinical project very carefully, since their project and their external project coordinator will shape their experience much more than the class itself. Specifically, I would say to rank only projects whose project descriptions outline a specific, realistic final product. I would advise other students to develop a list of their own learning objectives for the clinical experience and then to draw on those in choosing their project and (ideally) in dividing responsibilities with teammates.",

    "Don't procrastinate on your hours!",
    "An interesting subject matter is not enough to ensure a good client experience. A tricky aspect of the course is that it would be really helpful to talk with students who worked with clients you are interested in (many clients are repeat participants), but the client list is confidential. It's very hard to tell what to expect from just reading the project proposals. I found my experience interesting, but my work didn't build to a final product that I was proud of and the research was somewhat surface. It got challenging to keep up interest in my project as the deliverables and aims constantly shifted and as I didn't feel any real sense of ownership.",
    "I would advise students to take the course--it's a great way to get short-term \"work\" experience through a class. The instructors give great advice about how to work well with a client and are there as a support net.",
    "Take this course as a capstone course after you have completed substantial coursework on a subject. Don't take the course as a way to learn about something new, because then it is all self learning and you don't get to be as helpful to your client. I think this course is a great opportunity to apply new expertise to a real client situation, not so much a first year-first semester course",
    "Take the course and be open to new experiences. This is your chance to work on a real-world project that can really open your eyes.",
    "Carefully choose your client project! Do your research and ask the instructors about client quality. Just because the project looks cool does not mean it will go well. otherwise, certainly a great experience (esp if you get to travel for it!)",
    "Take this class if you find a project you're really invested in--if nothing jumps out at you, I would be hesitant to take the class. The quality of your work and what you get out of the semester will be much better if you are interested in the project and can envision yourself in a career similar to those of your clients."
