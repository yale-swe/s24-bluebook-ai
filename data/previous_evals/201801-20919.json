   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analyze literature and gained a lot of knowledge about human nature and different cultures in the world.",
    "I really enjoyed the material of the course. I gained skills in close literary reading that I have never gained before at Yale. I also learned about world literature theory from scholars like Spivak and Fannon.",
    "Through this course I improved my close reading and literary analysis skills. I was exposed to literature I wouldn't have otherwise read due to the global scope of the course.",
    "This class introduced me to the broad scope of the literatures of colonialism and post-colonialism, and made me think about these effects in the contexts of vastly different nations and cultures. It helped me learn to formulate arguments that took a close reading perspective even for texts whose broader contexts couldn't be ignored, and incorporate historical research into those arguments. This course also inspired a lot of thought about the ways that people use language, and what it means to use the language of the colonizers to write the narratives of those subjected to colonialism. In a more general sense, the format of this class facilitated participation in many ways that made me feel like I was constantly engaging with the course, and also got me to read many books that I otherwise had little exposure to.",
    "I learned more about form\/structure analysis and the wide range of works that could be considered as World English literature.",
    "Learned about colonialism through English literature"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "hated the group work. would rather have a full class discussion.",
    "This course was fantastic! I think more of an emphasis could be placed on classroom discussion however.",
    "honestly super strong and the only weakness was maybe that we didnt get huge feedback on our writing before the final paper?",
    "Weaknesses: - Not enough literary theory element. - Not enough time to discuss the themes of the novels in detail. A book per week is too short of a period to cover rich material in the books that we discuss. - It would be great if we explore more genres other than prose: such as plays and poetry. - Does not address in detail themes of translatability - Emphasizes close reading skills by neglecting bigger pictures sometimes Strengths: - Comprehensive of most world regions - Good to develop skills in close reading",
    "This course offers many great readings which cover a broad thematic and geographic range. The assignments are interesting, incorporating close readings with archive research. The discussions in class were also very engaging. More historical context for some of the events covered in the readings might have been nice.",
    "I thought that the reading list for this course was excellent, and seemed to be chosen with a lot of thought and care. I also liked Professor Richards' emphasis on multimedia sources and historical archives research, as these perspectives added a high level of engagement to our reading of the assigned texts. Class time was productive and thought-provoking, and included a good mix of smaller group work and full-group discussion. One improvement might be some way of guiding our thoughts while reading, such as a few specific questions to keep in mind, because there is a lot of material assigned for each class and it's easy to get bogged down. Another possible improvement might be some short assigned texts for historical\/political context; we would always address this in class, but it might be helpful (at least for some books) to have the key points on hand while reading.",
    "The range of works was really good I was just sometimes confused about how they were all related other than for the fact that they fell under the category of English literature.",
    "Because of the broad nature of the subject matter I feel like I didn't proper context to be able to talk about and argue a point for a lot of the books we were reading. Notably when we read midnights children, we dedicated multiple weeks to the book and it context, but when it came to writing my final paper, I had to do a lot of contextual research that I found changed some of the meaning of the book for me and exposed my lack of prior knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "no not particularly. good reading list but not with richards...she's so kind and lovely but didn't lead an interesting seminar discussion at all. take it with someone else",
    "Yes. The books are fantastic and provocative.",
    "yes!! take this as one of your english pre-recs or just to take it. super worth it.",
    "I would. It broadens one's perspective on the point of view of literary and artistic expression because of the diversity in authors. It keeps students engaged with the historical contexts of literature in place. It also is a good course to develop close reading skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in exploring English literature",
    "I would recommend this course strongly! I love that it's a part of the foundations curriculum for the major now, but it might be an especially interesting course for non-majors who want a more literary perspective on issues of colonialism and globalization. While the reading load can be heavy (about a book per week), the readings are very carefully selected and I found most of them to be excellent. Each one uses language and form so differently to approach some unifying core themes. Also, although there is a lot of reading, the assignment load is very reasonable and worked well to synthesize ideas and techniques from class (sporadic short reading responses, a short paper, a short research assignment, and a longer final paper with a research component.)",
    "Yes definitely would recommend. Was especially impressed by how many good readings there were. I had never read Jamaica Kincaid or Alice Munro before this class and theyre probably some of my favorite authors now .",
    "This course is among the intro requirements for the English majors, it is good option for an English major who wants to skip out on stuffy english poets."
