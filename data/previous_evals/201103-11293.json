    "The classroom part of this course (as opposed to the UN internship) is a disaster. Prof. Lee is terribly disorganized -- can't even provide a proper syllabus for the class. The class is largely thought by students who are asked to give presentations. The professor and TA are unable to provide clear guidance on anything. For example, Prof Lee had asked that we work on a group paper for the entire class to submit to several of the UN missions. Weeks went by without any guidance, and the week before Thanksgiving break it blew up with students complaining in class that we were not about to start working on a group paper due next week. He cancelled the paper idea. Here is another example: we had been told we had to submit a 2 page reflection paper after we returned from COP17. A few days after our return from COP17 and after several students had already written their reflection paper, we get an email that says this:\"I sincerely apologize for having to do this to you, but it seems the reflection paper is actually five pages. I had thought Prof Lee had given me confirmation of the two page requirement before I sent the email to you all, but there seems to have been a misunderstanding.\" This is highly inappropriate during finals week. Typical of the class: wait until the last minute to provide guidance on something and then expect students to turn things around immediately.Another big ordeal was planning for the COP17 trip. The professor waited until well into the semester to announce that not everyone would be able to go to the COP, and this created an unpleasant process of selection. A large part of this drama could have been prevented by setting proper expectation, had the professor announced from week 1 that not everyone would get to go to the COP. The budget for the class was known from early on. In the end we worked it out so that everyone that wanted to go could go (by flying cheaper routes and cramming 3 people per hotel room).Prof Lee lacks some social skills, often calling students by their wrong names, or at one point asking students to raise their hands if they were willing to contribute money for everyone to be able to go to COP (this is awkward and inappropriate to ask and should be done privately via email).",
    "Regarding Question 8: \"I would give this course an overall rating of\"The response is purely on the basis of the class, not the internship component nor the field trip to COP 17.",
    "Question 9: Interning at the UN and traveling to COP17 were invaluable experiences. However, I felt like we were getting a lot more than we were giving. If there was a way for our contribution to be more important\/significant, that would make it a more rewarding experience.",
    "The instructor gave the impression of preparing very little or not at all for the class. Nearly all presentations given in class were given by TAs or students, and subsequent comments by the instructor were based on these presentations. The instructor clearly knows quite a bit about the subject material, but makes little effort to share this with the class other than by showing up.Organization for the class in nearly all respects (clarity of assignments, planning for the internship, planning for the trip to Durban) was ad hoc and somewhat improvised, and often carried out at a much later date than would have been convenient for those taking the class. Class time and location were rescheduled in a very cavalier manner that was disrespectful of students' time.",
    "This course would be best considered as a clinic course with two clinical components: 1) weekly internship at the UN with a time commitment of 10-14 hrs per week 2)2 week intensive participation at the annual COP conference with not less than 10 hour\/day for 12 days.Both parts of the clinic are integral to understanding, achieving goals and for effective integration of the coursework. Coursework geared toward understanding the COP process, text, and current issues is irrelevant if students are not offered the opportunity to attend as delegates, but extremely valuable for preparing them for the COP if they do have this opportunity.As a practicum students gain both an intimate understanding and experience of the international environmental negotiation process and program work of the United Nations and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
    "In terms of the Durban trip: couldn't the school \/ instructor have figure out before the semester began how much money there would be for the COP trip? Having to figure it out mid-semester led to a lot of drama. And, students were left with the responsibility of deciding who would attend -- that led to more drama and required a lot of tie.As for the weekly class:is there no better way to teach about this topic than to have students with very-limited expertise present powerpoints based on the readings? I can learn the same info by simply doing the readings.As for the internship:very interesting but started very late in the semester and required a lot of time.",
    "this class should have more credits, as it takes up a lot of time to travel every week to NYC."

    "Everything. See question 11.",
    "Course needs a more complete syllabus (presentation requirements, writing assignments, etc, with specifics) - if students are making presentations every week - create this schedule at the beginning of the semester not on the flyLectures need structureInternships should be established within first 2 weeks of class (not 1\/2 months later)!professor lee doesn't seem invested at all in the students - like he just shows up for class and isn't engaged or interested in what the students needs\/desires areinternship should be much more organized with specific assignments and tasks - internships take up a lot of time so they should be worthwhile and meaningful",
    "The actual class meetings were based on student presentations and I felt like students did not actually benefit from the knowledge of the Professor who has spent years in the UN.",
    "organization of class materials and internship information. It was confusing what readings were assigned each week.",
    "A more structured syllabus (and classes that stick to a plan) would help me gauge my learning and progress better. I would feel more confident and well-prepared going into the conferences if I could reflect upon what I'd learned in a more organized manner.",
    "This course was a hard one to rate\/describe because from a practical point of view it was a very useful course that taught me a lot about how intentional diplomacy is done and the internship and trip to COP 17 were awesome and made taking the class totally worth it. BUT the classroom time was horrible. The prof was non responsive to email and the TA did not have the authority or ability to make decisions on her own. The rules of the game keep changing, what I mean is that the prof would come in to class and say \"i think we should put to gather a paper on ___ or do a project on___ and I think that ___ and ___ will do it\" it was unreasonable to have the requirements of the class change that frequently and have our work load of the course be something that we could not plan for or account for.",
    "The class sessions need to be better structured. The amount time required for this class with the internship is considerable.",
    "see above.",
    "Two things could improve this course:1) Commit early to the number of students heading to the COP to alleviate the constant uncertainty and strain and allow student to focus on preparing more fully for the conference, delegations and issues on which they will be working.2) Structure the course as other clinics\/practicums with students breaking into teams early in the semester to prepare materials related to their specific assignment. (i.e. Team 1 on mitigation prepares briefs on each negotiating bloc's mitigation position and presents to class). Professor organizes readings on each issue, but also spends first few weeks of lecture giving an overview of history of each negotiating track and the UN processes before course moves into guest lecture and student presentation phase.",
