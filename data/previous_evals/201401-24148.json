    "This course was very interesting, and it covered a wide variety of very cool material. Having guest lecturers come and share their knowledge and research made a big contribution. There was a lack of predictability and organization as far as course structure went. The syllabus did not predict the course schedule very well, and some presentations and homeworks were somewhat of a last-minute surprise.",
    "Very interesting material and a fun class. There was one too many group presentations, although I thought overall they were a good way to get exposure to a few more diseases than possible with normal lectures. The class was a bit disorganized but mostly good. I missed the heavier science and biochemical side that was more apparent in the first semester, but overall it was a good course.",
    "What a great class! The guest speakers were excellent and it was such a fun learning environment!It would have been easier to keep up with readings if they'd been posted sooner, but this is a mild complaint in a class that really made the learning experience interesting and enjoyable.",
    "I didn't like any of the guest lecturers. I didn't feel that they added to the course and sometimes I don't know if the lectures were relevant -- I might have preferred to have a lecture on a different ID instead of having a guest lecturer. I also don't know if it was necessary to do three group presentations.. one would have probably been enough for the student's choice day. The other two times I didn't feel were as productive.I really liked the organization of the course. Really liked Melinda's lectures.",
    "Incredibly important course for understanding infectious disease abroad in areas that do not receive as much publicity or funding.",
    "Some of the guest speakers felt a bit random and didn't always seem to fit in with the overall narrative of the course, but I did greatly enjoy all of the guest speakers (even the Prion lecturer when I think I came out more confused than when I went in). I especially liked the arbovirus lecturer and when Albert Ko spoke about Leptospirosis.Other than that, I think the only thing this class needs is a second year so I can take it again. Definitely my favorite class.",
    "This class is so perfect. There should be an Infectious Diseases 3 and 4 for second year. I am really going to miss Melinda and Jamie.",
    "This class is great for anyone wanting to know about the \"lesser known\" infectious diseases. There's a lot of talk about neglected tropical disease, rare and emerging pathogens, and niche topics in ID (prions, bioterrorism). After taking this and Principles of Infectious Disease I, I feel like I have a very solid knowledge base about communicable disease. Some of the guest lectures were redundant, but others were unusual and well-delivered (bioterrorism lecture). Overall, it was a lot of fun.",
    "Strengths: Fascinating subjects, lecturers have real world experience, homework examples were interesting, group projects were greatWeakness: Some guest lectures should not be invited back",
    "good intro, helps people feel comfortable giving presentations on technical material",
    "There was more a focus on memorization than on critical thinking skills",
    "Strengths: use of expert faculty on different organisms and their impact to current and previous epidemiology.Weaknesses: clarity of assignment expectations and deadlines could have been better defined.",
    "Great topics in lecture. All very interesting.",
    "I loved this course! I loved that the year long infectious disease courses allowed for us to really think about the topic and have it settle into our minds. Jamie and Melinda are such a great duo of instructors and really bring a lot of enjoyment in learning the subject.",
    "Strengths: broad overview of many infectious diseases particularly zoonotic and parasitic infections that are not normally covered or thought about in public health. Group presentations were good practice for presenting elsewhere. Guest speakers were very interesting and knowledgeable.Weaknesses: Group presentation didn't have clear guidelines, quality of presentations and information varied greatly between groups. Homework was interesting and engaging, could have had 1 or 2 more assignments which integrated lecture material into a real-life context similar to EID I (Fall 2013). Assigned readings were discussed briefly, but not in depth for most lectures.",
    "Very helpful course for my concentration. Learned a Good span of different kinds of diseases",
    "I loved this course! I thought it was one of the only things that unified the EMD class of 2015 and I found it to be something that kept my interest throughout the year. I loved the holistic approach of thinking about disease impact on populations and interaction with the environment, and not just about genes\/proteins. I really loved Jamie's teaching style. It was always conversational and he was a really great teacher.",
    "Very interesting topics and guest lecturers"

    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Professor Childs is extremely knowledgeable about the course material. His personal experience and stories contributed a lot to the course, and I enjoyed his lectures. His exams were based on practical interpretation of the course material, instead of just dislocated facts, and this helped make the coursework seem relevant. He isn't always good about giving us a heads up in regards to changes in the course schedule, however, and we sometimes felt frustrated about not knowing what the schedule was going to be.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Has great stories and experiences to share with the class, and was a great professor to get to know. Sometimes the content is pretty disorganized but overall it was a good class for YSPH.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He's so great! He's really knowledgeable and interesting. We're lucky to have him as a professor.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Great, really tried to foster a good cooperative learning environment, engaged the students and listened to our opinions.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is simply amazing. Incredible background, brought in some great speakers, and incredibly open to students. One of the gems of YSPH.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is a wonderful professor and a joy to learn from. He clearly takes pleasure in teaching, and has a wealth of knowledge and experience that he is eager to share with the class.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is enthusiastic and very knowledgeable and clearly loves to teach his students. I loved learning from him. He was a bit disorganized with respect to providing adequate time for assignment completion, but we got it done. His exams were quite fun to take.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0If the guy from the Dos Equis commercial dies, Jamie could replace him as the most interesting man in the world. Jamie is amazing.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie's enthusiasm is what makes this course great. Hearing his stories and personal experiences with many of the diseases covered in the course adds a special element of interest to the lectures. He keeps things interesting.At times, lectures could be sporadic and difficult to follow, but the wide variety of content covered makes up for this.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie Childs is one of those people that makes both the field of public health and Yale amazing to be in. He is a goofy loveable guy who has seen more than I will likely ever in my lifetime. I find myself able to remember things from the class so easily because I remember Jamie speaking about them in his own experience. He does things his own way and it works.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0he's super approachable, very funny, clearly wants students to be interested in the subject",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is a very knowledgeable instructor that places a great emphasis on broader thinking on the impact on infectious organisms and the actual applicability of concepts into the field of public health and disease surveillance.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0A little erratic. never consistent, but didn't mind it at all. He's down to earth, easy going, and wants you to learn big picture and not little details. Overall, awesome professor.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is great! I appreciate that he focuses on the global outlook of what's happening with infectious diseases and isn't consumed by particulars of diseases or mechanisms. He really cares about having us learn the things that matter. I also loved that he introduced us to some speakers who did not take the academia route and tried to expand our scope as public health professionals.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Strengths: Vast amount of infectious disease and parasite knowledge. Also provided insight into real-life infectious disease investigations, lab research, and current \"big picture\" public health concerns for the present and future. Very approachable, always present in class even during guest lectures. Great resource for students, enthusiastic aboutsubject material and teaching.Weaknesses: Sometimes difficult to contact via email. Due dates and times for assignments should have been more clearly announced and posted.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Great instructor who truly cares about the well being of his students which I appreciated. Loves the guest speakers he brought in to give us advice on careers in ID.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0The Man! He is a great storyteller. I liked his enthusiasm! It made me so excited about the subject! I looked forward to his lectures. I also liked his emphasis on careers and the guidance he offered us. I liked his class so much. One of my favorite to date.",

Ryan spoke a total of maybe 4 times the entire semester and didn't contribute to the class at all. Would have been great to have a TF over the course of the entire year that could interact with students, contribute to class, or share some outside information.",

   "comments": [
    "Like its predecessor, his course is a topic-by-topic presentation of information on a wide variety of infectious diseases. Many of these topics were presented by outside lecturers that were experts on the topic.",
    "A great overview over a lot of interesting diseases, with a fun and interactive professor who brings in a lot of great guest speakers. Definitely take either this course and\/or the first half of Infectious Diseases - although I preferred the first half over this one.",
    "This is an absolute, must-take course! You will learn SO much! Be flexible -- dates, assignments, and readings will change, but it's a minor blip in an otherwise fantastic course! I wishwe could take a third semester of Principles of Infectious Disease because the first two were just so very well done.",
    "Great continuation of PID I. Loved the content. A lot of group presentations",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in infectious diseases",
    "A wonderful overview of some of the most important microbial diseases we face in the 21st century. It covers exciting topics such as bioterrorism, hygiene hypothesis, and disease surveillance in addition to a nice selection of emerging and present diseases both at home and abroad.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in niche infectious diseases, or anyone interested in doing communicable disease work in the developing world. Lastly, it is a great course for those who want to hear \"adventure stories\" from an instructor who has worked in the field.",
    "This course will teach you about important infectious diseases that might not always be on everyone's mind. Most importantly it will use these \"off the beaten path\" diseases to educate you on important ID concepts that can be applied in all realms. It is a fun course and you learn A LOT from the lectures. Testing and grading is very reasonable.",
    "good course, i enjoyed going to class",
    "Principles of Infectious Diseases II has both similarities and differences compared to the first portion of the class. Using some of the foundation concepts learned through PID I, this course takes a more hands on use of the concepts in order to tackle current trends and issues in infectious disease research and public health surveillance.",
    "Yes, definitely would recommend this course!",
    "This is a great survey course. It's engaging, informative, and well taught. You will come away with both an understanding of the global burden of IDs and a framework through which to analyze problems and interventions. Take it even if you aren't in EMD!",
    "Very interesting and engaging overview of current infectious, parasitic, and microbial disease. Will discuss many topics not covered in general infectious disease courses, including current research with guest lectures by interesting high-quality researchers in the field. Lecturer is knowledgeable and engaging. Workload is medium-low, prepare for many group presentations and further self-study if a particular topic engages you.",
    "Great and Interesting class. I'm going to miss it",
    "Yes! If you are into infectious diseases at all, must take it!",
