    "Take this class. I don't care what your major is, take it. It will be the best decision you have made in a long time, and that is not an exaggeration. I know this kind of review is easy to dismiss, but you will regret doing so if you do.",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale, and the first time I've really enjoyed an engineering class.It was amazing. The basic premise to use doctors as mentors \/ clients, thereby not only giving us a real problem to work on, but giving us the experience of iterating the solution with the doctors and having their help in testing it, in doing anything to move it forward, was extremely rewarding.Then the teaching staff and their commitment to our learning \/ progress was also excellent. We were pushed hard, but even those who had little experience building \/ designing (me) were given theproper encouragement to get started and finish the semester with a whole new passion and confidence. By pushed hard, the more engaged members on our team easily put in 10 hours a week beyond the class, but I've never loved work more as it was devoted to designing or building, with the CEID as an awesome setting.Even though the curriculum was being developed as we went, I didn't have any issue with that and thought it was well considered and communicated by the teachers. Finally, the opportunity to see the medical device industry from many angles was a great juxtaposition to the design process.It's making me re-think what I want to do after school and given me a new confidence to consider new options. Plus, we are continuing the project with our doctors (they are so excited) and I've been able to turn it into my senior project, far better than any other option I had.Such an excellent class",
    "One of the most dynamic courses at Yale. This course served as an opportunity to apply a wide range of skills towards solving a real-world problem as part of a diverse team. One of the most challenging and rewarding classes that I know of. It was a lot of work and at times you feel lost, but this is due to the fact that the problems are open ended and that the students are actually interacting with real people's problems. The professors spend a lot of time making sure that the class is a great learning experience for each student. The lectures provided valuable background for those interested in medical device design.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale so far. So empowering to be able to solve a real-world problem with doctors. Although SO many hours were put in it, working with an eclectic team of students and being able to construct something from scratch was an amazing process. Definitely take it!! Professors are great and the healthcare lecturers are awesome.",
    "Without a doubt, the best course I have taken at Yale. But be warned, if you are one of the team members with the technical knowledge to actually make your device, this course will consume your life. It is incredibly rewarding if your project works, but it is not easy to get there - many late night, many weeks of frustration, ups and downs of design - it takes a toll on your emotional health. There is minimal written report work when compared to an engineering design course, which allows us to focus on the actual project.The project has the goal of meeting some unmet need in the medical space. Rather than assign specific projects with specifications, we are given the freedom to decide what avenues to pursue to solve a specific problem. The course gives a more holistic design approach to a problem, rather than a specific engineering approach.If you have time, take it. If you are a senior MechE and are doing 489 as well, prepare for some long nights.",
    "MENG404 is an amazing course and probably one of the most rewarding courses I've ever taken at Yale. It's similar to MENG489 except that all of the projects are medical devices, the group is more interdisciplinary, andthere are fewer reports to write! Dr. Zinter (and Dr. Fan) pushed us really hard, but we needed it, and it really helped to keep us motivated and excited throughout the semester. Be aware that the course does require a lot of work and a lot of time in the CEID, but it's very hands-on and you'll definitely learn a lot especially if you don't have prototyping\/building experience. They bring in a lot of interesting speakers for the class lectures, which give you a nice context to put your own project in. I think a lot of the experience depends on what your project is, so pay attention to the physician lectures in the beginning so you can choose a project you will enjoy working on for the entire semester. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Medical Devices is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Unlike most classes, the course is more of a long term project that requires students to work on real-world problems and find their own solutions. The greatest strength of the course are the professors (Richard Fan and Joseph Zinter) who poured their entire life, sweat, and tears into the success of the semester. Whenever we had any problems or obstacles to face, Joe would be in the CEID available to talk it out. Often times I would be on the computer working on a SolidWorks CAD and he would come over and just talk over some ideas. We had many wonderful brainstorming activities and our instructors' hard work and dedication was more inspiration for us to put more effort into the semester. This was the first year and it was experimental, that being said, the results of the course were also pretty amazing. We learned how to use Solidworks, 3-D printers, laser cutters, the lathe, and other machining equipment over the course of only 4 months. I wasso thankful for having the opportunity to take this class and I hope Yale University chooses to keep it for the years to come, as it is a break-through into the types of engineering courses that lead to innovation on campus.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in medical device development. Ability to make stuff is a plus, but you never know what you will be working on, and there is lots of room to explore the patent space, market research, human factors, as well as mechanical and\/or electrical design. I feel like this course has given me the best semester-long preparation to work in a particular field of any class I have taken at Yale.",
    "This class gives you the opportunity to design a novel medical device for a doctor at the New Haven Hospital. It is a wonderful fusion of biomedical and mechanical engineering. Half of the classes are set aside for working within your group and the other half are for lectures given by people in the medical field, patent law, FDA, etc. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in this area. It is a lot of work, but worth every second of it. I am so happy that I took the class and I wish I could take it again.",
    "I applied to this class on a whim. It was the first year they offered it and I wasn't sure I was qualified to take it (I knew little about engineering and nothing about medical devices). I have to say, that was the best decision I've ever made at Yale, and this was the best class I've taken in my 4 years here. You learn all about the design process from ideation to prototyping. You hear from so many awesome speakers in various spaces, and learn about what it means to design things. The two professors, Joe abd Richard, are absolutely phenomenal. They are endlessly dedicated to this class. Apply. Take it.",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale. It is such a real life experience and really teaches you about the medical device\/biotechnology industry. The lecturers they bring in from the FDA, other companies, patent offices, etc. show you so many aspects that go into product development in a company. Every meeting, presentation, report and step in the design and fabrication process teaches you real skills that will actually be applicable in industry. The teachers expect a lot from you, and it is a lot of work, but it is by far the most rewarding and most I have learned in a class from Yale. I felt like this was not just a class, but a real life experience. You are working on real projects for real patients. Many of the projects are being further pursued in the hopes that in the future it will actually be patented, marketed and manufactured to help patients worldwide. Despite how much work it is, you don't feel like you are doing work for a pset or just a homework assignment or essay. You feel like your work could actually make a difference in the world. Definitely take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend Medical Device Design to a fellow student looking to obtaina practical hands-on experience in Medical Device Design. One should plan to allocate a sizable amount of time for this class as for any engineering design class. The class provides a fantastic opportunity to not only to prototype a concept tackling medical challenges, but also hear from different lecturers from the FDA, medical device companies, and YEI, providing a holistic foundation for understanding the industry.",
    "Amazing course. You learn a ton, and it's really fun and motivating. Lots of work!",
    "By far the best elective I've taken at Yale, engineering or otherwise. Consider yourself blessed if you are accepted. That said, I highly encourageyou to clear the rest of your schedule so you can devote a large chunk of time to your project. The benefits you reap from this class will be proportional to the amount of time you spend on it. Dr. Zinter and Dr. Fan are top notch, and you'll learn a ton. Take the course if you're lucky enough to have the chance.",
    "If you are interested in learning how a medical device is made from conception to design to implementation, this class will serve those needs and so much more. This class has the potential to birth a new interest or project that can expand into a career or at the very least, an exceptionally satisfying experience that cannot be emulated by any other course on campus.",
    "I would summarize MENG 404 to other students as a full interactive, high intensity project-based class that offers good exposure and background into the world of medical device design. The course is a good opportunity to get to know the CEID and to stretch engineering know-how in a very practical, research based way.I would fully recommend MENG 404 to other students (especially grad students) because its a unique learning experience that has enriched my Yale experience and my understanding of how I perform as a manager and thinker."
