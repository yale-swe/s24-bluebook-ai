   "comments": [
    "Lectures are very well-organized, tests are straightforward, grading is fair, and the advocacy project was a great assignment. Great, great, great class. Sad that Professor Frick is leaving though. If the class is offered by someone else, it would probably be very different.",
    "If you are interested in neuroscience, definitely.",
    "Yup, recommended but probably won't be offered again",
    "Prof. Frick is leaving after this semester, so I don't know if this course will be offered again. But in case it will be: you end up learning a lot, but the material is not presented in an interesting way. The exams are difficult. There is a presentation on the paper before the paper is due, which helps to organize your paper and keep you on schedule. For the exam you only have to do the readings that students present.",
    "Yes but the professor is leaving and the class won't be the same without her.",
    "Psyc 338 is a narrowed neuroscience class. It focuses on Alzheimers, dementia and cognitive impairments in the elderly, as well as just the aging process in general (on a hormonal, mood, activity level etc.) You really enhance your understanding of neuroscience as well as apply it to a specific age group.",
    "In Psych 338 we learned that a lot of cognitive functioning declines with age, which you probably already know. There was some interesting stuff about specific deficits and preventing cognitive decline, but overall I didn't feel that I got too much out of the class. If you're particularly interested in the neuroscientific aspects of aging, then maybe you'll get more out of the class, but I wouldn't recommend it all that strongly.",
    "Psych 338 is a great class for students interesting in neuroscience. It covers all of the diseases and effects of aging that result from cognitive damage. It is a very broad topic and will help encourage students to take care of their bodies and live healthier lifestyles after learning about the harmful effects of not doing so.",
    "You don't often get to hear about how the brain (+ other things) change when you age, so the class offers a unique perspective on things you have likely heard about before in a neuroscience course. On the flip side, individuals lectures tend to be dry."
