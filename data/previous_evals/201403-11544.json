It changed the way I view the aid and development field, and hopefully with my now critical eye, I can improve the way it works.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings. I only wished that there were a few more contemporary (post 2000) readings mixed in with the classics.",
    "The lectures by Professor Dove were amazing. You can tell that a significant amount of time and thought went into preparing the lecture and it shows. It helped give the readings a strong context, asked provocative questions, and stimulated interest in the material. The guest lectures were very interesting--particularly Michael Hathaway. Keep that part of the course for sure!",
    "I enjoyed all of the topics covered.",
    "The readings and discussions were great and helped a lot in expanding critical thinking.",
    "The pacing and design of the course, the way concepts were grouped, and the supporting readings and discussions were exceptional.",
    "Professor Dove's lectures were high points of the course. He was always well-organized, and his comments were insightful and thought-provoking. The information presented enabled me to examine new angles of the work I am engaged in and of environmental and development programs in general. Particularly useful and practical were the lectures focused on how to appropriately engage with communities and informants.",

    "Instead of a 1 paragraph summary about the intended topic of the final paper, a 3-5 page outline or some other more lengthy requirement would be helpful to encourage students to organize their thinking and think deeply about their topic in advance of writing the final paper",
    "If the students can get a transcript of the instructors speeches, that would be most helpful.",
    "I think the lectures and discussions could have been more dynamic. They were interesting, but dragged on a bit. I thought the way they were structured last semester, the same amount of material could have been covered in 2 hours instead of 3.",
    "I would pick one book between \"Political Economy of Soil Erosion\" and \"Uncertainty on a Himalayan Scale\"--they are similar and it would create space to add a different book.",
    "More case studies on successful case studies where an anthropological angle bought a positive change.",
    "In some of my classes the teaching assistant took part in discussion group meetings before the class, this could be helpful in this class as well.",
    "The 3 hour block of class was a bit long, and the way reading week sign-ups were done was a bit confusing, but both those are minor.",
    "It would be extremely helpful to have the mandatory opportunity to meet with the professor before presenting in class as a discussion leader. This would have helped to ensure that the discussion section brought out main important points that the professor hoped we would discuss. A pre-class meeting with Prof. Dove would be beneficial to the presenters and the class alike. This is particularly critical for topics\/readings that did not have a clear link to the previous topics, such as We Shall Now Praise Famous Men. Otherwise the topics presented and discussed a times seemed disjointed.",
