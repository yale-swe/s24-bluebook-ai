   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for people who like math and only people who like math.",
    "This is a good course, and you should take it if you've had good preparation in calculus. Make sure to pre-register so that you get a good section. Many people recommend Michael Frame's, as he is the only tenured faculty member running a section. I took it with Joseph Lauer instead, and I have to say that this was a great decision. Even though Lauer is only a graduate student, I have rarely encountered anyone as good at teaching. He is, without exaggeration, a budding superstar of the pedagogical world. He's from Canada, which means that you will be able to understand what he says. He knows his stuff, and his explanations are always clear and concise. He has a good sense of humour and is very pleasant to talk to. What more could you want? I really cannot recommend him highly enough.",
    "Take it with Lauer or (as other people suggest) Frame. Most people have to take 120 anyway as a prerequisite, so might as well get it out of the way.Note to prospective Physics 260 students: I came into Yale with no multivariable calculus background, and 120 was a perfect corequisite. You have to teach yourself some of the math for 260, but for the most part, 120 covers all you need to know.",
    "Yes, its a fundamental math course for many majors.",
    "It's multivariable calculus, so starting off, it's easy and straightforward, and as you go along, it gets more and more difficult.",
    "This class is the definition of \"ridonkulous.\" Honestly, I have never taken a more pointlessly hopeless class. I imagine that this is the type of course that you are forced to take when you have been arrested. You literally have a better chance of winning the lottery or getting away with murder in a police department than passing this class with any semblance of an A. If you don't get Frame, which a lot of you won't because he is very sick, then you might consider another class. If this class is required for a major, FIND A NEW MAJOR! You are probably laughing while reading this, and I know that I did the same thing in the beginning of the year, but for once, LISTEN TO THIS! I actually feel bad for you because you are considering this class. DO NOT TAKE IT. If you do get Frame, you will still fail miserably, you just might enjoy failing a bit more. If you don't get frame, you will be taught by an eastern european girl who really doesnt even know what an integral is. You think I'm exaggerating, the scary part is that I AM NOT! Flee. Just close this computer screen and flee.They are coming.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. They might tell you to take ENAS 151, but I don't really know anything about that, so check it out maybe.",
    "Same response at Question 1",
    "Yes, I loved the material. I took Math 115, and liked it too but found 120 more interesting (and in my opinion easier to understand). There is a lot of connection between 120 concepts and the physical world, so if you have enjoyed physics you will probably like 120. That being said, I had an amazing teacher who made a big difference with my 120 experience. Lauer teaches a fun and engaging class. He is sincerely interested in helping you learn the material and learn why it's important. His students do well on the tests too. I would recommend Lauer over any other professor.",
    "Lots of people say Math 120 isn't the best course, and I'm a bit of a math geek so maybe that's true for a lot of people, but I liked it. It's a basic, systematic look at multivariable calculus in a standard math class setting. But what can be a problem is the instructor of the course. I would recommend the class if you want to continue taking math classes, but only if you can get a good instructor. TAKE IT WITH JOE LAUER IF YOU CAN. I was a bit skeptical at the beginning because he can mumble sometimes, but he is actually GREAT. I sat in on review sessions with other instructors and I was shocked by how much better Joe was. He actually looked at us and talked to us and asked us questions instead of talking to the board the whole time. He always took questions and was very invested in making sure we were all on the same page. He also had a sense of humor and the class was a very comfortable environment. So he's awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. Useful skills. But unfortunately you won't recognize their usefulness during the course.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 because it's a great continuation of calculus. Don't be scared by the rumors- it's not bad and actually really interesting. Again, don't be misled by the midterms- the final is much more difficult.",
    "I liked the material presented in this course, but overall it wasn't my favorite that I took this year. Though my teacher was great, the textbook was often unclear and not very helpful. The problem sets often took a while to complete but seemed to not count much towards the final grade. This course is valuable in that I learned a lot, but it is pretty demanding.",
    "It is a hard class!! The problem sets and tests are not for the faint-hearted. Also, a lot of the kids in the class had already taken multivariable in high school. This is not a \"for fun\" class at all.",
    "I would highly recommend it. It teaches multivariable calculus computation, which isn't too hard but isn't so easy that it's boring. The class only takes a few hours a week for a p-set, so you learn a pretty high amount for just a little time. Only thing that might deter some people is that the class involves no proofs, so if you want that then this class isn't the one.",
    "This was a great class to take first semester to learn basic multivariable calculus. High school BC calculus was sufficient preparation for this class.",
    "This course is very though. It starts off easy but then gets increasing harder after every test. It is imperative that if you take this course that you pay attention in lectures because they give so much help when doing the problem sets. A good word of advice is to read the book before the lectures so that you will understand everything in class before hand so that when Lauer is solving problems, so have better incite.",
    "Math 120 is your standard multivariable calculus class - no less, no more. It was exactly what I expected, and I was happy with the class. Be wary that many people in the class have already taken multivariable.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student, but you definitely have to be interested in math if you want to take it. If you're not motivated to understand the concepts, you might not enjoy the class.",
    "MATH120 is a pretty standard math course, and you\u0092re probably taking it to fulfill some sort of requirement for a major. But by the end of the semester, I found myself actually kind of enjoying multivariable calculus. The stuff you learn is actually prettycool and problem-solving can be enjoyable once you get used to it! Take the course with Lauer! He was probably my favorite instructor this semester. He always seemed to know everyone\u0092s name, and he was very approachable during office hours. His instruction and lecturing was extremely clear and understandable, and he was always open to questions or doing one more example problem before moving on. He seemed to really care about the class and for me, that made the class worthwhile.",
    "MATH 120 covers the main facets of multivariate calculus, building on single-variable calculus but applying the concepts to 3D spaces. It requires you to think in a slightly different way frombefore but because of that you see a much wider range of how calculus can be used. I would recommend this course especially for people interested in science and the social sciences because the concepts taught can be applied to many of these fields such as economics and engineering.",
    "Math 120 goes over exactly what the bluebook says it is going to go over and it's straightforward and manageable. The class has a pretty poor reputation, but take it with Joe Lauer and it'll be enjoyable.If you are required to take this course, choose your section carefully because the teacher does make a difference. With that being said, I would definitely recommend Math120 with Joe or another good teacher. I learned a lot and I left the class feeling pretty comfortable with the concepts taught in the class."
