   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Latin 430 as a good Latin course that focuses on a surprisingly interesting yet uncommonly taught work. Professor Freudenburg's great knowledge of the subject and his laid-back personality made the class an interesting and unstressful one.",
    "I would definitely recommend the Fasti, and Professor Freudenburg in general. The class was manageable and enjoyable.",
    "Fun class with a great professor -- pretty slow pace, since it's a class that appeals to a wide range of Latinists. Still interesting and worthwhile, just expect to be on your own for a lot of it.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a straight forward L5 latin class. About 300 lines of translation every week, but Ovid is pretty easy to read. There's a quiz every week, but it keeps you on top of the translation. The fasti are pretty interesting... there's a lot of mythical background used to explain roman festivals and traditions. I liked the concept for the paper, which had us explore a very specific feature of the fasti of our choice in detail. The exams were perfectly fair and even a little bit easy.",
    "Relatively easy class (120 lines translated per class, about), really chill professor, awesome subject matter. Quiz once a week (fairly easy, all material covered the previous week), one paper and a presentation about the paper, and a midterm and final.",
    "An excellent translation-based course for someone with a solid background in Latin. Faster-paced than the high school Latin courses I took, but nothing unmanageable. Excellently taught, and very rewarding.",
    "Highly recommended - focuses on a piece of literature that does not get the attention it deserves.",
    "Coming into this from 4s on the latin AP tests was a very difficult step up. Maybe stick to something easier if that is your position. Otherwise, the course was interesting and probably pretty easy for more experienced students."
