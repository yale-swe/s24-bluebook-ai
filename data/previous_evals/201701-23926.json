    "I really enjoyed this course. Joan's teaching style is great for teaching those of us without a law background, and she's great at explaining the content in a way I could understand it. I loved the first class and feel like that was a key choice in creating enthusiasm for the topic for the rest of the semester. I do feel like the students who missed that first class (non YSD students) missed out on that!",
    "I appreciated the suggested reading section that hopefully I'll be able to tackle this summer.",
    "The organization of Law and the Arts was very good, starting with basics of copyright law, and moving into more complex applications. In the moment, it was unclear why we learned the moral rights and trademark law, but the information was interesting nonetheless. Is there a reason why .rtf files were used for the syllabus and the case law? I often find PDFs are easier to read from."

    "Great professor. Very engaging and gives a very good introduction to law and the arts.",
    "I love the Joan Channick approach to PowerPoint! Main points and key info. They make a great reference for the exams and for reviewing. Her knowledgeability on the subject is priceless! She was also very helpful outside of class when I came to her with questions related to law and the arts. I appreciate, too, that she let us eat lunch in class because of the 12:15pm-2pm class time.",
    "Joan was a fantastic instructor for this course, which is fitting, since she created it. There were times, however, when she seemed dismissive of incorrect answers or of questions that were not immediately on the topic under discussion. Sometimes, those questions, or those incorrect answers, could lead to further learning opportunities for us, if given the dignity of a reasoned response and\/or a bit of discussion. That said, she is spectacularly well-prepared, and knows how to deliver the complex information of legal cases in very simple, small steps that the group can easily understand. This was particularly useful given the differing experience of everyone in the class."

    "I will definitely be keeping the material from this clas as a reference book for my career.",
    "Maybe my favorite class of the semester and I wish we could go a little more in depth than we did. However, I think that may be because I have a larger interest in logical reasoning and the law. I also wish there was more freedom in our schedules so that I could dissect the cases a little more."

    "A few too many bodies in the classroom. I think more people may have stayed in the course if we all had equal seats.",
    "I would have enjoyed more opportunities to have class discussions about hypothetical cases, like we did in the first class. It was a fun way to exercise what we were learning.",
    "Honestly, mostly just the PDFs for the readings. Makes everything easier to read on multiple devices. Aside from that, I wonder if we might have any homework or something around contracts, to get us more familiar with using or identifying the elements of a fair contract? It's hard to ask for more homework in the drama school, so even just more focused discussion on finding whether or not given contracts are fair could be helpful (i.e. to help us identify things like the lack of mutual indemnification in some of the contracts we read after the midterm)."
