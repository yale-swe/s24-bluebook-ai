   "comments": [
    "It could be improved by removing the readings that were not tested on and seemed like fillers. I was confused about the point of watching Al Otro Lado, I thought it was very pointless and a waste of time. I wish we could have spent those class days reviewing for the final test which was significantly harder than anything else we did in that class.",
    "Strengths: 1. The textbook was very useful for learning grammar and having a source of reference. 2. I thought the presentations were a good way to learn about Spanish or Latin American culture, while also improving our speaking skills. Weaknesses: 1. Class time could have been been spent doing more useful activities. We didn't spend much time talking, which I think is a major purpose of class to improve our speaking and listening skills. 2. The absence policy was unfair. Although we are allowed 5 absences throughout the semester, this is pretty deceiving as on some days we have small assignments which need to be submitted in class or else we don't receive any credit. I thought this was especially unfair. 3. Supersite activities were not very helpful in improving grammar. I also did not think Palabras Problematicas were very useful.",
    "Better professors across the board. I thought my instructor was not as skillful as the others.",
    "Teacher was not engaged whatsoever. Course schedule was easy to keep up with. Hard to learn when teacher did not seem like she wanted to be there.",
    "Too much reading, not enough teaching grammar.",
    "It is too hard. Not designed as a true intro class."

    "No, I didn't enjoy it. Would only recommend if said student had strong interest in Spanish or had to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Yes, learning Spanish is a very practical skill to have right now and especially within the next century.",
    "Yes",
    "Only if they need the credit or it is their major.",
    "No, unless you took spanish in high school."
