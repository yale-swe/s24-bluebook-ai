   "comments": [
    "A much more comprehensive understanding of Greek grammar. Practice with forms and vocab. A basic understanding of PIE and the uses of it in being a Classicist!",
    "Students in this course learned about historical linguistics - how Proto-Indo-European became Mycenean Greek, Homer's Greek and classical Greek. We also learned to examine the choices Greek authors make on the level of particles and verb forms and thus became incredibly attuned to what is natural, flowing Greek and what stands out. This kind of close reading is widely applicable not only to Greek but to any kind of reading. We also learned Greek composition and reviewed grammar (and by necessity vocabulary & conjugation - immensely useful for future reading).",
    "I learned the ins and outs of the Ancient Greek language, its history, and discussions around tenses and particles.",
    "I learned to write ancient Greek prose (which made me much better at *reading* Greek prose for stylistic features), and I learned to look at Classical Greek as a product of a long linguistic history."

   "comments": [
    "It was HARD! That being said, it was rewarding. Professor Bakker is, himself, a strength of this course. He is clearly a wealth of knowledge on this issue, and any questions asked in class were answered with kindness and patience. The course is trying to do a lot (which is what Bakker himself says), and that definitely shows. While every class was revolutionary and provided new perspective on the way I read Greek, it was definitely difficult for me to retain all of the content particularly as the semester progressed.",
    "This was a wonderful class. The amount of material we were able to cover through Prof. Bakker's superb preparation and grasp of his subject is amazing. I think the combination of the Greek syntax class and the historical linguistics class really worked in this way; I don't feel like either subject was slighted, and I feel in command of both. For me, I think the main improvement to the course would be more help with the historical linguistics assignments at the beginning (the Fortson assignments were challenging, though the book was understandable because we always went over the information in class first). Otherwise, I found the intellectual rigor very valuable. So too I think the part of our course about understanding discourse made me a much more critical reader prepared to undertake my own scholarship.",
    "The course is very, very difficult and work-heavy. It might be better by having the first and second halves of the course more integrated, and slightly less homework (so its less repetitive).",
    "The only weakness of the course is its attempt to fit more material than is reasonable into a very short time. This is a new course, though, and I think the department is probably already in the process of addressing that problem."

    "Know what you are getting yourself into! This class is HARD! And is a lot of work! HOWEVER, you will be thoroughly educated, and you will look at Greek entirely differently after this course. Your understanding and appreciation for the language will grow exponentially, and I can promise it will be absolutely seminal to your understanding of the Classics at large. Do not take this class with other very intensive classes or else you will not be able to appreciate this class and its work!",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would, but only if you have had a lot of experience with Greek and your other courses arent as difficult. It will probably be your hardest course of the semester.",
    "Yes -- cautiously. It's a great course; I learned a whole lot, and I've got a new set of tools for approaching texts, for which I'm grateful. But it's grueling, too -- it was tons of work, and the exam was incredibly difficult, and some of the concepts were hard to grasp. That's an important kind of challenge to have, but you probably don't want to take it with an otherwise-heavy courseload or lots of nonacademic commitments."
