    "I really struggle with memorizing characters so I still need to find what works for me",
    "Strengths: Chinese department is amazing, organized, and genuinely cares about your progress and how much youre enjoying the class Weaknesses: maybe too much emphasis on writing characters at expense of grammar, old textbook",
    "Strengths: consistent work load following same pattern for each unit, interesting ways of learning (class discussion, projects, essays, presentations, etc.), small class size Weaknesses: too difficult, I think that since we meet everyday and the homework is a lot, normal quia assignments should be graded for completion. The tests were also a little too hard. You have to sacrifice A LOT of time to do well in this class, and the problem is that it then prevents you from pursuing a lot of other amazing things at Yale deeply.",
    "The strengths were the variety of learning styles used, including powerpoints, home exercises, essays, etc. The biggest strength for my course, however, was Liang Laoshi! The only weakness I can think of is that maybe the tutorial sessions aren't necessary EVERY week (maybe twice a month?), though that might just be a me thing."

    "Yes but ONLY if you are passionate about learning Chinese and especially if you are willing to do the immense amount of work. But if you put a lot into the class you will get a lot of great learning out of it.",
    "If you're looking to truly devote yourself to Chinese, then definitely. If you're not willing to commit wholeheartedly, I wouldn't recommend it, just because it is so much work each night."
