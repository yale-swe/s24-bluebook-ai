    "Take this class. You will not regret it. You will not write the same way after taking this class (and it's for the better).",
    "I absolutely loved this class, and it has been my favorite class at Yale thus far. The material is interesting, the class discussions were lively and stimulating, and all of the writing practice we did certainly served to make me a better writer. Professor Ehrgood is brilliant and passionate about his students. He acts as a fantastic moderator for class discussions, and he provides excellent commentary on all of our writing, which is no easy task given all of the assignments we submitted over the course of the semester. He is always well prepared and ready with interesting new discussion topics. I really appreciated that he took the time to meet with his students outside of class in order to discuss our writing and homework assignments. This extra interaction and one-on-one teaching added significantly to my experience. I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for a chance to improve their writing while also learning about the law and all the complexities of judicial decision-making and legal arguments. It's a lot of work, but well worth it.",
    "A must-take - life as a student becomes so much easier once you know how to write, and Ehrgood is the person to teach you. I know few instructors who are as thoughtful and dedicated as he. If you're worried about grades, just start the course CDF - if you do the work, your writing will improve and you will accomplish things in prose that you never thought you could.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. I don't care whether you want to go to law school or not. Take it. Organize your semester around it. Organize your life around it. Never have I ever felt a class was more worth it than this one. It's a lot of work, but it's so worth it. And because it's a lot of work day-to-day, there's never pressure on each assignment. It will change the way you think and the way you write and the way you speak. It's the best class I've ever taken. And that's largely also because Professor Ehrgood puts SO much time into everyone -- like line-editing daily assignments and meeting with you every other week for at least a half hour and conferencing about multiple paper drafts for hours. Every ounce of work you put into it, you get a lot out of it. Professor Ehrgood is probably the best human at Yale, and he'll make it so worth your while. He's demanding and expects a lot, BUT he's also reasonable, flexible, funny, and kind. So, so kind. Best professor I've had at Yale, best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend students who are interested in learning legal writing and thinking. You won't learn law in this class, but you will learn a way of thinking and writing about law. It would challenge your assumption about leaning law and open your eyes to a colorful thinking and writing process.",
    "Best class I took in four years at Yale, easily. Ehrgood is divine; he brings energy, humor, and compassion to class every single day. The coursework itself falls into two categories: writing style and legal thought. Writing style means learning formal guidelines for improving writing, and then using them to edit sentences. It might sound boring but I was able to see the payoff immediately and it felt great. Very few other classes focus so minutely on developing writing as a skill. If you want to improve your writing, for any field, I recommend this class. The legal part of the class is fascinating, involving wild hypothetical and real life cases, and combining elements of philosophy, politics, and of course law. Even if you do not plan on law school, I suspect you will find it engrossing. Workload is significant for the first half of the class, with assignments due before each seminar. To sum up: TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Could not recommend it more.",
    "ENGL 121 01 is definitely a great class to take. Both for what it will do to your writing and for the knowledge that you will accumulate in many interesting areas. The major assignment of the course is a very engaging project at the border to political science, philosophy and law and probably was the most interesting assignment I have done at Yale.",
    "Great class. Lots of work! Ehrgood's class is not only a great way to learn about the law, but also to improve your basic writing skills. I found particularly useful the numerous style exercises we were assigned. Ehrgood is a fantastic teacher, very lively and fun to be around. He enjoys a cult-like following among some of my peers which I don't think is necessarily deserved, but to each their own. I just didn't feel particularly blown out of the water by any of our classes. I think what makes Ehrgood stand out among other professors is the sheer amount of care and work he puts into the class. He regularly meets with students, makes comments on all of our assignments, and is even available for extra meetings if you ask him. I really appreciated his dedication to the course.",
    "ENGL 121 01 is a great course for basically anyone. It is a gem in a pile of rocks! If you do not take this course, then you might be making the biggest mistake of your life. Definitely take it if you're even a little interested in law. Even if you're not interested in law, however, you can still learn so much about writing\/thinking\/analyzing\/etc. from this course.",
    "This class and this professor are INCREDIBLE. The work is relevant and helpful and it is unquestionably one of the most useful, engaging courses I have ever taken at Yale. The workload is kinda front loaded, worth starting credit\/d, but truly life changing.",
    "Expect to put several hours into each assignment, even (or especially?) when you're writing just one or two paragraphs for the next day. If you do, it pays off. Professor Ehrgood takes you *very* seriously as a thinker and as a writer, so give him your best writing in order to make the most of his feedback and praise. Absolutely recommend. I thoroughly enjoyed what we talked about each day, and I didn't know anything about the law or the judicial system beforehand."
