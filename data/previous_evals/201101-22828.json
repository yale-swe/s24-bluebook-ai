    "TAKE IT!",
    "Great course- fun, interesting, informative, and overall very enjoyable. I highly recommend this course, especially for those interested in archaeological studies!",
    "Simply a continuation of the first semester course. depending on what was found on the dig 1st semester, and what subject you specifically are studying, you could have a lot of work 2nd semester (in this course) or you could have very little.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's freaking sweet. Plus, you basically get a credit for writing one paper.",
    "Archaeological Studies 279L is the second semester of lab for Archaeological Field Techniques. If you took the first semester courses then you a required to take this course. Essentially, the semester is structured around analyzing the artifacts you found\/brought back from the first semester. The course is purposefully front-loaded, with most of the work due at midterm. It's a very relaxed environment, which can be both good and bad.",
    "Well, if you took the class first semester, you have to take this one. It's great, but you have to stay on top of your work or it will creep up on you. There's less direction, but you have a great opportunity to really investigate your artifacts. Plus, you're done with the final paper by spring break, so you don't have to worry about it during finals!"
