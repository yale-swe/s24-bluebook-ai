   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you're up for a lot of close reading and enjoy tackling the challenge of a really tough poem. If you're looking for an easy A or a way to fulfill the pre-1900 requirement without a ton of reading, just think twice--but it is completely worth it as long as you're willing to put in the work.",
    "Would not recommend this course.",
    "You will spend an inordinate (though not unenjoyable) amount of time on the Romantics, who in the course are a kind of prelude to the Victorians. Tennyson and Browning are great; Barrett Browning was fine. Take it if you like Professor Brisman and Tennyson -- even if you hate the rest of the poets, it'll still be a great course.",
    "This class focuses on the poetry of Tennyson and Browning, with a brief excursion into Elizabeth Barrett. Questions of literary influence and the relationship between imagination and action resurface throughout the semester. I would recommend any class taught by Professor Brisman; he is an extraordinary teacher--unsurpassed in his wisdom, dedication and rigor.",
    "This class is good overview of Victorian Poetry, hitting most of the major poets and a few of the minor ones. There was some comparison of them to the Romantic Poets. I would highly recommend this class, even if you don't think that Victorian Poetry is your cup of tea, because Professor Brisman is so delightful. Shop this class at the very least and you won't regret it!",
    "This class was hard, sometimes mystifying, sometimes rewarding. Some of the poetry we encountered-- Tennyson, Browning-- is wonderful. However, I didn't love this class as much as Professor Brisman's other classes because it seemed rather too lofty and academic for me (maybe because it is a combined senior seminar\/grad course) and I spent a lot of class time feeling perplexed.",
    "Absolutely recommend anything with Brisman."
