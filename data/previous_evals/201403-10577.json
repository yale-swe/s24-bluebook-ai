   "comments": [
    "It's a required seminar, so you'll have to take it.",
    "A thorough introduction to early cinema. Would recommend to anyone interested in early cinema. Not a research methodology class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who is pursuing PhD in Film Studies, although I don't need to since the course is mandatory and everyone is taking it anyway.",
    "Charlie's class provides a thorough and nuanced history of pre-classical film and film scholarship. I would definitely recommend this class, but I might also warn students that the class can be as much a personal history of Charlie's relationships with some of the top film scholars in the country. I found his personal anecdotes useful, but some might find them grating.",
    "The course offers a comprehensive overview on American early cinema"

   "comments": [
    "I entered the PhD program with an MA from the University of Chicago, so my grounding in film history had originally been in a more international context. Although that's valuable (and indeed something I would love for the Yale program to incorporate), it also meant that I didn't have a deep sense of American film history and film historiography. That was excellently attended to by this seminar.",
    "It was an in-depth introduction to the most important question in Film Studies - how it all began.",
    "Before taking the course I was already somewhat familiar with early cinema in America but the course deepened my knowledge significantly. As I mentioned earlier I find the beginnings of cinema a necessary thing to study by anyone who is in film studies. Although the course not particularly relevant to what I am planning to do for my dissertation the research I did for my final paper addressed some of the topics I am working on.",
    "The course provided me with very useful context for any publishing I do in film studies in the future. It also offered invaluable research experience in American film and media archives, which I'm sure I will bring to bear on my future research. Thank you, Charlie, for your expertise, warmth, and encouragement!",
    "This course provided an invaluable window into the research, archival, and expository techniques employed by contemporary early film historians and completely transformed my understanding of the genealogy of cinema by staging the American narrative of its emergence alongside the European one that has framed my prior experience in Film Studies. It is difficult to determine the direction of my dissertation so early in my graduate career, but I will certainly deploy many of the skills I learned in this course, particularly the practice of reconstituting the form and cultural effect of ephemeral media through an accumulation of their textual traces.",
    "It provides a solid foundation",
    "This class was a huge inspiration for me. Charlie opened up a powerful dialog among the group throughout the semester, allowing us as a class to feel free to speak to one another as much as to speak through him as the professor. It was an immensely supportive and collaborative atmosphere. Those class conversations and our readings and film viewings will long be a reservoir from which I will be excitedly drawing throughout my future studies and career."
