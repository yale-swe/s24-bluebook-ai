    "definitely!!!! best sc credit for non science majors ever! you actually learn a lot about very interesting material!",
    "It's a survey of important theories and discoveries in quantum physics and other topics in physics. The material is very interesting and the course provides a good picture of the history of physics in the 19th and early 20th century. I found this course to be a valuable study of the history of physics and a good introduction to concepts in particle physics. It's not too difficult. I wouldn't say that it's a breeze, though. I would recommend it.",
    "It's a good class if you want to read more about modern physics and are self motivated to take interest in the class. It is kind of dull at times, but the work isn't too much and it's a good chance to read about some pretty cool concepts.",
    "This class is awesome! The information is totally crazy and fascinating. It's a decent amount of work, but not that hard to get an A if you study.",
    "Yes. Most liberal arts class I've taken at Yale--something outside my area of interest, but I learned a ton and was exposed well to the field. The Professor and TA were great. Can be tricky stuff though.",
    "Summary: one 2hr class\/week, for which you read 3-4 articles and complete a reading response (basically summarizes the main ideas of the articles) which grading is pretty lax on. Two or three quizzes, similarly lax, and a final paper on the topic of your choice.If you're a Humanities major looking for an easy Science credit, go for it. Its not that hard and the material is fairly interesting - but beware the students who ask really stupid questions and make class boring for everyone.",
    "Yes! A very interesting science credit. Not sure exactly how the knowledge in this class helps you, but you'll feel like a more educated person with a working knowledge of the universe, quantum physics, uncertainty principle, string theory, etc. Also pretty easy to get a good grade if you put in the work and study. Don't worry if you dont have a science background--even the most basic AP physics is good enough for this. And Helen Caines is very friendly and supportive.",
    "Definitely take this if you need or want to take a science but don't want to or cant do heavy math.",
    "Physics 120 is a decent way to fulfill the science requirement. Some of the concepts are pretty cool, and the work is fairly easy. The problem sets are literally reading comprehension questions, so if you want to learn some cool stuff about science without ever having to do any, this is your class. The final is a paper of a topic of your choosing, which gives you a lot of freedom to explore something that interested you in the class.",
    "As with all non-legitimate science classes at Yale, you want it to be no work, which it's not, and you end up without much tangible knowledge. The material was pretty interesting (although it became hard to stay engaged in 2 hour long lectures by the end of the semester) and the time commitment relatively low.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have an interest in the direction of modern physics but don't have the reqs to get into the higher level physics class",
    "Absolutely, though only if you are a non-science major. Otherwise, you might miss some math behind everything we read about. On the other hand, if you are just curious about science, this is a wonderful course to get a glimpse of what top-notch science does and learn all those concepts you thought you would never get. Not too heavy or boring, you will learn a lot of worthy material.",
    "This is a very good way for a non-science major to get a science credit. My main motivation for taking the course, as a humanities person, was that I wanted an approachable course for non-science majors that wasn't a big joke. This class is way better than the gut science classes that you could take because the people who are in it seem for the most part to actually want to be there, and are engaged in the material. But, it is really no harder than any of those gut classes. Doing all the reading for the week takes about an hour, tops.The material itself is really neat stuff, some of which is mind-blowingly crazy. Professor Caines, if she's teaching it again, is lovely; she's smart, friendly, and has a really pleasant accent.",
    "Physics was a very good class that provided a wide range of topics from the Big Bang theory to quantum mechanics to string theory. The topics are extremely complicated, but Professor Caines did a good job in finding easy-to-understand reading material and answering questions in class. Professor Caines tried to explain the difficult concepts in a relatively easy manner in class, but sometimes it was still too confusing and the reading was necessary to grasp the concept more fully. She was always available after class and for office hours, but the grading on the quizzes and midterm was a bit tough. Take the class though-- it's very interesting and you learn about very difficult concepts without going too in depth (although that could be frustrating at times because you can't understand some things without math).",
    "Quantum Physics and Beyond is an interesting class about modern physics that is very accessible without a lot of science background (I had taken one physics class in high school.) The readings are mainly Scientific American-like and cover various topics from quantum mechanics to relativity and string theory. The science is interesting and the class is not very difficult. It's also a nice contrast to most of the intro science courses in that it has less than 30 students, which I really enjoyed. However, the makeup of the class means that a lot of time is spent explaining and re-explaining things that were covered in the reading, and several of the more interesting things are glossed over because they require too much time or math. So basically, the class is interesting and great if you don't want to take an intro science lecture, where the focus is all on formulas and problem solving with no discussion, but don't expect it to be particularly rigorous, and expect to leave with a bunch of questions still unanswered."
