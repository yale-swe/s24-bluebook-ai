   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone; especially someone interested in reading a wide range of important texts and\/or looking at a theme over the ages and its evolution through historical attitudes and genres. It is intense and interesting without actually being too strenuous, and certainly gives background and viewpoints on literature that inform and improve one's understanding of what one reads outside of the class.",
    "This class is incredible if you want to explore the art of memory. It has great readings and discussions that will be very intellectually fulfilling. Professor Buonocore is amazingly talented. She guides you through the different texts in such a way that you can see the progression of ideas from Plato to Dante in terms of how memory is treated. It is an excellent course if you want to learn more about the philosophy of memory and how it has played a large roll, and continues to play a large roll, in society. I would recommend taking it to explore ideas in a broader sense, acquire a learning tool in terms of reading texts. Professor Buonocore is always looking for ways to further your development as an individual and as an academic.",
    "Please take this course. If you are a English, Literature, Humanities, Philosophy, or Italian major, I would consider it a MUST-TAKE!!!!! It sets the foundation for everything you will be exposed to in the future. At the same time, here at Yale, I major in English and Economics, and I think that the more practical, methodical, and less creative side of me still thoroughly enjoyed this class. It introduces a new way of reading and thinking. How is my mind working? How do I remember things? How do love and memory work together? These are questions that, by the end of the class, you will be able to answer because the class provides a great deal of physical material and offers a ton of discussion to help students discover what memory actually is.",
    "Italian 314 is definitely a unique course, not only for its content\u2014when else do you have an opportunity to dedicate an entire semester to the study of memory?\u2014but also for its method. In this interdisciplinary class, you read both works by philosophers and works of poetry, creating a space where philosophy and literature can come together on the same topic. This diversity ensures that each student will find their own array of texts to latch onto and truly make their own. In this vein of student ownership over the syllabus, the ten-page final paper can be on any topic (tied to the syllabus) of your choosing, thus giving students a welcome opportunity to further explore their own interests about memory in literature and philosophy. Field trips throughout the semester to the Yale University Art Gallery and the Beinecke Library further enhance the feeling of exploration that this course offers. In this light, I would definitely recommend Italian 314 to another student. If for no other reason, Prof. Buonocore is an extremely enthusiastic and passionate instructor and goes out of her way to make each student feel welcome in the classroom.",
    "Take this course! No, seriously this is not an option - TAKE IT! You don't need to be an Italian major, or anything close it that. It will change your life and who you think. I'm not being hyperbolic, it is absolutely amazing!"
