    "Take it if you want to learn to read French in a semester. It's amazing how much you can pick up - at the end, you'll still be limited by your vocabulary and some of the finer points of tense and whatever, but it's a useful skill and the class isn't bad either (mostly grad students). Good for a 5th class\/credit\/d. Two or three tests, weekly homework, translation projects - overall, not too bad.",
    "It's a standard reading course.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who needs a reading knowledge and is ready to invest at least and hour a day reading. I feel it is more suitable to graduate students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to those who need to read French, as it accomplishes this aim.",
    "An overall good class but with a large workload. Definitely recommended for students in need of French instruction for translation purposes, but I would take it during a semester when one's overall workload is lighter than usual."
