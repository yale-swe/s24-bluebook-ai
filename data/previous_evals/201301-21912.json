   "comments": [
    "Good solid roundup that complements everything covered in L1. You learn somewhere around 12 tenses and can come out a fairly decent conversationalist when it's over.",
    "A wonderful language and a wonderful class! Not a huge workload. A lot of grammar in 120, but this is to be expected.",
    "Loved the class. It was just the right amount of work for a daily course that it didn't consume my life, yet I felt as if I was learning tremendous amounts of material. You don't realize how much material you have learned until the very end when you take the oral exams and realize you can hold a conversation with no effort at all. Take the class!",
    "Definitely take it. If you took L1, its a natural progression so not a huge step up in terms of difficulty or work- as much as you'd expect.",
    "This is a really great class. There are a lot of verb tenses to learn in L2 as opposed to L1, so it is definitely harder than first semester, but it is definitely worth taking. Thiago was an excellent professor--he is always engaging and kind, and I highly recommend taking this class with him.",
    "L2 is very different from L1 in that it focuses so much on verbs and conjugation. This takes some getting used to but becomes extremely useful in helping carry on a conversation in Portuguese.",
    "L2 is harder than L1, lots of grammar where L1 was mostly vocab. It seemed tough at times but in the end wasn't too much harder than L1. The exams were not too bad, and I spent the same amount of time on homework and other assignments as I did in L1.",
    "YES! This class is so great.There's an excellent balance of skills (listening, reading, writing, speaking), and the pace was just right. This term (L2) focused mainly on verb tenses, with, of course, some vocabulary and other grammatical forms. Compositions were based on (lovely!) Portuguese films watched outside of class. The atmosphere was friendly and fun, and the workload totally manageable, even light. Beautiful language, beautiful class.",
    "Absolutely! Portuguese is a very useful language, and this class makes it fun to learn. Be aware that L2 has significantly more grammar than L1. That said, once you finish L2, you will know essentially every Portuguese verb tense and most common grammatical structures."
