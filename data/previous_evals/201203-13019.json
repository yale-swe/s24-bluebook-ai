   "comments": [
    "Literature is exactly what is is. Analysis of text, LOTS of reading, LOTS of writing. If you want to take something out the the course do the readings. If you like having time to analyze each book in depth, maybe DS is not for you.",
    "DS Lit is a lot of reading, and most of them are very dense. Unless you are willing to commit some significant amount of time to it, the only things you'll get out of the books are from the discussions in class, which covers less than 10% of the entire content. The texts are great, though, if you enjoy Homeric and Virgilean epics. Definitely take the class if you wish to learn more about Classical antiquity.Professor Wood is great. He is very low-key so not many students know about him. But don't switch if you have him~",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in Literature. I enjoyed the discussions, and the professor was great! Students should be aware that, since this is a directed studies course, there will be a lot of reading, but the Lit readings are fun!",
    "Directed Studies is a wonderful program as long as you are willing to sacrifice depth for breadth, and this applies especially to the Literature portion of the program. That's not to say that you won't analyze passages in all their richness and complexity, you just won't be able to cover the vast majority of the reading in class. What you do cover, however, you cover well.",
    "I would encourage a friend to take this class. We read amazing works, the lectures are thought-provoking, and section meetings are always lively. However, I would also warn them that the course moves quickly, and that we are often forced to 'move on' prematurely from work to work.",
    "Directed studies literature is a course in which you read works from the Iliad to Dante. I would highly recommend it.",
    "This is very much a crash course in the Western Canon literature. It's awesome! It's a ton of work and lots and lots of reading, but if you don't mind it, it will make you a better person.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to a fellow studentbecause I enjoyed it greatly and also I feel like it has been an incredibly productive experience for me. I have improved a great deal as a writer from Professor Wood's instruction, and I have also noticed myself thinking about literature in a different and more profound way after having taken this course.",
    "Do it! Be ready for the reading. You're going to love the lecture series.",
    "This class is a literature course which covers major works from the Western canon. Whether reading the entirety of a work or select pieces, we dug deep and exploded the language and changes in writing technique that had occurred from one author to the next. I would highly recommend it!",
    "Take it. The texts you spend time with are worth the effort."
