    "THIS IS THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN IN MY LIFE. quizes are pure memorization of insignificant details, the curve is insane, definitely one of my worst experiences at yale",
    "Not recommended. only take if required. do not take this if you are interested in genetics. better off pursuing another interest.",
    "Take it if you must. It's a rough course.",
    "Genetics is an interesting core biology class but it requires a lot of work on your own to get in depth into any of the areas presented in class.",
    "Dellaporta's good (on the MCDB department scale -- \"fine\" on a regular Yale College faculty scale), Roeder's fine (er, \"mediocre\" on the Yale College scale), Garcia-Castro is utterly incomprehensible (I'll leave it up to you to decide what that would be on the Yale College scale). I really liked this year's weekly quizzes + final format, though the final was WAY too easy and some of the quizzes were WAY too hard (or, rather, \"tricky\" may be the better word --the quizzes are out to trick you, more so that most high school tests, even). Genetics is a great subject, but due to the quality of teaching, I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're a biology major. Biology majors, don't fear, though -- you will survive, and it won't be that bad.",
    "This was a great class, but you need to figure out how to study for the quizzes right away. The final is very reasonable, no tricks, but do the practice problems given to you - they help (especially with Dellaporta's material which is the most mathematical). Overall, very interesting and you learn a lot (although, do outside reading for Garcia-Castro's lectures as it is hard to understand what his point are).",
    "A good bio class for pre-med students.",
    "Its a required for the mcdb major and you're just gonna have to get through it. If you don't need to take it, don't.",
    "It was what you would imagine a typical genetics course to be. It was interesting, not that much work, and relatively easy. I personally love genetics, so I really enjoyed the course. I think this was a fun class to take, so I would definitely recommend it. Dellaporta was by far the best lecturer, so definitely go to all his lectures.",
    "If they keep the weekly quiz format, it's a good amount of work, but an interesting class.",
    "Not the best biology class at yale, but still interesting material.",
    "interesting, but more work than I thought",
    "A truly fascinating, interesting, and engaging class for those who are interested in genetics. There is a lot of work but the material is so interesting that the work is manageable. Premeds or people who are not truly interested in genetics may struggle. I recommend taking other bio classes at Yale first, because many of the same trends in teaching arise.",
    "At first, I really enjoyed this class. There are a lot of interesting concepts, but as the class grew on and we passed from instructor to instructor it got both progressively more boring and harder to understand. There is a ton of work. The quizzes require a ton of studying...four hours a week or so...in order to do well. The amount of material for the final was overwhelming. I would not recommend this to those who are not used to science classes at Yale. It is not an easy science class, even though some of it was very interesting.",
    "MCDB 202 covers the many topics related to genetics throughout the semester, so it is a relatively fast-paced course. The format is weekly quizzes with a larger final exam on the last class period. I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students. Besides the fact that it is a requirement for the Biology major, the course it well taught and fair.",
    "Not having taken AP Biology or MCDB 120 before, I was a bit worried this class would be too hard. That was not the case. I thought the material was for the most part very interesting and not too difficult. I really liked the weekly quiz format, which helped me stay caught up with the reading. The third lecturer, professor Garcia-Castro was not a good teacher. His accent was difficult to understand, his lectures rarely went along well with the textbook reading, and his powerpoint slides were very confusing.",
    "Good course for the MCDB major and you learn useful things. It was just a little rocky this semester: the first time with quizzes.",
    "What you get out of this class really depends on how much you like genetics. Lectures vary from really easy\/borderline boring to incredibly confusing depending on who is teaching a given unit... but the textbook explains things nicely. The weekly quiz format was a lot less stressful than taking midterms. Genetics isn't a bad class if you're taking it to fulfill a bio major, but I wouldn't take it for fun.",
    "Overall very enjoyable class! I definitely feel like I learned a lot about genetics, and the weekly quizzes were a great format to learn the information in manageable chunks. Roeder and Dellaporta were fantastic teachers, so don't let Garcia-Castro's bad reviews discourage you from taking what was an overall good course. How well you do seems to be a direct proportion to how much time you put in.",
    "Only take this course if you have to as an MCDB major. If you're a premed who just needs a year of bio, look into something else. I used to be really passionate about being an MCDB major, after this course, I'm not so sure. I've been told that Genetics was something I just have to get through and that the upper-level biology courses at Yale are much better. I certainly hope so. Dr. Roeder's lectures were the most straightforward and her quizzes were relevant. Dr. Dellaporta's quizzes seemed to purposely tried to trick you. Dr. Garcia-Castro's quizzes were simply unfathomable. But overall, weekly quizzes were so draining. I would have preferred midterms hands-down. A cumulative final in a class with three different instructors with three different teaching styles was also an incredible pain. And it came right after Thanksgiving break, so we all felt really unprepared, given that the final was over problem solving while the quiz was multiple-choice so staying on top of the material for quizzes had minimal benefit since we had to go back and learn all the problem solving skills again.",
    "I would say DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. But since it's required for Bio majors, you're out of luck.",
    "This was a terrible class. As a senior MCDB major who had to take this course, I was bored (almost) to tears. It is poorly run in comparison to other classes such as MB&B300, the full year biochemistry class. Other science classes focus on solving problems using the tools of science and genetics.I think this class was bad for several reasons. The professors of this class felt like they HAD to include 10 questions on the weekly 10-point quiz. Because the quiz only lasted 10 minutes, the questions could not be very involved because we wouldn't have had time to finish. So they ended up taking random facts off of slides.As a senior, I know that memorizing useless facts is NOT HOW SCIENCE IS DONE.I would not recommend this class to anyone who doesn't HAVE to take it.",
    "Much, much too much work. You learn a lot only because you're forced to read the textbook to understand the powerpoints. I spent entire weekends reading the book and taking notes to prepare for the Tuesday quizzes. Quizzes can be unfair because some are so hard.Going to class is a waste of a walk up science hill. It is poorly taught and you gain nothing from going to class.Don't take this unless you're a Bio major (or premed), in which case you must.",
    "Genetics was my first biology class at Yale, and from what I hear, that was a mistake. The subject matter should be interesting, but the lectures are not. Do not take this class if you want an easy science credit. Take it if you have to, and try not to let it turn you off of science.",
    "I would not recommend this class. No one wants to take it but it is required for bio majors. Class is disorganized and with three professors their wildly differnt teaching styles are very difficult to get used too.",
    "I think that this course is a good overview of classical genetics, molecular biological techniques and developmental biology, but has lots of overlap with other MCDB courses. The new quiz format is better than the midterm-midterm-final format from last year (when I dropped the course) as spreads the pain of test taking and the chances of you doing well in the class (screw up one mid-term and you're toast; one quiz and you can drop it!).",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need to take for the major. It can be fairly difficult especially with the quiz style grading system.",
    "Bio major - no choice go for it. Not the greatest course, but obviously essential for any serious biology education. Suck it up!",
    "Although I would not recommend this class to another student, if you are MCDB major, you have to take this class. My best advice: you have some suffering to do. Just make sure to read up before the weekly quizzes, even though they drop your lowest one, and for the final spend the majority of your time with Garcia-Castro's material, since you are only responsible for half of his lectures with regard to what you are quizzed on.",
    "Boring and heavy on memorization. Buy the book and teach it to yourself.",
    "Genetics was not enjoyable and I would definitely not recommend it. Do not take it if you do not need it for your major.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who has not had too much biology yet. If you are far along in your science courses, you will not learn much and will be disappointed that the lectures only summarize the readings. The teaching starts good, moves to ok, and then finishes as simply bad. The material is not that difficult and the quizzes are a good way to keep up with the material.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you love Genetics (I thought I did, but really I only liked Punnett squares and pedigrees which was only a third of the course...the molecular stuff was really dry). If you need it for your major, then go for it, but be prepared to keep up with the work with weekly quizzes.",
    "This class was a good basic introduction to genetics... not too difficult but not very interesting either. There are weekly quizzes, but no problem sets to turn in or midterms. If you stay on top of the reading and go to lecture, the material is not hard to understand at all.",
    "I would recommend MCDB202 to other students. It was a good course that was stress-free. I feel that I learned a lot from this class, especially as a premed student.",
    "Uh, if you're a bio major you have to take it. I really, really enjoyed the quiz structure; it forced you to keep up with the information.",
    "Genetics-you probably have to take it anyways, but if you don't I wouldn't recommend it as the bio course you should take. I constantly felt like I was doing work for this class because there was an in-depth quiz every week worth 10% of the final grade. The quizzes were hard and based on trivial details. I over-studied for the final, which turned out to be very easy. If they rework the quizzes it will be a very doable class.",
    "I only took it because I had to for my major, and if they keep with the 3 different professors, I'd suggest you do the same. There are many other classes at Yale that you would enjoy more, and that provide significantly less stress. Good luck, try and figure out how you learn best as soon as possible - meaning if you need section, go to section if not 2 even if they are optional.",
    "Pretty difficult if you have 3 or 4 other classes. If you have time to cram you are fine otherwise it is a rough road. Garcia-Castro was just awful!",
    "Take it because you learn a lot of good material but beware of the different styles of lecturing brought on by each professor.",
    "I took it because I had to.. so you are probably doing the same. The weekly quizzes were great, but the curve was tough to beat because everyone did pretty well every week.",
    "This course is a great way to establish a background in genetics. The weekly quizzes, while scary at first, actually are a great way to learn the material really well. I know far, far more about genetics now than I did before. Having several different teachers is slightly difficult, although each was very clear and good at teaching. If you are interested in majoring in biology, this is a great course.",
    "The class seems more focused on cramming as much information into the lecture period as possible than generating an understanding and appreciation of what genetics is about.Not a lot of required work--a 10-question quiz each week.",
    "The subject matter of this class is extremely interesting if biology is your topic of interest. However, you must keep up on reading in order to maintain the grade.",
    "Genetics is not a particularly exciting class, and lectures are not very engaging. The weekly quizzes force you to keep up on material, which is convenient. Also, there are no midterms, and just a final on the last day of class. If you're really interested in Genetics or a biology major for whom it is a requirement, take it.",
    "Honestly, it's boring. The quizzes are kind of random and require a whole lot of (pointless?) studying. Maybe my least favorite class at Yale.That said, I did learn some genetics.",
    "It was a lot of unnecessary work. Weekly quizzes were NOT helpful in organizing this class-- required problem sets, required section, and some actual teaching would benefit Genetics SOOO MUCH.",
    "No complaints - just a lot of variation between professors' quiz\/testing styles. Would have preferred just having one professor (or 2 max). Take it if you're interested in genetics (but you're probably taking it because you have to). It's not a bad class, I kind of liked it. They vary the structure of the class each year, but this year we had 10 quizzes (1 dropped) and a final.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Otherwise, it's a lot of stress you don't need to add on to your schedule. The weekly quizzes were just torture and some of the lecturers were hard to follow. Because it's weekly quizzes, if you're having a bad week because of other midterms, papers, or an extracurricular picks up for that week,you still have to take the genetics quiz for that week, even if you have a lot less time to study for it. And that brings down your grade a lot.",
    "Genetics is not that bad! While the weekly quizzes are exhausting, you leave the semester really knowing the material. The material presented is actually really interesting as well. However, I'm not sure you'd want to take it, unless you are a EEB or MCDB major.",
    "an okay class, even though the material is great. It could be taught better",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a requirement for MCDB major so that's probably why you're taking it but it's also a good class. It was only necessary to go to lecture and maybe look up the things you're not clear on in the book. Garcia Castro's quizes were a lot harder than the other two sections so study those well.",
    "Interesting material for bio majorsRoeder and Dellaporta good lecturers and fair gradersGarcia-Castro poor lecturer, bad question writer",
    "This class covers a lot of material in a very short amount of time, and most of the material does not tie together very well, so it's quite a bit to handle when studying for the final. However, the quiz format is very nice because you only have to manage two lectures at a time and can keep up with the material. The quizzes are also only 10 multiple choice questions, so they really aren't bad. Professor Dellaporta will not be teaching again, which is too bad because he was the only good professor. Professor Roeder is incredibly boring and mostly reads off of her slides; she is also incredibly detail-oriented in her quizzes so make sure to study the minutiae that seems irrelevant. Professor Garcia-Castro is hard to understand and is not a great professor. Hopefully whoever they get to replace Dellaporta will be better.",
    "A nice bio elective; I definitely found this class to more interesting than I expected. The majority of the lecturers were very competent.",
    "MCDB 202 involves fascinating material that is, unfortunately, presented in a not-so-fascinating way. While I am ultimately happy that I took the course, it could definitely be improved. The course is split between three professors who each cover a third of the material. While ProfessorRoderer is a wonderful lecturer, Professors Dellaporta and Garcia Gastro are only ok. They clearly did not put as much effort into preparing their lectures, which were subsequently much more difficult to follow. In principle, the course\u0092s weekly Tuesday quizzes are a great way to force you to stay on top of the material. Because they consist of ten multiple-choice questions, I felt that they did not always allow me to demonstrate how much I actually knew about the material. I felt that some of the questions were not designed to test my knowledge of central genetic concepts but rather to trick me about minute details. Despite the sometimes poorly written quizzes, the final exam was very fair.",
    "MCDB 202 is a great introductory course to Genetics. There are weekly multiple choice quizzes (focused more on concepts)followed by a final exam (focused more on problem solving), so make sure to keep up with the reading!",
    "It's a great intro bio course",
    "Genetics is very detailed and hard to do well in. Having 10 minute quizzes count for the majority of your grade makes it difficult to succeed if you have a big workload for the beginning of the week (quizzes were on Tuesdays). I would recommend Genetics with caution. You must make sure to study very very hard for the quizzes. If you're not good at multiple choice, this is not a good class to take.",
    "If you need this class for your major and sincerely find genetics interesting, take this class. Otherwise, there are much better taught classes here.",
    "The weekly multiple choice quizzes did not do as great of a job at getting at whether or not you knew the material presented as short answer quizzes would have. Also be aware of Garcia-Castro's lectures as he not not explain things well and his slides are not helpful.",
    "It was a really stressful class that you need to work very hard in to do well. Dellaporta and Garcia-Castro are both really nice and seem to care about the students, but they were unbelievably confusing. Lectures were always frustrating because you couldn't understand anything that was going on. Roeder explained things really clearly and was very organized. The weekly quizzes force you to keep up with studying, but it's hard to retain everything for the final. It's pretty complex stuff, but it's very rewarding when you finally understand the material, just takes a lot of work.",
    "No. If they change the quiz format, maybe. But this semester was a disaster because of the weekly quizzes. I learned nothing and ultimately dropped the course because genetics should not be a course taught with multiple choice!",
    "This class is very broad and there's a surprisingly enormous amount of material covered. You might learn a lot, but it's a lot of work and it's incredibly difficult. The book is strangely written and difficult to understand, and I disliked the constant shifting in teaching styles between the different professors, which made it hard to adjust. The quizzes seem like a fairly good idea to keep you studying, but I still didn't feel like they helped me retain information for the final. I don't really recommend this class, especially not to freshmen, even if they have the scores to get in.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend the class to someone who doesn't have to take it.It's a lot of added stress, unless you find the really nitty gritty topics in genetics fascinating.The quizzes are a little frustrating to study for because problem sets can focus on math and calculations and the quizzes are generally tested on the slides and presentations. Sometimes the quizzes felt more like tests on deciphering questions rather than the scientific information.Pretty fair final given before final's week.",
    "Genetics is a comprehensive overview of Genetics. The book is a good guide to the course. The lecturers seems to change year to year. Roeder is a solid lecturer--definitely the best. Dellaporta is so-so, somewhat engaging as a lecturer but definitely could use more organization. Garcia-Castro just isn't organized at all and delivers his lectures in a very confusing way. There aren't any required sections though there's optional sections four days in the week and looking back on the semester I really should have gone to them. Ultimately you get what you put into the course. It's a beginning biology course so its filled with a bunch of freshmen and sophomores looking to break the curve. I took this course as a senior and highly recommend that people take this course as early as possible to get it out of the way. I can't really recommend this course as its required for the major, but I suppose I would recommend it to non-majors if you are really really interested in genetics.",
    "I really liked the quiz format of the class, which helped me to stay on top of the material rather than just cramming before a couple midterms and the final.",
    "Interesting topic and the lecturers were sufficiently interesting and presented the information in a way that fostered understanding. Three professors teach the course and the switch between their teaching styles, and ESPECIALLY between the types of quizzes they wrote could be very jolting. A short quiz is given every week instead of a single midterm. Sometimes I felt disappointed that the format of the quizzes didn't reflect how much I knew and how much I studied because they were ten very specific multiple choice questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it covers a lot of very interesting material and gives a thorough understanding of Genetics. It definitely got me more interested in the genetics aspects of my research. It is not an easy course and though they are 10 quizzes they are not to be taken lightly as they all add up and require a fair amount of reading and preparation.",
    "Take this class if you need it for your major or absolutely love genetics. The material's pretty straight forward, the teaching isn't so bad, and the weekly quizes shouldn't stress you out too much. It's not a stellar class, and there are definitely better ones within the MCDB major, but it's not painful either.",
    "Take it only if you absolutely have to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but only if they have a very strong interest and background in bio. The material itself is pretty difficult to understand sometimes, but the quizzes and even the final only require a cursory understanding of everything presented in lecture. Also, the ten-quiz format was really helpful because it made you keep up with the material.",
    "Only take this class if you need to and study in advance for this quizzes! They can be kind of tough if you don't study but if you do, they are a piece of cake.",
    "It's a good course and the weekly quizes are not that bad!",
    "Really not as bad as I expected judging from the perceptions I had about the course from last year. Once you get in the rhythm of the weekly quizzes and figure out how to study correctly for them, things run quite smoothly. It takes a bit of time to get used to the transitions of the professors, but all in all, not abad course. Would recommend just for the volume of material that you learn...which is actually quite a lot. Relatively fulfilling.",
    "Most people taking this course probably have to for their major, so you have to take it regardless of what I say. It very clearly summarized the major points of genetics and where genetics will be going in the near future. However, it was interesting, and the topics are very relevant and not too detailed to feel important. Don't dread taking this course; stay on top of the material and really study for the final and you will be fine and learn a lot.",
    "This class is pretty mediocre, but it's getting better. It has a one-quiz-a-week structure which is perfect for this class because there is a LOT of material and it's cumulative. Often, if you zone out in one lecture, you're screwed for the next one so this structure prevents that.Don't take it unless you need to because there are way better classes out there.If you need to take it, work hard and you'll see results.For Dellaporta's lectures, the problem sets don't help with the quiz, but they are almost identical to the final exam's problems.For Roeder's lectures, do the problem sets; they're incredibly helpful and manageable.For Garcia-Castro's lectures, know the material.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it at all especially if they keep the weekly quiz system. Only take it if you have to.",
    "This is a difficult course; I think a separate reflection is required for each of the three teacher: Prof Dellaporta I think actually cares about his students and gives a fair reflection of the quizzes from his material. Professor Roeder is very punctual and perfect-type, and Prof. Garcia Castro is just too difficult and hard to follow.I put in more work than any for this course, and it was still too hard. I went to multiple TA sections, and unfortunately, you can say you learned a lot for the course, but not the right lettered answer for their multiple choice quizzes.",
    "very tough, but very interesting. Get a tutor if you think you need one.",
    "OK class. Weekly quizzes can be challenging, but I think they make the material more manageable, as opposed to midterms.",
    "I would recommend this for sophomores and juniors as well as very well prepared (think about it) freshmen who are or are thinking about being bio\/pre-med; trust me, you'll need the science background. The lectures are straightforward though long and it's sometimes difficult to know what to focus on in the textbook if you spaced out for a bit. Coming from Cell Bio, I liked the weekly quizzes since I felt more prepared for the final. The quiz averages tend to be high so be prepared to fight the curve.",
    "I would not recommend this course. If you're just taking it as a mid-level bio class, take cell bio (which handles the weekly quiz-style of learning much better) or repro or something else instead. The lectures aren't great, and you won't learn much.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have to take it or if you are really interested in biology. You will have to work hard, but you will learn a lot.",
    "The weekly quizzes were a pain. If they don't change the format it is 10 multiple choice questions each week that ask about very specific things as opposed to your understanding of the material. Dellaporta is great, Roeder knows what she is talking about but is kind of boring at times, and Garcia Castro is hard to understand and his quizzes don't make sense",
    "Yes. Do it."
