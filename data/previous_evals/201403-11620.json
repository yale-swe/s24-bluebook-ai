   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the course and the material. The only weakness I can think of is with regards to some of the background knowledge that was needed for some of the concepts, such as chemistry. It has been a while since I've taken a chemistry course and would have liked to learn a bit of the basics before we dove into some of the material, just so I could get the most out of it.",
    "Great instructor, but the course could be organized better so as to allow students to learn the material, as opposed to cramming before exams. Also, the exam\/paper\/presentation assignments are relentless - there needs to be a break.",
    "I really enjoyed this course; assignments were all relevant\/engaging and never felt like busy work.",
    "Very interesting course. Perhaps too much overall material though. For the next group, I would suggest not making papers due immediately after other large tasks (as in, the class period right after a midterm and the day after class presentations), as this became challenging to do both equally well.",
    "Should have more discussions. Sometimes going too fast.",
    "I waived this course.",
    "I thought the material taught was very useful and clinically relevant. Public health implications of the topics covered were made clear. Lecture material was heavy and very detailed, making it difficult to sift through what was most relevant\/conducive to learning a particular concept. I found the course challenging, but don't regret taking it as I think I learned a lot and was interested in the material. Exams were fair but challenging; I think the papers were very challenging and what was expected of us was not always made exactly clear. The difficulty level was a little higher than I think is appropriate for the program, since many (if not most) of us are completely inexperienced with the field of toxicology and associated concepts.",
    "The course was very different from anything I've take previously. I liked the idea of having both tests and papers as components of the grade. Expectations on the paper were very high and it would have been nice to understand the grading mechanism before turning in the first paper not after.",
    "I think toxicology is the most interesting subject I had the opportunity to study this semester at YSPH. I learned so much and have fallen in love with exposure science. The only issues I have with the course are structural ones. It is not productive to lecture at students week after week, slide after slide, and then not have some kind of project to solidify the concepts throughout the semester. Balancing really understanding the concepts and memorizing over 800 slides makes overall learning less efficient. A lot of instructors give guidance on key concepts to focus for exams and that needs to be emphasized in Toxicology. Also 3pm-5pm is the worst time to have such a heavy lecture based course.",
    "Toxicology was a very interesting subject. I feel like I was able to appreciate the lectures and course as a whole more at the end of the semester. Throughout the course, it was difficult to see the \"big picture\" of what we were learning and why we were learning it. However, looking back on all of the lectures, the purposeful trajectory of the course is very clear. It was by far my most difficult course, but it was also one in which I learned the most. It was incredibly effective in expanding my critical thinking skills and teaching me a new way to analyze situations. I really appreciated the clinical relevance of the material. Some of the lectures could probably be omitted or greatly condensed, like the research history of TCE. There was also some discordance between the two professors, such as in the discussion of our papers. It seemed as though there was occasionally negative tension between them over certain issues, and that sometimes resulted in an awkward classroom setting.",
    "Best course this semester. Learn practical knowledge and scientific knowledge are both taught in this class. Interesting teacher and inspiring way of teaching.",
    "A good course about a fascinating subject. I liked that the lectures were self-reinforcing, and covered the same material repeatedly in order to make sure that things were firm. My biggest complaint was that, on exams and for the papers, they often asked general questions and expected specific answers. This left things open to guess and interpretation.",
    "great class. some lectures were directly to the point but others were long and confusing (PAH and TCE)",
    "The course is overwhelming prior to the midterm - there is a lot of information that is difficult to organize and absorb. It was difficult to figure out how the individual lectures fit into the bigger picture until we took the exam. However, I felt as though it all fit together in the end and it was ultimately one of my most rewarding classes.",
    "Strengths: very informative, even for non-EHS students. Weaknesses: too much information to know. It's terribly difficult for one student to understand and memorize that many pathways. Would have been nice to let us know what are the salient topics.",
    "Overall, this course was a good introduction to toxicology, providing a wide range of topics and mechanisms that will be useful for further study and work. However, there were a number of frustrating aspects to this class. The primary frustration was in the forms of assessment through the course. Prior to the first exam, there were only two simple, brief homework assignments. On top of that, although there was much questioning by the students, the actual format and structure of the midterm was not made clear. Although I understand that Dr. Borak did not want to reveal the content of the exams, not establishing any set of expectations was extremely frustrating to me as a student. A similar dynamic was established for the final, although then we at least had the midterm to use as an example. Additionally, a significant portion of the second half of the class seemed unnecessary. The student presentations that dominated the final three classes were an utter waste, since there were no guidelines and it was such an insignificant amount of our grade, little work went into them, and a number of rather subpar presentations were given. This was frustrating to listen to. On top of that, since that information was not going to be tested on, there was little motivation to actually listen and process, aside from casual interest in the field. A restructuring of these presentations would potentially make for a better learning experience.",
    "Very interesting topic, but sort of hard for student with no science background.",
    "The course provides a lot of information to students and emphasizes drawing the links between toxicology and public health. To understand how chemicals in our environment can affect the health of humans, it is essential to understand the concepts that this course taught. I believe that the course's assignments can be better spaced apart and more guidance on what to study for the exams\/what is expected in the papers should be provided. Exams should indicate what number of points are allocated to each question.",
    "Grading is too strict."

    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0I waived this course.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Prof. Fields is also very knowledgeable about the course material. I thought the grading of the first paper was a bit \"nit-picky\" in that we were criticized for our usage of terminology; while I understand that knowing and using the terminology correctly is important, I think that understanding the big concepts is far more important. Many of us are unfamiliar\/completely new to this material so I think the graders could have been a little less harsh.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl and Dr. Borak compliment each other very nicely.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl is very critical of our work. She has a lot of experience in toxicology but seems to have to kind of prove it to the class when she lectures. Her criticism can seem more than constructive sometimes. Besides this, her lectures were my favorites, she gives great pop-culture references for us to remember the concepts with.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0As as Borak, inspiring professor.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0She is clearly interested in helping students, and loves to teach. My biggest suggestion for improvement has to do with her timing. She often ran out of time when speaking, or misjudged how long things would take. In addition, she spoke extremely quickly. English is my native language, and I can't imagine how some of the foreign students must have felt while listening to her. Putting these two ideas together, I think that it would benefit everyone if she sat down and planned out her lectures a little more deliberately so that she doesn't feel rushed, but still has time to cover her topics.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Great instructor, she talk to fast though. would love to take another class with her",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl can come across as condescending and patronizing. I realize that she means well, but there is a more sensitive way to deliver information. Her lectures were interesting and well-delivered. However, she needs to work on her timing because she frequently ran over time.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0 Cheryl was too redundant and it became very frustrating when she would be a little condescending and would assume students would just 'plagiarize' from the Internet. She would go over the homeworks in such detail telling students what each student did wrong when she had already written them on our paper--that time could have been used in a better way. Not to end on a sour note, she is very kind and helpful--really cares a lot about students and their understanding of concepts.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl lectured in a very similar way to Dr. Borak. However, there were a few differences that were quite frustrating. Her slides were very scattered, and had frequent inconsistencies with certain facts, especially concerning the mercury information. When pressed for time, she would frequently start racing through slides, regardless of the informational content. This was frustrating, as it would technically be considered 'covered' information, despite the fact that there was little teaching actually occurring. At a certain point, it would be wiser to simply delay it into a next class if it meant getting more information across.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0I think Cheryl is better at approaching students with different levels and backgrounds. Her lecture is easier for me to understand and follow.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0I think Cheryl can be a little more understanding of students' differing capacities to learn (slow down a bit when lecturing, for example) and more sensitive when returning graded work.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0She is very knowledgeable, and explicit at explanations. And also talks really fast.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Unnecessarily harsh.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak is really knowledgeable. I really really learned a lot in basic bio-chemistry and toxicology knowledge during his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak was a great professor and really kept the lectures interesting. I liked how he used many examples to connect the concepts to the real world, which emphasized the importance of toxicology overall.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is exceptionally knowledgeable about the course material and is a great lecturer. He is responsive to questions from students and is helpful during office hours. I sometimes feel his expectations of us are a little higher than what is appropriate for an intro level course; that being said, it was a challenging class that, in the end, was worth it. I think I really learned a lot.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0strengths- great lecturer",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is very knowledgeable and inspiring. His feedback is meaningful to us and he understands where we are coming form with issues and is open to ideas. His lectures are very detailed and long. It is difficult to focus on this kind of lecture format at this time of day.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak is a fantastic instructor. He is obviously incredibly intelligent, but he is willing and able to explain concepts to students learning the material for the first time. It's obvious that he is genuinely interested in students' success. His patience and approachability was so helpful in my learning.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak is clearly a very knowledgeable man with a host of examples up his sleeve. However, it took me a while to figure out what it was he wanted us to get out of the class. In the end, it was a really beneficial class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Not always the most exciting professor, but he was nice.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was a good lecturer. His slides were well crafted, although there was a tremendous amount of material on them. I enjoyed his plentiful examples throughout the lectures, which helped bring the small individual mechanisms into a real-world focus. Coming back to the same examples multiple times was definitely useful, as well.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Great instructor, but for student with no science background like me, his lecturing is more jargon-y and hard to follow.",

    "Great, but could be organized in a way to give students a break.",
    "Subject matter may be a little intimidating for those without science backgrounds. Not the easiest course, but it was very interesting and never overwhelming...definitely worth the time for those who are even remotely interested in toxicology\/environmental health.",
    "I would summarize this course as very biochemistry and organic chemistry heavy. If another student has a strong background in these sciences, by all means I would recommend it. However if they do not have a background in this area, do not.",
    "Useful The most interesting course I have in this semester",
    "I waived this course.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in toxicology, medicine, chemistry, or environmental health...but be warned, it is not easy. I would recommend taking the course if you are genuinely interested in the material and willing to put time into it, but it is not an 'easy way out' of the environmental health course requirement. Material is very detailed and specific.",
    "I would recommend it for students who have a decent amount of chemistry experience and who are self-motivated. It's also good for pre med students as there is heavy focus on the human body.",
    "Challenging science course. A background in organic or biochemistry would be very helpful for this course. A lot of work at key times, not spread out throughout the semester.",
    "Toxicology covers difficult subject material but is very interesting, particularly if you have an interest in medicine and clinical sciences. A background in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology is VERY helpful.",
    "highly recommend to students who are interesting in consulting because Professor Borak has relative experience. In the class, he would tell how a consulting company work.",
    "An interesting course on toxicology and its applications. It's not an easy course, and you will be frustrated, but it will open your eyes to a different world. Take it - you know you want to.",
    "Toxicology is the study of the potential of a substance, either natural or man-made, to cause harm to humans or other animals. It studies the metabolic mechanisms involved in processing, activating, and ultimately excreting the toxic and toxicants, and their mechanism of injury. It's a great overview, basic principles course that will require a fair amount of memorization, but will leave you with a better understanding of how toxins and toxicants behave.",
    "This is a broad overview of toxicology that gives you the tools to understand and evaluate toxicological studies. It takes a while to see the big picture, but in the end, it was one of my favorite classes. I strongly recommend this class.",
    "May be best to take the other required EHS course if this is a requirement.",
    "This course was, overall, a good introduction to the mechanisms and concepts of toxicology. I would be hesitant to recommend it, however. It would heavily depend on whether or not they had any background in biochemistry. Going into this class without any biochemical background would be very difficult without serious work, as many of the mechanistic explanations required a rudimentary understanding of how different molecules worked.",
    "I recommend the course to any student wishing to understand how various chemicals affect our bodies. Among the courses I took as a first semester EHS student, this was my most difficult course--not necessarily because of the material itself but because of how the course is structured\/organized."
