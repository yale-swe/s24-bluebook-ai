    "Super interesting course! I learned a lot about what is important for a college level paper, and she was always very clear about how to improve my work.",
    "I learned the structure of the essay that Yale mandates that its students write. Honestly, I do not think my writing has improved by a large degree, but I did learn about a few tips to enhance my writing. I also learned a lot about the topic of the course, which is art movements after World War II and how to receive them. I think modern art is pretty cool, so I enjoyed learning about the intellectual justifications behind modern art movements.",
    "academic writing (humanities-oriented); being able to make as much sense of readings(and doing it fast) on topics I'm uncomfortably underexposed to; a general concept of what is going on in art since 1940, with a focus on abstract expressionism and minimalism."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings were assigned without much importance... We didn't go over a lot of them, or didn't use them in our work. But, some of the readings we focused a lot on and those discussions were really interesting.",
    "Strengths: Discussions were very engaging. But most importantly, meeting people in the course was very good. I do not think any of us were English-inclined people at all, we had three international students, three student athletes, et cetera. But I do not think I would have met my great classmates in any other context, so I'm glad this class allowed me to do that. Weaknesses: Watching a 3-hour movie outside of class about a woman doing chores is not exactly the way I want to spend a Thursday night",
    "Strengths: definitely a good balance between content(art) delivery and writing practices; readings are wide-ranging yet in-depth when it comes to minimalism and critiques surrounding it; classroom discussions were guided effectively for best productivity and they generally tend to be clarificatory and inspiring (especially when the reading is difficult) Weakness: probably not very friendly to people who have not touched aesthetics\/modern art before; some readings are very challenging and perhaps some form of summary\/annotation would be very helpful"

    "Yep! This is a super interesting course if you are interested in modern art and need something for a writing credit!",
    "Yes. English 114 allows you to develop as a writer, while learning about a topic that is not necessarily related to literature or poetry, like english classes of high school. Since a lot of people take English 114, it provides an additional thing to talk about in discussing schoolwork or intellectual topics.",
    "Yes, especially if you are somewhat interested in art\/art criticism\/ aesthetic theory but do not yet wish to venture with a hardcore criticism course.",
    "Yes"
