    "It's just your basic math class. I only took it so physics will be easier. But then again, I don't care for math. I don't hate it, but I don't like it. It's just there. A means to an end, the end being something like chemistry or physics.Math 120 was fine. Just your typical math class.Get Rishi Raj as a professor though! He's amazing. I was sad I didn't get Frame at first, but I know I definitely lucked out. Rishi Raj was so dedicated to helping us understand, and as a result our section had the highest average on the midterm!",
    "Math 120 is quite difficult subject matter. The curve this year was not very good on the midterms (50% of my section got 85\/90 points on the first midterm), but our section did the best out of all of the sections, probably due to Professor Raj. He really cares about teaching and about the students, and is always willing to explain a problem. He held review sessions before the midterms, and bought us pizza for one of them. We did go a little slow, but we always were able to catch up (and it was really good for homework since we wouldn't have to do the problem sets as often as the other classes) If you have to take it, take it with Professor Raj.",
    "Math 120 teaches how to evaluate calculus problems of multiple variables. I would recommend it to students who are interested in higher level mathematics or need it for their major.",
    "You have to take this class if you want to be a math, econ, or math and econ major for exampleThe course material isn't very interesting all the time, but anyone planning on continuing math here at Yale should definitely take itThe workload is substantially less than 230If you can choose your section, pick Prof. Raj!",
    "Absolutely, especially for a math major.",
    "A normal math class involving multiple variables, really.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Contents: distance, vectors, addition, dot\/cross product, defining surfaces and lines in 2D\/3D, local and global max\/min for surfaces, arc-length parameterization, line integrals (dot product and scalar product), Green's theorem, surface integrals (dot and scalar), Stoke's theorem, cylindrical coordinates, spherical coordinates, divergence theorem.Take it if you plan on doing any economics\/science\/math\/engineering courses or majors. Also, note that the integration's pretty basic: just know integration by PARTS and by SUBSTITUTION, and you're fine (no series or anything).In short, if you've done differentiation and integration, just take this course. You can handle it.",
    "Mathematics 120 04, potentially taught by the best professor in the course, is a good introductory multivariable math course that should probably be taken by any freshmen interested in pursuing math-related majors. I would highly recommend it in this sense, as it was also a big challenge and a satisfying class to have completed.",
    "Challenging but also interesting. Requires plenty of own-time studying to understand the material.",
    "RISHI RAJ IS THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER.I've taken multivariable before and I still learned so much from his class. His teaching style is great because he gives proofs, geometric\/physical interpretations, etc. for all the concepts, which help a lot when you're trying to visualize\/understand weird formulas. Most importantly, he makes sure you understand. He won't leave anyone behind, although sometimes at the cost of not moving through all the material as quickly as the other professors. But it doesn't matter since he covers the rest in outside-of-class review sessions that pretty much go as long as you want since he is willing to dedicate as much time as it takes for you to get it.Rishi is also unintentionally entertaining. He likes to call functions crazy, nasty, and diabolical. Sometimes he says funny things, makes funny faces, stands in funny positions, etc.But don't get the wrong idea. Rishi isn't a joke when it comes to math. His class averages for all 3 exams were always significantly better than those of the second best class. And your grade is curved to all of the sections.He also did very well in the Putnam.Rishi. dominates.",
    "If you're coming out of BC Calc and want to take a math course, take this. Don't be worried about forgetting stuff that you learned before. You don't need to know anything about series. In fact, all you need to know is u-substitution and integration by parts. If you're decent at math you should have no problem in this class.",
    "Math 120 was a great course. I was originally a little nervous that it would be too difficult and considered taking 115 but I found 120 to be the right choice. If you took BC calculus, you are more than prepared for this class. It is a little difficult but if you put in the effort, it is very rewarding. Concepts learned are interesting, just make sure you get a good TA. If Rishi Raj was teaching this course again, I would highly recommend him. He was amazing and extremely helpful, holding extra review sessions to help our understanding. He was great at explaining concepts and all this was reflected in the extremely high average of his section. But in general, get a good TA and put in the work and you will enjoy this class.",
    "Math 120 is a useful and very interesting course. As the name suggests, it takes all the key operations of single-variable calculus and applies them to functions of two and three variables. It was one of my favorite classes this semester.However, I enjoyed it so much mostly because of the professor. Professor Raj is one of the best professors I have ever had (though to be fair, I am only a freshman). He is extremely understanding of his students' needs, both in terms of his teaching and his expectations of work. He provides physical and geometric interpretations as well as proofs to make the concepts accessible. As long as you put an honest effort into his course, you will earn a good grade. Professor Raj is extremely willing--perhaps even delighted--to see students outside of class. He holds review sessions that usually last for 3-4 hours, and he always stays after class answering students' questions for as long as he needs to. He is an understanding person, a talented mathematician, and above all, a magnificent teacher. It would be a mistake to not at least try to fit his class into your schedule.",
    "Take it if you need it. IF you don't like math... I guess it would be dry.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken an intro multivariable course before. If you have only taken single variable calc, even calc bc, it is very difficult. Doable but difficult. You have to be willing to put a lot of time and effort into the class.",
    "Recommended if you are interested in mathematics and wish to further your knowledge of this field.",
    "I would recommend this course definitely. The material is not very difficult, and, especially if you can take from Prof. Raj, you will have a great time and come out with a very solid understanding of the material.",
    "Multivariable essentially takes the concepts learned in AB and BC calculus and extends them to two and three variables: you'll be working with surfaces and volumes. Pretty much everything in the course can be visualized and has some sort of tangible explanation, so as long as you have a teacher who will make those connections clear, there's nothing that's too difficult to understand.The course starts out fairly simple and gets much harder by the end, although it never becomes unmanageable. I heard that the material of the last three weeks was \"impossible\"--that is not true in the slightest, especially because there are so many other people taking the course. This means that if you're having trouble with a concept, it's easy to find help in peers. Make friends with some people in your section and find people in your college who are taking it so that you can work together on homework and review together for tests. This makes it much simpler and generally speeds things up."
