    "A waste of time, time which could have been used studying literature in a much more productive manner.",
    "Lit 122 is a survey course in drama and poetry, which every Lit major should take. It offers exposure to works from a wide variety of genres and time periods. Lectures are informative and entertaining.",
    "Yes! You should take it! Literature majors complain a lot about having to take it, which is silly. This was a really strong class, and you will learn a lot about how to read poetry and plays closely and thoughtfully. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you are planning to take more literature classes. This class also has a great structure: one lecture and one section a week. I found the lectures interesting and worthwhile. Sections were really fun. We didn't do much close reading in class, but we had great conversations about the works in general. Professor Gabriel is a great section leader. He is very knowledgeable and insightful. He is also a nice person in general. If you take this class, you should go to office hours to talk to him. Although I don't know Professor Devecka as well, I also really enjoyed his lectures, especially on Greek theater.",
    "The only reason anyone should take this class is to fulfill the Lit major's prerequisites. It is boring, pointless, and hardly productive at all.",
    "There is nothing overtly wrong with this class. Both professors' lecture style is slow-paced but generally amusing, a decent range of material is covered, the three papers are very doable, but I wouldn't recommend taking it if you don't need to (i.e. if you're not a Literature major). And maybe because the lecture room was filled with 30 or so lit majors, mostly upperclassmen, it never felt like people were learning anything particularly new or interesting. Do NOT take this if you are looking for a formal poetry\/drama survey\u2014the syllabus is fairly sparse and the course is designed more to teach you how to read and think about poetry and drama.",
    "If you're interested in the Lit major, you have to take this course as a prereq. My suggestion is to come in with an open mind and just be prepared for some boring lectures and sections. A lot of the information will be review, especially on the poetry side, but you can always find things to learn. The course description for this class looks really interesting, but be forewarned that the class doesn't always live up to those expectations.",
    "For students considering \"World Poetry and Performance,\" I have not advice but a request: Please do not, under any circumstances, take your experiences in \"World Poetry and Performance\" into consideration when you are deciding on a major. If you are a Literature Major, then you have to take this class no matter what, and unless you are very interested in film or translation, it's not worth switching to a different track--it is possible, and worth it, to suffer through this one course. If you are interested in the Literature Major, take other Literature classes and use them to decide whether or not this is the field and course of study for you. Once you have decided on the Major, take \"World Poetry and Performance\" only because it is a required course, and do not under any circumstances take it as a representative of the Literature Major, Comparative Literature as a field, or the humanities in general. If, worse yet, you are interested in exploring the humanities despite being a science major, please choose a different course: this course will be confusing, frustrating, and will not give you a good picture of what the humanities can offer. Yale has a wide variety of fascinating courses in literature and the humanities that are far more representative of humanistic fields and of the scholarly talent that Yale has to offer. Don't take this course unless you have to in order to graduate, but also DO NOT take this course in order to find out whether Literature is the major for you, or to see if you are interested in the humanities. And if you do for some reason take this course, DO NOT let it discourage you from the major. \"World Poetry and Performance\" is the exception rather than the rule of pedagogy and instruction in the Literature Major; any senior or junior in the major will tell you as much. And for those who have decided on the Literature Major, all I can say is: buckle up and soldier on. It's just one course, and it is possible, with enough effort, to make it a tolerable--if not educational--experience."
