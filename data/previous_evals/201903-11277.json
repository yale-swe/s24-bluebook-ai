   "comments": [
    "It helped me to develop skills in math proofs and in synthesizing many problem-solving methods.",
    "My skills in mathematical thinking, understanding taught content on a fundamental level, proof-writing, and collaboration have improved a lot this semester. The fact that the course is proof-based forced me to spend a lot more time on striving to understand the inner workings of the math we're learning to an extent that I've never gone to before. In addition, office hours have given me more experience in working with groups of people to tackle difficult problems.",
    "Math. I learned problem solving skills and proof skills, as well as analysis and algebra.",
    "I learned how to write proofs. Even if you have taken a multivariable and linear algebra class beforehand, this class is definitely worth your time. You will learn if you like proofs based math or not from this class.",
    "I have learned more about the foundations of multivariable calculus, as well as being introduced to the field of linear algebra in general. I have also gotten a sense of what proof-based math looks and feels like.",
    "In Math 230, we develop the whole of mathematics from the ground up, starting with defining the real numbers. Over the semester, we build up to sophisticated claims such as the Rank-Nullity theorem and the Banach Fixed Point Theorem. Along the way, I learned the essentials of proof-based math: how to write a proof, how to use various proof techniques (e.g. induction), how to write using formal mathematical language. I also discovered connections between vector calculus and linear algebra (e.g. the derivative as a linear map).",
    "Unsurprisingly, I learned a lot about vector calculus and linear algebra in this course. More importantly, I learned how to properly write mathematical proofs in a clear and concise fashion. Though I personally chose not to, many of my peers developed extensive LaTeX skills throughout the duration of the course.",
    "I had never done proofs before this course and this was definitely an intense introduction to them. The course moves quickly and covers a lot of material that you need to not just remember, but also have to fully understand. It definitely gives you a solid foundation for future proof-based math courses.",
    "I learned basic mathematical analysis as well as some linear algebra.",
    "A good mix of some linear algebra (mostly vector spaces and some matrices) and some analysis (point-set topology, function continuity, limits, differentiation)",
    "Having taken this course, I can say that my skills in mathematical problem solving, methods of proof, and my overall mathematical maturity (i.e. my intrinsic ability to read and understand higher level mathematics - both developing it on my own and understanding the work of others) has greatly sharpened.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of linear algebra and analysis concepts, as well as developing my proof-skills.",
    "The material presented in this course covered a wide range of fields foundational to math. Even though I had taken multivariable calculus and linear algebra before, I learned little bits of topology and interesting number theory facts here and there. While the material is interesting and diverse, I would say that the majority of the course's value comes in developing the sophistication of proofs. Even having taken several semesters of proof-intensive math, the volume of proofs assigned in the class was substantial. I feel my proof writing has developed measurably and that I have gotten much better at organizing mathematical thought on a page.",
    "Critical and abstract thinking",
    "Proof-based mathematics, calculus and analysis (up to and including differentiation), linear algebra",
    "I developed tons of new skills in taking this course, though most of them fall under the ability to thoughtfully and carefully construct precise proofs using major theorems of analysis, and linear algebra. Also learning some topology, set theory, number theory, and did a ton of Putnam problems.",
    "Proofs (translating intuition into rigorous arguments) and the relationships between various fields of Math (Linear Algebra, Matrices, Calculus, Geometry etc.)",
    "I learned more in this class than I learned in every math class I've ever taken, combined. I had studied through Calculus BC when I began Math 230, and the amount of math I have now seen and been exposed to and tried to learn is immense. I learned how to write a proof, how to think about and try to solve very challenging problems, all within the greater reaches of vector calculus and linear algebra.",
    "I learned pretty much everything I know now about writing proofs, as well as a ton of random math stuff that Pat felt like throwing in along the way.",
    "Wow. It's hard to capture everything, but here we go. I learned a LOT about analysis and linear algebra and random other mathy things. I learned that proof is beautiful and fascinating, and that pure math is really interesting. I learned that a lot of productive work can be done between midnight and 7AM in the math lounge on a Thursday night. I learned that having an inspiring, caring professor and excellent TAs made a HUGE difference in how doable and valuable the class was. I felt myself get smarter over the semester, and that was an awesome feeling. My problem solving abilities dramatically improved.",
    "Proof writing and critical thinking",
    "The course taught mainly about proof writing, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra",
    "I learned what the course claims it teaches: vector calculus and linear algebra. I really appreciate the depth of the curriculum, as well as the exposure to a wide variety of subjects including topology, number theory, and many others. All around, I really felt like this course improved my proof-writing skills (which were essentially nonexistent before I took this class).",
    "A good introduction to real analysis, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and, ultimately, proof-based mathematics.",
    "Significantly improved my proof-writing skills, understanding of the intersection of different areas of math, and appreciation for collaboration!",
    "I gained a better understanding of the rudiments of linear algebra. I also learned how to navigate a mathematical academic environment - how to take access of the available resources, how to appropriately collaborate, etc.",
    "Theoretical mathematics and problem solving",
    "I learned a lot about analysis, improved my proof writing skills, gained experience with critical thinking in mathematics, and refreshed my knowledge of simple calculus and linear algebra.",
    "I only took this course for about a month but in that short time I definitely learned how to collaborate effectively on math with others, to ask questions that really got at the root of my confusion, and of course the basics of writing a strong proof.",
    "I learned how to write a cohesive proof, and got a great introduction to a variety of topics in math that were previously unfamiliar to me. I also learned how to build up on previous knowledge, as each proof we did was using only facts we proved previously.",
    "Gained a very strong exposure into rigorous proof-based mathematics.",
    "This course was mostly review since I've seen most of the material before.",
    "I learned how to write formal proofs in math, about the logic needed to write proofs, and many theorems in Calculus and Linear Algebra.",
    "I developed my skills in critical thinking and proofwriting. In addition, I learned Vector Calculus and linear algebra."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course includes many materials in different mathematical areas. It is a big challenge to find the right pace in teaching this ideas. Also the student body includes students who have massive math proving bases and those who is new in that area, so finding a balance in that is really hard.",
    "I think the strengths of the course are how it always emphasizes connections between topics (and similarly how it teaches analysis and linear algebra together, with different lenses of geometry and algebra to enhance understanding). The proof-based and theoretical nature of the course is also a strength. It enhances mathematical reasoning and ability to articulate mathematical ideas, while preparing us thoroughly for more advanced math. I think given how much the exams are worth in our final grade (69 percent), it would help the students to really give them an idea of what to expect, i.e. difficulty relative to psets, or relative to past exams. For example, we were told the first exam would take about 2-3 hours, and after 5 hours at midnight only a handful of people had left. So transparency in grading and assessment could potentially improve the experience. Overall, content-wise, the course couldn't be better.",
    "It's very strong. The lecture are good, the psets are a good structure and size and there's tons of support with office hours basically every day and helpful tas and stuff. Also I learned a lot of math. I can't think of a weakness besides possibly the-hour first exam (technically it was untimed).",
    "The lectures in class were very engaging. The problem sets were interesting and they will always stretch your brain. At times the workload in the class could become overwhelming. Once the PSETs turn to online grading do not expect to get as good of feedback as you were used to in the first semester.",
    "I think the exams were hard to prepare for because they were so different than the psets, which made it easier to not do well on them.",
    "My only critique of this course is that it often took a while to get grades for pets back, which meant, especially at the beginning of the class, that we had to turn in a pset without the chance to see how we had done on the last one. But other than that, the course is well structured, and while the workload is substantial, it wouldn't say it is unreasonable.",
    "The course is perfect for any student who wishes to pursue proof-based math in the future. The class provides an environment designed to hone your logical reasoning. That being said, the homework is extremely burdensome. Each weekly assignment consists of six to eight proofs which take a significant amount of time to figure out. You need to be aware of the progression of the class, as you may only use theorems that we have proven in class or on previous assignments in the current assignment. I could have used more of a warning about the structure of the first midterm. The exam was graded on a curve and there was no time limit, so people where motivated to stay for long hours into the night.",
    "I think the course was incredibly well-taught. Both Pat and all of the TF's\/Peer Tutors had extremely high levels of engagement offering over 20 hours of office hours a well that are very much so appreciated and used. As alumni of the course, the Peer Tutors always had encouraging words and fun stories from their 230 days that made long pset nights a little more bearable. One thing that I think could improve would be the consistency of the course's exams. To prepare, we were given exams from previous years; however, the exams we took were much more difficult. Thus it was difficult to know how to prepare of what to expect especially as the exams themselves varied in difficulty as well.",
    "The class teaches you time management and work ethic. You can't survive in it without developing these two skills. The psets are intense and you'll find it extremely helpful to collaborate with other students and go to office hours. This is also a weakness though. The homework will definitely take away a lot of time from being able to do other activities.",
    "I think the course serves as a good introduction to independent discovery. That said, maybe the instructor should post more pset sols online.",
    "Strengths: Pat is an excellent instructor and really engages the class when teaching. Pat also helped foster a sense of community in the class, which was definitely appreciated. The course becomes manageable after the first few weeks, and the course content builds on itself in an elegant way. Weaknesses: I wish we could get feedback on homework assignments a bit quicker (I found myself waiting for a month or even more on some homework assignments)",
    "Strengths: Pat is the best person on the planet. 80% of why I stayed in the course and came to class was because of Pat. Another strength is that I met really good friends in this class because you are forced to work with other people on the psets. Weakness: I felt like there was not a single pset that I could do 100% on my own, which was a bit demoralizing.",
    "This course doesn't really have any weaknesses, other than that it isn't spread out over a longer period of time.",
    "This course was strong in that all the problem sets and lectures seemed to fit in together perfectly, as almost nothing felt out of sequence given that anything we proved was used later to prove something else.",
    "One of the strengths of this course, in my opinion, was the broad range of material covered. Pat does not stick to a script and seems to cover material as it interests him (while ensuring that ideas flow together naturally). The course feels very organic in this way, and topics creep in that would not be covered in a more traditional class. For people who rely on structure, this strength might come as a weakness: there is no textbook to study from and reviewing material can therefore be difficult. While the lectures were interesting, I got the most out of the problem sets in this course. They were stimulating and engaging and struck a healthy balance of achievable difficulty.",
    "The course pushes you to think abstractly about math and gain a fundamental understanding of the math learned. However, this course does not teach multi and only scratches the surface of teaching linear. Furthermore, problem sets are graded slowly and thus some exams were taken with little to no feedback on our work. Unless you are a math genius, you will need to go to office hours.",
    "This was an extremely engaging course that made me think very hard on mathematics. The office hours are plenty, and I found much help there for the psets. Those would otherwise be complicated to complete. The piazza discussions helped a little. One challenge was figuring out what I did wrong in the psets, because the feedback was not clear and I often needed to find a TA or ask a classmate to work out what was my mistake. This could be improved, as most questions are proof-based so not as clear-cut as recognizing a computation error.",
    "This course is potentially the best class I've ever taken. Pat is absolutely incredible: always there to get lunch with you, or give you a nudge on a difficult proof, or talk about some mind blowing mathematical concept. The problems and exams are always very challenging, but support systems are in place to help you where ever you need help. Because of math 230, I feel like more sure than ever that I want to be a math major.",
    "Math 230 is amazing. Best class I've taken. The lectures are fun and engaging and informative, the lecture space is designed to make it easy to collaborate with other students on warmups and discussions when appropriate; the office hours and TA-led study halls are abundant and build a great community among the students; Pat is so nice and knows so much. Students are helped through the math \/and\/ the psychological aspects of taking such a challenging, demanding course. The problem sets are designed very well to be challenging for everyone, regardless of background or experience, and to make you really wrestle with and come to understand the content. This is a class for first years who think they're good at math and want the biggest challenge they can get, and it does a great job of throwing the problem sets at you and never letting up, satisfying that need for a really challenging class. I can't think of any weaknesses or things that could be improved.",
    "The class isn't that structured, but that's what makes it great. Pat kinda flows through anything and everything that's semi relevant and he finds cool, and we end up learning.",
    "This course is incredibly difficult. That is a huge strength: it forces us to rise to the occasion. At times, I think it's a little unnecessarily difficult (the problem sets could be a tad bit easier without compromising the insane difficulty of the course), but all the support structures (especially office hours with Pat and the TAs) are there for us to do as well as we physically and mentally can. I love how detailed and helpful Pat's notes are for each class, and I appreciate that he posts previous midterms for study material. The problem sets tend to be really interesting, and working on them with others made the class an excellent community for me. I am very grateful that Pat was patient with me as I struggled through this course: it made me a smarter human being and helped me make some friends too. Win-win.",
    "Hard yet engaging psets.",
    "This course gives you a really deep understanding of the math that you are doing and you learn a lot. The course requires quite a bit of work, but you get a lot out of it in return.",
    "Strengths: welcoming community, fascinating content, valuable work Weaknesses: a LOT of hours per week, but this is necessary for the level and rigor of the course",
    "This course was an effective introduction to higher mathematics for students with little to no previous exposure to such thinking. More difficult problems were offered at the end of each problem set for students who had previous exposure to proof-based thinking. I think the course could be improved if those extra problems could be made more thematic with the week, rather than a potpourri of different topics: e.g., in the regular p-set, we prove the Banach fixed point theorem in compact subsets of R^n; as a bonus, prove it in a compact metric space.",
    "This course overall is very good, and I think it's a great way to see if the math major\/minor\/concentraion is right for you. I know some people who found it too time consuming, and a few even dropped the class. But for most, its a great way to learn some math, make new friends in the math community at Yale, and take some fun but scary looking midterms, and the time spent really feels worth it. Professor Pat keeps the classes interesting and energetic, and I love how the course is advanced, yet taught from the ground up. My main issue is that for anyone in a physics class, the only time to take this class is at 9:25 in the morning, since all of the physics schedules conflict with the 11:35-12:25 section of Math 230. I have slept through multiple classes that I wish I didn't miss, and I know others with this problem as well! On a more serious note, I did get the feeling that the curriculum wasn't perfectly planned out, as many of the lesson plans and class policies were still in flux (such as not grading on a curve). This is not that big of a deal, and it is something that is very difficult to avoid in a course that has only recently been established, but it is certainly something that can be improved.",
    "The strengths were definitely its rigor and the level of engagement it inspired in all students. No weaknesses. You just have to be willing to spend time and effort in this class, and to have fun while doing it.",
    "Strengths: this course gave a solid introduction to a variety of topics and showed how seemingly unrelated topics are actually related, and was incredibly interesting. There are also many methods available for receiving help. Weakness: I found this course incredibly difficult, as I have had essentially no previous experience in proof writing or knowledge of any of the topics. It is also very fast paced, and the PSETs required a lot of time. I believe the course could be improved by making the PSETs a bit less time intensive.",
    "Prof. Devlin has an infectious passion for mathematics who clearly dedicates a lot of time to the course. The homework problems were frequently fulfilling and a great source of learning. One oddity was that since the class nominally required no math background, we would spend relatively long amounts of time in class going over stuff that was way simpler than the problems we were wrestling with for homework. It might have been nice to have more class time dedicated to more difficult proof methods and material. The midterms were well-written and interesting in the same way that the homework was, but the first one was far too long. Students were allowed to work on it from 7pm until past midnight. I don't think it is even safe to be letting students walk home that latethe exams should be designed to take a reasonable amount of time.",
    "Strengths included the inclusive environment of the class. Felt very welcoming to many different students from different math backgrounds and experiences. Course is very difficult at times but also is fun at others. One main improvement is that examples given during class are often far easier than expectations for problem sets and exams.",
    "This class teaches the material well for students who have not seen the material before or have not written proofs before. For students with experience in the aforementioned subjects, it is easy. I would like to see a more challenging version of this class for students with more existing knowledge.",
    "The strength of this course is that it teaches advanced concepts in math such as linear algebra and calculus starting from the most basic level with a natural progression: the course builds to advanced concepts from the ground up, starting with basic logic and sets of numbers and working up to multivariable calculus in a way that makes sense and helps heighten understanding, even for students who have already learned calculus and linear algebra in some capacity. The professor, Pat Devlin, alone makes this class worth taking: his enthusiasm and approachable teaching style make it nigh impossible for students to not enjoy his lessons and he makes the class feel very rewarding and also fun even when the work is difficult.",
    "This class is a lot of work, and many people can and do feel overwhelmed by the huge and difficult workload. However, I think that it is also very rewarding in that it teaches you proofwriting and logical thinking better than any other introductory math class at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "I would recomment it as Pat is really a great instructor. More on that in the next response. Also I get to meet other students who have great interest in mathematics.",
    "Yes, if (and only if hehe) you are willing to embrace the challenge and to struggle. It will be hard and time-consuming, and that's why the course is so worth it. Remember MATH120 and MATH225 (or whatever it is) will satisfy the same prereqs for more advanced courses as 230+231. But 230+231 gives a much more solid theoretical foundation for future courses.",
    "Without question. It's a great introduction to rigorous math and it's fun. That being said, with Pat gone next year I suspect the course feel may change quite a bit and so I'm less sure.",
    "At least shop it. The class is an extreme amount of work, so if you don't initially enjoy it that is not going to change later on in the semester. This class will stretch you, but if you can make it to the end it is worth it.",
    "If you do the first pset and do not feel joy, DROP THIS CLASS.",
    "I think this was a great course. It was well structured and built on itself well. I will say that it is not for everyone, because if someone doesn't enjoy proof-based math, they would end up stuck in a course with a lot of work that they would not necessarily enjoy.",
    "I would highly recommend Math 230 to any student who wishes to pursue more proof-based math in the future. It is the perfect environment to develop your proof skills and you will be surrounded by other students who love math. You don't have to be a math major to benefit from the class. Proof-based math is important in any STEM field that requires higher-level math courses. On a more general level, the ability to articulate proofs with full logical rigor in useful in any discipline that requires formulating arguments, including the humanities.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student who truly loves math. It is a big time commitment, but a wonderful learning experience if you enjoy math and creative thinking.",
    "If you want an intense introduction to mathematical proofs then definitely. It's a great class and you'll learn a lot quickly and Pat is great. Just make sure you REALLY do love math. If you only want to learn linear algebra and multi-variable calculus you'd probably be better off with another course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in higher-level math, especially proof-based.",
    "Wholeheartedly, especially if they are interested in math. Pat gave us a wonderful and intuitive introduction to concepts in higher-level math, and this course is an excellent way to gain introductory exposure to college-level math classes and practice in proof writing.",
    "If you want to be a pure math major or are thinking about being a pure math major, this is a good course to take to see if that is really the path you want to go down.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course to another student. This course, unlike most mathematics classes students have taken up to this point, specifically get you to become familiar with and practice the different standard methods of mathematical proof. In doing so, it increases your mathematical maturity and leaves you better equipped to handle upper division math classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but would also say that the amount of work needed for this course is quite large and may require a lot of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend. In particular, I would recommend this course to students who have already been exposed to linear algebra and calculus. Pat doesn't waste a lot of time on examples, and having completed the first semester of this sequence, we have not yet discussed how to take a derivative of anything more difficult than a polynomial.",
    "I would recommend this class only to students who have a strong interest in using abstract thinking to solve a mathematical statement. If you want a good grade in this course, you will have to excel at math.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who is very passionate about math. The work load is incredibly significant (I spent around 20 hours a week doing problem sets), so loving math for its own sake is necessary to having a positive Math 230 experience.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to anybody interested in math and willing to spend a good bit of time studying it. The work for the class was difficult but incredibly rewarding. I noticed a discernible improved in my math skills through this course.",
    "Take it if you really want to understand math",
    "Absolutely! Take Math 230! If you think math is fun, if you might want to major in math, take this class. You will see and learn so much and meet so many other people who know so much, and it's a great time. You'll know even before shopping period is over what the workload is like, and if it seems overwhelming, know that if you enjoy it whatsoever, you will be able to do it. Math 230 is a community that carries everyone through who wants to get through to the end; sometimes that means staying up until dawn in the math lounge with a dozen others who also procrastinated on the problem set, but that's part of the experience, part of the fun. Take this class and soak it all in.",
    "Easily my favorite course this semester, might be my favorite course ever. Pat's a legend, office hours all nighters are fun, you learn a ton of math, just it might not be for you if you don't think math is cool.",
    "I would emphatically recommend this course for a certain type of student. Someone who loves math, proof, and problem solving, who likes doing hard things when there are easier options, who works incredibly hard when confronted with fascinating material, who is not afraid to admit when they don't understand something and ask questionsthat's the student I would recommend this class to. This is the hardest way to get to medical school or whatever non-math major, and it's a wonderful class because of it. The people who choose to take this class and show up at office hours tend to be wonderful, interesting human beings with a lot to share. Don't take this class unless all of this sounds awesome to you.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you are interested in math and enjoy understanding the logic behind important theorems in linear algebra and multivariable calculus then you should definitely consider taking this class. It is also a great class for those who enjoy collaborative learning.",
    "I would generally recommend this course. If the \"math\" you are looking for is working through long problems with multiple integrals or partial derivatives as one would expect from a typical multivariable calculus class, perhaps they should look elsewhere. This course is primarily concerned with proofs, teaching the content of the course simultaneously with proof-writing skills. I entered expecting the first case, but the course took a different direction than I expected. I ended up enjoying this direction a lot, however, and the insights it gave into math I had been doing for a long time. I would encourage students that are interested in math to pursue this course, but to be prepared for its proof-based nature and workload.",
    "Yes! Even if you aren't sure if you want to continue with math, try this course if you want an intellectually engaging experience and a warm, inviting community. Know that to be successful, you should expect to spend many hours a week in the math lounge or office hours, but the support from other students and peer tutors make this time commitment more of a joy than a burden. There's a steep learning curve at the beginning of the course, particularly if you don't have a background in proof writing, but the course is designed for you to learn and grow through the semester.",
    "Definitely. I think this course is an extremely effective introduction to higher mathematics, offering rigorous yet understandable practice with various proof techniques.",
    "Absolutely just know it is intensive.",
    "Yes. It is the only class that I really enjoyed in my first semester, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with any interest\/talent in mathematics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who was looking for a challenge and who was eager to take of the time and effort required to learn and do well in this class. I learned invaluable problem-solving skills and the method of proof-writing is one that is applicable across many different disciplines (essays, scientific papers, etc.).",
    "I would only recommend this course to prospective math majors, other students who are incredibly interested in mathematics, students who have some previous experience with the topics covered, and students who are willing and ready to put a lot of time into this course. It's an awesome course, but you have to be prepared for the challenge and time investment.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in pusuing math in any form at Yale. While the course will take up a lot of time, it is not overwhelming and you will learn a lot.",
    "If you are majoring in math, this course is pretty much mandatory. Otherwise, I would still recommend this class to most students majoring in STEM subject since it teaches you a new way of thinking. Additionally, the support system is excellent so students can get help when they are struggling.",
    "The professor, Pat Devlin, alone makes this class worth taking: his enthusiasm and approachable teaching style make it nigh impossible for students to not enjoy his lessons and he makes the class feel very rewarding and also fun even when the work is difficult. The workload is often challenging but it always feels rewarding and is one of the most enjoyable classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would only if that student was thinking about becoming a math major, for not a lot of things you learn in this class, directly or indirectly, are applicable to things outside of math major. However, if you are thinking about majoring in math and are comfortable with multivariable calculus, then you should at least shop this class."
