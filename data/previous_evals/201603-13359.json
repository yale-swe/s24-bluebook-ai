    "I think it is obvious to students and instructors that the visit to see the Rachel Carson papers could be improved upon. It was an awesome idea for field trip. Definitely, keep doing it! It just needs to be tweaked so students have more time to actually look at the materials. The online component of the class was great. The website worked well and all the files were clearly labelled. It would be nice if the recommended readings also had links to them. People might be more willing to do the recommended readings if they didn't have to hunt around the internet for them. I think the discussion portion of the class was not long enough. I would have liked for the online homework to have been reduced and the in-class discussion time to have been lengthened."

The discussions were far more enlightening. It's generally tough to have ongoing conversations with people online."

Everybody reads such different stuff from the Canvas website. This can make it challenging to focus the conversations on one topic. Finally, Professor Grim and Tucker are the sweetest people in the world. It's worth taking this class just to meet them."
