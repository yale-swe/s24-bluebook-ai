    "great breadth and depth",
    "You can get by doing literally nothing for the entire semester in this course, which is a shame - the material is interesting and could benefit from group discussions\/debates.",
    "The course was well organized and the lectures were clear and well prepared--there was a lot of repetition however and the class could have moved more quickly. There were no assignments until the final to keep you engaged or encourage you to do the reading. Not a difficult or deep class but a good intro into management concepts for those like me who have not had much before.",
    "This course fulfilled a bin requirement for me, and the work was minimal. I had low expectations for the class. Professor Ramsey was excellent. Professor Esty tended to repeat concepts without going over new material, and that was frustrating.",
    "Question 3Except for the final paper due at the end of the semester, and the readings due each class, there were no other assignments in this course. At least a couple of exercises assigned throughout the semester, meant to highlight important concepts and point students in teh right direction, would be helpful.Question 5Prof. Esty spent little time on student questions or comments. He acknowledged them, but he would usually continue with his previous line of thought and move to the next point very quickly. Prof. Ramsey was only slightly better in this regard.",
    "One of the things I liked about the course was that we often had guest lecturers.The experiences from people working in important companies complemented the course and gave us the opportunity to exchange questions and comments."

    "Understanding CSR from GE's perspective. Getting a useful framework for strategy through Green to Gold. Excellent guest speakers.",
    "a good way of thinking to analysis environmental management issue.",
    "Lectures were engaging, outside speakers were interesting. It was a good basic overview of the topic for someone who knows very little about the business world.",
    "It was not a lot of work and the concepts were clearly presented and discussed--a good introduction into principles of green business and management strategy. Both professors are knowledgeable and well prepared for lecture, good at keeping the discussion moving and well directed. Slides are clear and well prepared.",
    "The light workload and the clear framework that Dan Esty follows meant the course was very easy.",
    "The case studies used to illustrate concepts and ideas were very helpful. The two brief visits by practitioners and professionals (Jerry from Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, and the fellow discussing GE's clean up of the Hudson) were refreshing and very instructive. The exercise we were assigned with CitiBank and Rainforest Alliance was fun and useful.",

   "comments": [
    "Maybe have more exercises like the Rainforest Action Network\/Citigroup one",
    "At the start of the course, Professor Esty said that the class would be very discussion oriented - especially for case studies. I am unsure if it was because of the general reticence of class members, but I was disappointed by the level of discussion that the instructors engendered.",
    "NA",
    "Hold us accountable\/make sure we don't run out of time for case study discussions. I really feel like we would learn more if we engaged the readings and had to think critically. We did this with the RAN exercise and I thought it was great.",
    "I wish there had been more assignments and opportunities to apply the information we learned in class.",
    "Engage students more -- perhaps with assignments.",
    "I thought that the time allocated for discussing case studies was very short. Usually it was just the last 20 minutes of class, and more often than not the instructor would talk about the case.There is a lot of emphasis in class about being data driven to back your analysis and thinking. It would have been more helpful if we discussed more about data analysis and how each company tackled the problems they faced based on the numbers at hand.",
    "Perhaps more hands-on case studies, where students pick apart topics. More hands-on training working with companies on specific problems.",
    "field trip or more simulating activities will be great",
    "I was disappointed that the field trip to Stonyfield Farms was cut this year.",
    "The pace was a little slow and there was some repetition of the main concepts in many lectures. If you have a lot of background in economics or business it was a little shallow. An assignment or two to keep people engaged would be good as well. A little more direction on what they are looking for in the final might be helpful as well.",
    "Professory Esty should not cite the same examples over and over again. Having other examples and cases involving smaller-scale companies would have been more useful.",
    "There must be more substantial involvement with the students during class. There were always the few students that constantly spoke, but most of the class could keep very quiet with few repercussions.The course could progress more quicly into complex cases: the first few weeks of the course were overwhelmingly repetitive, with Prof. Esty deliniating almost exactly the readings previously assigned for homework.Towards the middle and end of the course, substantial sections of the syllabus went undiscussed in class due to lack of time.I did not find the material challenging, or the readings burdensome. It would be possible, and probably very beneficial, to limit the lecturing and have instead much more discussion about the readings, their implications, and how they relate to student experiences. The class was listed among three schools, with a variety of students in different fields, with different professional backgrounds... the class should take advantage of its students to complement and enrich the curriculum.",
    "The course could be improved adding more class exercises."
