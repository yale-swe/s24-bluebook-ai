    "Take the PoliSci department's equivalent class, not this one.",
    "Phil 178 is a good course, with a good professor and a very reasonable amount of work. The assignments (especially the final) help you learn the material and feel extremely relevant, and the course and lectures are quite interesting. this is a good alternative to the other intro philosophy course, as it is very analytic and helps you think about the ideas and logic of the texts, not just the historical context and get bogged down in the specific and often extremely complicated nature of the works. This doesn't mean that you don't need to do the readings to understand the lecture well, but the focus is not on every specific word that is used, but rather the underlying logic and structure. Additionally, professor pogge organized optional dinners in the dining halls where he would invite speakers to introduce us to interesting contemporary topics in philosophy, which I appreciated.",
    "Definitely take this. Although it's a bit harder than usual intro courses (the readings are a lot) it's well worth the effort.",
    "This is one of the courses for which I genuinely did not want to miss any section\/lecture. Every lecture gives a new and interesting insight into one philosopher. Even though it's labeled as an \"Intro\" course, with Pogge as a lecturer, you can expect to delve deep into certain topics - if not in the lecture itself, then with follow-up questions that are always discussed extensively. The better you prepare yourself on your own, the more you will get out of the class. Doing all the reading is hardly possible at times, but one should try to keep up to reap the greatest benefits. Pogge is more interested in original ideas and intelligent thought than anything else and goes out of his way to provide opportunities to tie philosophy to current events. He was very approachable for the duration of the semester, which might also be a result of the relatively small class size."
