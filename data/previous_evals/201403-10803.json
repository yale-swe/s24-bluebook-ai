    "This course covers a large portion of the basic statistics that I believe every single person should know. Those not involved in research will undoubtedly come across statistics throughout their lives, and those who will be using statistics, now have a great basic background in it in which they could follow up with additional courses.",
    "Stat 501 is an intense introduction to non calculus-based statistics with emphasis on applications. The second part of the course goes deeper into general linear models and nonparametric statistics.",
    "I would recommend STAT 501 as a first (or even second) course in statistics for a student researcher. It combines sound theoretical explanations with relevant practical examples. There is also an emphasis on experimental design."

   "comments": [
    "Statistics is crucial in almost every discipline. I have already applied some of the knowledge that I gained from this course in my own research.",
    "I took this course as an elective so I enjoyed the course for it's own value.",
    "I had taken introductory statistics before and picked up some methods on the job, but STAT 501 helped me better understand familiar methods and added some new ones to my repertoire. I also appreciate the emphasis on experimental design; good design lays the groundwork for proper analysis."
