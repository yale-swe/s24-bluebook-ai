   "comments": [
    "I like several students in this class didnt come from an EVST or even a science background so it was a very informative course in terms of learning how to write scientifically. The field trips were very instructive too, Professor Decker knows a lot about anything you see and when she didnt, the mixture of specialties in the class always meant someone else had an idea.",
    "In this class, I learned what going into the field was like. What does it take to be a scientist. Going through the experiences was super important. Factually, I don't know how much I retained. The readings I seldom read because I didn't see how they tied into class. Rarely were they mentioned or discussed. I learned how to prepare lab reports and proposals, though my analytical skills didn't change.",
    "I developed skills in field work for coastal environmental issues. Also how to write scientific lab reports and research proposals. I did not learn much about the actual environmental issues, but had a lot of fun nonetheless working in the field.",
    "This class was the first time that I'd ever written a research proposal, so it was interesting to go through that process. I also enjoyed being able to get away from campus for the field trips.",
    "I learned techniques used and topics considered in field research of coastal environments. I became better at writing formal lab reports, and learned the necessary components of a research proposal. I feel that I now have a better picture of the Long Island Sound Ecosystem, much of which has come from spending immersed in it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is the best class I took this semester. You don't realize you are learning because it is so fun, but looking back on the year, I have such a strong understanding of coastal ecosystems. The field trips were all great, especially the fall break trip. The class as whole gets really close because you spend so much time together. It seems like an easy class, but the work really picks up later in the year, so stay ahead of it.",
    "I think it was unclear sometimes what was required for assignments. Alex and MBD didn't seem to necessarily have the same idea on this. Apart from that the class is super fun, very interesting and full of surprises. Definitely go on the Cape Cod trip. You get to apply everything you've learned in class and it's beautiful too.",
    "Experiential learning was the most important learning. I wish the readings were referenced and discussed. I also wish there was more of a way to test that we were learning facts. Going on the field trips was cool, but I often didn't understand what we were doing. Being more explicit about the goals and purposes of each trip would have been helpful. Typing them up in the syllabus or the day before would have prepared. Also tying in the readings to our field trips would also have been helpful. I though our trips were awesome, but I just think checking in to make sure we were actually learning would have made this class. The workload was a bit funky and not equally spread out. I think I would have liked that. I'm also unsure of how the proposals fit into the curriculum. I learned a lot, but mostly because I had to figure something out.",
    "Strengths: hands-on, engaging, like the magic schoolbus going somewhere else every week Weaknesses: not much gained in content or knowledge of coastal environmental issues",
    "This class felt very surface level. While it was really fun to go on the field trips, it was frustrating to try to do fieldwork meant for one person with 15 other students. I also felt that I didn't get very much out of the lectures. That being said, I really liked Professor Decker, and enjoyed meeting with her one-on-one.",
    "This course is a ton of fun. All of the field trips in Friday mornings and the trip to Cape Cod over October break were great. I think it could benefit from an additional lecture time on another day to cover more material. More discussion of the readings would encourage students to do more of them.",
    "Strengths: you get exposure to legit science and scientists. The lab reports in EVST 244 are unlike normal lab reports because you actually investigate a hypothesis that you construct. Normal lab reports are not as interesting. Plus, this is one of the most fun classes I've taken so far. The field trips were incredible--it truly was like being on the Magic School Bus. It made the early mornings worth it. Plus, our class became pretty close by the end of the semester. Weaknesses: the workload isn't evenly distributed. It's long periods of minimal work with a few massive assignments throughout the semester. The last week was pretty tough since we had a final lab report due at the beginning of finals period and our research proposal due after finals were over. Also, students were confused by discrepancies in requirements and grading between the professor and the TF. For example, MBD said it was fine to write a lab report in first person, then Alex would say it was not.",
    "The field trips were really fun, and I feel I did learn quite a bit, but much of this class ended up being dead time. I wish that the in-class lectures and the information provided on field trips had been more rigorous. The lack of rigor and thorough explanation in class made the harshness of the grading on the first lab report, though reasonable in general, seem surprising and a bit unfair in the context of this course."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend, especially if you want a fun science class that is not test based.",
    "I would recommend this. Start assignments EARLY and be disciplined with them. Its easy to think it won't be too hard because the rest of classtime is very discussion based and often outdoors with little written work, so the change of pace throws you off. As long as you keep that in mind, there is nothing better than getting up and wandering in nature while actually learning a lot about it (yes, it's worth the 9am start), and getting a better appreciation of the challenges that a very important set of ecosystems are facing.",
    "I'm not sure. In the current state no, but I think with a bit more attention, clarity in expectations, and continuous rigor, I think the class would have been great. You go on field trips almost every week and learn how to take samples and measure water quality. You also get to go to Cape Cod for fall break. This class needs to shape up a little in order that it be a phenomenal class. Right now, it's a class that's cool but pretty stressful because what we need to know isn't really articulated or hammered home.",
    "If you are looking to have a blast and cap your week off with some time out learning in nature, take this class.",
    "This class is fun as a field trip class, but the course periods can feel really long. Professor Decker is really great, and really easy to talk to, but the course feels almost too casual for learning a lot about coastal environments. However, if you want a fun and interesting friday class that takes you off campus, do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The actual time spent in the course is great. Be forewarned, however, that many of the few assignments take a large amount of time to complete.",
    "I spent the whole semester telling my friends how lit this class was. So yes, I would. It's science made real and fun. I'd say the early mornings were completely worth it (the start time varies among 9 am, 7 am, and 10 am depending on the activity). The only downside is you might have some grading scares.",
    "Field trips were fun and Professor Decker is very nice, but this class was not as rigorous as I would have liked. While we spent a lot of time immersed in the ecosystems on which this class focused, we did not learn much about how they actually functioned, which was disappointing. Once we stepped off the boat or returned from the salt marsh, it was difficult to remain truly engaged in this course, and I would hesitate to recommend it."
