    "Although MB&B 545 was on top of Science Hillfrom 7 to 9 PM on Thursday nights, I never regretted making the long walk or missing YPU debates: the papers we read and discussions we had were some of my most stimulating experiences as a science student at Yale. I would recommend this class without a doubt, particularly as a junior (I think it might be too easy to lose focus senior year). Although I am applying to medical school, this class made me seriously consider getting a PhD instead. If you involved with research at all, you truly need to take this class.",
    "TAKE IT! I learned so much from this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others to take as the added difficulty of 545 over 445 really is nothing special and does nto detract from the course at all.",
    "This course has a great reputation and lives up to it. There's not that much to say: if you've read the syllabus and are considering taking the course, then you are probably a good fit for it. If discussing basic science papers interests you and you like tearing apart experiments and data and figuring out how important discoveries in biology were made, there is no other course at Yale like this one. The opportunity to sit down with two Professors every week and discuss papers is incredible and enlightening. They bring such an incredible amount of experience and knowledge and wisdom to the analysis of scientific papers that you learn to be critical of every conclusion and every result and gain a much better sense of how great science is done. There isn't that much work, and the end-of-term project (designing an experiment) is interesting."
