    "Take the lecture.",
    "Seminar is instructive but very difficult and there's a lot of competition. I did not have any background in econ and it was a little bit too fast paced for me but it ended up working out. It's up to you. If you want something that's less stressful take the lecture.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 to other students if they already have a basic understanding of Econ or are willing to put in a lot of work to learn the topics outside of class.",
    "A good course, not particularly engaging (simply because that's the nature of the material), but interesting information. The dreaded curve isn't actually that bad (though I haven't seen my grade yet...), 33% get A's or A-'s. Probably better to take the seminar than the lecture. The workload is not bad at all.",
    "yes",
    "It is basic economics. If you've never taken microeconomics before, then this course is for you. Even if you aren't an econ major, it gives you a good basic grip of how economics works.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone else because i learned a lot during the course of the semester and I feel like i will be able to tackle future economics classes well as a result of the independence in academics that this class taught me.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Good introduction to economics.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to understand the basics of economics when you've never taken it before, but also if you've taken AP etc. because it still offers a lot of new ways of looking at econ. The course goes very fast, so you'll have enough challenge. Be prepared to work for it and not always get back the work you put into it, but definitely take it, if you prefer personal contact with teacher and more in depth intro compared to the lecture.",
    "I recommend this course only if you want to develop a detailed understanding of microeconomics. The course assigns a good amount of reading and work, and it moves at a fairly fast pace. The math is not very difficult, and this course does satisfy a quantitative reasoning credit. However, if you are not a math person or don't really want to know microeconomics that well, you might as well just take the lecture version of this class, as it assigns much less work and is significantly easier.",
    "It is tough but interesting. I would recommend it to others",
    "Take the course, but take it with Tolga. By far the best option of Simons, Tolga, and the lecture.",
    "Only if interested in a possible major in economics. Also work regularly to stay abreast with all the math and graph related concepts - especially in market structures."
