    "If Kapranov is still teaching it, you'll probably find this to be the easiest math course you've ever taken. Kapranov seemed determined to make it as easy for us as humanly possible. The six problem sets took less than an hour each (sometimes much less); he made the midterm significantly easier when one of the problems on the practice exam seemed to hard for us; and the final was a short take-home final that we had almost 2 weeks to do. Don't be scared away by the steep grading curve (96.1% for an A, 92.1% for an A-, etc)--if you go to class, do the homework, and check the answers (e.g. by plugging the derivatives of your answer into the PDE), it's not too difficult to get 100%. Don't be scared away by the prerequisites either. You really only need basic calculus (Math 115 and the easy parts of 120), not even an ODE course and definitely not linear algebra.You won't really get much practice solving PDEs that you might actually encounter in the real world--everything is already given in terms of a sum of sines and cosines, so you won't need to actually use the Fourier series formula, like in ENAS 194. This course is really about learning the *theory* of PDEs, and understanding them more intuitively, and it does that job really well (without making you do proofs on the homework like most theoretical courses). Some of the connections to science were really cool--the equations explain why the world is the way it is. In that sense, the course is an interesting and non-stressful complement to any science education.",
    "This course is great - you learn everything you need to know, get tested on nothing more.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend MATH 247!!! It is an excellent course for a mathematician, scientist, and probably economist. You will learn techniques to solve a variety of problems, including basic forms of the three fundamental PDEs (hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic). Prof. Kapranov, in particular, focuses on making sure that you completely understand everything that he is teaching. Consequentially, you are expected to solve homework and exam problems near perfectly, but that's not as difficult as itmay seem at the start of the course. Prof. Kapranov is also an amazing lecturer and is quite approachable if you have questions or concerns. So, TAKE IT! :)",
    "Great, low-stress course with little work. Very good if you want to learn more computational math and if you don't want to go crazy and stressed with pointless, cruel problem sets and tests.",
    "MATH247 is a great introduction to partial differential equations. The course isn't all that challenging, but you learn the material really well. Also, Kapranov is really good, if he's still teaching it.",
    "Amazing class. Must take for any math\/econ-math and science majors."
