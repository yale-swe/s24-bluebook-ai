    "It's a good course, just be prepared for a lot of work -- not necessarily hard work, but a lot of it.",
    "Yes; if you have any interest in learning French, take French 110 with Professor Ngame.",
    "a good introductory course! take it with ngame",
    "This is a good class. Ngame is a good teacher.",
    "I would recommend French 110 for anyone who wants to learn a difficult but rewarding language.",
    "Yes, definitely take it with Ngame. he is the chair of L1-L2 french.",
    "French in Action is a wonderful method, and this is a great class. You learn more French than you think you do, and very quickly and naturally. Definitely take it with Matuku Ngame if you can.",
    "If you want to learn a language and are willing to work hard, then this is it.",
    "i would definitely recommend french 110 04 it is a great introduction and the amount of material covered is really amazing.",
    "FREN 110 is a lot of work, but so worth it. Basically you get out of it what you put in. It is manageable and even conquerable if you put in the 3 hrs\/night. Put in the time. And get Ngame! He is excellent. Really pushes you in class, but is extremely kind and supportive. He knows exactly how to prepare you for tests."
