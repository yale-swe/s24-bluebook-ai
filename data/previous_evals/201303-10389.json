    "Yes. It's a good continuation of your Russian studies.",
    "Take it if you're into L5 Russian. It's less work than earlier levels and Constantine is great.",

    "Take it if you are willing to put in the work. Falling behind does NOT feel good. The oral exams are difficult and you should prepare for them well in advance! Really great course, though-- Kostya is amazing."
