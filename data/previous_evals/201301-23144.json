   "comments": [
    "This was one of the best technical lectures I have been in at Yale. If you are even mildly interested in the intersection of biology and mechanics, this class is amazing.",
    "Yes! Take it! So interesting, really not too much work (you need MATLAB though just a heads-up). Fair exams and professor Humphrey is the greatest.",
    "This class addresses a pair of diseases in vascular mechanics, hypertension and aneurysms, from a clinical, theoretical, and experimental point of view. It is extremely well taught, and would be a great elective to take even if you aren't a BME major.",
    "Definitely take this as a follow up to 353 if you are interested in the biomechanics track.",
    "Overall this is an interesting course. It is a very manageable course and has a fair amount of course work. The professor is great! There are only 2 homework problems but they take multiple weeks to complete. There is one paper, a midterm and a final - all of which are very fair and not too difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a great BME elective that is a dilemmas-based approach to vascular problems, focusing on hypertension, aneurysms, and a little on growth and remodeling. Not too much work, and Professor Humphrey is a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student."
