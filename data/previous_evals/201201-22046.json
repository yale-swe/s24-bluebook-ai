    "Extension of Beginning Yoruba, you go a bit more in depth in terms of cultural things and read a bit more.",
    "Spectacular.",
    "Do not hesitate for another second. Take this course! The professor is fantastic and the curriculum is fun and exciting. You will continue to learn about Nigerian\/African culture and this is a very useful supplement to the study of the Yoruba language. If you have taken a Yoruba course before and are debating whether to continue, you know you will regret leaving behind such an incredible community of students and this course offers a rare opportunity to learn this language. If you are considering taking Yoruba for the first time, I would highly recommend this class. The workload is very manageable and the professor will help you to meet your academic goals, whatever they may be. Taking Yoruba is one of the best decisions I made at Yale!",
    "Very similar in structure to the previous classes. If you enjoyed them and learned from them, then take it."
