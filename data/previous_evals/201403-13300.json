   "comments": [
    "No I would not recommend. Class was dry.",
    "I would recommend the course. The assessments are very long and you need to know alot of information but if you go to class you'll be fine.",
    "Take it. If you know the material, it's not terribly difficult to make a good grade. Not going to be a gut, but not brutal either.",
    "Absolutely. This is a solid course that will help you understand the history of the West. Unfortunately it won't dispel you of your romantic notions, since they are likely so ingrained in your subconscious, but you will leave with a more nuanced understanding of Western - and thereby American - history. As for the infamous midterm\/final\/memorizing shindig: you can do it. It's a lot, yes. It's probably excessive, but Faragher gives you everything you need to know a week in advance and you will be able to do it.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend The American West to any student who is interested by the topic and who has enough time to invest in the course. It's image-based, and so is definitely easier for students with good visual memory. That said, don't underestimate the amount of fact-based knowledge you'll need to remember alongside the images.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - the material is very interesting, and it makes you look at American history and America as a country in a very different light. Professor Faragher is awesome, and both TAs seem very competent. The exams cover a lot of material, but Faragher gives a study sheet making it more manageable. The class is not a lot of work otherwise, and if you like history and particularly American\/Native American history you'll really enjoy it.",
    "Professor Faragher is a wonderful professor. There are so many different approaches he could have taken in teaching the history of \"the West,\" but the one he chose was the most comprehensive yet cohesive way I think it could have been taught. The class is very organized, and I was lucky to have a wonderful TA. The work is manageable, the grading is fair, the content is interesting overall great class.",
    "Course looks at the history of the colonization and development of the West and the role of the West in history, beginning with Columbus and going to the modern day. A word of caution to history majors: it is cross-listed with American Studies, so a significant part of the class looks at the \"idea of the West\" or the \"myth of the West.\" Still, as a history major who focuses on American history, I'm glad I took the class it's an important subject to understand and Prof. Faragher was an engaging lecturer. The lectures looked at very specific topics, which are sometimes fascinating and sometimes excessively focused on the making of a few images. All major topics are covered in his textbook, though, and there are some good primary source books. Prof. Faragher is an accomplished historian and has an inventive way of interpreting the past, and while sometimes overly sinister, it was valuable to be exposed to his style.",
    "Definitely an interesting lens into the history of the Americas and the United States. If you're looking for a critical history that focuses on the experience of exploited peoples, this is a great class for you. Not super hard, but be ready to do extensive memorization for the midterm\/final. If you're good with your rote memorization, you should be fine for the tests. You don't really have to do much reading either and you should be able to get by. A good fifth class or pre-civil war AM STUD req.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. This is a great class if you are interested at all in the American West.",
    "I would recommend it to another student but I might recommend doing it credit\/d\/fail.",
    "Yes! This is a must take! The lectures are dynamic! The readings are great. If it is taught again, sign up right away. The icing on the cake is the final research project which can be on the Western Americana collection; its a great opportunity to work in the Beinecke.",
    "I would 100% recommend",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I was expecting a history course that addressed stereotypical themes and topics in \"Western\" American history (e.g. Oregon trail!), but this course was quite different, but in a great way. Professor Faragher's main theme was about how much of our memory of the West is a myth, crafted and modified over time, and that the West is really the history of the frontier -- and his definition of the frontier is part of what makes the course so fascinating. In fact, the first four or so lectures are not even about the \"western United States\" as we think of it today (he talks about pre-Columbian civilizations, Columbus's arrival in the Americas, etc.). While the midterm and final exams require a lot of memorization (images and terms), Professor Faragher provides a study guide for both exams with all potential images and IDs you may need to know, as well as the essay questions that might appear on the exam. Overall, a great course if you're interested in U.S. history.",
    "Take it. Outstanding course and material. Very well designed and always engaging.",
    "You should take this class. It's a class that I feel everyone should take. It's just so interesting.",
    "AMST 141 is a very interesting class -- one of the sort which really changes your views on a subject. We all have some mental notion of what the \"Wild West\" is and what it means -- but this class challenges those notions, replacing half-cocked ideas drawn from cowboy movies with a deep and thorough understanding of the forces which shaped our nation's frontier for over five centuries. It covers quite a wide range of topics, spread over hundreds of years and thousands of miles. It's a whirlwind tour to be sure, though a very interesting one. I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in a good history lecture course, especially if Anya Montiel is available as a TA.",
    "For history majors, this class is a unique theme-oriented history class in which Prof Faragher uses important images to teach students about the myth of the American West. For AMST majors, you will find Faragher's interdisciplinary approach to be familiar and wonderful. The only downside is that this class requires way too much memorization for the midterm especially, so I might recommend starting it Credit\/D if you're unfamiliar with history or AMST. It's a great class though and I'm happy I took it.",
    "The lectures are captivating and moving--you'll find yourself fascinated with the material every time Dr. Faragher begins to talk. The workload is a bit on the heavy side, but manageable (and, most importantly, it's all interesting!). If you're looking for a history course to take, or a first history course to take at Yale (like me), this is a GREAT option.",
    "as a senior AMST major, I found American West to be an interesting history\/culture survey though definitely not my favorite. the punchline of almost every lecture is how crucial the dispossession and mistreatment of native peoples was to our nation's historyI think this was revelatory to many of my classmates, but as a senior AMST major who has all ready taken similar courses I found this to be very repetitive at times. I was really hoping for more analysis and critique on all fronts, but felt that we kept returning to a few broad themes without digging deeper. that being said, it's a fascinating narrative approach to our nations history if you don't know much about it and I have many friends who took this class under different circumstances and consider it to be one of their favorites.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with any interest in American history: how we consider it, how we consider the West, and what this consideration says about us, whether American or not. Whether you're a History major that's made your way through the rest of the History syllabus, or whether you've never taken a History class since high school, this is a good place to turn to for information that's challenging, interesting, and often entertaining."
