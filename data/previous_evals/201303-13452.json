    "Awesome course, would absolutely take it if you like sports",
    "This is a great class, especially if you are a sports lover. A fair amount of reading but almost all of it is really interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely take it. It's not like anything else you'll take in an established department, and is a really refreshing change. Everyone in the class walked out saying that this had been their favorite of the semester.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend taking this class if you have the chance!",
    "History of sports is a really interesting class about the interplay between race, culture, and sports in the United States. WARNING: this is NOT a gut class! There are 100 pages of articles to read every week with weekly quizzes, and a 12 page essay at the end. You will go all the way back to the 1890s, and won't get to modern sports until the last few weeks. So, do NOT take this class if you just like sports and want an easy class; take it if you're ready for an analytical review of the causes and effects of sports in U.S. history. Class can sometimes be dry and only recap what you read (which gets boring in an hour and fifty minute seminar), but I think she will restructure it to make it more engaging next time. Definitely worth a shop!",
    "It's a fun class and not very much work. I would highly recommend it if you like sports and history.",
    "A great class, especially if you're interested in sports. The in-class discussions that we had were great, especially as we moved to more modern-day times. Professor Gleason does a fantastic job assigning readings that are pertinent and interesting.",
    "This is essentially a high school class. It's a lot of fun, because you get to talk about sports a lot (and mostly modern sports, too!), but it's quite numbing intellectually. There are reading quizzes each week. Gleason is a really nice professor, though. She cares about the students a lot, which is really helpful.",
    "Awesome seminar, definitely recommended"
