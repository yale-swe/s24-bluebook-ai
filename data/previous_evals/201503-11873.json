   "comments": [
    "The workload turnaround time is very high; draft, final, draft, final, one every week. But it's an extremely rewarding class; the readings are many but so fun that you won't mind reading them, the writing is fun rather than tedious, etc.",
    "!20 was great. As everyone says, you should definitely take this class before you graduate!",
    "In Engl 120, you learn to read and write the kind of essays you'd want to read for fun, like The New Yorker. The professor can make or break the class though, so definitely check and make sure you get a good professor.",
    "I took this class because I wanted to get my writing up to a college level. The class is less about research and professional writing but instead allows for more creativity and personality. It is not overwhelming, even for a freshman, but has really helped me gain more control over my prose and the structure of my writing. If you're looking for a fun intro writing class that doesn't force you to follow a formula - and includes an outstanding reading list - English 120 is a great pic. Shirkhani makes the class fun and manageable.",
    "It was a useful course that improved my creative and personal essay writing skills, but it is very difficult and time consuming.",
    "TAKE ENGL 120 WITH SHIRKHANI IF YOU CAN",
    "Take it! It's such a wonderful class!! I never enjoyed leaning writing this much! I just wish that I had more time to read the articles and think about them, and I wish I were more confident about speaking up in class.",
    "An extremely rewarding course. The readings are a thrill to read most of the time, and you learn to write as a real writer. You'll be crushed by the workload and reborn as a better writer.",
    "Yes, take ENGL 120. And take it with Prof. Shirkhani if you get the chance.",
    "English 120 is a highly interactive exploration of good writinghow to read it, how to talk about it, and how to produce it. Through exposure to work of accomplished essayists, journalists, and satirists, you learn to read like a writer and to write like one. You will also have a chance to have an essay draft critiqued by your classmates (which is not nearly as frightening as it sounds) and to return the favor for each of them. If you're deciding between this class and another class, go for this one. It will make you a better writer, a better reader, a better editor, a better thinker, and a better human."
