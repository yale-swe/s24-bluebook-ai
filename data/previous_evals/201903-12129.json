   "comments": [
    "I learned how to critically think about writing in film in a very meaningful way. As well, I learned how to write for film, and what pitfalls to avoid",
    "Marc helps you learn how to format a script and create a story in 12 pages. A lot of learning comes from reading scripts and seeing what they did. You also learn a lot about film and classic movies. If you enjoy writing and film, definitely take this course!",
    "I learned the basics of screenwriting. How to format a screenplay and some basic techniques on how to approach a piece. That's about it. I learned how to quietly get through class without getting picked on by the professor.",
    "I learned about screenwriting, especially writing with brevity and without adverbs. The discussion on Psycho (1960) was illuminating and the course made me a better consumer of film in general.",
    "The dos and do nots of screenwriting, learning how to write as a screenwriter, analyzing plot development and tone of scripts, as well as professional industry tips and advice from guest speakers and Marc himself.",
    "I learned how to develop a story for a short (8-12pg) screenplay. I learned how to critique short screenplays and how to format them using a software called FinalCut Pro. I learned how to write for the screen, which is different than writing a novel.",
    "This course provides an introduction to the formal conventions of screenwriting."

   "comments": [
    "The workload was very confusing because it was basically nothing most weeks and then everything one week for the midterm folder. It would be good if it could be made more clear that there is this huge project that comes up sooner than u think so people can get a head start on it. However, the class as a whole was incredibly interesting. I loved the professor and his lessons and stories, and the midterm folder work was actually quite interesting.",
    "Strengths: -Marc is incredibly engaging and makes the 2 hour seminar go incredibly quickly. -you get to read a lot of scripts and select which scripts you want to read. -the class is small and you get to work with lots of people in the seminar Weaknesses: -the midterm folder is a lot at once. Make sure you dont do it all at once and work on it gradually during the first half of the semester.",
    "I really enjoyed Marc as a person, but the course lacked structure and clear ways for us to improve. The midterm folder was nearly 50 pages of writing, and the final was 3-5 pages. This didnt really make sense to me, and I would have rather had the work spaced out so that I could receive better feedback on it as I grew throughout the semester.",
    "Weakness of this course - I did not learn very much about screenwriting. Beyond the basics, I didn't take much away from my time in class. Professor Lapadula spent some classes lecturing about important films, which was certainly interesting but I often left those classes unclear what I had learned with regards to screenwriting. The majority of our classes were spent workshopping pieces. I found this exercise wholly unproductive, as most critiques were centered around simple formatting issues rather than breaking down the content. I spent so much time in this class zoning out because there was nothing interesting to focus on. Strength- The workload was relaxed and easily manageable (save for a midterm folder that turns out to be a lot more work than I expected (that's on me, though)).",
    "The course could be improved by reducing the requirements in the mid-term folder or spacing them out more evenly during the term. The course is excellent in the lecture style, student engagement, feedback and coursework.",
    "Strengths: One of the most passionate and exciting teachers I've had at Yale, fun class structure to learn screenwriting as a first timer, given work that will help you improve a lot if you've never written before. Weaknesses: A pretty subjective subject matter, so it was hard to tell if my work was any good or not.",
    "Strengths: in-class workshops provide tons of feedback for your working screenplay. Professor is very enthusiastic and highly engaged with students. Industry guests are invited 1-2 times during the semester to offer a fresh\/cool perspective. Weaknesses: 2-hr seminar format could be tiring (especially when there wasn't an allotted bathroom break in the middle). Course work culminated in two major deadlines (a midterm folder + final draft of screenplay). I think it would have been helpful to have several, structured smaller assignments before the bigger assignments. I also wished I got more feedback on the midterm folder (e.g. character profiles, premise drafts, etc.).",
    "This course was strong because of its workshop format, which enabled students to be individually heard and to be more committed."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It gave me a more nuanced understanding of film and how to think about it, and gave me very clear feedback on my writing and how to improve upon it",
    "Yes, very engaging and interesting. Not too much work.",
    "Absolutely! I loved creating my characters and story and will definitely be taking intermediate in the spring. This is one of my favourite classes Ive taken at Yale so far.",
    "This was a fun course in spite of it being taught poorly. I had an incredible time reading and writing screenplays, and recommend the content to anyone interested in writing or film. I do, however, believe the class would benefit from major adjustments in how it is taught.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in screenwriting or writing in general and films. Professor Lapadula is a tremendous lecturer and there is great value to be gained from attending each class.",
    "Yes yes yes. If you're even a little bit interested in writing narratives or movies, I seriously recommend taking this course.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a low workload introduction into screenwriting that focuses on story development. If you're looking for an intense writers' workshop, consider other screenwriting courses that the film or English department offer."
