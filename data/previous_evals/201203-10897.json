   "comments": [
    "Really good reading course, most practical if you're studying the field. I would recommend the course to other students, particularly if they're very interested in Britain and its empire.",
    "An overview of the historiography of Britain's Atlantic Empire which teaches one how to read books for orals prep and write an historiographic essay.",
    "Absolutely, without reservation or hesitation. I would definitely warn them that they should expect to work hard and perhaps if they have a semester with a very heavy work load as is, they would need to account for that. However, I would tell the student to lighten the work load elsewhere so they can still study with Professor Pincus.",
    "I would absolutely recommend (and have recommended) this course to fellow students. The demanding nature of the course and the instructor motivated me to work harder each week. As I said above, I don't think I've ever learned so much from a single seminar.",
    "HIS 612 is an introduction to the literature of early modern Britain and its Atlantic context. It covers politics, economy, social and cultural history. It is worth taking even if one is not intent on doing early modern Britain as an orals field.",
    "I would recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "Most importantly, taught me valuable things about how to carefully analyze historiography. That's an incredibly valuable skill.",
    "As my above responses have largely indicated, the course unquestionably deepened my knowledge of the field and enhanced my critical reading skills.",
    "It would be impossible to convey how much this course deepened my knowledge of the discipline and shaped some potential directions for my future research. To put it briefly, I left this course feeling like I could read secondary sources much more critically; pose more significant\/complex historical questions; and posit more sophisticated and historically-informed answers to those questions. I also feel that I have strengthened my conceptual thinking to a significant extent. As a first-semester graduate student at Yale, I feel this course prepared me very well for future work and dissertation research.",
    "As stated above, the course teaches one to approach and engage with texts in a deeper way. This is a skill that, if one takes it to heart, will continue to use and improve throughout their professional life.",
    "I learned a great deal about the British Empire. It was a useful introduction."
