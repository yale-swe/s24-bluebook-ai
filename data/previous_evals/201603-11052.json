    "A knowledge and ability to analyze a time period that I had never studied before",
    "Analyzing pieces of fiction and literature, elements of micro-history, and primary source documents within their larger historical context, and developing arguments from there.",
    "Got to brush up on reading in Spanish! Learned to engage with material written in pre-industrial eras.",
    "I really developed my reading comprehension, presentation, critical thinking, and research skills.",
    "This is the only class directly about Spain that a non-Spanish speaker can take, which made it an amazing opportunity. I learned a ton from Professor Jordan.",
    "Provides a good overview of the Catholic Monarchs and the Early Habsburg rulers in Spain and what was going on during that time period.",
    "I learned a lot about the Golden Age of Spain and how the success Spain achieved in this period impacted the Spain's future as a global actor. Not only did we discuss Spain's financial situation during the period, but we discussed the role of women, religion, rebellions, colonial possessions, and royalty in launching Spain as the leading world power."

   "comments": [
    "The style of having a presentation each week is great! I do think Prof Jordan tried very much to get us all to come out of our shells.",
    "I really enjoyed how interesting the course readings were. I also appreciated how warm, welcoming, and open to help Professor Jordan was. I would have preferred, however, to have more written assignments to ensure that I understood the material better. I also would have liked to spend less time on presentations and more on discussion.",
    "I like that every week we had a new student presenting, I think it broke up what could have become a monotonous course. I really disliked the format of the midterm. I wish we could write a short paper instead about other readings, or possibly had the option between the two: a paper or an exam for the midterm.",
    "The class was a bit quiet so discussions weren't as lively as they could have been.",
    "I think the book list for this course was very diverse, which was nice since we read novels to history books to plays. However, I think the format of the class was not necessarily the best way to foster discussion in a seminar. Each student led the class discussion weekly, which most times ended up being the student talking for most of the class with Professor Jordn adding important material. I wish students would have presented for maybe 15-20 minutes at the beginning of the class and then opened it up to general class discussion about the assigned reading so that the whole class was more engaged. I think the format we had allowed students to zone out and not really do all the reading, so adopting a new format would make students be more invested in the class on a weekly basis."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The workload is very manageable, except sometimes some fairly long readings for the week, but the class is very student-driven, so often we would focus most on what interested us the most. Almost every day there's a long student presentation preceding the class discussion, which is a cool way to get different perspectives on things. Professor Jordn cares more about her students than any other professor I've had at Yale-- she's always up to schedule a time with you to develop your writing, focus your presentation, talk about what interested you in class that day, or just chat about how things are going. She works very hard to make sure that your work is something that genuinely interests you, and that it might spur more research for you in the future.",
    "Absolutely! It's a relaxed seminar with a lot of diverse reading - plays, articles, books, short stories. The final paper can seem intimidating with the primary sources but Prof Jordan really tries to help you. The style of the class - a presentation each week, with discussion during each one - gives everyone a chance to talk and engage. It's a great pre-industrial class!",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course if the material interests you even remotely. Professor Jordan is amazing. She is so willing to meet with students and help them understand the course material and prepare for the final paper. There is not a lot of work and the course readings are very interesting.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Jordan is a joy, understanding, and a huge sweetheart. The course was interesting and she found a ton of unique documents to help students facilitate their education. If you're interested in the topic, you'll have a great time in this course.",
    "If you're interested in the time period take the class, Professor Jordan does an excellent job teaching the course and keeping the class engaged.",
    "I would recommend this course to a person looking to learn more about the Spanish Golden Age and the global impact Spain's empire had on the future of Europe and the New World. Also, I think this is a good first history seminar to take because Professor Jordn really walks you through the readings, the written assignments, and the long research paper at the end of the term.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE Maria is one of the sweetest, if not sweetest, professors I have ever met. She cares for her students and their wellbeings above their grades, and you always feel comfortable talking to her. I have nothing bad to say about this class, and it is one of my favorite courses at Yale"
