   "comments": [
    "strengths: instructor's knowledge and enthusiasm weaknesses: switching to winslow --> diminished ability to and quality of lectures and interaction. i would really like to see a small classroom where we can all see each other (semicircular = better for discussion and engagement). i also think that immunology should be required PRIOR to taking this class--- i had a strong immunobio background but many of my classmates struggled on basic concepts that should not have needed to be reviewed in class.",
    "This was a great course. Strengths would be the instructor (all of them in fact) and the structure, providing us with knowledge on a wide range of topics. The only weakness I could think is the location in Winslow, I wish we met in a room that was more conducive to discussion. Overall I loved this class.",
    "Great instructor - slides could be better organized\/comprehensive, so as to facilitate the making of study guides and learning the material for exams. Homework is ridiculously graded by the TAs - much too harsh. An understanding of the material should be expected, not mind-reading",
    "Great survey of bacterial and viral diseases.",
    "The course is very interesting and you learn a lot over the course of a semester. The organization of lectures was very good throughout the semester. The homework was well spaced. However, the S.pneumoniae lecture was much more unclear than the other lectures. I think it was organization of how we talked about the vaccines and jumping between PPSV23, PCV13, and PCV7. This portion could probably be organized better. It would also be very helpful if each question in the homework had the number of points associated with it.",
    "As an EMD student, of course I enjoyed the topic, but the course was completely different than I thought it would be going in. I expected to learn a lot of facts\/science, but instead we learned a lot about policy and social\/behavioral factors - which was good! I appreciate that now I have a decent knowledge about a range of IDs, but I also have a good idea of the many external factors that influence all of those diseases. Lots of things I didn't know and wasn't aware that I needed to know them.",
    "This is an excellent and engaging course. I like that the material covered is a combination of the biology of infectious diseases, along with the epidemiology\/public health and even ties in social and behavioral factors that should be considered as a public health professional or a clinician. I found the material very clinically relevant and thought this was useful as I am planning to go to medical school post-MPH. Exams challenged us to think critically and although I don't know if I performed well, I do believe that this class changed the way I think and problem-solve. I had never been exposed to parasitology or infectious diseases before this class, and discovered that I really am interested and excited by this field. I would say that this course played a big role in my decision to switch into the EMD department at YSPH! Thank you!",
    "I felt I learned a lot from the class. However, I thought the homework was a bit unreasonably difficult and graded harshly. The homework was our first opportunity to test our knowledge of the subject and learn from our mistakes. That was hard to do while being worried of being penalized for not giving the most fleshed out, detailed and accurate answer possible.",
    "The course was immensely interesting. I believe we lost time on strained discussions rather than getting clear information. Discussion sections or separation of discussion and lecture might improve both the acquisition of the material and the conversations. The commentary on the homework was disheartening. Questions were often ambiguous as to exactly what is required yet points were taken away for missing statements. It felt like the intention was to find places where students made mistakes instead of approval for thoughtful answers. This only stimulated students to try and fill pages with every note and factoid they gained rather than think through the material in a thoughtful and meaningful way.",
    "This was hands downs my favorite course of the semester. I thought the lectures were incredibly thorough and that Dr. Pettigrew presented very well. Sometimes she went through the material a little quickly, but was always willing to review concepts anyone had trouble understanding. The class was also well-organized, with related concepts grouped together. I also liked that we discussed biological mechanisms as well as practical public health and clinical strategies. The few interactive exercises we did were helpful, so I would have liked to have done more of those. I think the course provided a great overview for all of the material we had to cover, and I'm looking forward to the second installment next semester.",
    "Great course, for the content but also the way it is lead.",
    "strengths: lectures and themes that run through the class are all really interesting. prof pettigrew also does a good job at facilitating discussion in the class with problem solving type questions scattered throughout the lecture. weakness: grading on homework assignment wasn't always terribly clear to me. i realized late in the semester that it's probably worth going to office hours to get TA's input on the questions.",
    "This was an amazing course that really taught me how to be critical of research and how to think like an epidemiologist. I loved this class and wish I could take it again.",
    "This course was so helpful in providing a different lens through which to view infectious disease. I was concerned about redundancy between this course and previous microbiology courses, but I am SO grateful that I decided to take this class. I feel that the course helped expand my critical thinking skills not only for situations related to infectious disease but also in general. For example, in a clinical setting this semester, I was able to draw on my skills from this course in order to connect with a patient and understand the patient's situation more fully. I constantly felt challenged to consider different perspectives on current issues of interest in public health. I loved this class!",
    "The subject material was very interesting and the course provided a level of detail sufficient to impart a high level of understanding, while still being able to cover many topics.",
    "Overall, this course was very interesting and informative. I enjoyed the way Dr. Pettigrew made the class have a public health emphasis more than just a class on infectious diseases (ID). I felt she integrated the biology, epidemiology, and public health concerns very well for each ID covered. Strengths included teaching around questions, having a more discussion based lecture experience, having the ability to ask questions during class often, thought provoking homework and exams, and covering a breadth of information. Weaknesses were at times moving too quickly through the slides, at times not laying out a clear road map of where the lectures were going (this was more related to Dr. Child's lectures than Dr. Pettigrew's), and at times, the exam questions felt incongruent with what we learned in lecture (based on how much time we spent on a particular topic). Overall, however, I thought the class was interesting, and I learned a lot. Suggested improvements would simply be to label pictures in a way that students can go back and understand what they are looking at (ex. the epidemic curves - none of them were labelled. Needed that information for the final exam - yikes.) The readings for the class were also useful and informative. Good choices.",
    "I certainly liked this course. Prof. Pettigrew is brilliantly intelligent and has a fantastic personality. One thing that I really disliked were the homework assignments. Some assignments I lost points for small details and for others I guess I wrote more and avoided losing those points but this wasn't always the case. I found the lectures to be a nice combination of basic science and public health. One criticism I have is that Prof. Pettigrew could be more clear in her slides. Some wording and phrases were hard to Understand.",
    "Excellent course. The focus on Epi will ultimately prepare students for the challenges they will face in their careers. Students are given appropriate background information on the biology in order to inform public health interventions. The readings allow students to explore the subject in depth and create a larger framework to put the course teachings into perspective. There is no feedback mechanism in place to encourage students to do the readings. Unfortunately, the course homework is not very helpful. The course homework and reading assignments could be combined in a way that encourages students to do the readings. Also, one's ability to express their ideas is crucial for a public health professional. There should be an actual strong incentive to participate in lecture. A mechanism to tie a student's homework grade to them doing the course readings and participating in class could effectively kill two birds with one stone. The current course readings are very demanding. Any changes in the homework structure should be balanced and not overwhelm students with much more homework as most of their time will be spent reading.",
    "This is by far the more useful course I have ever had. I have never looked forward to going to class as much as I did this one. I can't believe the amount I learned during just one semester. What I loved about this course is that it not only covered material on infectious diseases but it also encouraged critical thinking and taught me how to critically read scientific articles. Exams and homeworks didn't ask us to simply regurgitate the material taught in class but required us to apply it to a more complex scenario. The in-class activities were very relevant and useful. The midterm and final review questions that were provided really helped with the process of studying so much material and helped me understand where I needed help. I loved the course and have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "I feel pretty neutral about the class. I don't feel particularly great or bad. It's not quite what I was expecting as I thought it would be more \"science heavy\". It was challenging in the sense that we were asked often to come up with public health solutions to infectious disease outbreaks, concerns, etc.. It was good because that challenged us but this was my first semester ever taking public health courses so it was difficult at times.",
    "Incredible course. All of the topics covered were very interesting, and taught in a great way.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was required since I am in EMD, but it confirmed for me that this is the department that I should be in since I am definitely the most interested in Infectious diseases! I thought the set-up of the course made a lot of sense, in that we cover basic concepts in the first few classes and then a different infectious disease each class. It is a lot of material that we cover, but you learn a lot. The homework assignments were difficult but in some cases I though it really enforced and required you to apply the concepts we learned in class, such as the polio assignment and the serotype replacement questions. I think one aspect I struggled with is that we often glazed over some of the biological mechanisms of the pathogens, but coming from a biology background I was expecting to learn more of them. We weren't tested on mechanisms so it was not necessary to memorize pathways but sometimes I wished we could've covered them a little more in class in the framework of understanding how the microbes work as a pathogen. There is a lot of reading and I sometimes felt that while the papers were good there were some that were less related to the concepts we were focusing on in class, so I usually preferred to read the papers after the lecture as opposed to before because I had a better idea of what the major points were. The exams were difficult in my opinion even with a lot of studying, because I often felt I knew what we had covered in class but had difficulty applying it or making an appropriate decision (such as designing a study) for the exam. I really enjoyed the class and I feel like I learned a lot. I really enjoyed the class discussions on the public health impacts of diseases.",
    "This was a very good course. I think the course is probably excellent for EMD students. Taking the course as an elective, it was an interesting perspective. Melinda is a wonderful professor. I was impressed by her knowledge and fluid lecturing style. She is ladi back, which is great! I felt discouraged when I received a couple of the homeworks back. A couple assignments were graded harder than what is expected in other YSPH courses, but I thought the course was fair overall. The lectures were interesting. Tests were fair.",
    "I really enjoyed the material and Dr. Pettigrew was very engaging. Sometimes I felt that our homework was graded harshly and there was not a lot of feedback for improving on subsequent assignments. The exams also seemed to deviate from what we learned in lectures also. I did enjoy the critical thinking that the class had us engage in but I wish the homework and exam were more streamlined with each other and the course material.",
    "I learned a lot. I liked the structure of how we learned a new disease each class. d",
    "Really excellent course. I liked how the lectures were organized (both throughout the semester and each lecture itself). There were a few times where I felt slightly intimidated to participate in class, but I liked the few times that we did small group discussions and then conferred with the whole class--I liked how that allowed us to engage with the material and have more back and forth \/ discussion about it. I",
    "I really enjoyed the class. I thought we covered very interesting diseases and we went into an appropriate amount of depth for an intro class.",
    "Weakness : the grading of homework assignments seemed inconsistent at times. Strengths: covers a wide range of diseases and is very interesting",
    "A great course, covers the ins and outs of the most important infectious diseases and makes you think like an epidemiologist. Homework assignments and tests always had interesting and relevant questions, and allowed you to apply the concepts and defend your reasoning. The only drawback is that it can be a little heavy on the biological mechanisms, especially for those without a biology background, but I felt they were all very important to know.",
    "I really loved this class. It helped that our lecturers are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the material. I loved the inclusion of more practical lines of thinking in addition to the purely biological and epidemiological. I only wish we were able to delve more deeply into some of the topics, but of course that's hard to do in an intro class like this one. Another area for improvement is more explicit instructions on homework--sometimes it wasn't clear what exactly the graders were looking for and we kind of had to talk very broadly in order to try to cover all the bases because the question wasn't specific (e.g., the question would be very general but from the grading it was clear they were looking for us to list two advantages and two disadvantages)."

She encourages discussion in class and poses though-provoking questions during lecture that gets us to think and interact. She's also very helpful in office hours There is a lot of material to cover and she does sometimes speak too fast, but is also open to questions and clarification when we ask for it.",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0-Very good explanations, take the time for everyone to understand -Maybe too much discussion with the students sometimes (we have the slides so we already have the answers sometimes)",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0strengths: great slides and lectures, good sense of humor, good at explaining things in response to students' questions; weakness: there's a lot of material in each class (which I'm fine with) but it can make following her pace through dense sections a little difficult.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I loved how she would ask us questions during class to keep us engaged in the topic. Professor Pettigrew's knowledge of the subjects was super evident at all times and though I was slightly intimidated by this, it was also an incredible asset because I knew whatever question I had could be answered. I also liked having Jaime in class with us. He is incredibly smart and motivated as well and it was nice to see them both collaborate and interact with each other in the classroom setting.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She is very knowledgeable but sometimes her pace is sometimes too fast.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was an incredibly effective instructor. She was patient, very approachable, and engaging. She treated us as adults, which was very appreciated and encouraged participation and discussion. She made lectures interesting, relevant, and informative (and incorporated a wide range of perspectives, such as biological, social, and epidemiological views). She was one of my favorite professors this semester.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew knew the information very well; however that might have been the reason why I felt like she needed to slow down when she talked, more enthusiasm in the lectures. She also made it seem like we should know the same amount as she did; sometimes that motivated me to do outside research to understand the topics fully, and sometimes it didn't. I still learned a lot from Dr. Pettigrew. She helped us think in ways that is crucial and relevant to public health, which I think all the other classes should do. The case studies presented were interesting, and the thought exercises in class helped us approach the problem from all angles.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was a very knowledgeable and approachable professor. Very funny, too, mostly. Strengths included having an organized and structured approach to presenting the lectures, clearly integrating the biology\/epidemiology\/public health concerns of each ID covered, creating reasonably interesting in-class discussion assignments, and creating interesting questions for the exams and homework. Weaknesses included sometimes not explaining figures very well (ex. during the microbiome lecture, there was a figure on what flora were more present or absent in obese environments; figure was not very well explained in class, made it difficult to go back and review), sometimes not giving enough information for us to suggest the answer she was looking for in class discussion, and at times, just moving too quickly through the material. Suggestions for improvement would simply be to help orient students to the figures and especially to the tables, and to offer hints occasionally if the class is getting stuck on an in-class question to help keep the discussion moving forward.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Fantastic, brilliant, and funny. Made lecture a pleasure to attend. She does speak a little wuickly and had a tendency to gloss over some important material. But definitely one of The better professors I've had.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Excellent instructor.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Simply put, I want Dr. Pettigrew to teach every class that I take at YSPH. She is the BEST professor I have ever had! I love her teaching style. It's refreshing that she poses questions to us that don't have clear answers and challenges us to consider holes in our reasoning. Not only is she knowledgeable about the material and very capable of transmitting her knowledge, she is also funny and keeps class interesting. The only suggestion I have is for her to slow down a bit when she covers the complex biological systems of the pathogen we are learning about. Overall, great professor, great class.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I definitely enjoyed Dr. Pettigrew's lectures more than Dr. Childs. She spoke loudly and clearly. She also engaged the students and made the topics feel very relevant (real world examples, questions, class exercises, etc..).",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I loved Melinda as an instructor! I sometimes felt that she moved a little too quickly, but she was always willing to take questions or go over something again. She is very engaging and poses questions to the class often which makes the class more interactive. I also found her to be very helpful in going over the study questions for the midterm and the final exam. She is very straight-forward, and very knowledgable on the subject, and I felt like I learned a lot from her teaching style. (Also, this isn't relevant to teaching but I really admire her sense of style.)",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Really good instructor. I think that I am very interested in the biology aspect of the course. Sometimes you would fly through this and I would miss what you said. I know that you were more interested in us knowing the public health side of the diseases, but for me, it helps to the know the biology as well. I would suggest slowing down a bit when you go over the biology and the mechanisms. Your pace was great when you talked about the public health implications, you just sped through the mechanisms. I'm specifically thinking flu mechanism. I also think the exam wasn't very comprehensive. I liked the homeworks, but I studied flu a lot and there were no questions on it.",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great instructor, always easy to follow and interesting to listen to during lectures. Was very helpful when answering questions and giving feedback. Tests are no nonsense and graded fairly.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda is the best. She's very funny and smart and enthusiastic about everything she teaches. I would say the only areas that might possibly need improvement is the fact that she talks pretty fast and sometimes glosses over some of the biology (which is my weak area). Other people might understand what biological mechanisms she is talking about, but I always have to look it up separately to get a better idea of what exactly is going on."

I recommend it to students with an interest in infectious disease, and I would suggest that students make use of their opportunities to ask questions and to meet with Dr. Pettigrew or the TAs outside of class as needed.

    "Every class reviews the basic biologic background of a particular pathogen and then there is a discussion of the public health implications and impacts the pathogen has or had in the past. With this format you basically cannot link and connect the lectures to one another (in my opinion). There is a lot of information that felt like I had to simply memorize (not necessarily learn). I also found it hard to focus at times. Although the course is interesting and Dr. Pettigrew was an engaging teacher, I cannot say that I would recommend this course.",

Even if you do not come from a science background, the focus of the course is on the public health impact of infectious diseases and the factors that play a role in that. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This is a good course! For those thinking about taking it as an elective, I would say a high pass seems harder to come by than other possible electives. the course is worth taking for the benefit of experiencing Melinda's lectures. She is one of the smartest professors I've had at YSPH!",
    "Overall a very interesting class that goes into a lot of depth and teaches you to think about why and how diseases move through populations. It gives you a lot of understanding of dynamics of disease transmission and is a class everyone should take.",
    "Yes-- great course, great instructor.",
    "Excellent overview of some infectious diseases viewed from the lens of public health that incorporates much critical thinking.",
    "This course is very good. It gives an interesting summary of many of the most important diseases. It has a reasonable amount of work and the work increases your understanding of the subject material.",
    "Highly informative and interesting. One of my favorite courses in the semester!!!",
    "A great course. I feel that learning about the topics covered in this class is an essential part of studying public health. Recommend it.",
    "This is an awesome class and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone, whether you are required to take it for EMD or not. Perfect for anyone who wants to get a taste of infectious disease."
