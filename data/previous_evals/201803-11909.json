   "comments": [
    "I learned about the research and development behind clinical trials.",
    "basic statistics, learned about the way the clinical trials work",
    "I learned the fundamental principles of statistics and learned how to critically evaluate RCTs (Randomized Clinical Trials).",
    "I learned basic statistics and how they apply to clinical trials.",
    "I learned a lot about reading medical journals! We mainly talk about different trial types for new\/improved\/maybe-not-so-improved medical treatments and evaluate the robustness of their statistical analysis. You don't really need to know statistics",
    "Learned basic statistics and how to read medical journals and analyze the statistics in it.",
    "The first part of the course provided a strong basis of statistics for me. I learned how to use minitab. The second part of the course we learned about RCTs and I developed my ability read and analyze them.",
    "I learned how to analyze Randomized Clinical trials and other medical literature with a critical statistical lens and learned important methods of statistical manipulation.",
    "did not like this course. lecture was not helpful, and the material was not taught in an interesting way. The topic is amazing, but the way the material was delivered made going to class a burden.",
    "I learned pretty much every important thing in statistics, which was very helpful since I did not take AP Stats in high school. This course exposed me to a variety of statistical techniques used in analyzing data and the principles underlying statistics. When the courses branched into the different specialties, I learned a lot about the different ways in which medical studies are conducted, like randomized clinical trials and implementation science. This course gave me a great amount of knowledge about medical statistical analyses, which will be helpful when reading medical papers because I'll have the statistical insight into their conclusions and how they came to those conclusions.",
    "During the first half of the semester (10X taught by JRS), I learned a good amount of basic statistics. Material was taught clearly and he would often go over material if he saw that the class was confused. Psets were challenging but fair, and TFs' office hours were VERY helpful. Often improved my grade by 10\/15 points after going to office hours, which is pretty great considering that at office hours they didn't give a single answer outright, only explanations. Pretty great TFs overall, and a very good intro to stats class. S&DS 105 is a different beast entirely; Russel-Barbour clearly has zero interest in teaching a class entirely on randomized clinical trials, and you can safely sleep through\/skip every lecture without missing out on much. I say \"safely\" because even if you go to every lecture and take notes religiously, you will be able to answer approximately the same number of questions on the pset as someone who didn't come to any lectures or played Blossom Blast through the entire lecture while noshing on some pretzels (guilty). According to the TFs, RB has gotten much better about not expecting intro stats students to know advanced statistics, but there were a number of times where TFs would just have to give answers to the pset (and ***the final***) because there was no way we could have known them, given what was taught in class. Thankfully, extra credit was simple enough - read some RCT paper and fumble through a 5 minute \"discussion\" in front of the class and you'll get 5\/10 points (the psets are 25 pts). In summary, dumpster fire.",
    "I learnt the basic statistical measures and its applications and also how to read and analyze medical literature.",
    "I learned a lot about statistics as well as its importance and diverse applications in the first half of the class. During the medicine-specific second half, I learned practically nothing.",
    "I learned basic stats calculations and how to use stats software.",
    "I learned the basics I need to know for reading research papers in medicine, especially those regarding Randomized Clinical Trials.",
    "A lot of statistics.",
    "I learned basic stats (assuming similar to AP stats). Binomials, t-tests, probability, Poisson distributions, etc.",
    "First half of the course was great, second half with Barbour was difficult to get through",
    "did not know anything about statistics before",
    "I learned some stats principles",
    "First half I learned the fundamentals of Stats, how to interpret data and various statistical techniques and concepts. The second half (med stats), I sometimes learned various methods of statistical data collection in Medicine, but mostly how to day-dream in lecture.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze statistical data.",
    "I learned about statistics.",
    "I developed knowledge of basic statistics and of the effectiveness of and alternatives to RCT trials. I learned how to interpret RCTS in a clinical and public health setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were the online lectures. There was less pressure and i actually felt as if i learned more through the podcast-like structure as well as the take home midterms and such.",
    "I think that the medical stats half of the course could have been presented in a more interesting way. The professor clearly has a lot of knowledge and has a personality but at times I got really bored because he just read from the lecture slides",
    "The course is very well-taught for how large of a lecture it is, there is much support for learning and all the teaching fellows and JDRS himself are very accessible.",
    "The first part of the course was very well organized and taught in a way that made statistics almost exciting. JDRS has a great energy, and he explains things very well. The second half of the course was not as well organized, and it was difficult to tell what the goal of the course was.",
    "Amazing teaching fellows. Lecture can be dry and the PSETS are impossible.",
    "The course is great for the first half before you split into sections. The medicine section was superbly boring. Professor Barbour just read straight off the slides and it was hard not to fall asleep in the classes. He would go on tangents not related to the material very often. I learned more at office hours than I ever did in class.",
    "The first part of the course was so well organized. The psets were a good length and helped facilitate learning. The second part of the course was very unorganized. A clear syllabus with pset due dates needs to be laid out and expectations need to be made a little clearer. Consistently posted powerpoints and objectives would also help.",
    "JDRS did a good job in teaching the basic principles and information for statistics, and I learned a lot from his portion of the course. He was very engaging in every lecture and was able to explain the concepts, regardless of their level of difficulty, with ease in a way that I, as someone with no stats background, could understand pretty well. When the classes branched out into their specific areas, I was so bored that I just couldn't pay attention in class without dozing off, so I ended up learning the material on my own time when I would go through the slides and work with other people in the class on the assignments. However, the material wasn't too challenging to learn on my own time. The grading in 105 was incredibly strange and strict; the questions never really specified what the graders were looking for in our answers since they were always very vague and broad, but I got a lot of points taken off by not saying some of the niche and specific things that they wanted. I think that they should be clearer in terms of grading guidelines and what they are looking for in our answers. 105 also felt very disorganized in every class, and the material kind of jumped around and sometimes did not flow very well, which definitely contributed to my struggles to pay attention and learn in class.",
    "The second half of the class was quite boring. However, the extra credit assignments helps to boost your grade. Also, you get lots of TA help which makes the class pretty manageable.",
    "JDRS is a great lecturer who makes even the most boring statistics interesting. However, his slides can be confusing at times due to their order and progression. Otherwise, the course was great with the exams and problem sets being very fair and straightforward, although you will likely have to go to a few office hours for help. The second half of the class was the weakness. Professor Barbour's slides are not engaging in any way and his method of reading the bullet paragraphs on the slides is less than conducive for learning or even realizing what is important for the class. It was helpful to read real articles from medical journals, although it would have been impossible to realize what was important or strange about them without help from Sappho.",
    "I feel I have a better understanding of stats, but psets can take a while sometimes because figuring out how to use the software can be difficult at times.",
    "Strengths are that all topics covered in class were engaging and interesting. The application of what we learned was explained immediately after a new concept arose making learning easier. One improvement would be a sort of pre assignment to make a glossary of medical jargon that is unfamiliar to most students in the class.",
    "Strengths: JRS is hilarious, online videos are nice if you can't make it to class, and a lot of weighting is on the homework, so you can do well if you try hard. Weaknesses: Kinda boring, many people don't come\/aren't engaged because it's recorded, grading of homework was slow.",
    "lecture on videos were amazing!",
    "Its great how many office hours are available, it makes it easy to get help if you need it.",
    "Strengths: The first half taught by JDRS (he's awesome) and the staff of TAs that took office hours. The midterms and problem sets were also very fair and you had ample opportunity to do well in the class. A lot of opportunities of extra credit across both halves of the course was nice too. One of the midterms and the final exam was take home - this was awesome. The gaping hole of freedom in my schedule where the first half of the course was as soon as the second part (med stats) made my extremely difficult and intense Junior Fall much easier. Weaknesses: The entire med stats part - it's amazing for your schedule but I didn't feel challenged by the course at all. Prof Barbour is a really nice man and cared about the class, but he doesn't lead a very interesting section at all. All material and information needed for the Med Stats psets and the final were available on Canvas, so I eventually gave up going to lecture.",
    "The strengths of this course are the frequent office hours and the engaging teaching style of Professor Reuning-Scherer.",
    "It was taught really well by JDRS.",
    "This course might be improved if there were more interactive activities in the second half."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you are pre-med or looking to get your masters in public health or anything medicine or research related...take this! it is an intro course then you get to choose a pathway. I really enjoyed this course. The professor is amazing and makes learning very fun.",
    "Yes, its really not that hard and is a useful skill",
    "I would definitely recommend both S&DS 10x and 105 to students, especially those who are interested in learning real-world applications for statistics such as for aiding in your understanding of research papers.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student if they have any previous statistics experience- it will be far too introductory to them. I had never taken statistics before at all, and I still found the content to be very easy. If you are looking for an easier QR, this is a good option, and JDRS keeps things really interesting.",
    "Second half with Barbour is very gutty but has rather interesting readings (that aren't very long) if you are interested public health research.",
    "Yes.If you are interested in medical school. AND ONLY if you are interested in medical school",
    "Stats 10x was super well organized and a great intro class. I would not recommend the stats medicine section because it was boring and unorganized.",
    "I would take a different section",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Intro Stats. Probably not S&DS 105 (The medicine version) unless you really really wanna learn more about reading and interpreting the data in med journals and learning more about clinical trials. Overall, it's a good class and its worth knowing some stats.",
    "Yes the first half of this class with JDRS is great; however, if you are looking to not learn anything the second half of the class then the medicine section would be perfect.",
    "Yes, it's a good way to get a grasp on basic stats principles without stress.",
    "Yes, if you love medicine, need a statistics class, or are thinking about pursuing research in the future, this class is for you.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot about statistics.",
    "Good for an easy stats class. Personally, I wish I'd taken a more intense class where I learned more that I could actually apply to more scenarios in the future.",
    "Only the first half, I would recommend staying with JDRS by taking 102 or 103",
    "honestly everyone should know stats but I would not",
    "If you need to take an intro stat course, this is a very straightforward class to take. Its very accessible if youve never taken stats before.",
    "If you need to take it.",
    "Absolutely. If you need to take some type of STAT course for your major, this is perfect. As a Neuro major, I took this over PSYC 200, and I do not regret it at all. It's easy to do well if you put any kind of effort into the first half of the course (GO TO OFFICE HOURS - this is key to getting 100 on almost all psets) and just look at the lecture notes of the med stats part (you don't even have to go to lecture!).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student as this course teaches how to critically analyze data.",
    "Absolutely. Great introductory course",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially to any student leaning toward a career in public health or medicine. The information provided is extremely valuable and statistics will prove useful for conducting research in the future."
