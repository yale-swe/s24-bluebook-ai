    "I loved this class SO much. It was so relevant, and went WAY back to the beginning of history. There are a ton of readings, but you don't have to read them in absurd detail. One midterm and one final that are both relatively straightforward, but you will def put in your work when you study for them.",
    "This is a broad survey of Middle Eastern History from the time of Muhammad (6th Century) to present. Strengths include excellent lectures from one of Yale's best professors, and an introduction to many of the key figures and events of this critical region's history. Weaknesses include -- students ability to focus at 9am in the morning. You will do MUCH better in the course if you attend all the lectures. Exams are important and cannot be blown off. Reading is hugely beneficial, but many people do not do it.",
    "100%. IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, YOU ARE TRULY MISSING OUT ON A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. There are a number of Middle East-centric classes at Yale but I can't imagine a single one is more comprehensive, enjoyable, or fair.This is the best class I took this semester, maybe all of Yale. You learn so much, which is fitting because there is so much to learn! You go from Muhammad to the Arab Spring (obviously not covering everything, but covering a whole damn lot). An incredibly comprehensive overview. It's so refreshing to leave after an hour and fifteen minutes and actually feel like you acquired new information! Plus Benjamin Foster is a storyteller. It felt like I was being told a 75 minute story about an incredibly important and nuanced region.The class couldn't be any fairer in terms of assignments, either. You get to choose if you want to take a writing credit, if you want to write a term paper, or attend an optional lecture section. What kind of amazingness is that?Studying for the midterm and final were fun because I knew the questions would be straightforward and open enough that I wouldn't have to worry about being tricked. It was straightforward, but not \"easy\" if you haven't studied a lot. That's how it should be: you study a TON, learn a LOT of new information, and have a clear-cut exam that is clear-cut once you've studied.Recommended WHOLEHEARTEDLY.",
    "The content of the class is really good. I am very glad to have learned all that I did in this class.",
    "Waking up for the 9am class was definitely worth it to study under Professor Foster! He is one of those teachers who students instinctively like, and want to learn with. The material is pretty in-depth considering that it's a survey class, and you will come out of the semester with a greater understanding for what (1) has gone on and (2) is currently going on in the region.",
    "If you want to learn a comprehensive history of the Middle East, then this is a great class. I took it so I could better understand current event and would say it was successful. The readings are really long, but definitely do the ones from the books (the course pack is super expensive). Professor Foster knows what he is talking about and if you are really interested in the topic of this class it's not difficult to stay engaged. If you're taking this class just because it will be hard to get much out of it.",
    "This was a broad survey course of the history of the Middle East, and it did an excellent job of giving me an introductory understanding of the region. I found Professor Foster's lectures quite compelling and enjoyed the reading he assigned. The optional Friday lecture classes were also a wonderful way to learn for the sake of learning, without the pressure of a test. The class with the Friday lecture option had a pretty excellent learning to work ratio - only a midterm and a final, but I felt like my grasp on Middle East history, politics,& culture was substantially improved by the end of the course.",
    "Definitely. You will learn so much about the Middle East from Muhammad until the present. The first half of the class is Muhammad until WWI and then the second half is from post WWI until the present. I learned more from this class than I did from courses in the history department. Professor Foster is perhaps my favorite lecturer I have had at Yale- he is incredibly knowledgable and is pretty funny too. The class is so flexible- you can take the midterm, term paper (10-12 pages, Foster marks up a first draft for you), final, or you can attend 9:25 Friday optional lectures to not write the paper. You can also do the writing section, which is three papers, midterm, final, but I think that is probably more work than normal WR classes. Foster is very understanding, and is a very fair grader. He really is great and you should definitely shop the class to see his style. It is certainly worth getting up at 9 am twice a week to learn this material from him.",
    "Yes - great overview of an important subject. And very minimal work with fair exams, and no required section.",
    "This class is good if you want an overview of the Middle East but also could use some improvement. Professor Foster is very knowledgeable but does not post his notes online, so if you miss one of his 9am lectures, there's no way to get the material. Also, the midterm and final are based very heavily on rote memorization. He gives you 200 terms and expects you to look up and memorized the dates and definitions but only tests you on ten of them. Also, he takes off a lot of points if you don't say the exact definition he's looking for even though he does not provide you with the definitions. On a weekly basis, there's no too much work and the reading is pretty good. You really will learn a lot, but go into it knowing it'll be a lot of memorization.",
    "Take Intro to Middle East if you know nothing about the Middle East and news headlines confuse you. I get the sense that if you're already familiar with global affairs and the state of events in the region, the information from this class won't be news to you. That being said, this course covers the Middle East from like 500 AD to 2010 so it's an opportunity to learn more about earlier time periods and the transformation of the Middle East too, through a lens that is more objective and less inflammatory than most American media.It's a survey course in the truest sense of the word, that sometimes seems pretty fast paced, especially as you blow through the early history of the region. If you are looking for a course that will glorify the West and teach you \"what's wrong\" with the Middle East, this isn't for you. If you want to understand a region and people whose history have been closely interrelated with the Western World, and consider their perspectives, take this course.The ONLY reason I would tell an interested student NOT to take the course, would be if they just absolutely hate assigned reading, as each lecture is accompanied by around 100 pages or more of text.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Definitely go to every lecture and go to the 10 optional sections so that you only have to take the midterm and the final. Professor Foster was a good lecturer and the midterm and final were very fair as long as you go to lecture and studied for a day or two before.",
    "Good intro to the region though there is a lot of material covered in a short amount of time. Dont go into detail about any specific region or time period.",
    "This course covers the history of the Middle East (and parts of the Near East) from Muhammad to the present--which is a ton of material. Prof Foster is a brilliant lecturer who is passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the material. It is helpful to do a large amount of the reading and absolutely necessary to go to the lectures. Prof Foster does a great job of covering each topic with enough depth to give his students a good understanding of it and balancing different perspectives on highly contentious issues. After every lecture I left amazed by how much material I learned in just one lecture. He is SO SO SO SO organized and as long as you are careful to read the syllabus and course packets very closely you should be good. You need to study a lot for the tests-which are fair but just cover a lot of material. However, this course gives you a clear understanding of a region that has become very important in the present.",
    "definitely take it if you want to learn more about the history of the middle east up until world war II. seriously learned a ton and lectures were interesting.",
    "It is a good introduction to a complex region of the world. Its not a must know, but if you are interested in the region this will be a useful course to start with.",
    "A good overview. Recommend."
