    "How to analyze fossils.",
    "I learned a lot about paleontology.. how to identify things you see in rocks etc.",
    "This laboratory course provided the unique opportunity of learning about Earth's history throughout geologic time by looking at the exact fossil specimens that paleontologists have used to create this historical timeline. It is amazing to be able to understand the processes of fossilization and evolution through observation of the actual specimens.",
    "I gained the knowledge of identifying different types of fossils and an expanded terminology when referencing fossils and different animal clades.",
    "This class is absolutely CRUCIAL if you want to get anything out of History of Life. The lab made all the concepts real and tangible, and allowed me to get a lot more time with the professors and TAs. Having those extra 3 hours per week to talk through the content with the teachers is the only thing that allowed me to learn in History of Life."

   "comments": [
    "The labs were very difficult for those of us with no previous background in the subject, but did improve over the course of the semester.",
    "This course is very much one that throws you in and expects you to learn to swim. This is a fine way of learning but I think it would be useful to have presentations on what we're learning before lab (like the trace fossils lab) rather than just giving you fossils and expecting you to identify them with no background as to how. This is especially important because we were often reliant on the TA's for answers to the questions, and if they told us the wrong answer we would get lots of points off. Grading is a bit stressful because we would work in groups putting down all the same information and then get different grades, which was stressful because I felt like I had no control over my grades but not too stressful since none of the grades were horrible. Overall it is a relatively fun lab that I would recommend taking, but I think it could also be improved. I also think that lab final was very stressful and since it is a half-credit class, a lab final during reading week or paper or project might be less stressful.",
    "Weekly 3 hour labs were designed to allow the student great freedom and exploration of the fossil collection laid out for that current period of geologic time. Students were asked to take observational notes, sketch specimens, and answer leading questions on how these fossils show evolutionary or mineralogical processes that we learned in class. In the beginning, it was very easy to write large paragraphs on specimens and not have enough time to finish all of them, requiring work on the lab sheets outside of class, but as the lab progressed I began to understand how much information is necessary to answer each lab question.",
    "The class is a really cool way to experience hands on what identifying fossils is like. I found some of the structure of the course frustrating in that in labs answers would never seem too apparent unless we were being guided through them but even then it was still speculation. This was frustrating when we got marked points off for putting things down that the TA's told us was right. overall a very cool hands on learning space.",
    "The lab is so difficult at first because you just get thrown in (it feels) without any guidelines. It was very hard to hang on the first few labs, but the TA's are helpful in talking you through the questions. Without a background in STEM classes or labs, the HoL lab was difficult for me, but I did definitely learn observation skills and seeing the fossils is just absolutely crucial for any type of learning to occur in History of Life. The course could be improved if the professors all made worksheets like Celli did, which gave us lots of background information about the topics we were dealing with in the labs. The more information we can get, the better!"

   "comments": [
    "No work outside of the three hour lab each week, which is great. The labs themselves are pretty hard if you have no prior knowledge, and the grading can be arbitrary at times. I'd often answer questions with the help of the *fantastic* TFs, and still be marked off. That really annoyed me because I did everything in my power to do things right, but would still get 8\/10 or 7\/10 on lab grades. The three hour labs were super stressful at times when we had no idea what we were doing (every single lab) and had to finish the report before we ran out of time. I took this for EVST and assume it was infinitely better than taking chem lab or something of that nature.",
    "Yes! It's like a long guided tour of the Peabody. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course, mostly because it is a good supplement to the lecture. I definitely understood things better and had a more cohesive vision of what was going on than I would have if I was not taking the lab. But it was stressful because of grading and it was a long time each week (3 hrs)",
    "This lab was a great supplement to the lecture course, and made the subjects we were learning in class much more meaningful when we could interact with the fossilized specimens in a hands-on manner, while also studying the processes more in depth and in a directed approach I would not have been able to do alone outside of class.",
    "I would only recommend this to someone in HoL, who really wants to get something out of that class. The lab is the only reason why I succeeded in HoL and it made me actually care about paleontology, where I wouldn't have otherwise. TAKE THE LAB."
