    "A fast paced course in multi variable calculus.",
    "don't take it if you don't have to, but if you do, it's not a bad course to take",
    "A moderately-paced introduction to multivariate calculus - note that the subject demands more ingenuity than single-variable calculus; it is difficult merely to apply formulas or techniques by rote. Han does a fine job of making sure you understand the theoretical foundations of multivariate calculus, and provides a solid foundation for that ingenuity that is a staple of higher-level math.",
    "It was a fairly challenging course, but if you can easily understand mathematical concepts and have a good understanding of calculus to begin with, you'll be fine.",
    "Mathematics 120 is a great course for learning multivariable calculus at the level of understanding how to solve problems and applying the basic concepts of calculus.",
    "If you have to take its it's not the worst.",
    "tough math class\u00e2\u0080\u0094potentially a weeder class that separates strong math students from rest. be ready to keep up with high pace",
    "Math 120 is a course on multivariable calculus, and the midterms and final are weighted a lot. The curve is pretty hard for this class, so unless you absolutely love multivariable calculus or need to take this then you probably shouldn't since it might harm your GPA.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, but I would urge the student to consider \"why are you taking this?\" I took it simply because it was the \"next\" calc class, and I'm not sure this was wise, because it seemed a bit irrelevant to what I want to do.It is very conceptually challenging, but not as mechanically challenging as 115. Therefor, it is for some and not for others."
