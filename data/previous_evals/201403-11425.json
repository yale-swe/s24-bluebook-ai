But at the same time, we went into so many aspects of climate change in depth, it seems like an appropriate course for people who already had some background as well. This can be a depressing topic to delve into and seems to have a lot of the most experienced people down, including Rob and Deepti. To counteract that dynamic, but not in a fake way, it would be good to include mini lectures from time to time on what makes the instructors hopeful about the situation... and maybe have the students contribute to this conversation as well."

    "It is a good introductory survey course in what has become a very big and complex subject",
    "Interesting material. I appreciated the amount of time spent on adaptation, resilience and vulnerability.",
    "it is a very broad course and covered very diverse aspects of climate change. The course gave the students a general idea of all perspectives that could be considered and discussed in terms of climate change. The professor also offered a huge variety of sources for further research.",
    "I enjoyed the reading materials, the lectures, and the class discussions.",
    "The policy memo and the final paper are really good ways to make students bring together what they've learned in the course and apply it to a potential real-world situation of their interest. I enjoyed writing my memo and the follow-up final paper, which I based on my policy memo.",
    "Great overview. Hard to cover everything in a topic like this, but I think the course did a good job at exposing students to different sides of the problems and potential solutions. Also nearly impossible to meet every students expectations for the course, because some people will want more international negotiations, others will want more theory, and others will want more examinations of sector based national solutions. Overall though I thought the balance was good. I would definitely recommend keeping the adaptation memo, because it makes folks with more of a mitigation mindset think about the other side of the problem.",
    "Assignments, including weekly reading responses, were very good in getting me to sit down and think about the readings and course material in a deeper way.",
    "Some of the readings were very interesting, and I liked when there was a back and forth discussion between the class and Prof. Bailis, instead of Prof. Bailis just going through his slides\/lecture.",
    "The breadth of the course was great for people who are new to the field. I also enjoyed writing the papers because I was able to delve into a subject I found interesting.",
    "Twofold: 1) Professor Bailis works to keep the course current, weaving recent news, studies, and events into his lectures. 2) the format of the course - lecture first and discussion activity second - really works.",
    "I loved to get really up-to-date information on both climate science and the UNFCCC negotiations. The graphics on the slides were superb. I also enjoyed the freedom to pick my own topic for the term paper. For someone who is already familiar with climate change policy and science, this was still a great course to take!",

   "comments": [
    "A group midterm project or final could complement the course well, given the cooperative nature\/challenge of climate change negotiations. The discussions help fulfill this, but a larger project in which students could work together in-depth may be an interesting future option.",
    "- Course focused far too heavily on climate change adaptation and far too little on mitigation and policy. - Course was poorly advertised as it did not significantly address climate issues like policy. - Lectures were counterproductively long. - Some papers seemed quite outdated.",
    "If there was more attention given to the perceptions of climate change, how the media portrays and shares information, and more instruction about how to help educate the general public about the importance of these issues. Also, it would have been interesting to have more controversial ideas discussed and possibly some prescription for ideas.",
    "The last hour of each three hour class was a student let discussion. These were largely unfocused, and did not lead to in depth discussions or learning. The student discussion leaders each week were allowed to pick any discussion topic they wanted, with very little guidance, and were allowed to formulate the teaching exercise any way they wanted. The inexperience of students in creating a good learning experience showed.",
    "I wish we had gone deeper into a lot of the material, rather than simply reviewing the readings. It would have been interesting to do some case studies in class and to discuss the nuances and practicalities of climate change in more detail. I would have liked to have heard some of Professor Bailis' own experiences working internationally.",
    "Rob should focus more on the basics concepts before any other advancement in content. He also should speak slowly and louder. The classroom was very dark and cold, which sometimes affected the learning. The instructor is very knowledgeable and have a notable domain of all topics approached in class. However, as an international student, it was hard to follow the class because speaks very fast and not loud enough to listen. The explanation were also very fast and the load of contents per class were too much.",
    "None, I thought the course was excellent.",
    "Lectures are too long.",
    "People came from a lot of cool backgrounds and had a range of unique perspectives on climate change. Could have been cool to go around and hear from folks in the beginning of the class to get a sense of those backgrounds.",
    "The student led discussions need help. The professor should have intervened to make them more engaging. The professor's lectures were non engaging either. This course had a lot of potential, considering all of the current climate change headlines; however, I did not leave this course feeling like I had a firm grasp in current affairs. The lectures could be improved by searing clear of heady charts and graphs... a few are fine, but the basic concepts and underlining conclusions should be emphasized. I felt very lost and never engaged in this class.",
    "To be honest, I was disappointed with the class overall. I'm interested in a career in climate policy and was most excited about taking this course, but somehow it fell flat for me. For example, during the lecture portion of the class, I did not feel as challenged as I could've been and I do not think there was enough emphasis on exchanges between Prof. Bailis and the students. Prof. Bailis would complete his lecture in about 2 hrs with the final hour used as a discussion\/simulation\/break into groups led by students each week. I would've wanted Rob to challenge the class to think critically about these difficult issues, and to bring in examples from his experiences in the field. Instead, the lecture felt more like a summary of information (which I found to be very interesting) but it was surface-level, and as a class we didn't go much \"deeper.\" The portion of class for student discussion was likely intended to do so, but after a few weeks the class discussion\/activity was pretty similar and felt repetitive. One recommendation would be to hold this class twice a week, to break up the amount of lecture time.",
    "The weekly responses take so much time. For some of the discussions, the amount of reading is daunting. Either requiring less reading or fewer responses would be helpful.",
    "I think Professor Bailis excels most in conversation, making the large-class lecture format tricky for maximum effect. Not sure how to fix this, though.",
    "Rob is very open to discussing subjects with students, but may still be perfecting his lecture style. is lectures tend to be very one-sided with little to no student participation. Rather than the half lecture, half student led discussions (which often felt like a waste of time), I would prefer to have him lecture at a slower pace, stopping to discuss items of interest as the arise. Also Bowers auditorium is a terrible classroom space and is very un-conducive to interaction and discussion.",
    "The group discussions felt somewhat repetitive every week. I would have liked if they were a bit more structured or if they drew more on the readings from the week to actually learn the material.",
    "What I mentioned above... somehow inspiring hope."

Given that Rob will be leaving at the end of the academic year, I sincerely hope that FES staff and the administration are working hard to offer future courses in climate change policy. A few students and I met with Dean Crane to discuss this earlier in the semester and it sounds like there is potential to bring in an outside practitioner to teach a course, if all of the logistics align. As the top graduate school for environmental studies, I was surprised that there is not a greater commitment and resources dedicated to preparing students to the growing and important field of climate change policy and mitigation in the U.S.",

The more involved you are in this course and the more involved you get in the discussion sessions, the greater the value this course will have.",
    "In my opinion, every student at F&ES should take this course.",
    "This class will not be offered again, so N\/A. I hope that this gap is filled by another professor.",
    "Take it if you have time to read all the texts and are interested in working with climate change after school.",
    "I would advise them to read the supplemental materials as well, as all of the readings are quite relevant, cutting-edge resources.",
    "Very good class for if you want to go into policy! You should take it!",
    "Think carefully about whether the professor's teaching style fits with your learning preferences.",
    "Wish they could take it with Bailis.",
    "As far as I know, this course will not be offered next year. I hope something similar to it is offered to incoming students and I would recommend students take a climate policy course with a writing component.",
    "If you're interested, take it now, because it won't be offered for much longer!",
    "Focus on the assigned readings",
    "Take the course... it's a great overview of the topic. If it's just one long afternoon lecture per week, bring caffeine or some other way to help stay engaged."
