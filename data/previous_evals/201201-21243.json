   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of statistics will be KEY in doing well in the class. Carson isn't the best at teaching statistical concepts, which are a major part of the class. I would only recommend this to definite BME majors - the problem sets are very, very long and pretty difficult, but the material is useful for BME applications.",
    "It's really difficult if you haven't taken statistics or linear algebra. If you have to take it for a requirement brace yourself and don't take it as a freshman like I did.",
    "Don't take this unless you are a BME major and have to - it is a lot of statistical knowledge and MATLAB that is unnecessary and not exactly very fun unless you are required to take it.",
    "This is a challenging course. If you keep up with the material, however, the class becomes more manageable. Professor Carson is great and really enthusiastic, but the class is demanding, especially during the second half.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in biomedical engineering. It's a lot of work most of the time. It's really important to understand concepts in class. Professor Carson is a great, but he is an unusually busy person. It's hard to get a hold of him.",
    "This covers A LOT of material. Matlab is really useful, especially once you see how much it can do, but expect to go pretty in depth into statistics and get less instruction on how to actually use Matlab (a lot will be self-taught).",
    "It's a fast-paced course and you will put a lot of time into the homework. I would encourage anyone taking it to make friends with your classmates, as the homework assignments are much more manageable when done as a team. If you're taking it, it's probably required, but nonetheless, it's an interesting course and you feel like you learned a lot at the end of the semester.",
    "Too much material in too little time. While the material does have a lot of application, I felt like I never really fully understood it. The prereqs say you only need Math 120 and no programming experience, but I honestly would not have understood what was going on if I wasn't taking diffeq\/physics at the same time and had previous programming experience.This is not primarily a programming course. Its mostly a computations\/statistics course with some matlab involved.",
    "This course is kind of a hodgepodge of many many different topics ranging from basic probability to numerical methods for solving differential equations, with applications in MATLAB. I enjoyed learning MATLAB, but the course moved pretty quickly trying to cover many topics, so coming out of the class I'm not entirely sure what I actually learned. I think it's worth it, though, if the topic interests you. You get some good biomedical engineering applications.",
    "Intro to Biomedical Computation is a useful class for any BME major, and I would definitely recommend it. MATLAB is very powerful software when used correctly, so learning it early on is definitely a good idea. The course covers a lot of (useful) material fairly rapidly, and it's not based on one particular textbook, so going to the lectures is definitely important. The problem sets could be pretty lengthy at times, so make sure to start them early.",
    "I really enjoyed the way that this class opened my eyes to the field of the statistical analysis of biological processes and the powerful ways in which matlab can aid this analysis. The course moves at a very fast pace and I wish that I had some background in statistics and matlab before taking it.",
    "You learn a lot about biomedical engineering in this class, but it can be hard for those who are not very proficient in math.",
    "Well it's a required course for BME's, but DON'T take this course if you just want to learn matlab. If you have taken a basic stats course beforehand, that would give you a major advantage, as he introduces a lot of statistics courses. Assignments were long and tedious - so definitely go to the office hours and help sessions. Exams are intentionally difficult - at least the curve is good. Students generally all do quite well on the problem sets though, so study up for the midterm, which is definitely a time rush.",
    "It's an ok class. Doable for the major and not too much work except for the 7 problem sets. Work together and definitely go to the review sessions. Midterm and final were very hard and tested concepts not on the problem sets. He focused on very specific questions from the lecture notes.",
    "Take it if you are a BME major. You do learn a lot of statistics.",
    "This class covers several aspects of Biomedical Engineering in the real world. We look at statistical manipulation, differential equations, and modelling different real world phenomena, and we use MATLAB to apply and practice the theory. It's a heavy workload, and I would definitely recommend that you don't take this class until you've taken a statistics, and programming, class.",
    "I would not recommend this class if you do not have to take it as a requirement for BME. It is really time consuming and it is difficult to understand all of the information because it is presented in such a short time period. The problems sets are worth the most percentage of the class, however most the problems take over 12+ overs to complete.",
    "This class had a lot of potential but ultimately tried to cover too much material for students to effectively learn it all. MATLAB is a very important tool, so I would still recommend this class, but hopefully in the future the course will emphasize programming skills rather applications that were too complex to fully understand in such a short amount of time."
