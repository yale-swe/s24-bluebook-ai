   "comments": [
    "This class was an excellent introduction to film archiving, both as a scholarly field and as a practice. I would definitely recommend this class to others, especially those who work on topics related to film history. This is probably the most useful class to my own work that I have taken so far.",
    "Anyone studying film should consider the course either for credit (if you want more practical experience with handling film prints) or audit. The class is a mixture of history and theory of film archive in the US, it also includes practical assignments that introduce students to the basics of film archiving.",
    "I think this class should be required for graduate students in film and media studies.",
    "The course is recommended to any graduate student whose research would benefit from learning more about the materiality of film as a physical medium or perhaps hopes to conduct archival work. It is much less theory driven than graduate film courses tend to be, but nevertheless illuminates pressing historical and industrial concerns. In addition to gaining practical knowledge about handling and archiving film, the readings and discussions were also stimulating in their own right."

   "comments": [
    "As someone who studies the history of film, understanding the role of the archive is extremely important. However, this is rarely covered in other film classes. This course provided me with tools that I will be able to use in many classes going forward (as well as in my dissertation work). I am already using the work that I have done in The Film Archive in other work that I am doing.",
    "This class gave me all of the information that I could possibly need for navigating a film archive and thinking deeply about archival practices. Brian is fantastic and my classmates were incredibly intelligent. It was a semester full of learning!",
    "Unlike the majority of the courses in Film Studies which are pure theory or culture studies this is a very practical course that deals directly with film materiality. In this regard it is vital for any Film studies scholar.",
    "This course gave me a whole new perspective on the history and future of cinema. It also opened up some theoretical lines of interest for me, like the mythologization of film prints in the wake of mass film production, which I will continue to pursue in my dissertation research.",
    "Gaining practical knowledge on archiving film is useful for me to better understand concerns of film distribution, circulation, medium specificity."
