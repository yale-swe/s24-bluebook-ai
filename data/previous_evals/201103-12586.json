   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. The reading might be a lot, but it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "History and Political Thought is a lot of work and McCarty will make you work, but it's an incredible payback overall. McCarty really cares about your papers and participation (cold-calling those who don't speak up) and forces you to keep up with the really interesting lessons you get from the reading. Definitely a keeper.",
    "Ifyou are looking for a section leader who will take an active role in the class, you might be disappointed with this class. His grading is fair.",
    "It was a struggle for me, but a struggle that left me in a significantly better place than I had been before I took the course in terms of analytical ability, appreciation for an author's style, and writing ability.",
    "very good. mccarty is a good teacher. get drafts done early and run through them at office hours with him! also, PREPARE FOR CLASS",
    "If a student is interested in DS, I would certainly recommend all three courses to them. That said, I'd warn them that the reading is challenging, and that it may be different from other history classes they've taken because there is so much emphasis on political commentary and analysis. I personally enjoyed this, as I had very few dates to memorize, but it might throw someone else for a loop.",
    "It's a class of entirely primary source historical texts, with a few philosophical works dealing with history or politics thrown in. Lots of ancient historians, but it is definitely not a history course. The emphasis is less on specific battles or wars, but rather on the lenses through which you can view and understand history. Basically, it's about the ideas behind historical thought and the ways that people interpret what happened (or didn't happen).",
    "I would definitely recommend Directed Studies to a fellow student. It gives a fantastic grounding in the Western Canon that cannot be approached by any other class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is up to the challenge of a lot of deep reading and rethinking big issues in new ways. If this is not you, then I suggest you not do it just because it would be a bit of a slog otherwise.",
    "The reading for historical and political thought is probably the most difficult reading of the three Directed Studies tracks. You learn how to read and analyze literature in high school and for the most part the philosophy writers just say what they mean. In historical and political thought, however, it can be difficult to figure out the theory that is driving the work, and I thought that beginning to learn how to do this was a very useful skill that came from this course.Also, if you take history and politics with McCarty (which I would recommend doing), definitely go to his office hours. Talking to him one-on-one before writing a paper was very useful and was one of the key components of the class for me.",
    "If you're taking Directed Studies, congratulations. It's an incredible program in every way - except for the huge volume of work, of course - but definitely worth it. A lot of people hate on the fall H\/P curriculum for being disjointed; I personally thought that when read together, the works painted a really good picture of what the ancient world was all about, providing a good foundation for thinking about questions of historiography and political science. You won't find many better DS professors than McCarty. Extremely enthusiastic, cares about if students are getting something from the class, runs a good discussion, fair grader, good lecturer - pretty much anything you'd want from a teacher. If you're in the class, you will have to do the reading.",
    "I would say that it is whirlwind tour of a lot of ancient and medieval historical and political thought, and that, while its speed can be a little frustrating, it ends up being rewarding because it gives you a solid foundation for thinking about questions of statehood, history writing, and morality. I would recommend the class to another student with a warning about the impossible amount of reading (this is not Professor McCarty's decision, but the decision of the entire DS faculty) and about the fact that this is not really a history class, but more of a philosophy of history class."
