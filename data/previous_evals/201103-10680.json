   "comments": [
    "As this class was structured, no I would not.",
    "This course gives an overall idea of the basic mathematical techniques a student would have to master before beginning research. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "A quick review of all the math a physicist will ever need to know.",
    "No if they have a strong undergraduate preparation, they wouldn't learn much new.",
    "Yes. A good course to strengthen math skills.",
    "Yes. It's a good introductory course for math methods.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it for a graduate student entering with advanced work in Mathematics. It's a waste of time.",
    "This course is essential. It teaches things you need to be a competent physicist. I do however think that there should be a separate course for student needing a more advanced study of groups etc. Subjects which are lightly touched in this course.",
    "Physics 506 is a survey of all the applied math you've encountered as an undergraduate plus some group theory and tensor calculus. Complex analysis is condensed into a week (the same amount of time that was spent on series--which I last saw in high school), differential equations are done in a few weeks, and a month was spent on group theory and tensor calculus (even though we were never tested on it). I would only recommend taking it because it is required.",
    "Physics 506 quickly summarizes some of the basic mathematical structures and problem solving techniques used in physics. It does not go into any topic in considerable detail. I don't think a mathematical methods class is the best way to learn this material and would not recommend this course.",
    "It's an interesting class to understand the theory behind how unique mathematical functions such as Bessel or Legendre functions come about, and the background for how these function solve differential equations often encountered in physics, but most of the \"method\" part of the class is rushed and students don't get too much out of that.",
    "Recommend! It's helpful for physics students as well as engineering students.",
    "Perhaps working through a textbook by self more valuable and taking another class a more valuable use of time."

    "I could learn many new concepts, and it helped me think about the old ones and gain a better understanding of them.",
    "The course exposes the beauty of math to me. I am motivated to explore more after class. And the materials covered are useful for my research.",
    "This course will surely help with electromagnetism. However, I do wish we did more on methods of greens functions. I'm not satisfied with my knowledge on it.",
