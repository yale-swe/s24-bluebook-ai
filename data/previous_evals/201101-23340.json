    "Matt is an excellent teacher, perhaps the best I've taken a class with at FES. The lessons were very high quality, and it is amazing how much Matt makes himself available to help students.",
    "Matt Eckelman is a great professor and I found this course very useful \/ interesting. The readings were very helpful as were the in class LCA tutorials with SimaPro. I also found the projects to be very exciting and applicable to current environmental issues. Great work!",
    "This is a great skills-based class. It is useful both in terms of the LCA modeling skill taught, as well as the real-world consulting experience working with clients on a project.",
    "We had few logistical glitches. First, the license of the software expired before the semester ended. This delayed in submission of the project report. Second, the client must be provide a clarity of what they want and also provide information beforehand.",
    "The instructionin this course is terrific. The subject is large enough (and the need for practical work in it is acute enough) that the course ends up being unsatisfying, but I don't know if this is avoidable, and it's a great start. Perhaps linking the homeworks together would help create a sense of continuity and development?",
    "LCA Practicum is a wonderfully hands-on experience, giving us real skills that we can take into the future, and is mostly determined by the dynamics of the student team."

    "I think pretty much everything. Sorry, I know that's not very constructive.",
    "Final project, with close connection with the client",
    "Professor Matt Eckelman--is is knowledgeable, genuinely interested in student learning, and extremely willing to listen and assist students in any way he can. He keeps up with both the literature and real world practice, a unique trait for FES instructors!",
    "The class project. It's very rewarding.",
    "The learning the LCA tool and its wide application.",
    "Professor Eckelman is an excellent teacher. His engagement in the topic is infectious and he really cares about helping the students deepen their understanding of the topic. The lectures were well thought out, the class discussions were interesting, and the client project was a great experience. I came away from that class feeling like I had gained a well-rounded understanding of the LCA literature as well as a practicable skill that I can take with me into a career. Overall, this class was a 10 out of 10.",
    "Great introduction to LCA taught by someone who knows it very well.",

    "The assignments could be refined so that students better understand the task and what they're supposed to get out of it.",
    "The classroom. I think 380 Edwards is not appropiate for this type of course.",
    "The client we were working with delayed the project details and made it tough for us to finish the project within the deadline. More clarity and information would be very helpful.",
    "The homeworks were pretty time consuming. Also, the \"assigned readings\" were really not necessary given that most of the learning came from actually doing the homework assignments.",
    "The course format could be improved. The discussion part of the class was a bit forced and often students didn't want to participate - better not to push it. I think its ok to have the classes end a bit early and let there be some breathing room in a 3 hours long class.",
    "Any deficiencies in my experience were honestly the result of my own distraction and anxieties about the future."

    "The real world consulting experience was great.",
    "You learn to think ahead of time, avoid innecesary work, and respect others' opinions.",
    "disproportionate division of work",
    "The Simapro is not a user friendly tool. Though we were both working on the data, we could only enter the data into one computer and the data could not be imported. This made it tough and very time consuming.The software itself made it tough as we had to work together each time& could not work independently.",
    "Partners should be allowed to rate each other at the end of the process for grade input (as is standard practice at the School of Management). Work in my group was not fairly balanced between everyone. The point of a grading system is not to punish but to create incentives for equal participation; without that, problems can arise. This is especially important for an explicitly pre-professional class.",
    "I loved every aspect of the group work. Sometimes group work at FES can be frustrating, but for this particular group, it was fantastic. I learned so much more by working with the group rather than on my own.",
    "I also learned important skills of pacing a project and working with a group."
