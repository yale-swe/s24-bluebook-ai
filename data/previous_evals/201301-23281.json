    "Monsters was a really interesting topic with Hurley as a great prof. I would recommend an intro English class for every incoming student and even some upperclassmen who never too this class, it will help you further down the road.",
    "Complicated and irrelevant readings, three major papers, no final. I would not recommend it to someone who wants to become a better writer or to someone who wants to enjoy their classes.",
    "This class was extremely interesting. More importantly, it helped improve my mode of thought, and I am today a better writer and thinker. I am very sad to hear that it won't be available next semester.",
    "It's a pretty standard English class. The subject matter was interesting though, so I would recommend it to people who need that Writing credit but hate english classes, like me.",
    "Interesting readings and topic, but not much focus on learning about writing etc.",
    "It's a class about Medieval perception of monsters. Don't take it if you don't want to get up early or want to take a class on Frankenstein, etc, but do take it if you want a funny, engaging, and well-learned professor."
