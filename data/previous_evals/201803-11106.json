    "Translation of French",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: focused class without unnecessary work. Very much felt like the goal was to be able to translate, and we reached that goal.",
    "The reading passages were very engaging. It was useful that we spent time in class going through each translation sentence by sentence. I thought the strength of the course was the attention to language in the translations. The instructor was also extremely helpful in office hours. The course was thoughtfully designed and assignments were interesting and valuable. I think perhaps the coverage of grammatical rules in class could have followed a clearer structure. It did not always feel that class related closely to the textbook readings. I would have felt more engaged had there been a closer correlation.",
    "No weaknesses! I would say though that those who have prior knowledge of french will have an easier time.",
    "Considering the breadth of material in the course and the short time period, I believe Prof. Sanjabi did an excellent job. I dont have any recommendations for improvements."

    "Absolutely! This was a fantastic and efficient way to develop a reading knowledge of French.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, absolutely."
