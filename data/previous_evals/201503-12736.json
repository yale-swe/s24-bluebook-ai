   "comments": [
    "A low-stress introduction to a stressful language.",
    "Great introductory course. The pace isn't too overwhelming, and Jonas is a very good teacher.",
    "Arabic 110 is a good introduction to Arabic, and very reasonable considering the Arabic language can be quite challenging for English speakers. Be prepared to do online homework assignments almost every day, but the work load is definitely manageable, as are the exams.",
    "If you have Professor Elbousty, it is a fantastic introduction to Arabic. You will learn a lot about the language and the culture, make great friends and get hooked into the department.",
    "If you are willing to struggle through a confusing class for the language then go ahead. The subject matter is really interesting and there are fun assignments mixed in with rote language acquisition. The language itself is not easy to pick up, which is fine, but I think the professor made that task even harder, which is not what should happen.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - you make great progress and the class is very enjoyable. It can be quite a lot of work though, but I think that's related to learning a difficult language in general."
