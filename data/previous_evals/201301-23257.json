    "Take this class if you want an easy science credit. It does not ask much of anything of you--just the ability to regurgitate competently. It's approachable but certainly not demanding or really intellectually in any way, shape, or form. That being said, when they say they're going to make the final exam \"harder,\" they actually mean they're going to make it impossibly long so that no one can possibly finish it in the time that is allotted. It was generally disappointing because I was hoping to take an actual science credit while at Yale, and this was just a joke.",
    "Fun science class, not as memorization-heavy as MCDB or MBB classes. You have to really like infectious disease--not just human ID, but animal\/agriculture diseases. Midterms are a bit random.",
    "Infectious diseases (which should probably be called Evolution of Infectious Diseases) is a good science credit that isn't a whole lot of work - just two midterms and a final paper along with the weekly sections. Lectures are interesting enough, just don't expect to learn about specific infectious diseases. The course is more focused on trend of infectious diseases and their role in the world than in what the diseases do orhow they operate in hosts.",
    "It's a great class if you want to have a survey of infectious diseases and parasites. It doesn't go incredibly in-depth in any disease system, but is still really interesting and worth it!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone looking for a basic introduction to infectious diseases. Not too difficult, definitely don't need a science background. The readings for section were disproportionately difficult compared to the lectures.",
    "Good intro course for a variety of biological topics (cancer, evolution, genetics), and a pretty thorough look at a variety of pathogens and disease systems. Also, not too much work - weekly summary, 2 midterms (both of which are pretty straightforward to study for, given that most of the material is straight from the mandatory sections or the slides), and a paper that can be as time consuming or relaxed as you let it be (yay Credit D).",
    "It's a great class that I think anyone should take provided they do not mind the workload. It is not too much work but the exams can be deceivingly difficult and the paper at the end is very difficult to write especially without the precedent of writing during the semester.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course! It is a great look into an interesting subject, and not much background information is required. If you're at all interested in diseases or pathogens, this is a must-take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was well-taught, had a reasonable workload, had interesting readings, and a good overall structure. It's a fascinating topic, although definitely evolution-heavy.",
    "Great bio class.",
    "This is an important class for anyone who ever questioned the relevance and importance of ecology and evolutionary biology! I wish more pre-meds took the class (I met some who shopped it and decided against it because it didn't feel rigorous enough)--the thing is, this was not a hard class, but the concepts are often non-intuitive, and are very important for understanding how our world does and will continue to work. I highly recommend it. Probably a good science credit for almost anyone, and a great 5th class for a science major.",
    "Definitely take it, even if you're a non-science major. The material is great and the lectures are super interesting. Midterms aren't terrible, but I'd recommend Cr\/D\/F if you can.",
    "This is definitely a course that you should take if you need a science credit or if you are interested in Infectious Diseases at all. It is not that much work and it is fairly entertaining, not to mention that you do learn a lot of very interesting things about disease systems.",
    "This is a great introduction to infectious diseases and thinking about the roles of pathogen ecology and evolution. It's a really interesting class, and there's not that much work.",
    "Take this class! It's very manageable, the exams are reasonable, it's a great way to begin reading academic papers, and Professor Turner is amazing.",
    "AMAZING! I HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in learning about how we humans fit into the broader circle of life, as well as anyone who needs a science credit. This class is totally accessible even to non-science majors, and as long as you are willing to do the work and go to class (which is enjoyable because Professor Turner is such a fantastic lecturer) you can totally succeed-- again, even as a non-science major. I took this class because I needed a science credit, but because of the fascinating material, great Professor and great TAs it ended up being one of my all-tinw favorite Yale classes EVER! I cannot recommend this class highly enough. If you need a science credit, and want to actually learn some really fascinating stuff that will change your ideas on how the world works forever, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",
    "Wonderfully informative lecture with little work.",
    "This is a really great class. The lecture style is great. Very friendly, engaging, and interesting. A manageable workload and interesting sections. Prof Turner is a really good lecturer. He really works to make the lectures interesting. You really look at infectious disease from all angles. I especially enjoyed the ethics based questions and public perception of infectious disease. This is a class that will make you interested in science. I would recommend it to majors and non-majors alike.",
    "Take it, especially if you are a science major who is slightly sick of intro classes",
    "It's been a really interesting class, just make sure that you have sufficient background information about ecology etc.",
    "I loved this course. If you are sincerely interested in the material, take it. Don't let the title fool you into thinking it is all about pathogens that infect humans, though. Professor Turner likes to focus on all sorts of parasites, of plants, bugs, animals, and humans. Also, note that the midterms sometimes didn't seem to reflect how well I understood the lecture material. Study for them.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is really interesting, and the research papers you read in section will really complement what you learned in the class. Professor Turner is a great lecturer, and his tests are fair. It is probably best if you have some background in science before taking the course or some of the papers\/topics might be a bit too complicated.",
    "I am a humanities major, but I found this class absolutely wonderful! The class is not an \"easy\" class, but presented in a way that makes it perfect for both science and non-science majors. (Professor Turner defines every term.)Infectious diseases is one of my favorite classes at Yale! Professor Turner was engaging and presented the material in an interesting way! The content of the class is not soley based on human diseases, but looks at many different types of parasites and pathogens, which is one of the strengths of the class. I found the material to be interesting because it is presented from an E&EB approach. I would recommend this class to everyone!",
    "EEB228 is a survey-style lecture on infectious diseases. It's not a gut, but the workload is manageable and the material is intuitive to a certain extent. I would recommend this to a non-science major who doesn't wantto take Issues to Biology."
