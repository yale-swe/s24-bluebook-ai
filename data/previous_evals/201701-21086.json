    "Continuation of L1. Feel like I just might be able to survive if dropped in Moscow.",
    "Grammar and verbal skills for Russian level 2. Did a lot of practise for different grammatical cases and learnt a lot of vocab. Also focused on correcting pronounciation.",
    "My Russian speaking, reading, and writing skills improved dramatically. Beyond technical skills, I gained a greater appreciation for Russian culture and literature. I became exposed to Russian poetry--we read and memorized some Pushkin poems.",
    "Conversational skills in russian",
    "Learnt all cases and good usage of verbs. Good oral practice with partners and for the exams.",

   "comments": [
    "Faster paced than previous semester, which meant I learned more, but also had less time to process it.",
    "Very good course. Better when the classes are a smaller size so that you have more practice speaking Russian.",
    "It is a very strong course. Expectations are clear and well-communicated. The homework assignments reinforces and helps clarify topics covered in class. The tests and quizzes are well-crafted and spaced out nicely. Additionally, I think the professor's encouragement to read\/memorize poetry is a great strength of the course. I would've loved even more cultural\/literary supplements!",
    "Good help by professors, really good worksheets that were more advanced than the book",
    "Although I did really well in L1, with a different instructor, I had a very difficult time succeeding in the course. The pace of the course was very fast, but I feel like some of the more difficult concepts were not explained adequately. I always went into exams, after extensive review, feeling like I knew and had learned from my past mistakes-- only to get similar feedback. Going slower isn't really an option, but maybe a more in-depth explanation of certain concepts could be done. Or making the class sessions longer than 50 minutes?"

   "comments": [
    "Very much so. Don't do something gutty and boring like Spanish when you can gain insight into an incredible culture and challenge yourself with a language like Russian.",
    "Yes even though it is hard the class is very rewarding",
    "Definitely. I'm so glad I decided to take Russian. It's a very cool language. This course covers the basics and gives you a very good foundation. Highly recommend for anyone who loves Russian literature\/culture and\/or just wants to learn a different language.",
    "Absolutely. This is such a great language to take",
    "Russian's a cool language. If you're looking for something a little different, but also somewhat practical, I'd recommend. Also would recommend if your interested in old Soviet cartoons.",
    "Yes take if interested in russian. Really good course",
    "Absolutely. Russian is so fun to learn and Julia is very committed to helping her students learn it.",
    "Russian really has to be your only focus for you to do well. If you have two jobs and are also taking other really hard classes, it's hard to focus the necessary attention to become successful."
