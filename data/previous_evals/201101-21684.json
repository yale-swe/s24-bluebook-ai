    "It's just your senior essay - pretty self explanatory. Write drafts early. Also, only choose a hands-off professor if you know that he or she will be OK with you having total ownership over your finished product in the end. If you only turn in one draft, your professor might grade you off for things that he or she never mentioned in meetings or comments... really really frustrating.",
    "This is not a class. The senior essay experience depends entirely on who your advisor is.",
    "EPE 491 is an independent study class for the senior thesis. I recommend it to students who are motivated to work independently and who my need flexibility throughout the semester."
