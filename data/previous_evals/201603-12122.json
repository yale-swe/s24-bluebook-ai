    "Before taking this class, I knew little about academia or what attending graduate school might be like. This class, beyond allowing me to learn content, gave me the tools to think about methods and methodology, speak to several guest lecturers, and learn from other students in the class. Feedback on our work was great and always encouraging.",
    "Within the working group format, this course mostly operated as a space for learning more about the breadth of current scholarship in the field of Latinx Studies. It also was a useful sounding board in which to share ideas about my own research alongside those conversations."

    "I appreciate the working group format, though I do wish that there were more opportunities to talk about our actual works-in-progress through the course of the semester perhaps more structure to the workshop aspects of the group (maybe where we share our materials online with one another in advance of presentations\/proposal shares), especially in the second semester. I think, also, that it would be useful to have at least one session dedicated to the formation of the field, just so that we all have the same ground to think through over the course of the semester. What I thought was fantastic were in-class sessions with scholars from other institutions the opportunity to talk about their own research with them was very helpful, especially as I begin to think about how to pursue my own research. I will say, though, that it is also helpful to be able to discuss readings without the authors in the room so I wonder if there could be more balance in that regard. Another major definite strength is that the course brings together a community of students, professors, and other scholars doing work in this field that I would not necessarily have run into otherwise!"
