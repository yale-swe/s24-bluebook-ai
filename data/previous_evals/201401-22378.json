    "\"Hello fellow student, what courses are you thinking of? Let me tell you about this one... CDI is an intense investigation of: the Caribbean, the construction of diasporas, and the formative effects on nascent identities that young communities of intellectuals have. It's not an easy course but then what worthwhile thing in life ever is? If you like good things then I think you'll like it.\"",
    "An exciting and innovative take on Caribbean literature headed by a wonderful professor.",
    "WGSS 645 is about everything. It really is. In the class, we use art and literature to explore the human condition in the context of a Caribbean space that is both local and transnational.The course is also about the legacies of history which continue to haunt the lives of Caribbean societies and peoples.Most importantly, the class is about the dimensions of selfhood in the contemporary era. It requires active participation from students whose engagement with the various materials is the substance of the classroom experience.I would recommend this class to another student without hesitation."

    "The conversation I was introduced to in CDI was the most profound I have witnessed in my academic career.The intellectual integrity and honesty of my classmates and professor was, for me, illustrated not only by the quality of conversation but by the the welcoming environment created by my classmates and professor.In summation: As a member of the Afro Caribbean community of Great Britain, I have gained a new confidence in my writing and a renewed engagement with the history and politics of my country and of my community. I have found and developed strategies for dealing with issues that I previously felt ill-equipped to deal with. I leave the semester a better artist and a better person. I have waited for a conversation of the depth and quality I found in CDI for most of my life.Thanks!",
    "+ Detailed feedback from Professor Carby gestured to further readings that would benefit my futue research area.+ The course strengthened by knowledge ofCaribbean authors and theorists."
