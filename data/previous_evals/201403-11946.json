    "It's a nice transition to the higher levels.",
    "I would describe Spanish 130 as a course for moderately skilled speakers. I would recommend the class because I felt like it was intensive, but not totally crazy either.",
    "We went over core Spanish grammar and honed our speaking, writing, and listening skills with class activities and homework.",
    "L3 is just a big review of L1\/L2, so the pace is way easier than L2. You dont actually learn any new grammar, so it is not that difficult. There is still little emphasis on speaking, so dont expect to be fluent as Yale claims you will be after the course.",
    "If you have to take Spanish L3, then I guess take it, not much to do in that case."
