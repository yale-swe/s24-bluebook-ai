    "Good",
    "As I said before, this course deepens my knowledge very much, esp. in database part.",
    "I was given a broad overview of computational biology and bioinformatics, though I did not realize this until the last week of the course; I noticed that at the end of the course when people asked me to describe my major I was having much less trouble as a result of the class. However, since the course is so broad, it doesn't seem like it will have a direct contribution to my research.",
    "Provided a good overview of the field. Provided some insights into what direction I would like to take my research."
