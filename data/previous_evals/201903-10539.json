    "This course is very well designed, and I cannot think of any current weaknesses in the course.",
    "I have no complaints about this class. It was fun, well organized, and clear. Dave explained things very well and was forgiving of mistakes. There was a lot of room to go at a pace that you're comfortable with and ask questions when you're unsure. It felt really good to get to do something with my hands instead of psets\/papers. It also was good to get to practice simple manufacturing because it gave me a sense of what is possible to make when making mechanical designs.",

    "Yes, I learned a lot and it was really fun and low stress and low time commitment.",
    "I'm putting my answers to all the questions here because it's the one that appears first on CourseTable (saving you a few clicks, folks). As you're undoubtedly aware, this is one of the most unusual classes at Yale. From the start, Dave tells everyone that there is no work or preparation required outside the class, no midterm or final, and all you have to do is just show up for four hours every week. (A few of the art grad students in our class had some trouble with even the last one .... whoops.) Before I dive into the details, let's get one thing out of the way: this year, the class met either Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday, from 1-5 pm. I don't know if that will continue to be the caseI'd imagine that the days of the week will shift depending on Dave's schedulebut since this is one of those annoying classes with no time listed, I'd guess the hours will be the same and there will be three possible sections. You have to come sign up in person at the start, but as far as I know basically everyone gets into one section. Just to set your fears at rest. Anyhow, the way this class works is basically you come, learn how to make a part, and leave. These parts are assembled into a small steam engine at the end of the semester, which you can hook up a compressed air canister to and get it to spin at roughly 50 revolutions per second, which is pretty sweet. The day-to-day consists of cutting things out of large pieces of aluminum and brass, using either a milling machine or a lathe. Note if this is relevant: there is very little use of CNC technology in this class, it's primarily manual machining. Dave is a slightly taciturn yet friendly guy who is a great teacher and, honestly, a good antidote from the \"intellectual type\" that comprises much of Yale's faculty. Ask him about his stargazing club and stories about ghosts. Obviously, I highly recommend this class, mostly because doing stuff with your hands is insanely fun.",
    "If you are interested in learning how to machine simple metal parts using industrial tools, take this! It's relatively low commitment since there is no homework outside the class. And you get to build a working model steam engine that you can take away which is super cool!",
    "Yes, it's a really excellent class! Take it!! Its just 4 hours a week, and you end up with a working steam engine & a pretty comprehensive machining knowledge.",
    "Very much! Great course, lots of learning, you get a souvenir you can be proud of at the end and every day in lab is truly a joy.",
    "Yes. It was a very fun course and the skills it teaches are very valuable.",
    "Absolutely! Anyone who will be machining or designing parts that will be machined should take this course.",
    "Yes! Great. Fun. Clear. Dave is a great teacher. Good stuff.",
    "Absolutely. Fun and very practical"
