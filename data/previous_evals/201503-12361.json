   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course, at least not in the form it is taught right now. It is essentially a \"learn this on your own\" course, as the video lectures provided were not so helpful as they appeared and the TA's were not great at actually teaching the topic to the complexity to which we were tested on. The students who did well did not learn any of their acquired knowledge in the classroom, but rather the students who spent the most time teaching themselves the material.",
    "No one takes or should take this class unless they're required to, so that's essentially the gist: it's not enjoyable, but if you must take this, your best bet is getting a section with Jim Rolf or John Hall or similar--some of the sections like this one are taught by grad students, which tend to be less effective in teaching the material. Be careful: the exams are often much trickier than what you see in class and what you prepare for.",
    "I would definitely recommend starting in Math 112 unless you feel extremely comfortable with the material. Getting a good basis of knowledge in Math 112 would benefit students a lot more in the long run",
    "This was literally the worst math class (and probably class in general) I have ever taken in my life. I do not know whether this was the fault of the flipped classroom system or just my professor in particular, but I truly felt like I learned nothing during this semester. The videos were hard to follow and did not explain the concepts well at all beyond one example problem. The professor did not offer any additional help either, and I would frequently leave class understanding the concepts even less than I did before coming to class. If you do not have to take this class for your major, DO NOT TAKE IT.",
    "I took math 115 so that i could have access to higher level courses. i would not recommend 115 unless it was done with a series that combined 112,115, and probably 120 in two semesters",
    "I would not recommend because it was not informative.",
    "Yes a great stepping stone out of introductory calculus.",
    "If you must take this class as a pre-req, then go for it, but it is CRUCIAL to choose the right instructor. Take it with Jim Rolf, Kyle Luh, Flor Hunziker, or Ethan Addicott. If you choose the wrong instructor like I did, you'll just be miserable during the entire class and have your interest in math completely removed (as mine was after having a terrible instructor). I would not suggest this class as a QR credit -- especially if they continue with the flipped classroom business. The flipped classroom is so so so bad, and not effective at all. It seems like the flipped classroom was implemented because there are only a few great teachers (like the ones listed above, but Jim Rolf and Kyle Luh are the two big ones) but too many students demanding the class, so what better way to teach than to record the one good teacher teaching and then having the students watch his videos? If this class went back to the traditional method of teaching, it would improve tremendously. And also, if you intend to fully understand the material, and want to do extremely well, be prepared to devote a lot of time to this class: going to office hours, review sessions, etc. The exams are difficult and challenging, and go beyond just memorizing and applying formulas: you really have to think and understand the material on a deeper level. The good thing is that they offer many resources to do well: individual coaching, peer tutors, multiple review sessions (both course-wide and section-wide), and frequent office hours.",
    "I was fortunate to be in a section of this class with a great instructor! Now, this can definitely be a tough course, but if you find it so then I recommend office hours: they were a huge help to me for understanding the material. The flipped classroom system is okay though the video lectures helped a visual thinker like me more than some verbal lecture would. This system also allowed for class time to be used for practice which can be both good and bad, oftentimes the problem sets were where I actually got to apply the principles. In all, not too bad of a class, and it's very possible to make it an enjoyable class even if some of the concepts are confusing.",
    "It's an annoying class, but not too bad. The material is challenging but straight forward enough to be learned even with a bad teacher.",
    "Not sure how I feel about the flipped classroom. It was nice to be able to pause the video lectures and rewatch some parts, but it sucked not being able to ask questions about it. There was a disconnect between what was in the videos and what was taught in class. I taught myself certain lessons from the textbook because the instruction was confusing. I would not recommend this course, but I think most people who take it are taking it for credit so just tough it out, study on your own, and make sure you understand each topic! Know what questions to ask BEFORE you get to class"
