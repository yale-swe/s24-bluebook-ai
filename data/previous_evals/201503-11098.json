   "comments": [
    "I love this class - it helps me really understand period clothes as a designer, but it is way too short. It needs to be longer than just one semester, because we cannot cover period in the small amount of time and pay equal attention to mens' and womens' clothes",
    "Robin handed out a syllabus and some other useful handouts in the first class, which I really appreciated. She went over what each week would like for us. At the top of each class she also would go through what we would be doing that day and then go into a more specifics about the time period we would be working in.",
    "Robin was incredibly clear about the topic of study, and it was clearly laid out in the syllabus what period we would be studying each week.",
    "For a costume designer, this class is the single most valuable class. It is a perfect pairing to Jane's costume history lecture which is part of her first year class. It allows the students to look at first hand research and begin to understand its implications in a 3D hands on way. Robin is a marvel in her ability to allow every student complete freedom to attempt any garment while being able to support that student in class as they experiment with fabric to reproduce the research. The skills taught in this class are only learned through a lifetime of hands on practice, and in lieu of a lifetime, this class lays a foundation on which young designers can build on as they encounter different garments, drapers, tailors, and artisans throughout their careers. The school MUST find a way to keep Robin on to teach an expanded version of this class (as I know is her desire after retirement.) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep this class going and make it available to all 3 years of costume designers who need these skills in the real world in order to be able to fully support the designers they are assisting or in order to fully realize their designs. This class is not a class to create drapers and stitches, but it is a class that allows Costume Designers to ask practical questions of construction and to be able to fully understand the steps that a draper must take to realize the designers vision."

   "comments": [
    "Robin would always bring a rack of clothing that were from the time period or constructed from patterns of the time period. These served as a very useful tool to study directly how the garments were made. She would always bring books that were relevant to the time period and to pattern making that we would reference throughout the individual class session. Overall I think the class was prepared and presented very well.",

    "Getting to create period clothes is great but I just wish that we had more time to complete them> the class should really be longer. That way we can get to the core of each period and then not rush to finish making the garment.",
    "I wish we could take this class twice a week. Once a week is sufficient time to get through one project, but we would all benefit if we added another day. It would be incredibly useful to me as a costume designer.",
    "All work was done within the class, so there was no outside work except for our research each week. Robin is incredibly sensitive to the demands we experience in our other classes, and never overwhelms with outside work. There is no need for it truly, as she is a wonderful teacher, and so much knowledge is gathered in class."

    "Incredibly helpful. She made time during her busy schedule to make time for a makeup class at the end of the semester. She makes time for her students, and is so excited about sharing her knowledge. She is an asset to the school of drama."

I don't have 100% confidence in this subject though and that's why I think having more classes like this would be useful. I would like to have the opportunity to study both menswear and womenswear equally. The limited time of this class only allowed my focus on one gender for each time period.",
    "It was, perhaps, the most important class I took all semester outside of my costume design course. I cannot begin to explain how vital this knowledge is, and how wonderful it would be to be able to further this knowledge with more classes in this topic."

    "We just need longer hours for this class",
    "Have this class twice a week! One day devoted to menswear of the time period and the other day devoted to womenswear!",
    "My suggested improvements would be that the class could be longer, as we often ran out of time to fully completely drape the garment. It would be wonderful to have the class for a full year, and to have a coordinating costume history class with it. One day or week is lecture of the period, the next is the three dimensional draping."
