    "English 126 with Professor Patterson was the light of a tough sophomore spring. At first, I was not especially keen on taking the class, because I had disliked English 125 pretty strongly. Things got much better in 126. The authors--Milton, Pope, Wordsworth and Eliot--are more accessible, in my opinion more enjoyable, and the readings more manageable. Professor Patterson makes the very wise decision of assigning whole poems--Paradise Lost, the Rape of the Lock, Eloisa to Abelard, the Prelude, the Waste Land and Ash Wednesday--rather than slicing off excerpts from particular works: a good choice. She is an excellent and very experienced instructor; it was an honor to be taught by her, and to be under the sway of such a powerful, knowledgeable and scholarly mind. She is sometimes tough, sometimes tart--she told me without adornment that I should pretty much rewrite my final paper--but in the best possible way. Her criticisms are not pointless, but useful in becoming a better interpreter of poetry. She is helpful in disciplining your mind, sharpening your imagination, and honing your precision as a critic. Our seminar developed that sense of camaraderie that makes going to class just so enjoyable, and I think there was respect for each other's thoughts and criticisms. That's never a guarantee but I think under Professor Patterson's influence that rapport tends to develop. I recommend this class to prospective majors and non-majors alike; I've now declared an English major, and I think that is owing largely to this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. ENGL 126 is one of the best English classes I have taken at Yale. The course covers the main works of Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Eliot. 10-page papers give you an opportunity to think about the poets on a large scale, while seminar is built primarily around specific, line-by-line analysis. This class will challenge you to truly engage with the texts offered in a critical way. Professor Patterson always injects seminar with wit, wisdom, and a true love for the work of English. One of the highlights of my time at Yale, and an experience for which I am truly grateful.",
    "English 126 continues the same sort of structure as 125. While I'm not sure that I would have opted to take the course if it were not a prerequisite for the English major, I'm glad in the end that I did; I found the texts that we read in 126 to be more exciting and less tedious that those of 125. If you do take this course, DEFINITELY sign up for Prof. Patterson's section. She is warm and funny, and goes out of her way to make each student feel welcome and to give all students an opportunity to participate. That said, her expectations for papers are somewhat extensive (she requires that you write 3 ten-page papers instead of 4 shorter ones as in the other sections), so you should be prepared to work hard. But in the end, the longer paper format allows you to more deeply explore your own ideas and are more satisfying when finished. So... yes! yes! yes! Don't miss an opportunity to be in Prof. Patterson's classroom!!!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course if you're looking for a basic introduction to poetry--it's an intense course comprised primarily of English majors. But if you're going to take English 126, it's more than just a requirement--I actually enjoyed this class and gained a surprising amount from it. Definitely take it with Professor Patterson.",
    "Take this with Professor Patterson! She is brilliant and hilarious and so witty, and we're lucky that she's still teaching. I would recommend this to even non-English majors. The poetry you read is so wonderful, and really ends up being so fun."
