   "comments": [
    "Take this lab class if you have to. It probably won't be as painful as you think, because of the instructor (Aruna Pawashe<---amazing)",
    "this lab sucks. take section 1 and get it done if necessary.",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise, this course is not worth the pain or the time.",
    "Not a bad lab course. Try to take the first half because writing the 2 lab reports during finals would suck. Also they're much more flexible with due dates with the first section because it ends in mid-October.",
    "Start your project report EARLY or suffer!",
    "Most people only take this class because they need a lab for premd requirements. If you need it, I would take it. But there is no reason to take it for fun.",
    "not if you don't have to take it. i hardly ever understood what was actually going on.",
    "Very original for a lab course at Yale: you do two self-contained projects over a half-semester time frame. Lab was fun, but the reports were hard. Take it.",
    "Great course to become familiar to standard research topics. Will take up a ton of time and the work is not easy; there is a lot, but being half a semester balances it out a bit. Take first section, you will thank yourself for it.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is required or you have not had lab experience before. If you have worked in a research lab, you won't learn anything and will just struggle through lectures and writing long reports.",
    "You learn a lot in the class, but the lab manual is so poorly written that you stumble over everything. The lab reports would be more bearable to write if the supplementary handouts for the lab weren't so disorganized. I ended up having to write the second lab report over multiple times because there was something I missed every time I opened a new document with instructions about how to do calculations for the second lab report. The lectures are also unbearable. Both professors are enthusiastic and responsive to what you say, but Professor Konigsberg goes on tangents in a quiet voice that you can't hear, and then it is difficult to understand Professor Pawashe because of her accent and her rapid speaking. Perhaps this could be changed if there were a different lecture room that were more accommodating to the number of students in the course.",
    "Please for your own sake - do not take this class. If you are even looking at this, it probably means you have to or it's \"highly recommended\" for Med School. The class is very very intense - 2 4hr labs a week and 2 ginormous lab reports due at the very end. I spent at least 60hrs+ on those lab reports, no question. Also, Konigsberg's lectures can be painfully slow and the daily quizzes are frustrating as well.",
    "The lab meets twice a week, but only for half the semester. Pretty harsh grading, especially on the second lab report. A lot of work required, with quizzes each lab day, two large lab reports, and two problem sets that are due with the lab reports. One TA will grade ALL students' work so it doesn't really matter what TA you get...although if you can find a nice TA, it helps to ask them for help on stuff. The profs are nice though and really care about whether you understand the concept of the labs. Overall the ideas were interesting and the techniques were THAT hard...but accuracy is still difficult to achieve and that screws up your results, which inevitably leads to lower grades.",
    "Not too much work, especially if you've taken a biology lab before. For most of the labs you're done by 4pm or so.The first lab report is somethin' ELSE, though! A lot of work.It might be helpful to skim the requirements of the first lab report near the beginning of the course, just so you know what you're getting into and can stay on top of your game.",
    "Much more interesting than your average lab course, in that you get to work on two long-term projects (one of them lasting 9 lab sessions or so). It helps if you've done PCR\/cloning\/sequencing\/gels before, as it will make the procedures very easy. Might be tricky otherwise, since the lab lectures can be dry, though the lab manual does a good job of explaining everything. Try to take this first session, as you won't want to be writing your reports during finals. Also, start working on report 1 (at least analyzing your data) a solid 4-5 days before it's due: it will make things much easier.",
    "Biochem Lab is a lot of work, but it's nice to only have to go for half of the semester. You will learn several techniques that are commonly used in real research laboratories, preparing you for a research job.",
    "Having lab twice a week was a struggle, but it was really really nice to be done with it for the second half of the semester. I would recommend first session - they were flexible with deadlines for the lab reports in a way that they couldn't be for the second half.",
    "The MCDB biochem lab is a very good lab course with thorough treatment of some of the more important bio research techniques. The professors are great and very flexible with deadlines and such. The class meets 2 days \/ wk but only for half a semester, so think carefully about which half of the semester will be less work for you when you sign up. There are quizzes at each lab meeting, but if you've read the lab they're not difficult. On the lab reports, make sure to start early as they take a long time!!",
    "This lab is a lot of work but very interesting. Make sure you really want to take it, it isn't required with MB&B 300 so only take it if it truly interests you. It is worth the workload, you just need to be prepared for a lot of prepping (a difficult quiz every day) and long lab reports.",
    "You wouldn't want to take this class for fun, though when you're writing the lab reports, everything comes together and it's some pretty interesting stuff. And no, you won't be able to publish your results.",
    "This labwas really quite good. Lecture was sometimes quite slow but the lab itself is incredibly well organized. I learned a ton and did some ridiculously cool experiments. I feel that I have quite a large repertoire of sophisticate lab skills after this lab. The lab reports are huge but a great way to really understand what we did. Analyzing the results can be fun--if you leave yourself enough time--as we actually did real science and were working on a problem that many scientists are currently investigating.",
    "I think this lab is overall useful and a good experience. Be prepared to work hard, and you will get a lot out of it.",
    "Biochem lab is divided into two projects and there are 2 lab reports and 2 problem sets. You basically investigate topics in biochemistry through lab techniques. It's nice that there are two sections of the lab--I would advise trying to get into the first section. The labs are slightly frustrating because only a few of them work and you're often there late. Overall though, I would definitely take this over other labs. Also, I would advise to take this while you are taking Biochem. I didn't and really wish I did because you tend to forget a lot of things.",
    "This class is way too much time for a 0.5 credit lab. I spent ~4 hours in lab on Tues and on Thurs and ~4 hours reading over the lab manual and studying for the daily quiz for Tues and Thurs. This means I spent 16 hours per week on this class (0.5 credits). Just to give a comparison, I spent 9 hours per week for MBB 300 (1 credit). The lab was therefore almost twice as much work as the lecture. Quizzes are extremely picky and are made by the TAs. Both professors are extremely nice. The issue with this class is that they do not hand out the rubric (even though it exists) for the first main paper, so it's very hard to know what they're looking for. If you don't ask enough questions about what will be graded, your grade will suffer. Lectures are extremely dry and pointless. I almost think they should be entirely cut outof the course or shortened to 20 minutes or less--sometimes they went on for an hour or longer.",
    "This is a great class. There is a LOT of work involved, but you get a lot out of it. It's well-organized and fun, but it can get stressful. Don't take this class with another lab class though and treat it as if it were a one-credit class at least.",
    "Great to learn the basic lab techniques, but a very difficult half of the semester - perhaps the most difficult lab course I have ever taken. Would not recommend taking it unless absolutely required.",
    "A lot of work. Having lab twice a week pretty much consumes your life, and even after you are done, you have to write long lab reports. Make sure you start the reports early - especially the first one, it takes about a week to write a good report. The good thing is that I did the lab during the first half of the semester, so the last few weeks of the semester were much less stressful since the course was over. Overall the material was interesting though, and the professors and TA's were always willing to help if you ask questions."
