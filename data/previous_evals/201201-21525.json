    "It's French. I took the class because I needed to finish my requirement. It's not good or bad, it's just something I had to get done.",
    "French 140 is less labor intensive than 130, with a shift in focus from grammar to literature. I would recommend it if you are interested in practicing French more and furthering reading skills.",
    "I would recommend it, but not with Grantham. It really improves your French and is an interesting class, but Grantham is often confused about the correct responses to questions and cannot manage the classroom.",
    "I would be cautious to recommend the course with Mme. Grantham for anyone without an already extremely solid knowledge of the French language. Mme. Grantham, while an affable person, has a somewhat unreliable grasp on French grammar that is worrying. When asked to clarify difficult grammar questions, she would often return that we need not worry about it because it would not be on the exam. Additionally, people in the class would frequently argue various grammatical points with her that never fully reached resolution. Many came out of the class claiming to have learned little compared to, say, their French 130 class."
