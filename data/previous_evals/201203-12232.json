    "Economics 135 covers probability and statistical theory that is fundamental to understanding more complicated topics in econometrics. However, this course has a bad reputation for lackluster instruction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 my personal experience was no exception: the course was poorly taught and the material became very dull and mechanical. Hence, I would highly suggest learning from the textbook directly as lectures were taken almost verbatim from the book.",
    "If you like statistics and you like math, this is the class for you. The professor changes every year, so don't base your judgement on the quality of teaching. Rather, if you enjoy learning about probability and statistics and want to see how to apply them in a more concrete fashion take this class.",
    "If you are just and Econ major and not econ and math then this class does not work as your 'one semester of econometrics' and you have to take Econ 136 as well. But you can just take Part 1 of the intro to econometrics classes.Don't take the two semesters of math department stats instead of this if youre and econ major since this will count as an econ elective and those wont. So, take this if your an Econ and math major. Or just and econ major but like math and don't want to take the easier way out.",
    "Probably not a class you'd take purely out of interest. However, I'd say this sequence definitely sounds more engaging than the Econ 131-2 one. And it definitely gives you new and useful ways of approaching real-world problems.",
    "Don't take it with Armstrong if possible. Also maybe lookk for alternatives if you don't absolutely need t for your major.",
    "This course brings you up to speed on the most commonly used probability and statistical concepts and techniques (expected values, moment-generating functions, common distributions, randon sampling, central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, regressions, and the like). Although theorems are proved in the course, the emphasis (for this semester at least) is on applying the concepts to actual problems. Not a particularly exciting course (I mean, stats courses are generally not anyway), but I'd recommend it because you learn a lot of useful material, the workload (with Prof Tim Armstrong) is pretty light, and problem sets and exams aren't too bad. Rich Langford is also a great TA.",
    "This course is a pretty standard course in probability and statistics. Prof Armstrong presents the material pretty clearly, and the textbook supplements coursework extremely well. Overall, it didn't deviate much from expectations of a statistics class. I didn't necessarily love it, but it was not unenjoyable.",
    "Statistics is useful to know, worth considering even if you aren't Econ&Math. If you have a solid math background then the problem sets take like, 1 hour a week.",
    "Not unless you have to - for math&econ, otherwise 131 is just so much easier.",
    "Worse course I have ever taken. I love mathematics and I love economics. During my vacations, I read about economics or mathematics. I enjoyed the statistics I did online when trying to learn something for this final. This is the worst course there is. In fact, it is so painful that it will ruin your intellectual curiosity for the duration of the semester and you will find your other courses (that could be fascinating) to be dull.",
    "Yes.",
    "A proof-based stats class. Pretty tough and mathy, but interesting and potentially useful, I hope.",
    "You're only taking this because you're an Econ\/Math major, just pray you don't have Tim as a professor. This class could be improved in so many ways. The problem sets were in no way representative of the test questions. The grading is absolutely horrible. No curve at all on exams, and no curve at all on the class! It's hard enough to be an Econ\/Math major at Yale when everyone defects to the easier Econ (Econ 131\/132 is a JOKE), and this just makes it so much harder. If we had known what was coming on the exams, then maybe it would have been fairer (offer a practice test maybe?). A lot more should have been made clear about this class from the start. This is not in line with any other class offered at Yale. I'm praying that the class ended up being curved, otherwise I'm terrified of what my grade will be. No partial credit on exams, even if you mess up part A on a question and follow that wrong answer up correctly on parts B-E. Just horrible, completely turned me off to Econ\/Math, but we have no choice.",
    "Recommended, if you've had some minor statistics background (i.e. AP Stat). It's a pretty nice intro stat class, heavier in math than Econ 131. As someone who enjoys both statistical concepts and the math behind it, I didn't mind the course or the psets (which are actually very important in understanding what the prof did in class), but would've enjoyed more application of the abstract concepts in class. This was pretty proof and math-heavy, but the workload isn't bad at all. Psets usually took around 2-3 hours. Prof Armstrong is fairly new at teaching, and I wouldn't say he's a phenomenal teacher, but he tries very hard and individual office hours are helpful. Go to section\/TA office hours; Rich is the hidden gem of this course. He understands exactly what we don't, and will teach it to you with patience. Take it if you want to learn stat and you have a solid math background. Zero economics background needed, despite what the prereq says.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I can objectively say that this has been the most informative class I have ever taken at Yale. I came into this class with a cursory knowledge of AP stats and now I know all the underlying reasoning behind introductory statistics. The course is conducted is a proof-then-application manner. The proofs for the statistical tools you encounter are exhilarating and the subsequent application is a great way to see how tools are used in real life. You even learn a bit of R and STATA programming which are useful is you're seeking a research job with the economics department. Professor Armstrong explains difficult statistical concepts very clearly and makes himself very accessible outside of class (by replying promptly to emails and holding alot of review sessions). The result of all these factors is that you will gain a comprehensive understanding of economics and feel confident and indeed excited about take further statistical classes after this class. Furthermore, this class is graded very fairly, so if you work hard you will get a good grade. THIS IS A GEM OF A CLASS AND WILL REAFFIRM YOUR DECISION TO MAJOR IN ECONOMICS.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn more about economics and statistics."
