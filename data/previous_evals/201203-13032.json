   "comments": [
    "History& Politics is a part of DS, so if you want to take DS you will take H&P. There is way too much reading which the majority of people don't do, leading to classic conversations in class that don't go anywhere because everyone tries talking on top of each other without even knowing what they're saying. H&P needs serious reformulation. Less books\/readings, more focused discussions. Also, if you're an international student and haven't had English as your language of instruction, switch out of Martin's section ASAP. He is not helpful if you want to learn how to write better, he'll just tell you that you need to improve and say \"read Strunk& white\" if you ask how to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend DS history and politics. The texts are important, and we do learn a lot even in the little time we have.",
    "Do not be scared off by Dale Martin. He'll tear apart your writing style, swear in lectures, complain about conservatives, and tell you that doesn't actually like Directed Studies, but do NOT be scared off by Dale Martin. The guy knows a lot, and you will learn a lot. He has an acute understanding of the ideologies and rhetoric of the Greeks, the Romans, and especially the early Christians. He's particularly good at identifying ideological problems in each text, and has a healthy skepticism of all the authors we read.Unfortunately, the week-to-week H&P lectures are variable in quality. In fact, the course itself is variable, in quality and even intention. While Lit and Phil tell cohesive \"stories\" about how Western societies have viewed narrative and virtue over time, H&P can't decide what it wants to be. You're never sure whether your class is about the Peloponnesian War, how the Peloponnesian War is reported, or how such a report reveals the values of the Peloponnesians. This means that there is more reading for H&P than either of the other two classes, because it's trying to cover three issues instead of one. Still a great experience though - there are some terrific texts, even if the course is confused as a whole.",
    "HECK YEAHonly if you want to learn and put in the time to learn",
    "DS History is a great overview and mix of ancient history and political thought. The small section sizes and great professors are the strengths of this course. The reading can be tedious and long at times and usually involves more reading thanthe other 2 DS classes.",
    "A lot of historians who sound the same!",
    "This course had by far the most reading of any DS course. Nonetheless, I also think that the discussions were the most interesting. Professor Martin was a fascinating professor to take this course with because he provided essential perspective on all the readings, explaining the problems with \"great books courses\" and with turning a blind eye to the authors' prejudices because of their assumed \"greatness.\" The reading was voluminous, the paper prompts were the most difficult of any DS course, but it was worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because Professor Dale Martin offers a very interesting perspective on the material that none of the other professors could offer, and the material itself is absolutely crucial to understanding western culture of political thought.",
    "Directed Studies H\/P is a great survey course on history, politics and political philosophy. It is extremely difficult, and readings are oftentimes dull, but if you put in the effort to read the books and participate in discussions, you will get a lot off this course. I would absolutely recommend this course and D\/S as a whole to other students.",
    "Directed Studies is fantastic and Historical\/Political Thought is no exception. The first semester material may seem somewhat disjointed at points, but this is simply the nature of early historiography and political philosophy. Understanding the development of these ideas is crucial to having a serious grasp on modern politics and our world in general. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to a fellow student. There's a lot of work, but it's worth it",
    "Great program, of course. Intense, but totally manageable, and the discussions carry far out of the classroom. Incredible intellectual community."
