    "this course if very valuable because teaches hands on skills applicable to many interests and disciplines seeking to utilize geographic information systems.",
    "Question 10Dana was fantastic. He made a 3 hour lecture on a computer program interesting and engaging. He was endlessly patient, accessible and understanding. He built a class that provided the opportunity to learn but he was accommodating of and made allowances for the fact that we all had other responsibilities that sometimes got in the way without compromising our experience in the class.",
    "Dana's responsiveness to student comments (via Piazza, the online web platform, and via email) is unsurpassed. This class was excellent, and it was easy to ask questions and learn a ton about GIS. Also, Meredith Azevedo was a great teaching assistant!",
    "A great class! Even if you don't really think mapping is your thing, it's a good skill to have, and Dana is great.",
    "Explanations and analogies were clear and easy to understand, and the handouts were useful. Maybe an alphabetical index to accompany the handouts would be useful, so one could more easily locate a particular tool.",
    "I don't expect to ever be an expert in GIS. But following my summer internship, I have a much better appreciation of the drive for \"interdisciplinary\" skills. It's obvious that we need to have more and more knowledge on all sorts of topics. And the ability to create visual explanations for others can be incredibly valuable. I highly recommend that other students take one or more GIS classes... and take them with Dana. He's a fantastic teacher. He's incredibly knowledgeable and articulate.",
    "Question 9. the instructor was responsive to the questions of the students but he is sarcastic in his habit to answer the questions.",
    "Dana Tomlin is a fabulous professor. The assignments are very useful, and I learned a lot in this class and implemented the learning right away in other courses and projects. I'm so glad I took this class- I think it's one of the best FES offers."

    "exercises though time consuming",

He really makes an effort to explain in the simplest of manners.The homework's really ties the material covered in class together.The TA was able to explain everything in a clear manner and provided you with great guidance to do the homework's and the final project.I was really happy with the peer-based grading system. Besides allowing you to see how your classmates work, it encourages you to do better.",
    "I liked the variety of assignments, which allowed for an opportunity to learn basics of GIS and to have some fun, but also were clearly applicable to real problems you might face\/questions you might answer as a GIS user.",

   "comments": [
    "Some of the lectures were slow \/ too much time to get into the actual material in class",
    "I did not feel like I got appropriate amounts of feedback about my work. When you're expected to send 6 hours a week on your assignments (and sometimes more), it would be nice to have some kind of feedback. In this semester, which the professor said was experimental, students gave each other feedback for the first few assignments. Then we stopped getting feedback even from each other. We were instructed to look at the work of our peers to \"see where we stand\" in the course. Direct questions about how we were progressing in the course were ignored and again we were told to just look at the work of our peers.I did not like this at all. It was one thing to have the blind leading the blind and having us give each other comments, but by fall break we were receiving no comments at all. It really seemed like the professor was just trying to get out of the work of grading our assignments. Perhaps there are simply too many students between the Yale and Penn students in the same course, but then why take on so many students? Or, if you really want to teach this many students, use your TAs. Have them help give comments but do SOMETHING so that students can get feedback on their work. If you expect your students to work for so many hours a week, the least you can do is tell them something about the quality of their work.I honestly can't tell where I stand in the course now. I have no idea. The only grade in the entire course is a final project. This is extremely stressful and completely unnecessary. In a separate issue, the professor really liked to spring assignments on students that weren't in the syllabus and announced them much too late for students to plan around their other coursework. This included assignments that were due over academic breaks and assigned after many students had already left town. I was going to take the raster course in the spring but there is no way that I'm putting myself through so much work and stress for such a low return again. It really felt like Tomlin did not respect his students at all.",
    "The pace of each lesson could be picked up a bit.",
    "Grading needs to be figured out and transparent. It's fine if everything is based on the final project, but if that is the case, Dana should provide feedback on every assignment as a matter of course.It's frustrating using so many different platforms for the class. We had to use a non-yale gmail account, use drive, V2 was not used, then there piazza for questions and resources. I was just very confusing. I understand if you can't use V2 because you want to integrate the classes, but whatever the solution, it should be better integrated",
    "A little more feedback on weekly assignments would have been helpful. Even though I was able to compare my work to that of my peers, sometimes I wondered if I was missing something obvious, or if what I actually did was done in the most efficient way possible.",
    "This class needs more TAs.",
    "There is focus on one software, ArcGIS and not the concept of GIS in particular given the numerous software available in the market. I feel that it may have been helpful to show situations where each of the skills and features will have been helpful first and not the other way around.This was not in any way introductory GIS.",
    "None that i can think of.",
    "I think having a little more feedback on the homework would have been helpful.",
    "Requires more teaching assistances and group lab schedules to allow students to work together but independently.",
    "I'm not sure how it could be improved. Dana's set it up so that it runs like clockwork and he provides fantastic guidance. My only preference would be for two 1.5 hr classes per week, but that's not about to happen... and it would still be great for others to take his class.",
    "Grading system must consider weekly assignments. Rather focus on final project.",
    "although instructor is trying to test different ways of grading the students i think grading only the final assignment is not adequate. grades should be based on the weekly assignments and also the final project and only on the final project.",
    "Having absolutely no feedback from the professor for the whole year makes it hard for you to know how are you doing.",
    "I do wish that we had a bit more feedback on individual assignments from Dana. I liked how the course was set up with us evaluating each other's work and learning from what others did (more realistic than usual course setup), but would have been good to get some more insights from the professional's eye.",
    "The grading system was a disaster and was continually in flux. Additionally, the inclusion of an arbitrary early deadline for the final homework as a personal joke was not amusing.",
    "I don't think anything!"

That could be a problem.My goal was not to become an expert.
