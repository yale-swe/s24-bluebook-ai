    "Overall great class. Prof Scott Morton is incredibly knowledgeable. Definitely a class where you get out what you put in. The homework assignments were a bit annoying - there were four psets on 'R' which I had never used before. Other than that, a fair midterm and final and an AWESOME final project on a relevant antitrust case. Would recommend!",
    "This is an excellent course on anticompetitive behavior, something that will never be taught at Yale College."
