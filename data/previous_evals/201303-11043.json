    "Juliana Ramos-Ruano is a great teacher. The class can be difficult for non-language oriented learners, but doable. I learned more in this semester than in three years of high school Spanish. Take it!",
    "It is an introduction to Spanish\u00e2\u0080\u0094 time consuming, but not terribly difficult.",
    "Absolutely -- it's fun and engaging. And you'll learn basic spanish very quickly.",
    "Spanish 110 is a straightforward introductory language class. You'll definitely be challenged throughout the year, but that isn't always a bad thing. Make sure to stay on top of the homework and study for the quizzes. Juliana is a great teacher who is always willing to help students if they're having trouble understanding anything. I enjoyed my time in the class and would definitely recommend it to another student. If you have to take a language, this is not the worst way to go.",
    "Take the class and take it early in your time at Yale. You'll be encouraged to take more Spanish!",
    "Don't be afraid of taking it, and don't think you're lazy for choosing Spanish. There's plenty of work, but you will learn an awful lot of material in just a semester, and it will be genuinely applicable to life if you want it to be. In addition, absolutely take it with Prof. Ramos-Ruano. She's incredible - a little intimidating at first, because it's fast-paced and she uses Spanish from the start, but it takes little time to get used to it, she's incredibly helpful, and she genuinely cares about making you a good student and helping you learn. Take time to talk to her - it'll help you improve a lot, and she's great fun."
