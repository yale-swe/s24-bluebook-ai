   "comments": [
    "My aim for this semester was to become a more confident and comfortable writer, making sure to improve upon some of the mistakes I've been known to make over the past years that I've been academically writing. I really wanted to write critically and have the ability to read and analyze texts critically. I feel that I've been able to attain at least parts of those goals. I'm definitely a more confident writer and my ideas flow on paper a lot better now due to this course. I also enjoy reading texts and gather meaning and am able to analyze them.",
    "I learned a ton about how writers employ subtle structural techniques to make a point or voice an opinion.",
    "I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. I also learned a lot of the tricks that good writers employ to write persuasively, when they use it, and why they're effective. As for knowing how to incorporate them into my own writing, that's still something I'm working on!",
    "The ability to identify WHY a certain piece of writing was breathtaking for me as a reader, and then the ability to incorporate those strategies into my own writing.",
    "I developed a better sense of what to look for when reading modern essays, which I really felt that I lacked going into this course. This class taught me to be more sensitive to how I structured my argument, what was persuasive, and what will convince my audience.",
    "Definitely improved my reading and writing--how to use various writing subtle strategies to be more persuasive! As a course on cultural narratives, this course also taught me to recognize and question accepted ideas we have about society (eg GMOs); we read a lot of pieces that genuinely added nuance to my views of the world and made me reconsider views that I previously took for granted.",
    "I developed a knowledge of how to effectively challenge cultural narratives through writing in a tailored and subtle fashion.",
    "I learned that good writing is a skill, not something that you're necessarily born with. I learned that the placement of each word in a sentence matters and that grammar&rhetorical strategies are absolutely INTEGRAL rather than tangential to the meaning of the words. Structure can show meaning sometimes more powerfully than content. I learned how to read more for strategy."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the small class sizes, the selection of readings, the workshops, the extensive instructor feedback at any point in the course, and the intimacy in the class Weakness: None that I can think of",
    "This course is incredible. Honestly, I have no complaints.",
    "Great course! Prompts give you a lot of freedom to discuss whatever you are interested in.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings we had for this course. They really helped me understand what a cultural critique is, and how to engage in it myself. The only problem I had with the selection was that it was difficult to see how precisely the persuasive techniques worked, since (in cases where there was an overt point) I was usually in agreement with the premise of the essay before it was even made.",
    "A really fantastic class. Our class was fantastic in terms of the discussions, although sometimes I felt that they weren't very structured. A few times, I wasn't sure what we were getting at, because we were all just pointing out interesting tidbits of the essays that stood out. Sometimes also a little disorganizedwe didn't get a chance to discuss all of the readings. A strength and a weakness of the coursewhen Professor Shirkhani reads papers, I feel that sometimes she compares them to a Platonic ideal of a paper on the same topic. The problem is that she is not working so much with improving my individual paper, as telling me how a paper ideally on the topic should look.",
    "So many strengths--all the readings, genuinely good and productive class discussions, good (if difficult) writing assignments. The biggest strength was hands down Shirkhani. Loved her!! She was always willing to meet and gave the most in-depth comments for our essays. She lit up our discussion sections. She pushed us. She gave me the most insightful suggestions for my essays; my conversations with her were always so interesting and helpful. That said, Shirkhani could have been clearer about writing assignments. I was sometimes confused about expectations. But overall, strengths far outweighed weaknesses.",
    "The readings are really great, and the exercises assigned before papers really help you to start writing in the desired style. I think sometimes feedback could be a little clearer, and the links between the writing we study and the writing we do ourselves could be strengthened.",
    "Strengths: engaging, fascinating, phenomenal syllabus and teacher who gives us actual lessons on the whiteboard on how to improve w regards to bigger picture writing techniques Weaknesses: many readings\/\/would have been better maybe if had slightly less so we could focus on a smaller number per week."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Professor Shirkhani is one of the best professors I have had the fortune to have at Yale (I'm not even an English major - in fact, only a few in my class of 12 were actually majoring in English). She is super SUPER helpful, and I often felt bad that she was staying well into the late afternoon to talk to her students to help them improve their writing. The pieces that we read for class, for the most part, are amazing and they really helped me in the writing process because we learn the techniques and conventions used in the pieces as we go along. I definitely recommend this class or any 120\/121 class for anyone who is looking to improve writing!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It shows you how to use personal experiences and evidence to appeal to a general audience. This, if you think about it, is incredibly powerful.",
    "Yes! Great class to help improve your writing skills both in general and specifically in the context of cultural critique. Note that this class is not about writing research papers for specialists, but for writing essays for a general audience.",
    "I took this course as a non English major. As someone who doesn't usually think about the topics addressed in this course, or about events and happenings in my life from the perspective of a writer, I felt like I was constantly playing a game of ideological catch up. If you are like me, it takes up a lot more time than you may expect! But if you are ready to put in the time and effort, you'll get a lot out of the course.",
    "Yes. This has been the best class of my life-- I have grown so much as a writer!!",
    "If you enjoyed 120, you'll enjoy this class. The readings were interesting, discussion was engaging and fun, and the assignments pushed me as a writer.",
    "Absolutely! Knowing what to look for when reading essayshow the author crafts an argument and uses style to support itis an ability that can be applied practically everywhere.",
    "YES, absolutely recommend. Expect to put a great deal of thought into class, but you'll be glad you did.",
    "Yes! This course is a great way to improve your writing and very valuable for non-English majors.",
    "Yes-your writing will improve. But you have to be willing to the readings fairly thoroughly to get a handle on the techniques"
