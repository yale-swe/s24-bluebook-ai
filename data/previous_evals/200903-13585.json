    "The class size is reasonably large, but the classroom is too small.",

    "This course in tropical ecology is rather theoritical than practical. We would have great if we have had a field trip to a tropical country so that to grasp hands-on experience on this course.",
    "Questions 1&7: The Instructor and the TA of the Course were very efficient in providing us with materials as well as ensuring that we interact with those materials. The course was delivered with great enthusiasm.",
    "Question 5: Professor was eager to engage in students questions and was very responsive. I'll look forward to her seminar classes.",
    "(2) Sometimes I found things Florencia would say to be contradictory, and her explanations were not very clear.(3) I don't feel like the paper and presentation really helped me understand more about tropical forests. Maybe another kind of assignment would have been better.(4) Compared to other classes I was taking this fall, this course had less reading and fewer weekly assignments, though it was back-end heavy with a presentation and paper.(7) I didn't call upon Alvaro for help on many occasions, but his pre-midterm help session was very informative and he had a great attitude throughout the class.",

    "I had a background in Biology, and this course serves as a refresher towards the work that I am going to do in Indonesia.",

    "This course fits perfectly with my program in forestry, and moreover my interest in tropical forestry.",
    "One of my main areas of focus is restoration ecology and this course has provided a good foundation. I deem it a necessary and ideal course for all natural resource practitioners who work or intend to work in the tropics.",
    "Prior to this course, i had very brief interaction with a \"formal\" course in Tropical Forest Ecology. Much of what i knew about the tropical forests was based on my first hand experience having been born and raised and also now working in the tropics including projects in the forests. I always felt the need to learn a bit more of the formal science of \"forests\". Now i think i have just succeeded in doing that. In that connection , the materials and learning i acquired through this course i believe, will help me view the forest from a much detailed angle and will also help me in my management decisions",

    "My interest is primarily in development which is concentrated in countries in tropical regions of the world. Conservation is closely linked to development and the two must be considered together. Learning about the ecology of tropical forests is essential to understanding the implications of activities that affect them and I took this course to gain such a foundation of tropical forest ecology knowledge.",

    "Yes",
    "it fell short. I was expecting to learn much more about forest ecology.",
    "Course was a little slow and more built like an undergrad course rather than a graduate one. I Still enjoyed it though.",
    "It was a little too basic for me.",
    "The course partly lived up my expectations as I got additional theoritical knowledge about the ecology of the tropical forests.",
    "Yes. To a large extent.",
    "Very much.",
    "no",
    "yeah, like I said though, it would be very helpful to see and touch a tropical forest while learning about it",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes and no--I don't think the teaching method inspired me to work extra hard in the course, but I could have had more drive on my own and I think that I would have learned more in that case.",
    "In general, no.The professor relied too heavily on Powerpoint slides that were full of photos and illustrations at the expense of substantive content. The course often seemed more like a survey of issues in tropical forests rather than the ecology of tropical forests. More focus should have been placed on what is known about the ecology of tropical forests as a whole, for example, nutrient cycling, energy flows, broad ecological relationships that have been deduced from numerous studies, so that the students could finish the course capable of describing the broad features of tropical forest ecosystems and also how tropical forest ecosystems are different from other forest ecosystems. While we did touch on strictly ecological topics such as nutrient cycling and the light environment, there was little integration of these important themes throughout the rest of the course. They were treated as interesting sub-topics, not as fundamental elements of the system to tie together our understanding of the whole.We spent time on topics that were interesting but not really relevant in an ecology course, for example, payments for ecosystem services and non-timber forest products.I also expected to leave the course with more specific knowledge of the most common plant taxa of tropical forest ecosystems. While names of common taxa were sprinkled throughout various lectures, an early lecture solely on this topic would have been more appropriate. This could be one of the uniting themes of a tropical forest ecology course, allowing students to predict what might be found in a given scenario based on a lecture early in the semester. Providing materials on common taxa organized by region and asking that we do some memorizing is okay!! We're not above such things. That's the kind of global perspective we need to get in the only tropical forest ecology course we're going to take at FES.More of the optional readings should have been made required. These were the more substantive readings that filled out the textbook material.",
