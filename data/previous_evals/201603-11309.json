   "comments": [
    "I learned quite a lot about the nature of vector borne diseases and the way in which the immune system functions. I also learned to try and integrate my knowledge to comprehend the issues at hand.",
    "I was exposed to reading scientific papers and learned a lot about applied biology. I also now know more about ticks and mosquitos than I ever really wanted to, but I got a thorough scientific perspective about the risks and challenges of treating malaria.",
    "This class introduces advanced biology concepts in an easy-to-digest and informative manner. It's a great window into a major subset of infectious diseases.",
    "In this course I learned about the immune system and how do do scientific literature research",
    "I learned much more about vector-transmitted diseases. The class also provides a very good introduction to basic immunology - probably in as much depth as you would cover in an AP Bio high school course.",
    "I started this class with no real knowledge of science besides the very basics of what was taught in high school. This class has made me scientifically literate, and while it was a struggle, I am glad to have gone outside of my comfort zone.",
    "Before taking this class I thought there wasn't that much to know about mosquitoes and vector-borne diseases but I was completely wrong! I have learned more in this class than in any other class I've taken at Yale. Professor Belperron does a remarkable job at structuring the class in a logical way that makes the information, which at times is quite challenging, make sense and be useful, as opposed to just rote memorization. I have learned about a wide range of topics related to malaria and other vector-borne diseases, including the life-cycle of different strains of mosquitoes and ticks, the role and function of the immune system and how parasites interfere with the body's immunity. I have become a much better test-taker and am able to think more critically about questions and my answers.",
    "A strong knowledge foundation in pathology, epidemiology, and immunology, particularly in relation to vector borne diseases which are relevant in the modern era.",
    "While this was just a science credit, I felt that it was a strong science class that actually taught me how to think like a scientist without getting formulaic. I learned about vector borne diseases and interventions that can prevent public health epidemics.",
    "i hate this class",
    "I learned about vector-borne disease biology, immune responses, disease prevention measures.",
    "The class allowed me to learn more about Malaria and other vector borne diseases and kill some previous misconceptions regarding the topics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the first half of the course was very engaging and exciting. I don't feel like I learned as much from the second half because I thought it was a little too technical and we did not spend as much time comprehending the different interventions. I would have liked a more general scope of focus much like we had in investigating the immune system.",
    "I thought that many of the assessments were too distant from the information we covered in class. I thought that the lectures were pretty well-structured, but went far more in depth than was maybe necessary. The panel discussion and paper project was manageable, but I struggled with studying because the questions were so difficult compared to the facts introduced in lecture. As this course is targeted to humanities majors, I think that the tests were unnecessarily frustrating.",
    "This is one of the best-structured and most thoughtfully organized classes I've taken at Yale. Evaluations are fair and do a great job of encouraging real learning rather than rote memorization. Class lectures are informative without being overwhelming, and offer plenty of opportunity for student engagement. The material is fascinating, and Professor Belperron is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.",
    "The class size was perfect for regular feedback from the instuctor",
    "This course is pretty funneled down to a pretty small topic, but it could seem overwhelming just because there is so much to know. This class could be improved with a bit more emphasis on science basics, at least at the beginning. However, I think that it really made me think scientifically, which is something I was not used to and had to grow into.",
    "Strengths: Prof Belperron's organised and engaging style of teaching. The concepts and material are challenging but manageable. Varied assessments so if you're not great at taking exams there are other opportunities (i.e. presentations and a research paper) to do well. Because the grading is curved the assessments aren't totally demoralizing. Weaknesses: The readings assigned weren't that interesting and possibly too technical and inaccessible.",
    "The strengths are that you learn a lot and are challenged to push yourself to actually learn a lot of substantial material. A weakness in that it would be nice to have more opportunities to get out of the classroom and have some more hand on experiences. It would have been cool to watch some films, meet with outer scientists, or go to a lab and have some alternative opportunities to learn.",
    "she was so boring i wanted to die",
    "While this course claims to be for non-science majors, the majority of the class was secretly pre-med and therefore the learning curve was very steep. Moreover, most of the knowledge that is prior assumed is not explicitly stated so it is very hard to catch up. When students are struggling, Professor Belperron is not helpful and suggests that they simply attempt to think as she would. This was my most frustrating class and while the topic is interesting to me the way it was taught made me dread going to class and apprehensive, despite spending hours studying.",
    "The weakness of the course is that the readings are science papers and if students are not used to it, it may be difficult.",
    "I liked this course a lot. The material was really well taught, the class was well organized, the instructor is nice and helpful and very knowledgeable. I like how there were lots of assignments, which gave you lots of changes. The group work was fun. The coverage of the material was good. Really I can't think of any criticisms."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you have a genuine interest in biology and are willing to put in work.",
    "If you need a science credit, it's pretty interesting and there isn't a lot of homework each day. But when it comes to the assessments, you'll freak out and spend four hours studying and still be confused by much of the material and when you get to the test, the things that you learned will be only tangentially helpful.",
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough. As someone with a minimal science background but an interest in the field, this was a fantastic way to fulfill my distributional requirements without overwhelming myself, and it really taught me a lot. Professor Belperron is incredibly kind, thoughtful and knowledgeable. This class will not just teach you lots of fascinating information about vector-borne diseases and health crises around the world, it will also train you to think critically about public health and the way science is presented in the media. I've taken both of Professor Belperron's classes and they were without a doubt my favourite two classes at Yale. Frankly, I'd sign up for a class on bricklaying if she was teaching it -- it's just an added bonus that the material in this class is so interesting and significant.",
    "This is a great science credit. It is really interesting, and by no means a \"gut,\" but if you put the work in it is quite manageable",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly for anyone who is looking for a science credit. The subject material is interesting, Professor Belperron is very dedicated to her students, and the workload is manageable.",
    "I found this class to be incredibly difficult. I have no scientific background whatsoever, and really struggled to understand the topic. Professor Belperron is really helpful when you talk to her one on one, so I would definitely recommend going to office hours or sending her emails (I would send her at least one a week with questions, and multiple on the night before a quiz -- she would always answer promptly). Only take this class if you really want to be challenged in science. As a non-science major, I wasn't really planning for that. Now that the class is over, I'm glad I took it and I feel like I have a lot of useful knowledge however, if given the choice again, I would not take this class. NOT a gut, and definitely difficult even though it is a science class for non-science majors.",
    "Absolutely YES, take this class you will not regret it!!!! This is not an easy science credit but if you want to actually finish the semester having learned something interesting and useful, take Professor Belperron's class. Every class was highly engaging and Professor Belperron's style of teaching is both entertaining and extremely informative. You'll learn so much more than you thought was possible and you'll remember the information well after you take the mid-term. The assessments were actually really enjoyable to study for and I loved writing my research paper (words I've never said before). TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN GET IN!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to get something real out of your science credit. It's definitely not an easy A, but if you put in work you will be fine.",
    "do not take this",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is pre-med and interested in the specifics of vector-borne disease pathology. I would definitely not recommend this course to a non-science major--you will not have the required biology background and will struggle.",
    "Yes!"
