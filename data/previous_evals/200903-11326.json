    "TAKE THIS CLASS, whether you like Shakespeare or not.",
    "You read most of the histories and tragedies. The reading is great, the lectures are great - if you like Shakespeare, there's no reason not to take this class. Take it after comedies and romances, though, because Manley's lectures are a let-down after Kastan's.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Take it. You read a lot of plays, but its a great class.",
    "Great lecture course - even if you're not an English major, Prof. Kastan will convince you why it's essential to read Shakespeare, and you'll understand a little better why we read all those boring plays in middle school. If you are an English major, the class is SO helpful in terms of reading and thinking about Elizabethan drama and all literature.",
    "This class provides an excellent overview of a number of Shakespeare plays, including some that are rarely studied in college lecture courses. Kastan's lectures are entertaining and insightful; Kastan himself is very friendly and accessible. He seems to enjoy lecturing.I'd recommend the class if you are looking for some low-stress exposure to Shakespeare. If you're expecting to experience life-changing personal insights and close interrogation of Shakespeare's master works, then take a seminar. The lecture format makes it easy to sit back and accept Kastan's interpretation of the play. The section is also enjoyable but low-pressure. Sometimes this is frustrating; sometimes this is just fine.",
    "A phenomenal course. Kastan is very funny and engaging in lectures. Essential for anybody who needs to read Shakespeare, i.e. anybody who speaks English.",
    "Definitely shop it. If you are interested in Shakespeare at all, take the class. Kastan is great.",
    "Definitly take this class.",
    "Fantastic lectures and of course great reading list (many of the Shakespeare \"greats\"). Brings some attention to the historical perspective to reading Shakespeare beyond strict textual analysis of most English classes. Encourages developing close reading skills with assignments like manic glossing.",
    "English 201 is a good course if you are extremely interested in Shakespeare and will not get bored reading history after history.",
    "Definitely worth taking--not just an English major, but for anyone who wants to learn about Shakespeare. Prof. Kasten's lecture are always interesting and informative, and you get to read some of the most important works of English literature ever written.",
    "If you're an English major, you should take this course, or one like it. It's nice to get a feel for Shakespeare in general, and to feel justified when you act like you understood that reference to Falstaff that the others are laughing at. And Kastan's definitely the guy to take Histories and Tragedies from; he almost always succeeds in making them interesting in ways you didn't think they were.",
    "Kastan's a great lecturer, and makes working your way through that pre-1800 requirement a little more bearable.",
    "If you like Shakespeare. A lot. The class covers one, if not two, plays a week. The writing assignments are manageable, though: a close reading exercise, a short paper, a long paper, and a take-home final. Professor Kastan is engaging and brilliant, although if Shakespeare isn't your thing, it will become hard to pay attention past the first couple of weeks.",
    "Great course, you get to read all the best tragedies and histories of Shakespeare. Kastan is great, an amazing and witty lecturer. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, his lectures will make you like them.",
    "This is a great course for students who want to gain an appreciation of Shakespeare and read a lot of his plays. Professor Kastan is an engaging and funny lecturer who helped students really understand what each play was about. The workload of one play per week, plus a research assignment, two relatively short papers, and a take-home final, was manageable, but appreciating the plays required very close reading of the text. The class is friendly to non-English majors who are interested in reading and discussing Shakespeare. I heartily recommend it.",
    "A great Shakespeare course to introduce you to a lot of plays, both popular ones and more obscure ones. Kastan is an amazing lecturer - he is funny, knowledgeable, and personable. It is a fair amount of reading if you choose to read all the plays, but you can get by skipping some since you get to choose your essay questions and there is a take-home final. Take this course!",
    "Brilliant class. Take it. Even if you can't read all of the plays (I imagine few people in the class manage it), you will get an insane amount out of listening to Kastan talk about Shakespeare twice a week.",
    "If you take this class, you'll never want to skip lecture. Professor Kastan is clever and engaging, and always has an unexpected take on a play that really gets you thinking. I'd definitely recommend this course, even to non-English-majors.",
    "Definitely. Good class. Kastan is a terrific lecturer.",
    "A MUST take if you have ever flirted with the idea of reading shakespeare or if you have already read a dozen works by the bard.",
    "It is a lecture-based overview of most of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. I would recommend it because it's a great way to read all of the major plays.",
    "Yes. If you like Shakespeare or want to read Shakespeare because you feel like you should, take it. The lectures are great, which is not always the case with Shakespeare lectures. Professor Kastan is incredible. s",
    "It's a great class for English majors and non-majors. Some of Shakespeare's most famous works in a new context, some that you probably wouldn't read on your own, and a couple that are just plain obscure. The lectures are well worth the time, the workload is very reasonable.",
    "English 201 involves a lot of reading -- the pace is about a play a week. That being said, if you don't do all the reading, it's not the end of the world. Professor Kastan makes the lectures informative enough that you can grasp the plays without necessarily having done all the reading, and the lectures are incredibly interesting. The weekly sections are manageable, as well, and it's very easy to participate.",
    "This is an excellent course to become familiar with Shakespeare's histories and tragedies, and I would highly recommend it. You will gain a new appreciation and understanding for Shakespeare and how he wrote, and the course will change the way you think about his writing.",
    "For anyone even mildly interested in Shakespeare. A must-take for the lectures alone.",
    "Kastan is an amazing lecturer. It's very easy to allow teachings of Shakespeare to become incredibly banal, but Kastan makes this author extremely relevant. His lectures are extremely compelling. The class work isn't bad- 1-2 plays a week, 3 papers, and 1 final. Would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you want to read Shakespeare (and c'mon, you want to!) this is a fun, interesting lecture. Sure, the histories are not as great as hamlet\/lear\/macbeth, but Kastan makes everything pretty great.",
    "Great class. Professor Kastan is phenomenal. He is brilliant, funny, witty and makes every single play exciting and interesting. The paper assignments, however, were quite irritating because they give you very specific topics that you are expected to stick to\/cant really come up with your own. But lectures were fantastic! Take it!",
    "This is an amazing lecture and i would recommend it to anyone. I was in love with Shakespeare before this class, and I am now in love with Kastan. JUST TAKE IT. Definitely shop it if nothing else. He's shopping period lectures are hilarious.",
    "Definitely. Kastan is fabulous - he definitely offered me a new perspective on the plays that I had already read, and great insights into the ones I was reading for the first time. I also lucked out with a good TA, so section discussions were also worthwhile. Reading a play a week doesn't really allow you to spend the time on each that it deserves, but otherwise the workload is manageable. I mean, you can't go through Yale without taking a Shakespeare course, and this is probably one of the best that you can find.",
    "An enjoyable introduction to Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. Professor Kastan is caring, passionate, and an engaging lecturer. His assignments are valuable learning opportunities.The take-home final can be stressful if you have not kept up with the reading.",
    "yes. These are the best of Shakespeare's plays and Professor Kastan is the best person to guide you through them.",
    "Yes yes yes yes! Take this class! Kastan's lectures are peerless. He's simultaneously hysterical and brilliant. You'll learn so much and laugh the whole time.",
    "If you love Shakespeare, you'll be interested in the class. Not necessarily informative, though. And beware Kastan's over-simplicifications and paradoxes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend thisclass, it will enrich your knowledge of Shakespeare faster and more concisely than anything else you could take at Yale.",
    "Take it. You know shakespeare is awesome and these are plays people should read and read better than they may have in High School. Not to say you weren't a good reader in High School. I would never suggest such a thing. But there is a difference and Kastan's readings are usually engaging and very entertaining.",
    "If David Kastan is still teaching it, I would definitely recommend it! Shakespeare is a pleasure to read anyway, and Kastan really makes it entertaining. Assignments were fair, work load was bearable, lectures were great. Definitely my favorite class this semester.",
    "You read a history or tragedy play a week, enjoy Kastan's excellent lecturing abilities, and write a few papers over the course of the semester. Definitely worth it.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses at Yale so far. Histories and Tragedies was an amazing class. Professor Kastan's passion and expertise were evident in each lecture. I was truly enriched by the experience and would highly recommend the class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it! The plays are wonderful and Kastan makes it fun.",
    "Great class to read good lit. Take it Credit\/D\/F.",
    "A great opportunity to read these plays with a great guide. Professor Kastan is a top-grade lecturer and very interested in getting to know his students.Reading a play every week is difficult to keep up with.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who would like to read more Shakespeare in a fast-paced, interesting, and even fun setting. Professor Kastan is a wonderful lecturer and seems to always be aiming to achieve the best course possible for his students, and in that regard, I would say he is at least partially effective. The reading for the class is not crushing- a play a week- but we covered a lot of material despite this, and I now feel as though my appreciation for and understanding of Shakespeare is much increased from the start of the semester.",
    "TAKE IT. DAVID KASTAN IS WONDERFUL AND SHAKESPEARE IS ALSO WONDERFUL.Seriously though.",
    "It's a joyous romp (ironically enough) through Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. Kastan is obnoxiously charming, to such an extent that he can sometimes barely lecture \u0096 he is so busy making jokes about the T.A's and about his reticent, video game-playing children. It's like watching TV; you are constantly entertained, chuckling and writing down his best quips. Other days, he really hits home runs. Henry V is a fabulous lecture, as are both Lear lectures. Even on his bad days, you get a great sense for the plays as they existed in their day, and how they exist now: how people feel about them, what they stand for. The reading list is to die for.",
    "It's a good way to get one of three English major 1800 requirements done. It's also very interesting. And what's life if you never do any Shakespeare?",
    "It's great. Kastan is an engaging, interesting lecturer, and you won't be bored in class. Section isn't super interesting, but I suppose it could be with a great TA. The weekly workload is usually only one play a week, maybe a reading response of<1pg, so it's definitely manageable. 2 papers, one kind of make-work assignment, and a fairly easy take-home final. It's definitely worth it.",
    "Best class I've taken, and will probably ever take, at Yale. Period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in Shakespeare, whether or not they have an English background.",
    "This course covers most of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. The reading is one or two plays a week, which is manageable. Prof. Kastan's lectures are excellent, and you'll feel bad if you skip them. I'd recommend the class just for the reading list, but you'll learn a lot from the professor and from the assignments too.",
    "Shakespeare\u0092s writing. Kastan\u0092s lectures. What\u0092s not to like? This was my favorite course of the year, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who enjoys Shakespeare. The material is about as good as it comes\u0097Shakespeare\u0092s histories and tragedies provide an endless fountain of great ideas and debates. Professor Kastan\u0092s lectures are usually very good, and I have not spoken with anybody who did not like his TA. One play a week is definitely manageable, and reading these plays in a canon with each other is an experience I think everybody should have.",
    "ENGL 201 is a survey course meant to introduce students to Shakespeare's Histories and Tragedies. I definitely recommend this class, if only for Prof. Kastan's brilliant lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is a really fun and engaging way to learn about Shakespeare. And Professor Kastan is really great -- extremely funny and very passionate about what he's teaching.",
    "Yes! Great reading, and not too heavy of a workload--one play a week and two essays, a take home, one shorter assignment.",
    "I would totally recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but I would attend a few lectures first before making a decision. Kastan is great, but I am not sure he would work for everyone.",
    "The class is a great way to get an overview of Shakespeare's Histories and Tragedies. I would recommend the class.",
    "Yes, take the class. Lectures are awesome.",
    "English 201 is a fantastic Shakespeare survey course. We engage closely with the text and get to listen to two amazing lectures each week. Definitely take this course if you are interested in Shakespeare, even if you've read many of the plays, because Professor Kastan is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "Take this class.",
    "Straightforward survey of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies; excellent with Prof. Kastan, even though you might end up disagreeing with his readings of the plays. Point is he delivers his lectures convincingly and makes you engage with the material.",
    "This was a great class--one of my favorite at Yale thus far. The papers aren't difficult if you've dealt with Shakespeare before and don't mind close reading. Some of the plays weren't the greatest, but Professor Kastan is a fantastic lecturer. Take this class and plan on going, even though you probably don't have to.",
    "An excellent survey of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. Professor Kastan's lectures are always engaging, often brilliant. Because it is a survey course, don't expect to delve too deeply into any of the plays, but it is a great introduction.",
    "English 201 is a great survey of some of Shakespeare's best. Lectures are engaging and interesting, and the syllabus is full of must-reads that you'll be glad to have illuminated by the wonderful Professor Kastan."
