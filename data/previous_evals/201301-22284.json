   "comments": [
    "You get from it what you want.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I took this class on a whim, and it ended up making my semester. Howard Stern is a secular mystic, and the curmudgeonly facade dissolves after a while to reveal a very funny, generous man. The grading is by no means easy-- I suspect this will be my lowest grade this semester-- but it's honest, which is a rarity these days.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have yet taken. Regardless of how much experience you have had with poetry, this course will deepen your understanding and enhance your appreciation of the field. Besides, Dr. Stern is as insightful as he is entertaining in class, so I would recommend this class to anyone!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a lot of work at all, but it's also very frustrating because Stern is crazy.",
    "Amazing course. Classes are mostly lecture-style - but that's no problem: Professor Stern is brilliant and a pleasure to listen to. The workload is very much in your hands as a student; there are two papers for the entire term, but there's no \"test\" to make sure that you've been keeping up with the reading (though the packet of poems is very carefully compiled, and I'd recommend it!).",
    "In terms of workload, this class is the golden gut. However, the grading is not so generous.",
    "Howard Stern is a real intellectual. He is very smart and will present some wonderful poetic insights during class.That said, he's also a real jerk sometimes. He is usually quite nice in person, but he writes unnecessarily mean comments on papers. His comments are short on constructive criticism and filled with jabs at your ability as an intellectual and a writer. He often discusses how he wants papers written in plain English, and, indeed, he will call a paper written in typical academic fashion to be \"over-written.\" Still, an essay written in plain English is considered bad writing. It can be hard to find the strike zone with these papers, particularly since there are only two. That said, although the comments can be harsh, the grading itself is fairly lenient. Also, although needlessly harsh, his comments usually ring true.I think that my ability to write and think about poetry improved a lot during the semester, but not as much as they could have. It's hard to feel motivated to produce good work for someone who appears to be supportive of the class's thoughts and appears to single you out as the student who cannot write about poetry. Upon closer inspection, however, it seems that many students feel this way. It can be hard to spend the semester wondering whether you are the single student who just \"doesn't get it.\" I would absolutely, definitely, 100% recommend this class but be sure to speak with your classmates outside of class. It will help keep up your own morale as you try to learn how to think about poetry.",
    "I would recommend this course with the caveat that you need to enjoy listening to Professor Stern talk. There is a fair amount of discussion, but I would say that he lectures at least half the time. I personally enjoyed this, as I think Professor Stern has a lot of interesting things to say, but you may not. I certainly learned to see poetry in a different light; Stern also has amusing things to say about life in general. The workload, which consists only of two papers (one midterm and one final), in addition to poetry reading for each class, is manageable. Overall a worthwhile experience, although perhaps in a way that differs from other courses I liked.",
    "This class is a gem.",
    "Only take it if you are going to take it seriously. The group of kids just didn't, so it was seriously depressing. But the poems are wonderful and Stern's lectures are very good. The papers were challenging and fun.",
    "Yes. This class is not hard. Not alot of work at all. Little bit of poetry reading. Maybe 1-2 a week so you are prepared for class. Don't even have to do that if you don't want to. We have 2 classes a week. One is lecture based where Stern reads the poem aloud and then discusses his thoughts on it. The other is discussion based where we talk about 1 or 2 poems. All classes are discussions, while Stern leads them. Very easy barely any work. 1 5 page paper and 1 7 page paper. Instead of a 7 page paper you can translate a poem or write a poem.",
    "The short answer is that this class is a technical introduction to poetry - that means studying how the form and content of poems necessitate each other. However, thanks to Professor Stern's (sometimes discursive) brilliance, the class actually exposes you to everything from Mozart to Merill and is a whirlwind tour of some of the most powerful, stunning, and important pieces of literature ever written. The class is an excellent balance of literary theory - diagetic levels, performativity, ect - and sheer poetic appreciation. I recommend this class to everyone, because everyone should learn how to read poetry the way Howard Stern reads poetry."
