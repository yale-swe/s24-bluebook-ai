   "comments": [
    "It's a moderate work load and a broad course. Very good for a focused introduction to a lot of different techniques.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a nice opportunity to hear from leading experts in cortical function from the Yale neuroscience department, and a valuable chance to critically read recent and seminal work on these topics.",
    "Overall a good course for non-first year grad students interested in a Principle's style course but with somewhat less pressure than principals. Topics will range from the molecular to heavy ephys and imaging, so at some point you'll be out of your scientific comfort zone. Discussions are stimulating and the papers are (mostly) interesting. I think this course finds a good balance between time required and rigor\/interest. Too many electives either meet barely ever and require no work but are boring\/too easy\/not stimulating, or require excessive work time but aren't actually that interesting. This class finds a good balance.",
    "yes, i learned a lot.",
    "It covers a great range of topics and therefore a wonderful range of neuro methods. You will learn things in this class that will help your career.Yes. It is a good class."

   "comments": [
    "It's helpful to know about current work in cortical neurobiology that isn't directly pertinent to my own research.",
    "The course made me integrate knowledge about multiple levels of neuroscience analysis into my high-order systems-level investigation of human cognitive functioning.",
    "I learned some interesting things about cortex I didn't know. I don't know that I learned anything that actually contributed to my own research, but it's always helpful to have practice writing critical responses and reading current lit with discussion.",
    "This improved my understanding of neuroscience topics outside my comfort zone and taught me enough about these topics to broaden my specific interests."
