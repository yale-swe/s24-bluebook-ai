    "It introduce basic and next-generation technologies in chemical biology. I highly recommend this course. It will broaden our horizons.",
    "It's all about the methodology of current chembio research. Not hard.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student as the course showed the instructors' passion for the subject.",
    "Not really a useful class for chemists unless you need it to fulfill your requirements.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. I would make sure to let him\/her know that while the class is good, be prepared to do a lot of outside reading on some of the more challenging topics as mentioned above.",
    "Chemical biology is an excellent introduction to the forefront of chemistry utilized in answering and understanding fundamental biological questions and problems. Yes I would recommend CHEM 521 to a fellow student as I believe it is a good course that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of the sciences and offers exposure to new thoughts and ideas, as well as new concepts that may not otherwise be presented in other courses.",
    "It was a very informative course that allowed us to learn various interesting topics in chemical biology. The topics were well-chosen, the course was very well organized, and the problem sets helped us understand the topics more deeply. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because he or she would learn a great deal of how chemistry is being applied to biological questions"

   "comments": [
    "It shows different biological technologies developed recently. Although it was not quite relative to organic chemistry, it attracted me a lot.",
    "The course did deepen my knowledge but has limited application to my dissertation.",
    "Not really - would have preferred a lit review style since the field itself is so new.",
    "The course provided me with a deeper understanding of the techniques used in chemical biology as well as the applications of the material learned in lectures. While much of the material in the course does not directly correlate to my dissertation research, the logical thinking processes as well as critical thinking skills learned in the course offers exposure to different areas of the sciences and may offer some insight in future research projects and\/or careers.",
    "I learned about many research techniques that were used intelligently by amazing scientists in chemical biology to find possible explanations to biological questions."
