    "This course is simultaneously an excellent literature course, and I gained an in-depth insight into Medieval poetry, prose, and drama. It also helped me develop practical knowledge in the assessment of primary texts from the Middle Ages, and the manuscripts in which they are found. It offered me a new way of examining the question and definition of \"authorship,\" and it raised many questions about the place of women in literary history that I think will remain with me for a long time. Like most English classes at Yale, it was also a great opportunity to practice my critical thinking, writing, and analytical skills. As a seminar, it also helped me further hone speaking in an academic setting, and meaningfully interacting with my peers."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided me a pretty comprehensive understanding of an era of literary history. We didn't just read the texts; we fleshed out their historical contexts, discussed their political implications, and used these considerations to draw even more from the writing. The syllabus was thorough and thoughtful. The main weakness of this course was, possibly, its size. A few more people might have added a variety of opinion that could have been helpful. And a course this interesting should have a higher attendance.",
    "The strengths of this course are many: the syllabus is unique and exciting, with many works that I'd heard of but never read and many more that I had never even heard of, all of which were challenging and rewarding to read; the seminar setting was a great opportunity to learn from my peers; the trips to the Beinecke and the Y.U.A.G. were enriching; and the assignments were varied, and the feedback helpful. One weakness, at least when I took the class, was its small class size, as conversation sometimes dwindled (though, on the other hand, the small class size also allowed for more one-on-one interactions with Professor Brantley). Another weakness was that, because the syllabus was so rich, there were a few works that I'd wished we could have spent more time discussing before moving onto the next assignment."

    "Definitely take this course, even if you have not taken any kind of course on medieval themes! I hadn't, and I cannot stress how surprising and interesting the course content was.",
    "Yes, if not for the amazing instructors than for the very eclectic and fun array of literature that students have to read.",
    "Take this class! Even if you are not an English major. There are few classes at Yale this exciting. The syllabus is unique, and the works are challenging but super rewarding. You get to interact with primary sources at the Beinecke and the YUAG, the assignments are varied and intellectually stimulating without being difficult or frustrating, and Professor Brantley is an amazing instructor. If you're at all interested in History, Art History, the Middle Ages, Women and Gender studies, representation, or, obviously, English, check this class out! It's a blast!"
