    "RLSC 243 is an enormously fruitful and fulfilling class. The philosophical and political depth and wealth of material in form of readings and lectures is more than you'll find in other classes of similar nature at Yale. Lectures with Prof. March were engaging and spellbindingly fascinating every time - throughout the entire semester. The amount of knowledge and insight you'll gain makes this class worth taking at pretty much any cost. Take it!",
    "Yes. there is a great deal of material to be learned in this class in a rather accessible way. Anyone who has had questions or thought about the intersection of religion and politics should take this course.",
    "It's difficult to assess this class. You read a lot of great thinkers (Hobbes, Locke, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Marx, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, etc.), although often their lesser works (perhaps this is to prevent it from getting to repetitive for the DS kids?). The material is always interesting and Professor March is a good lecturer. The class is not super cohesive, though. It is very much just reading a sampling of great thinkers' writings on the subject of religion. If that's what you're after, take this class.",
    "This is a great class very heavy on modern political theory from many of the great European thinkers (Macchiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau) but also some others. It reminded me a bit about DS politics, but the class itself focuses on the views of each of the thinkers with respect to religion. Reading is certainly doable (about 100 pgs\/wk) and also usually interesting. One of the main points I took away from the course was the deep role theological\/religious considerations played in formulating the political thought of different thinkers.March is a great professor and one of the best lecturers I've seen. He is also a very approachable and helpful."
