   "comments": [
    "Take this class. Even if I was having a bad day, Prof. Grigoryan's lectures would cheer me up. If you have never read Dostoevsky before (like me), or had ardently studied all of his works (like one of my friends who took the class with me), you will come away with a profound understanding of Dostoevsky's literary craft and the world of 19th century Russia that he channeled. This class changed my perspective on literature lectures.",
    "The reading can be too much if you have a heavy schedule already. The first week's reading was really interesting, and you could probably read Notes from the Underground and see if you like it. If you want to see how Dostoevsky worked similar themes through several novels and short stories, take it.",
    "The books are great, the workload isn't too much. Lectures I could take or leave.",
    "One of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. You will NEVER want to miss a lecture. Grigoryan's arguments are riveting and insightful. What's more, she's a very kind professor who's always willing to offer assistance outside of the classroom. The reading list is just excellent. The Brothers Karamazov at the end is just a fabulous dessert after a long and scrumptious banquet.That said, if you're not a \"literature person,\" the class can be a bit trying. The expectations on papers seemed high, and Dostoevsky is not an easy author to unfold. So if you're feeling unready, just CR\/D it just to see. The TF's seemed hit or miss - mine was good, others, not so much. The reading is significant and unremitting. If you fall behind, you will suffer. But don't let this get in the way of you enjoying one of the most talented and curious authors you'll ever read.",
    "Take it! It's a lot of reading and the two papers are a bit irritating but the class is great and you will learn so much. If you're interested in Dostoevsky, Russian society, Russian literature, etc. you will get a lot out of this class.",
    "Highly recommended. Dostoevsky is an amazing writer, perhaps the one who has made me think the most. Bella Grigoryan is a wonderful lecturer. The first lecture was great, and the quality did not flag at all as the weeks passed. This was my favorite class last semester. Be prepared to do a lot of very interesting reading.",
    "Absolutely, if you're willing to do a lot of reading. It occasionally gets tough to keep up with the readings - especially with The Idiot, which is a little rambling - but it's definitely worth it. If you would like to read Dostoevsky's masterpieces and don't think you'll get through them yourself \/ without someone grading you, this class is perfect.",
    "This was the best course I took this semester: Professor Grigoryan is an excellent, excellent lecturer. She is also very approachable, and she always seemed welcoming and willing to help. And the readings were great! The work load was manageable but sufficiently challenging. I learned many things not just about Dostoevsky, but also about literature and theory.",
    "It's a great class. Professor Grigoryan is excellent (go see her outside class!). The reading load is heavy, but you should expect that if you're reading Dostoevsky.",
    "Dostoevsky is one of the most significant writers. Any student should use this course to gain an appreciation of the thought of this author.",
    "Dostovesky is great, but this lecture is quite boring.I'd try the Dostoevsky seminar before going for this lecture.",
    "This course is fantastic for someone who is interested in Russian literature. The reading load is pretty consistent and can be heavy at times, but goes by quickly.The papers are heavily weighted for you grade, but you are allowed to really explore any topic you want."
