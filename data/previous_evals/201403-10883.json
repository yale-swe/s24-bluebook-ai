   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would warn him\/her it's a lot of work, but that the work pays off. Anyone who is invested in drama of any period will understand the debts that later drama owes to the medieval period after taking this class.",
    "Yes, accessible and thought-provoking reading material",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Medieval Drama was an overview of the drama of the period but did not skim over the surface. We have covered Latin and a English drama, morality plays, mystery cycles, mummings... While the reading for this course was heavier than for others, it was more than manageable. The whole class was clearly invested in these plays and the enthusiasm was catching. I really would recommend this class, as it has really filled in a lot of blanks and helped me a lot.",
    "ENGL 533 is a fairly wide sampling of Medieval Drama, with a focus on English drama. It considers dramatic texts as visual, aural, and literary productions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and instructor to other students.",
    "The class covered all of the aspects of medieval drama. If a classmate was interested in medieval literature, I would recommend it especially since it takes on a less talked about aspect of medieval literature."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very helpful for my discipline and my research.",
    "Presenting weekly written responses helped us think about conference presentation style and public speaking. I intend to incorporate the material read in this course on one of my orals list, and think the final paper might lead to a chapter of the dissertation.",
    "The course fed directly into my intended research, in more ways that I had expected. The plays were so wide-ranging that it would be difficult not to find something of interest. I was aware that some knowledge of medieval drama would be helpful but was quite surprised by how much it interested me,",
    "I had never really studied Medieval Drama before this course, and I felt that this course opened up new avenues of possible research for me as I approach the dissertation stage. It was really carefully constructed, with a natural arc to the readings that supported non-medievalists while engaging students with well-developed research interests in the Middle Ages."
