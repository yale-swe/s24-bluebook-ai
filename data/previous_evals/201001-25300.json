    "I would not recommend this course for fun. If you need to fill your language requirement then take it with Daniel.",
    "nothing great, nothing too bad",
    "Spanish 140 is an L4 language course, which is primarily important for completing the language requirement. That said, this is a very good course that teaches the material through a variety of multimedia learning tools and is quite engaging. Professor Garcia-Donoso is an excellent instructor who makes the class fun and I would definitely recommend his section. Overall, there is a lot of work because the class meets ever day, but it is, after all, teaching a foreign language.",
    "It's required; with Daniel, it's a good class.",
    "If you're taking this to fulfill a language requirement, you've got no choice. It's an excellent class, though, and it will improve your Spanish. Daniel Garcia-Donoso is an excellent professor, if he's teaching it your semester.",
    "Not too much tougher than L3",
    "It was a very rigorous course that really developed your spansih speaking fluency. It also vastly improves reading comprehension and video-viewing skills. you need to do the work but it is just slightly above an average level of work per semester. I actually enjoyed the weekly assignments as they brough back memories of high school. I would definitely recommend this course. Take it with Daniel Garcia - he's amazing.",
    "If you want to learn more Spanish, then you need to keep taking courses, and this does an adequate job (as much as you can get in a classroom, really)"
