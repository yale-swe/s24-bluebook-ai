   "comments": [
    "Lectures were, occasionally, fast-paced, but all of the material was extremely well-presented, interesting, and useful.",
    "This is a crash course. You cover a lot of material and need to put the time in to make sure you understand all the concepts. It is not easy, but is basic.",
    "Question 5: Professor Reuning-Scherer did a fantastic job of answering questions from the class. He never ignored a question or comment, and he always took time to provide a clear explanation.",
    "Stats might not be for me but the class was great",
    "The professor did his best to make very bland material interesting and engaging, and most of the time was quite successful.",
    "The professor is very smart and a great teacher.",
    "JDRS was a great instructor, but this course was about one and a half courses ahead of what I was ready for. I was completely flummoxed the whole semester. I really needed a basic basic stats course and I still do.",
    "The professor is great, but he was too fast in explaining. Overall, this is the best stats class I've taken.",
    "7) Professor Reuning-Scherer does a great job of actually making a statistics class engaging and often amusing. While some concepts could\/should be explained further (e.g. transformations), considering this was an intro course, he did a great job of keeping things moving at a good pace.",
    "There were three t\/a's for the course but I only worked with one of them.",
    "This class is an extremely helpful foundation course for any MESc. student, it was very helpful and the teacher is able to make statistics interesting.",
    "JDRS is a very wonderful, knowledgable, dynamic, and entertaining professor. He puts so much time and energy into creating notes and giving lectures. He makes the class fun and exciting, and for a stats class, he is a godsend. FES is very lucky to have him.",
    "The instructor also includes participatory processes during the course which is good.",
    "Q7:The instructor moves very quickly at times, which can make it diffuclt to follow.",
    "A basic stats class - but one that was pretty accessible for someone with a minimal maths background. Instructor and TAs (TAs did a GREAT job, in my opinion, and I visited them frequently) were helpful and responsive. Class moved a little fast but getting extra help solved that problem for the most part.",
    "Question 1:There is no required textbook. The class notes are handed out and available on Classes V2 as pdfs. This was all I needed to complete the work. Occasional web searches were helpful too.Question 6:The class moves very quickly. It is difficult to keep up with lectures, but completing the homework is essential to understanding the material. Any slower and we would not have gotten through everything, so it is a tradeoff.Question 7:The instructor and TAs were very responsive to questions. They provided many out of class review sessions and office hours.",
    "Excellent course presentation, the teacher manages to make the topic interesting and easy to understand.",
    "Question 2.Jonathan moved entirely too fast through the material, especially towards the end of the course (where the least familiar, or unknown, of statistics was found). Perhaps it would be helpful to students to receive the handouts before class, and ask questions on material that was not understood after a preliminary read and a class explanation."

    "JONATHAN!!",
    "The help given by the TA to understand the homework.",
    "That I enjoyed and learned statistics!",
    "1. Jonathan, the instructor, thinks his humor is corny. But I think its his humor and way of teaching that keeps the class alive and exciting. He helped us learn statistics by telling a story, which I think is the most difficult thing to do.2. Although the course load was high, the homework we had to turn in each week made sure we were in sync with the speed at which the class progressed. The homework also gave us a hands on approach to using Minitab, a statistical software.3. Jonathan wrote out a complete textbook, parts of which he would distribute in class each day. I am able to recall each and every concept taught in class and put them to practice because his textbook has some really funny cartoons and comments that I would associate the concepts to.",
    "The instructor was great at making a dry topic more interesting and presented the material in a clearly understandable manner.",
    "Very well organized and thoughtfully prepared lectures",
    "I learned about statistics!! Environmental statistics! The professor provided a lot of good examples.",
    "The teacher is so animated and energetic. This comes in handy because you are learning statistics which can be very dense. So this helps to take alot of pressure off of this potentially intense course. Also the jeopardy games that you play for review with the clickers are really fun!",
    "doing the assignments even without knowing what I was really doing was useful, and that is the only time I really felt I was learning. In lectures I was totally baffled and it is hard to listen if you are baffled.",
    "Generally, mathmatics is difficult class for a professor to teach. However, he made many nice ways like clickers and assignments. These are very useful to understand class topics.",

    "Quantitative analysis is not my strong point and I struggle with the homework assignments but Jonathan made it bearable, almost enjoyable and Alvaro the TA helped me immensely with the homeworks.The handouts of the class lectures are excellent. It was invaluable to have a really thorough reference for the class if you didn't catch everything at lecture.",
    "How the professor made stats to be easy and understandable.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer's sense of humor and development of repetitive \"auditory cues\" for commonly used principles or responses that actually help me to remember them.",
    "Relevancy - the instructor did a good job selecting examples from project conducted by FES students and in the environmental sciences arena.Final project - was an excellent way to synthesize the semester's work in a real world fashion.Final take home exam - appreciated it being assigned over the Thanksgiving break rather than other the exam period. Left ample time for focus on the final project.Use of grading area on the classes v2 site - Made it very quick and easy to access grades.",
    "10) Among the TAs: I think that the scoring for problem sets could be more consistent. I was graded differently from each TA. This is confusing due to areas that need improvement. If I concentrate on one area because of one score, there is a limited way of discovering if I in fact improved in that manner.",
    "The instructor has a ton of energy, enjoys teaching, and it shows.",
    "the fact that I now understand statistics.",
    "Project is flexible and can be a portion of thesis project groundwork.",
    "The notes he gave us and the applied homework that made our assignments useful and practical.",
    "The basic statistical knowledge was given and it opens way for other courses as Multivariate statistics.",
    "Learning statistical tests.The summary tree at the end should be given at the beginning.Out of class assignments.",
    "Engaging presentation by prof, good notes provided by prof, helpful TAs, and good\/useful to get some background knowledge of stats.",
    "Getting an overview of basic statistical methods. I had never taken a course before, and at least needed to know what was possible.",
    "Visual help, teaching method",
    "The examples, the notes and the constant repetition were very very helpful. The TAs (Curt and Alvaro were the only ones I consulted) were very helpful and responsive. And Jonathan's amazing performance! His attempt to keep every student engaged and interested through comedy and relevant examples were fantastic and effective, even if he sacrificed detailed explanations for light-hearted fare. The games with remote clickers also helped to keep students engaged, and served to highlight important points.",
    "The instructor is excellent at delivery of concepts.",
    "Gaining new skills and techniques with the directed goal of learning how to apply them to the analysis of my data from my master's project.",
    "Statistics is much less mysterious than it was before. And I loved playing clicker review games...Oh, but the best thing by far is how Jonathan writes up the lectures ahead of time and passes them out. That material is far too complicated to adequately take notes on without them.",

    "Handout packets - the way the packets were printed you were constantly turning them this way and that and it was hard to tell how to turn the pages to cotinue reading the pages in order. It made complicated material more confusing. (I know it seems small, but it was a constant frustration.)Instructions for Minitab - Were sparse in the packets. More screenshots would have been appreciated.Minitab's need for an internet connection to validate the license key - Made working on assignments while traveling (which I had to do for work quite a bit) difficult.Availability of office hours during the last two weeks - Wish there had been more slots, especially from the TAs during exam week.Homework review sessions conducted by TAs after class - Would have prefered that the TAs went through the whole assignment problem by problem.Class time - Conflicted with many lunch time speakers hosted by the Yale Forestry ForumValley of probability - But I'm not sure what you could have done to make it better...",

There were a lot of people in the class and Jonathan lectures very fast. I don't know what could be done to improve this, really...I did think that grading was inconsistent depending on the TA. On several occasions a work group partner and I got very different grades despite turning in essentially the same assignment."

    "It was nice to be able to work on a project in a group, and accomplish more than we would have done individually.",
    "Working in a group was quite helpful for the homework. My group members often found mistakes in my calculations. While it certainly isn't necessary to work with others, it was generally beneficial.",
    "great way to meet classmates",
    "My group was helpful for the homework. We also had group work for the project, which as usual, has significant disadvantages.",
    "The advantage was that it meant some of the workload could be distributed and there were people to check the work and analysis you had done. On the other hand, it was difficult to work with such a large group (group of 4) because people were not all on the same schedule for finals week and some of the group did not understand the concepts of what tests to use on the data.",
    "I learned more and shared what I know. Some in my group had more time to ask the TA, for example, so it was useful.",
    "1. For the first two homework assignments, I worked alone. I realized that it was very time consuming and I did not get my concepts right. We then formed a work group to meet each week and tackle our assignments. The results were fantastic. I was more productive than before and would finish homework quickly. It was also a great place to bounce ideas off people and get the concepts in order.For the final project, we had another work group. This time, we were able to finish our project some ten days before it was due.",
    "Only for the final project. It was good to discuss the analysis and results with other people in the group.",
    "I worked on the problem sets with a group weekly, and I also worked with a group on the final project. Both of these experiences were valuable because it allowed us to help each other through the task at hand.",
    "Different point of views, skills and strengths complemented the work being done.",
    "It was definitely helpful to work as a group on the final project. Also I realized how important it is to work together on assignments. It would be much more difficult working alone on every assignment.",
    "Developing own project was challenging and made us implement various tools learned in the course.",
    "I had a great group.",
    "Advantage! Made me understand more!",
    "Working through complicated problem-sets together.",
    "Group work allowed me to work with my peers processing information that was learned throughout the semester. I really enjoyed the group work.",
    "Workgroups helped solidify concepts and exchange strengths.",
    "it was great to discuss the subject matter with other students, it helped to learn the material better.",
    "The group work as a way to work with others to apply what we learned in class. It was fun and helpful, although the expectations for the project write-up were not very clear.",
    "Working with group was fine according to our interests.",
    "Discussion of the group work was very valuable as out of class learning.",
    "In this class it was extremely helpful. Particularly on HW assignments it helped to have someone to go over my work with, especially if I was really stuck.",
    "Group work was critical in getting the homeworks done. Discussing the concepts with other students was the only way I really grasped some of the topics.",
    "This was a tremendously helpful exercise. I was lucky to have team mates that were driven, professional, friendly and helpful. Together, and on our own, we spent a great deal of time running sample tests on Minitab and discussing which statistical test was more appropriate for what data or what experiment. The group project prepared us for our summer projects. Because there were few limits, students can examine the statistical tools that they think will be most relevant to their own fields or work.",
    "It was so much easier to produce a high-quality final project when we were able to split up the tasks involved.",
    "Great group experience"

   "comments": [
    "Take it and make it a priority. Even if you don't like the material in and of itself, learning it will be extremely useful in almost all fields and future work.",
    "It's a great class to take for anyone who needs to do any type of data analysis or interpretation. The instructor is amazing and I'd recommend everyone to take this class, even if they have a statistics background, because it has an environmental science focus.",
    "Keep up with the work! If you fall behind, you'll pay the price on your homework and midterms. It is also quite useful to keep a broad perspective when learning new statistical tests. Think about the circumstances under which you would use the test, and how it differs from other tests. The real skill you leave the class with is knowing what tests are appropriate for a given set of data.",
    "Don't worry if you don't understand some of the details relating to each issue - just try to keep the big picture in mind.",
    "get to class on time",
    "You will: laugh in class, never fall asleep, spend a lot of time doing your weekly assignments and exams, have a great assistance, and learn a lot.Take advantage of Professor Jonathan. Chances are that you will need statistics for sure in your profession.Try to have a study group early.",
    "1. Please make best use of the TAs. Ask them a lot of questions and pester them as much as you can.2. Be regular with your homework as it will be a great recap to what you learn in class. Even if you do not completely understand certain topics, completing the homework will help bridging the gaps.",
    "TA sessions are very helpful in clarifying the material.",
    "Stay on top of homeworks. Get started on final project early.",
    "Do the hw, go to class.",
    "Study the notes that he hands out in class. They are very detailed and commical, and often have the exact answers to midterms in them.",
    "You really need to know Stats well before you take this course.",
    "Statictics is needed for other environmental classes or acitivities. So, if they can, every student should study statistics once.",
    "Work together. Have a practical application in mind that you plan on using the tools learned on, and they will seem much more relevant.",
    "Buy a book as a reference, and try to start the homework early.",
    "Read the lecture notes before going to class.",
    "Recommended!",
    "Don't fall behind -- if you don't understand something work it out with other students, the professor, or a TA (especially probability -- I wish I had put more time doing the book readings outside of class).",
    "If possible, already have your data on hand. It would have been fantastic to conduct the final project using my own data.Do buy a textbook.Try to find a group of people to work on the problem sets with.",
    "Be prepared for problem sets that take several hours per week.",
    "Even though a textbook is not required, go ahead and buy one early on. Also, just get into a routine of going to office hours each week even if you don't have a specific question. It helps alot.",
    "don't miss class and work on the problem sets in groups.",
    "Take a class with JDRS!",
    "It is a very fine basic statistical course and it opens for other statistical courses as multivariate statistics.",
    "Make sure to get the class notes and compile them. They are your bible. Take advantage of JDRS's email availability.",
    "Go get help from the TAs! Do your homework in a group, and don't fall behind in lectures. Review the posted notes while working through the HW probs.",
    "Go to lecture even though they are hard to follow. Otherwise you will be lost when it comes to homework and tests.Do the homeworks on time and with groups.",
    "Practice exercises in the optional texts help, as well as reading various texts to cement the most important concepts and work through many examples.",
    "Go to the TAs' office hours!"
