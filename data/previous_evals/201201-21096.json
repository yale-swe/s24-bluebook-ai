    "I'd describe the seminar as an in-depth overview of the United States in the twentieth century, with attention to political, labor, cultural and transnational\/international history. The course provides a nice synthesis of class texts and new works. I would definitely recommend the course to other students, as the seminar environment is lively and you come out well prepared for an orals field in the 20th century.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone studying 20th century US history.",
    "I would summarize this course as an intense introduction to major topics in 20th century American history. I would tell any student considering the course that it will give them a broad overview as well as exposure to major historiographical issues. I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is looking to get a good grounding in American historiography or is considering doing an orals field in 20th century American history."

   "comments": [
    "This course increased my knowledge of US history and historiography by leaps and bounds. I can't state enough how helpful this was for orals prep. We covered a lot of ground, so didn't get much depth in any one subject, but all of the books we read provided good leads and footnotes for any further research."
