   "comments": [
    "An outstanding course for developing a deeper understanding of the international economic and financial system, and of the relationship between economic theory and practice.",
    "I would, with the caveat that it takes at least 10 hours per problem set and several days of studying for each exam. The workload is heavy, but a lot is covered. The student must have a healthy interest in macroeconomic concepts.",
    "Good class for international econ if you have solid background.",
    "The class gives a solid overview of some of the main theories in macro economics. I would absolutely recommend the course to someone with some economics background, but hoping to advance their understanding of these topics.",
    "Yes I would because it really helps to understand a lot of concepts in economics.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to a prospective student. It does assume some understanding of macroeconomics and mathematics (e.g. calculus).",
    "Yes I will.",
    "I would recommend the class to other students, but not those who majored in Economics at an undergraduate level, as there is a lot of overlap of material.",
    "Yes, depends on the student though.",
    "Yes, it is very useful",
    "The course was extremely fast-paced, but very good. I would recommend it because it is fundamental to the field of international relations.",
    "Yes, the course is very helpful to apply all the theory models to have a better knowledge of the current crisis.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. International Economics provides you with the theoretical knowledge to understand its practical applications.",
    "I strongly recommend this course, particularly to those without economic background as this is quite easy to follow. For those who took international economics in their undergraduate studies, they may find some background classes not very helpful. But overall, the course is very useful.",
    "A very good course and learned a lot. Definitely recommend it to anyone interested in International Econ.",
    "Yes I will recommend this course to anyone who wishes to have a more complete understanding of international economics. It is a useful course, not too much mathematics is involved, explanations are intuitive hence useful.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it: it's a good way to get a clear, but slightly more in-depth than in an introductory course, picture of what goes in international economics.",
    "I would recommend the class to other students because you cover a lot of theory at reasonable depth and the topics are relevant and interesting. I found the work load to be appropriate in quantity and the classes were interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Good introduction to international economics that is not overly technical. Would definitely recommend."

   "comments": [
    "This course was an excellent addition to my discipline (International Relations) and has added a deeper economic understanding of the world to my knowledge of its politics.",
    "It waskey in explaining key economic concepts central to development, and will help me in further research to understand when these concepts are referenced.",
    "I learned a lot about international econ during this class. It also helps me to complete a paper for another econ class.",
    "very helpful",
    "I had taken macro economics before, but only very basic courses. The class helped advance my understanding of the field quite a bit.",
    "It built on the undergraduate level of international economics and looked at the various topics in greater detail. It was a thorough course.",
    "It has deepened my understanding of international economics",
    "I understood a lot about the functioning of the international economics.",
    "The course gave me a grasp of fundamental theories to understand international economics, especially open economy macro.",
    "Too easy. Needs more models.",
    "As an IDE student, this course was a requirement course, and I found it very satisfying and useful for my future career.",
    "N\/A - no dissertation\/research."
