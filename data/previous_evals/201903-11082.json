    "A very thorough overview of central theoretical texts in International Relations, paired with more empirical insights into topical matters of security",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to the literature on international security. I have a much better command of the classic contributions to the study of international politics, a deeper familiarity with the key debates, and a clearer sense of the kinds of research that IR scholars do now. The course also dealt with methodological and epistemological debates in helpful and thought-provoking ways.",
    "Working knowledge of international security issues.",
    "The course opened up a new realm of thought on international relations and security. I learned how to view and analyze states' actions on the global stage, the motivations and reasoning behind their actions.",
    "A theoretical approach to IR problems."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Monteiro expressed disappointment with the way he balanced the security and theoretical aspects of this course, but I actually enjoyed the way he performed that balancing act. Wonderful and engaging discussions, no weaknesses. Very heavy reading load per class, however.",
    "I think the course is well-structured as it is. I recognize that it is challenging to balance the interests of the PhD students and those of the Jackson school students (the former being more focused on theory, latter more interested in contemporary events etc.), but Professor Monteiro does a very good job of this. I would encourage Professor Monteiro to use the first part of each class meeting to give a lecture, like the one that he did at the beginning of the session on nuclear weapons. I think this was helpful because it made sure that everyone was (more or less) on the same page in the subsequent discussion.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "The course load was heavy for a Global Affairs student. Thought-provoking questions to accompany the readings would help students hone in on the relevant points each week."

    "Certainly.",
    "Yes, for anyone interested in learning about global conflict and cooperation. The course gives deep insight into historical and current events in international security.",
    "Yes, if interested in developing a theoretical background in IR."
