   "comments": [
    "Probably best for physics or math majors. I probably wouldn't recommend this course to a freshman even if you felt you were prepared for it. As a freshman you are trying to figure other things out and wouldn't be able to give the material taught in this course the pondering it deserves.",
    "Amazingly thorough treatment of mechanics. If you are thinking, I know mechanics, this course will not do anything for me think again... and then take this course. Bow down to the power of Lagrangians and Hamiltonians. Material- Everything is a harmonic oscillator. Covering basic Lagrangian formulations, perturbation theory, 2-body problems, harmonic oscillators, rotational motion, non-inertial forces, special relativity, and hamiltonians. Seriously, the entire project of mechanics becomes clear through this class. Grades- Psets are graded nicely but are time intensive. Frequently I found that some of the most difficult parts were the algebra but overall representative of the types of problems on the tests. Tests super hard. I have no idea how he thinks of such difficult questions, but they are curved so hopefully it comes out in the end. Professor- lectures generally quite clear and engaging. Very willing to stop and answer questions. I rarely left lectures confused (only during special relativity). Office hours were quite good. Generally, Skiba can see what needs to be said when he goes too fast. His lectures are fast-paced however. Pay attention!",
    "I planned on taking Phys 401 (I came from Phys 200\/201 and Math 120\/225) but shopped 410 for a day and was instantly drawn to both Skiba's teaching style and the intellectual depth of the course. 410 is hard, with occasionally very tricky problem sets and challenging exams, but I found it very worth the effort. The work was never tedious, and the problem sets are a good way to collaborate with people and get a deeper understanding of the physics by talking with other engaged students. Go to a lecture and decide if you want to take the leap, I'm super glad I did.",
    "A great intro to classical mechanics, especially with Skiba who is the funniest lecturer I have ever had. Some psets are challenging, but most are managable.",
    "Phys 410 is a high level course that teaches all of the main components of Classical Mechanics, with a lot of focus on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to pursue a Physics\/Engineering related field, or anyone curious to understand how the world around us works!",
    "Challenging, fast-paced, but interesting and rewarding. It would be worth taking it to see lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics and perturbation theory alone.",
    "Phys 410 is a step up from Phys 260\/261 or Phys 200\/201. It is worth it! With Skiba this class taught me so much about mechanics and just a way of looking at problems that I would never have experienced if I had just read Taylor. Homework is reasonable, midterm is hard, but fair. Final was fairly challenging, but most of the questions were fair. Take this class! You won't regret it.",
    "Take physics 410 if you're doing the intensive physics major, or if you have a genuine desire to learn advanced classical mechanics. The tests are very hard and the problem sets range from 4-5 hours to as much as 12-15.",
    "Take this class, especially if you are deciding between 401 and 410! It is a really difficult class, not only in terms of work but also in terms of just understanding what is going on. I came in from Phys 200\/201 and a somewhat shaky math background and spent the first half of the semester extremely confused; you have to be willing to put in the work to read the textbook\/google and go to office hours. It is definitely worth it though: you emerge being able to think like a physicist the class gives you intuition for coordinates, complex math, approximations, abstract concepts and more! You will be challenged and pushed to the next level. You cover a bunch of really interesting material: Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, relativity, chaos theory, rigid body rotation etc. Skiba is brilliant and funny the best physics professor I have ever had who makes you excited and interested in the material. The workload itself becomes more manageable because you will quickly form a p-set group who will become close friends and great support. The textbook (Taylor: Classical Mechanics) is great and very helpful. This was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Take this class. Even if you're not a physics major. The physics is fun, enlightening, and challenging without being too difficult (as are the psets, which take maybe 5 hours, and the exams, though hard, which are graded and curved nicely---I think?), and Prof. Skiba is truly amazing---a clear lecturer (most of the time), friendly, funny, and kind. Expect a lot on Lagrangians, and not so much on Hamiltonians.",
    "This is a classical mechanics class, but one that is considerably beyond the scope of Physics 401. Part of the difference in scope comes from the more theoretical nature of some of the problem sets, topics, and techniques, while the other difference is from the pool of students who tend to take each class. Each student I know in the class is either an intensive physics major, a mathematics major, or a combination of the two. Dr. Skiba teaches this course better than I thought was possible, and I would highly recommend taking it from him. He is engaging, charming, and most importantly, he cares about the comprehension of the students.",
    "Take 410 if you really think you're going to be a physics major. You'll have a great time iff you can keep up.",
    "Great class, really makes you appreciate the intersection of math and physics. Work and exams especially are killer.",
    "It's a deeper look at mechanics but is certainly not out of reach for those who have taken phys 260. I would recommend the course, but only to someone majoring in physics."
