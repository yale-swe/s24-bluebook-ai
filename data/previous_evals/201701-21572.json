   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about research design, and even better how to be critical of methods that are widely used.",
    "I feel better equipped to critically examine research designs in social science articles. I also feel better equipped to critically evaluate aid programs, especially when considering a conflict setting. In general, my research design skills have improved as a result of this course.",
    "I have learned the most critical theories in aid work, methodologies, and relevant programs\/evaluations that make up the core curriculum for most practitioners.",
    "Interesting perspective on development aid and counterinsurgency methods.",
    "In taking this course, I thought the scope would be pretty specific, but actually I learned so much about a wide variety of subjects in this course. I feel like I have a solid grasp of how humanitarian aid works, what tactics are used in counterinsurgencies, and about specific conflicts like in Afghanistan.",
    "Perhaps the class where I learned the most this semester. This class is a really great introduction both to the mechanics and politics of contemporary, conflict-setting foreign aid and the methods of impact evaluation (notably randomized control trials and particular measures such as list experiments etc. to cut bias) in these settings.",
    "I learned how to design an impact evaluation and analyze political science research in a more refined way. After taking this course, I feel much more comfortable engaging in political science research and I am actually interested in understanding the methodological approach preset. I learned that aid in conflict zones is not always beneficial and can even be hurtful.",
    "This course was so engaging because every lesson started with an example. This means that every skill we learned we saw a real-life example which provided knowledge about how every element of the course actually worked.",
    "This class taught me how to consider at-risk conflict settings in a very empirical manner. I looked at development issues from the ground, and got a good understand of all the complex variables that need to be taken into account.",
    "You're exposed to some very interesting, and often difficult, texts.",
    "The course provided an excellent introduction into the topics of aid provision and impact evaluations. I learned about conducting quantitative experiments and the need for data on aid projects for greater efficiency. I also learned that the current aid apparatus is ineffective in achieving its aims.",
    "I developed a real-world understanding of how development works, as well as study methodology and study design skills.",
    "This was definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. In this class I learned what are the methods and techniques used to evaluate development projects around the world.",
    "I learned about the myriad controversies about foreign aid. I also learned how to create an impact evaluation.",
    "This course introduced a number of issues and approaches to development that I have never before considered. It provided a quality reading list that helped to cultivate an understanding of modern development theories, especially ones that are applicable in the fragile settings of conflict zones.",
    "I develope a detailed understanding of how aid works, how it doesn't work, and how to run impact evaluations to determine its efficacy.",
    "I learned about different development aid tactics, as well as how to measure the successes and failures in these aid techniques. Through the final paper I learned how to research and design my own impact evaluation.",
    "I learned so much about how violence affects communities.",
    "I learned different techniques to conduct impact evaluations. However, most of all, I learned how limited our knowledge regarding impact evaluations are, and how inconclusive they can be.",
    "I learned about the various types of impact evaluations and aid interventions that can be deployed in conflict settings, as well as some of the basics of econometrics (without having taken the course).",
    "I learned a ton about how aid impacts violence in both a negative and positive sense and in terms of the negative, discovered ways in which you can prevent increases in conflict and test to make sure your methods are effective.",
    "This class gives you a very thorough understanding of the theory and practice behind development work in conflict zones. I learned and got some practice in the skill of writing an impact evaluation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was a very American-centric approach to counterinsurgency and I often felt it dehumanized the subjects. I wish we had more insight into the lives of the people we often called \"rebels\" and \"insurgents\".",
    "Strengths: Engaging lectures, engaging professor, current material, good balance between guidance and personal discovery in regards to learned research design skills, readings well incorporated into lectures and into course themes Weaknesses: Guest lecturers not very effective or engaging",
    "The lectures for this course were excellent and I looked forward to going to this class every time. For me the biggest weakness was the Impact Evaluation at the end. Although I thought it was a good idea there were too many gaps in the information and access to information to actually simulate a real impact evaluation.",
    "The readings are fascinating, but they can feel like a lot if you're unfamiliar with aid and\/or statistics as I was (still manageable). You'll really see the world differently (with lots more grey area) after taking this class. I think it made me a more rigorous thinker. Some people say the class is dark because you talk about a lot of failed aid projects, but I found that component particularly informative. The professor and the teaching fellows have really in-depth knowledge and lots of experience (the teaching fellows were both veterans who had served in some of the settings we studied). The course does have an Iraq\/Afghanistan focus but also spends significant time on the Philippines, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Liberia, Somalia, and Zimbabwe. I've seen the Iraq and Afghanistan focus used as a criticism, but a lot of the most interesting literature is coming from studies in those areas so it felt natural. Professor Lyall is a really great lecturer and his TFs are super helpful.",
    "The only weakness I saw was that the final was a little confusing. I felt as thought I did not fully understand what was asked in the final or what format to follow.",
    "The lectures are definitely informative, but can be rather monotonous. I think utilizing more multimedia may improve the level of student engagement.",
    "I really liked the course. Sometimes it felt a little scattered thematically, mostly because we looked at so many countries and cases, but never really went in depth into one situation.",
    "Strengths - Relevant to the current political context - Provides a great balance between theory and practical implementation Weaknesses - Could have provided a more information about conducting impact evaluations (eg Could have taught us more about the mechanics of such experiments. But this shouldn't be tested because it is a complicated subject and we would all be new to it)",
    "This course feels very practical and real-world in a good way. The readings complement the course very well although there are a lot of them, and the paper at the end of the class is a really good way to wrap up everything we learned in a way that made me feel as though I had the skills to go conduct an impact evaluation.",
    "This is a great class. The lectures and readings are just great!",
    "I think this course was well structured and the lectures were interesting.",
    "By the very nature of its subject, this course provided more questions than answers. Overall, I believe it was both well-run and organized, which helped to facilitate learning. Professor Lyall and the teaching assistants were very engaged and more than willing to help students, which was greatly appreciated.",
    "This course's strength is that Professor Lyall is clearly very experienced, and is able to speak with authority about what it's like to conduct research in the field. However, it's weak in that we jump from one topic to the next with very little cohesive thread running through the topics. Also, we learned superficially about a lot of different methods and studies, without deeply understanding what really made one different from another. We never discussed what the underlying fundamental differences were when two very different studies were conducted. I also think it was weak in that it engendered arrogance in students. I understand that impact evaluation is a very new field, but I think the amount of generality we assigned to \"villages\" in \"developing countries\" was unfair and unsophisticated. I think it would have been much more improved if we understood the surrounding situation much more in the villages that were being studied. Because of the lack of sophistication we used in class when discussing the impact evaluations, I think students felt very confident in their ability to get the general gist, leading to almost nobody in my section doing the readings yet being incredibly confident about their points of view. I think this hampered any real, meaningful discussion or engagement with the material.",
    "The lectures are phenomenally clear, relevant, and interesting. The amount of reading for the course, however, is extremely high, making it impossible to cover all of it in sections. More so, retaining so much information from readings without discussing them is difficult.",
    "Strengths included the very comprehensive study of aid interventions around the world. By the end of the course, we could distinguish good from bad approaches to impact evaluations. Areas of improvement could include more guidance on how to write academic papers, specifically impact evaluations, at a high level.",
    "I thought the class was super interesting, however in the second half I felt like the course completely changed. I know the second part was focused on analyses and designing student's own impact evaluations but I didn't really feel like there was a huge connection. One other thing is that I felt like this course had a very heavy Western bias, which I understand given that there's a heavy focus on US aid or that of European countries but I did feel like it was very heavily skewed.",
    "I enjoyed this course and thought it was very well organized. I think it could have been improved if we had more practice working with impact evaluations and writing before the impact evaluation itself."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I thought it was a very interesting and challenging class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course provided me with a new (and much more critical) perspective on aid in general. I also gained much more confidence in critically evaluating social science research and designing my own research. Professor Lyall is an incredible professor with loads of real-life experience in this field. Learning from him was a privilege. His level of experiential knowledge and on-the-ground wisdom really makes this course a treat to attend. The material is extremely current, and applicable in many different circumstances. I wish I had taken this course earlier in my Yale career.",
    "Yes. It was a great introduction to what the world of a practitioner looked like and what policies stem from in the real world.",
    "I really loved taking this class. I always looked forward to going to the lectures. The information covered is fascinating and there is a breadth of content including humanitarian aid, counterinsurgency tactics, and information about specific classes. I would definitely recommend taking!",
    "Definitely! Superbly taught with fascinating material and worthwhile readings. Honestly would consider taking a second time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another poly sci major, but as a survey course I'm hesitant. The course is applicable to future political science endeavorers and I feel like I grew and gained tangible skills. Despite this, the course is heavy on reading and a lot of the papers can be dense and bland. The material was pretty fascinating though, and if you can suffer through some technical reading, I think you will really enjoy what you learn. I promise you will be challenged to reconsider your preconceived notions about aid in conflict zones.",
    "Yes this class was extremely engaging and very interesting. The professor was awesome and the material was mentally stimulating.",
    "This was actually a great course although I had trouble motivating myself to go to class after the midterm and I didn't even look at the readings for at least half of the classes. But the lectures that I did go to were usually really interesting. They are only 50 minutes and sometimes 10 minutes are devoted to a video . Professor Lyall obviously has a lot of experience in this field and is always illustrating his points from his time in Afghanistan . The final paper was actually really fun--instead of just doing a lot of research you were actively trying to think of ways to solve real world problems. I really liked my TA as well; he always gave copious feedback on assignments and did a good job of directing discussion and making section fun.",
    "Good class, if you are interested in really diving into the specifics of development work. If you are considering as a fifth class or just something to try, then it's workload in the second half of the semester and the Impact Evaluation as a final is something to consider (though neither are particularly awful or anything).",
    "It's a good way to become familiar with the structure of research papers and research design, the course does a good job of guiding you through a lot of the mechanisms of them and helping you understand them. It's also an interesting lecture.",
    "I would strongly recommend it because it runs like a well oiled machine. A lot of thought was clearly given to the workload and syllabus, which I really appreciated. It is also generally quite an interesting topic.",
    "Yes!! One of my favorite classes at Yale - although don't take it credit\/d there are too many readings you have to do to really understand the class.",
    "If you're an ER&M major like me, you might feel a bit out of place in the beginning since its so strongly a political science course. But I found it super helpful in learning a new way to think.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Lyall is a great lecturer and his lectures are very interesting. I always looked forward to go to class. DEFINITELY take it!",
    "If one is interested in the US intervention in conflict or post-conflict areas, they shoudl definitely take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students interested in development, whether it be political, social, or economic. It introduces a number of issues, theories, and concerns for modern development projects, especially within fragile conflict settings. It definitely provokes more questions than answers, but the ideas it raises are critical for understanding the changing role of humanitarian aid in the modern world. Professor Lyall is also phenomenal. His past experiences in the field of development work and research add entirely new dimensions to the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student thinking about global affairs\/political sciences as a major. Professor Lyall is the best lecturer I've had, and even though I won't be majoring in either of those subjects it was a worthwhile course about an important topic.",
    "This has to be one of the greatest Political Science courses offered for undergraduates. Not only are there relevant readings every week, but the Professor Lyall is fun to be around, and the topics discussed in class are visible in the news. This is the class to take if you want to understand what aid can do in a violent setting.",
    "Yes, I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. This class was outside of my major, and I started with it as a Credit D class, but every lecture was so interesting and I enjoyed learning about it so much that I switched it over. Jason Lyall is an amazing professor and a talented lecturer.",
    "Yes; it was very rewarding!",
    "Awesome course. You learn a lot about methodology and about how experiments are being run in the field. If there should be a mandatory poly sci class for any social science major, it would be this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student similarly interested but unfamiliar with the metrics and methods of international development aid. Prof. Lyall is engaging and clear. I walked away from lectures and sections feeling like I really learned something that fits into the broader spectrum of international affairs. A very relevant and refreshingly critical class.",
    "Yes; if you are interested in international relations, this is a way to see how that plays out on the micro level. As more of a political theorist, I found that the \"nuts and bolts\" approach was supplemented with more than enough theory that translated to other subjects within political science as well.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even given that I didn't find the second half extremely interesting I ended up learning so much on areas I never considered.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is interesting, it exposes you to a lot of important literature in the field, and it gives you practice in marketable skills.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot, and found all the material incredibly engaging."
