   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course although students should expect to teach themselves most of the material. Both professors tend to go off topic so expect to be tested on material not covered in class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would summarize the course as a fantastic overview of neurophysiology, biophysics, and systems neuroscience. I would absolutely recommend taking it, because it will provide a great foundation of knowledge in basic neuroscience, as well as the history of neuroscience. I also found that topics covered in the course engage intellectual faculties that are quite diverse, providing training appropriate to the interdisciplinary nature of the science we are pursuing.",
    "Neurobiology is an overview of the biophysics of neuroscience. I would recommend it to another student, because it is a rigorous course that provides a lot of helpful information about neurobiology.",
    "A introductory course that covers part of the basic concepts.",
    "This course is a good source of knowing elementary and well-accepted discoveries in neuroscience field. It also goes with \"Priciples\" so that a combination of knowledge from both courses gives a clearer map of established theory and practical research."

   "comments": [
    "Exposure to most aspects of neuroscience and understanding of the history of the field.",
    "Biophysics lens was a new perspective on the material.",
    "This course gave me a deep look into the biophysics of neuroscience. It gave me an overview of many types of neuroscience research that I could use for my dissertation.",
    "This course also offers a discussion part for graduate students in which the students introduce their first rotation project. The discussion requires the students to get a basic background of their research and cultivates the ability to articulate their ideas in a logical way. Some of the questions held by the instructors were quite inspiring.",
    "It was a good foundation. Would still haveliked a more graduate level class."
