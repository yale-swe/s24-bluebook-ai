   "comments": [
    "wexler is kind, funny and quirky. the work load is light and the structure of the class is intended to provide an overview--which it accomplishes. you won't delve into any ideas in particular depth. quality of professor will vary from class to class but overall they are enthusiastic and helpful. good readings. take it as a fifth class.",
    "Perspectives is a terrific class. Professor Wexler epitomizes a gentleman. But don't let his low-key manner fool you -- he is both extremely apt at making well-placed, good-natured jokes and tremendously knowledgeable (and often has been directly involved in many of New Haven-related subjects discussed).His guests are terrific, too. You'll cover everything from housing policy to new media and everything in between. My only complaint is that, despite this class being somewhat difficult to get into, I have no idea why a number of other students were taking the class. Despite fascinating guests and conversations, a number of folks doodled or texted their way through the semester. As such, I never felt as though the class gelled. But hopefully this year was just an aberration.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. You will learn so much, about so many different areas of study, and get to meet so many different professors. Wexler is the man, and you will get to know a bunch of interesting classmates. I have nothing bad to say about this class.",
    "Greatest class on urban studies that yale offers. Recommend it without any reservation to anyone that can finagle their way in.",
    "YES. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you are interested in Urban Studies (and wish there was an Urban Studies major) this is a great foundation course that will expose you to some of the best Urban Studies professors and literature. The assignments allow you a lot of freedom to pursue your own interests and Professor Wexler is the best.",
    "Perspectives is an interesting course, though the readings and seminar meetings are incredibly disjointed. The guests are a mixed bag, some of them (Elihu Rubin, Alan Plattus) are fantastic while others are really boring. Overall though, it's a worthwhile class that gives a lot of exposure to different views and disciplines. The readings, while often very long and unrelated to the class discussions, are interesting and valuable.",
    "YES! If you get in, you need to take it. No questions asked.",
    "YES. This class is phenomenal. You will learn a lot about a lot of things, which is something that is rarely said in college.",
    "Perspectives on the City is a great class lead by a great professor, and if you're lucky enough to get in, you should definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. The topics covered are fascinating and can be applied to almost any field, discussion is excellent, and I certainly came out of this class with a renewed understanding of and fascination with cities around the world. Professor Wexler is great."
