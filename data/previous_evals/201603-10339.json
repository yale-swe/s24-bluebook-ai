   "comments": [
    "Knowledge: Locations and capitals of SE Asia countries. Some languages and geographic regions. Skills: N\/A Insights: I learned about anthropology as a concept.",
    "In addition to a few basic facts, such as the population, languages, capitals, and geographic locations of the countries in the region, I learned basic anthropological theories and several social, political, and economic dynamics in Southeast Asia.",
    "Critical thinking skills about anthropology and deeper knowledge of Southeast Asia as a region in history and culture.",
    "I learned a variety of aspects on Southeast Asia and some basic anthropological approaches to studying peoples and regions.",
    "Incredible course which gave me a much-needed overview of Southeast Asia, from colonialism's imagined nations to dance and music to current day politics.",
    "This is a FANTASTIC course. I learned a lot about SE Asia and various social, political, and economic factors to take into consideration when approaching events of the region. If I had to explain the skills gained in one sentence, it would be that I feel I can now read headlines and news articles about Southeast Asia with much more fluency, context, and an ability to think critically about the subjects involved. We also had fruitful conversations about key dilemmas in anthropological study, including questions of positionality and ethnographic methods. The class community was great and the academic work was really meaningful.",
    "This course gave me a solid introduction to the methods of anthropology. I also learned about political, social, and economic issues in Southeast Asia.",
    "This course is a great introductory course into anthropology and Southeast Asia. It has definitely helped to develop my writing more than any WR course I've taken. You will leave this course with a really nuanced understanding of the broader ethnography of Southeast Asia, read a lot of essential anthropologists' work of Southeast Asia, and draw connections to events that are happening across Southeast Asia today.",
    "I think I learned a lot, from writing ethnographies to SE Asia. This class perhaps didn't teach me anything super earth shattering in terms of worldviews, but I gained a lot of confidence talking and writing because the class was a very supportive environment. It definitely gave me space to explore my thoughts regarding the material in the class (e.g. reading responses and the final), and that in itself was so beneficial. My writing skills also improved a lot; Harms and Emily (the TF) were super helpful in their comments.",
    "Learned a lot about Southeast Asia, about the field of anthropology in general, and about writing strong papers.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze texts and to challenge ideas presented by authors. I learned how to write a basic anthropology paper. I also enjoyed learning about how fascinating the Southeast Asia region is, full of cultures, people, and problems to explore and understand.",
    "The readings were great and taught me a lot about the people of the region. Reading responses took some time but were a good way to practice responding to texts and engaging with them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lots of readings. Amazing impact of other students within the class. Manageable workload. Relatively broad coverage of topics. Seminar discussions were thorough. Weaknesses: Lots of readings. I really didn't learn anything. Point distribution was rather interesting. Very deceptive in that it seems like an intro class but it really hits you in the face. Improvements: Fewer readings. Maybe like a real topic or something to learn every week in a possible lecture.",
    "This course introduces a lot of very interesting problems occurring in Southeast Asia, and supports them with interesting readings. Another great thing about the class is that many of the students were from southeast asia and contributed to the discussions with points gathered from their own experience. With that being said, we abandoned the topics pretty quickly, without having delved all that deep into each one. In class discussions also didn't really seem to progress during the semester; if a student came into the class with certain ideas or beliefs about society, I don't think this class made that student challenge or refine his or her own beliefs, but rather just gave the student a space in which to spew these beliefs.",
    "Strengths: varied selection of readings, engagement with material through discussions and papers, resources to succeed for research for papers Weaknesses: can't think of any!",
    "It covers a wide range of issues, which is excellent. I wish there could be a bit more lecturing besides the reading discussions. Sometimes the discussions are a bit dry and hard to get everyone to participate.",
    "Great readings and professor, interesting classroom experience because a lot of the students are internationals from Southeast Asia. Only drawback is that the readings can be pretty heavy in some weeks and it was a struggle to read everything for Thursday class after Tuesday class.",
    "I really only have strengths to share. The assignments are really meaningful -- two papers that provide a chance to delve into a topic of your choosing, and several low-key reading responses to engage with the texts more critically. The reading list is also fantastic, current yet offering deep insight into certain foundational texts and studies in anthropology and in the region. Professor Harms is a genius and knows exactly how to present the subjects of this course such that both people from the region and newcomers to these studies grow as a person and a scholar.",
    "Strengths: Prof = very nice, knows things, engaging; some very good readings Weaknesses: sometimes hard to get a sense things in a place... b\/c such a wide coverage could end up feeling kind of like random facts, rather than understanding a national or even regional conversation.",
    "I wish the course was more heavy on information about Southeast Asia rather than general anthropological methods and the concept of modernity. I wanted to learn about the region in this class and I expected it to be more a survey, lecture-style course.",
    "The strengths of this class include the fact that it is on modern Southeast Asia, instead of Southeast history like a lot of other Southeast Asia courses at Yale. On its own Modern Southeast Asia is already such an interesting subject and the readings were fascinating, but the key strength of this class is undoubtedly that it is taught by Erik Harms, who is hands down one of the best professors at Yale. I can think of no weaknesses of this class.",
    "First things first, Professor Harms is a gem. So sweet, so helpful, and so knowledgeable about SE Asia. He knew how to ask questions that pushed the discussion further, and his insights were probably the highlight of the class. In fact, I wished he gave more lectures or spoke more, just to tie the class together. Based on what others have said and how I felt, lectures were what drew us into the course in the first place! We were here to listen to Harms' engaging, informative lectures about SE Asia. While I did appreciate the discussions and found them important, I think too often class discussions drifted away from discussing the actual content in favor of critiquing the authors. I truly appreciated that Harms allowed us the space to voice these opinions (so important, especially because my friends complain of professors who do not allow for this sort of criticism), but I do hope in future courses Harms tries to focus the discussion mostly on SE Asia, rather than on white authors writing about SE Asia. I 100% think its worthwhile to bring these concerns up and they should be brought up, but I think its worth pointing out that this is supposed to be an intro anthro class after all, not an intense upper-level anthro course where all the students want to dissect the writing of ethnographies. The choice in readings and assignments (especially the open-ended final paper!) was also largely excellent. I enjoyed most of the readings, though I do think there were a few dry texts. But still, I actively tried to read as much as I could, which shows how much I trusted Harms' judgment. I do wish he incorporated them better in the discussion because oftentimes we wouldn't get to the third reading or I would have trouble trying to see how the readings fit together to form a bigger picture.",
    "I really thought this was a great course on so many levels. The breadth \/ depth of material was fantastic, the format of the class was great, it wasn't an obscene amount of work, and so on and so forth. Really wonderful. Having a tad bit more time for the final paper would have been nice given that the amount of work done over thanksgiving is always questionable, but it did seem like there was flexibility with the deadline so I can't really complain there. All in all, this was a fantastic course!!!",
    "The schedule of topics and themes for the course is very organized and makes sense. There are periods of time that are less reading intensive which helps during midterm periods. The assignments, readings, and papers that we do in the course are very fascinating and are enjoyable to do. One weakness was that we spent a lot of time trying to understand the field of anthropology itself, when sometimes I just wanted to learn about modern SE Asia.",
    "What I enjoyed most about this class was the diversity and quality of the readings. I learned a lot by doing the readings. We also had some good discussions in class. The assignments were very typical, one paper written using current events and one open-ended research paper, neither of which I enjoyed very much."

   "comments": [
    "It really depends on the type of student who's interested in taking this class. I think there's a clear binary. On one hand, students who are already interested in anthropology would definitely benefit from this course. It's well-thought out and an excellent course to continue my knowledge of anthropology. Also, if you are connected to the region in such a way, it will be a very interesting class for you. It compiles many different experiences, and it would be a great class for you. It's fairly easy with little work, especially if you don't read it completely, and you will get by in discussion. Prof. Harms is quite good and he will always foster a great learning environment However, I could definitely see that the intro students were struggling. If you have 0 previous experience in the region or the Anthropology department, this class might not be for you. It will puzzle you and confuse you, and you will walk away every day with more questions than answers. In a normal context, one might suggest that this is a good thing. I refute that claim in the context of Modern Southeast Asia.",
    "If a student is from the region, has a significant interest in the region for a particular reason, or is well versed in anthropology courses, I think this class could be a good match. There are plenty of opportunities to apply personal experience to the class, and familiarity with anthropology in general is helpful. By far the best part of the class was the personal experience that some students shared in the class. Students who expected this class to be an intro course seemed to be surprised when the semester actually got underway and the discussions were filled with very theoretical and vague concepts. At the end of the semester, several students expressed not having learned all that much. This class would be a better fit for students looking for a class in which to discuss theory rather than learn facts about the place. With that being said, there's not that much work and you can get away with doing none of the readings because the discussions usually stray towards incomprehensible gobbledygook anyway.",
    "Incredible course. Not a gut but Professor Harms is one of the nicest, funniest, and most intelligent professors at Yale. If you're at all interested in Southeast Asia take this course!! The workload is a bit high but manageable; Professor Harms adapts each semester so it may be different the next time he teaches it. Generally it's five reading responses over the course of the semester (which you can schedule according to your own schedule), a midterm paper, a map quiz, and a final paper. The readings are all very interesting, and you get to choose the topic for your papers so it's engaging for you (everyone in the class chose a topic that they were really passionate about). Professor Harms spreads out the workload so that you don't procrastinate on your paper and he really gives you the resources you need to succeed. This is one of the hidden gems of Yale College. Take this take this take this! A final note: the class may be framed as a lecture but is actually more of a seminar, so be prepared to do the readings and participate.",
    "Solid class. Not a waste of time. Above average, very well taught but sometimes it's not that exciting.",
    "Yes, definitely. This class teaches exactly what it's supposed to and I am now more interested in taking future classes with Professor Harms and about Southeast Asia in general. Honestly surprised that more people did not take the class. Besides the readings, the two papers are not bad and I enjoyed doing the final paper on anything I wanted.",
    "Professor Harms is hands down the best teacher I have had at Yale. He clearly cares so much about not just this subject, but whether or not the students in his class are actually learning and making strides in the modes of academic work that matter to them. His assignments are thoughtfully constructed to not feel like busy work but instead offer chances for deep intellectual engagement. The syllabus is dynamic and diverse; there's never a dull moment. Overall, the topics you'll engage with are really important for this day in age -- positionality in academic work, post-colonial culture and society, and the nuances of ethnographic study. Take. This. Class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in gaining an intro to anthropology. I would qualify my recommendation with the fact that the class is not a information-based lecture and it is very discussion heavy.",
    "YES, absolutely! Take this course! Professor Harms is one of the best professors at Yale. You have a lot of freedom in choosing your topic for the midterm and final paper so you have the agency to research about something you really are interested in. Professor Harms is a Yale treasure and lectures and his chosen readings were fascinating. An amazing class for those who know nothing about Southeast Asia and would like to know more, as well as for those who have a little more experience with the region. Take this class, you will not regret it.",
    "Professor Harms is amazing. I would probably recommend any one of his classes to someone because he has such interesting insights and is such a warm, friendly person. He also had pretty good taste in readings! Most of them were fascinating. The workload is not too bad. Reading responses do take (way) longer than you would think, but you don't have to read every single reading (though to maximize what you get out of this class, I think you should!). Participation in this class is pretty lenient. As for the class discussions, I think they could have been slightly better run, and Professor Harms' lectures were actually the highlight of the class (we started off with lectures and he eventually transitioned the class into a seminar). Overall, great class; I think I gained a lot out of it.",
    "A really great introduction to both the field of anthropology and different topics relating to Southeast Asia including religion, agriculture, politics, urbanization, literature, etc. Professor Harms and Emily (TF) were both awesome and super devoted to the class and to the students. A decent amount of work but it's quite fulfilling. Especially if you've never done anthro before, I'd highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as this class introduces us to such a fascinating region. The readings are very interesting, and class discussions were engaging. However the readings for this class require a lot of time, so this is not a light class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in anthropology as a discipline. You will get the most out of this class if you do all the readings, but the readings load is pretty heavy."
