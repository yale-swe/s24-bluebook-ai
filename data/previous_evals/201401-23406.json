   "comments": [
    "The best skill I gained was to be comfortable writing longer pieces than I was accustomed to from high school. However, the course can get kind of dry with a routine for everything and only one chance to share writing with peers. Basically, the syllabus lists three to five readings per class which you discuss (strictly in terms of writing strategies), divided into five units, each of which includes a 1200-1500 word essay assignment.",
    "English 120 really tries to hone your writing skills, and it is really helpful, no matter how good of a writer you are. I recommend it, even for those that don't think they are the best writers. I was scared to take it at first because I have never viewed myself as a strong writer, but I feel a lot more confident in my writing ability now.",
    "A must if you enjoy creative writing! If not, it is probably best to steer away.",
    "Really funny and really talented writer!",
    "Yes. Great practice in both writing and critical reading.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to anyone - considering an English major or not! Anyone who wants to be a better reader or writer or is curious about the modern essay!",
    "Absolutely take this course. It will teach you so much about writing, no matter how much you've practiced essay writing in the past. I loved the readings, which gave a very clear basis as to the style\/content expected of my own essays. The draft\/final paper due a week later structure was also very helpful- it lowered the stress, as I had an initial critique from my instructor to work off of. Workshopping other students' essays was also so interesting, and the discussions of these pieces and of the readings led me to think of writing techniques in so many new ways.",
    "I would highly recommend Professor Alina Simone's English 120! Although we had quite a few readings, they were all extremely interesting and helpful in improving our writing. Professor Simone is amazing! She's funny, personable, extremely helpful, always available to help, and just and overall wonderful professor! I really feel like my writing improved after taking this class.",
    "English 120 is a wonderful writing course. I would highly recommend it to other students. I had a great experience and grew a lot as a writer. The readings are also really interesting, and Professor Simone is awesome!",
    "take it!",
    "Everyone at Yale should take this course. It is challenging and a lot of work, but it will help you so much in understanding English."
