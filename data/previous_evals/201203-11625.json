   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone in the future. Although this year the class was taught at 9am, once you go to lecture once or twice you will be willing to wake up early and go to lecture. This course was definitely an eye opener in being able to appreciate sculpture, architecture, and portraiture in a more in depth manner. Take the course!!",
    "A great experience to engage in roman art and learn how to analyze art in a more meaningful way. Take it!",
    "Pretty basic art history course. You'll learn about the history of the Roman Empire, the emperors, and pick up some interesting facts about art along the way. 9:00 am start time is kind of rough, but overall it's a good class. I'd take it again.",
    "well i think the material is cool but the amount of memorization and going to class at 9 am because you can't afford to miss it is a major problem",
    "If you want to learn what art history is all about, or if you are interested in Roman history, TAKE THIS COURSE! Lecture might seem boring\/slow at first, but once you engage with the material and start to feel connected with the emperors\/sculpture\/etc, you will LOVE IT. Studying for exams takes hours upon hours (ridiculously amounts of information), BUT the course is VERY LITTLE work besides that. There is reading (which is short and fun), but it is hardly necessary to do if you attend lecture. Also Professor Kleiner is perhaps my favorite professor at Yale. She is super nice and super friendly and amazingly smart. TAKE IT!",
    "A great intro to any kind of art history. Heavy on memorization, but the readings are not really necessary to do.",
    "This class was really great. The lectures were very interesting and I always enjoyed going to them. Even though the class was at 9, I never hesitated to wake up for it, and I am definitely not a morning person. Professor Kleiner knows so much about the subject and is very passionate about it, which translates to the way she teaches the class. It coud be dry at times but I think that that is the nature of history lectures. I know I will be able to use what I learned for the rest of my life and I really feel that I took a lot away from it. It was one of those classes you really feel changed the way you think, which I think is incredibly valuable. The tests were very fair and the midterm and final were basically the only work there was all semester. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you're willing to memorize a lot this class is good. There's not much critical thinking involved but it's still a class worth your time.",
    "This is a good course for a non-art history major looking to get their feet wet. It isn't too technical and the material is interesting for the most part. It's also good for art history majors, since Roman art is such a fixture in Western culture. Be warned, there is a lot of memorization, even for an art history class (125-150 pieces that need to have name and date committed to memory). There are two midterms, so there's no cumulative final, which is nice given the quantity of material. Perhaps take this class credit\/D if you're interested in the subject but don't want to worry about whether the date for a particular piece was 251-253 AD or 251-255 AD.",
    "Great class. Take it. The material is really cool, especially if you want to learn more about the Roman world. I learned a lot of stuff that I didn't even know as a Classics major. Professor Kleiner is a great lecturer too. And it's not too much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to an art history major looking to fulfill their ancient art requirement. Very fun class.",
    "Roman Art is a memorization-heavy course (a lot of work right before midterms). However, it's memorizing pieces of art, their dates, and their significance, which is probably different from what most Yale students are used to memorizing (I am from a science background and found this style of memorizing a little harder, since the pieces of art look very similar, and it's hard to learn unique details for 150 works for an exam). Even as a student who's been to Rome before, it was still a challenge to learn and be able to discuss all of the works. This would be a good class to take Credit\/D if you can't put in the time. There's no curve. Professor Kleiner is a very engaging lecture at 9 am in the morning, but I was also very interested in the material.Besides the two midterms (no final), there is an art history paper. If you have no experience with an art history paper, try to get in a good draft to the TA's beforehand. Researching an art history paper took more time that I thought since I felt we weren't given a ton of help on how to devise an argument in the subject. There's no section but an online forum that was useless.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in ancient art or Roman history. I knew I was interested in Roman art (but knew very little) before going into the course and so I found the course content engaging and exciting, but I can imagine many others becoming disinterested in the subject matter after a while. The class itself is not too much work, but there are only three big grades, so it is important to give them all great attention when the time comes.",
    "Either you are a fan of art history or just interested to know more about art\/ancient civilizations, this is a good course. You can gain immediate benefit visiting Yale art gallery or Met or any other museums with Roman sculptures and making sense of them. In terms of coursework, it is quite similar to any other courses but much more fun and flexible. For the mid-term paper, there are ample choices and the teaching fellows are absolutely helpful.",
    "Yes. This course is very fascinating in its materials. You learn a lot in this course with the help of professor Kleiner and teaching fellow. Prof. Kleiner is a wonderful professor and the teaching fellow I had was also very helpful. However, you will be able to memorize a lot of images and information for midterms."
