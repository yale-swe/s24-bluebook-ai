    "A great PLSC senior seminar. You can get a ton out of this class.",
    "yes but won't be here next year so boo",
    "This class was solid. Sam is funny, laid back, and extremely intelligent. At times, the class was disorganized, and I definitely wish there were more assignments (rather than one essay worth 80% of your grade) over the course of the semester. This class also varied a lot depending on the day. Sometimes, the topic and the discussion were memorable and fascinating, and other times you got bogged down in aspects of IR theory or the minutia of a weapons system.",
    "It is a lot of work keeping up with all the text but more than anything - you will get the most out of it by coming to class with a couple questions about the text and hashing it out with your fellow classmates.",
    "Really thought-provoking class with great seminar discussion. Professor DeCanio is quite smart and challenges you to think harder each week. Reading each week is a bit excessive, but you don't have to do absolutely all of it. Outside of weekly readings, your only responsibility is a final paper. Mild workload, interesting class... definitely consider this class!"
