   "comments": [
    "I developed some knowledge of Latin American literary movements, such as Creacionismo and La Vanguardia, by taking this course. I slightly improved my Spanish-speaking skills.",
    "reading latin american literature and more background on specific authors.",
    "I learned so much about the meaning behind great works in Latin American Literature.",
    "I learned how to better read and understand texts in Spanish. I also developed a deep appreciation for Latin American Literature.",
    "Through reading and analyzing Spanish literature and poetry, I gained knowledge about Spanish cultural history, prominent Spanish authors and poets, and honed my reading abilities. Reading helped better my Spanish vocabulary and the ease with which I can read, understand and interpret Spanish text.",
    "Studying Literature",
    "I learned about and analyzed Latin American literature, ranging from letters to poems. I gained a greater understanding of the development of literature in Latin America as well as knowledge of various authors and their works. Additionally, I learned how to talk about the structures and styles of poetry that we read in class.",
    "I practiced reading and writing in spanish",
    "This class is less of a Spanish language class (grammar, vocabulary, speaking) and more a literature class taught in Spanish (writing, reading, content-driven lectures); that being said, I learned a lot about major literary movements, Latin American writers, and themes from important works -- and coupled with Prof. Adorno's accessibility and willingness to ensure every student understands the material, I took a lot out of the class in terms of the literary material.",
    "I developed extensive insight into different facets of Latin American literature through poetry, essays, novels, and stories by authors from different Latin American countries and time periods.",
    "I learned how to read literature slowly and deeply to extract everything possible from the text. I learned how to paraphrase an author's words and also provide insightful commentary about literature.",
    "Spanish writing, speaking and reading comprehension.",
    "I definitely was introduced to new literature. I don't know if my language skills were much broadened, but exercised in writing a bit.",
    "I learned a lot about the formulation and critical theory of Latin American literature, a lot of Spanish literary vocabulary, and poetry.",
    "I learned about hispanic writers and their work.",
    "I learned a lot about the culture of Latin America. I also improved my ability to read and write in Spanish. I think my Spanish ability grew a lot. I also learned a lot about different literary schools, like the vanguardia.",
    "I learned a few Spanish vocab words and phrases from the reading, as well as some tidbits on moderately well-known Latin American authors. That's about it.",
    "My writing skills in Spanish vastly improved through this course, and it was so helpful to gain baseline knowledge of the canon of Latin American Literature",
    "Outstanding! First-rate professional = always. I appreciate how class always started on time and concluded on time. The instructor was a non-anxious presence who treated other people well. I marvel at the sincere grace and dignity I felt in Dr. Adorno's responses to my emails. A master teacher: office hours where multiple students gathered and discussed\/listened\/reviewed was very helpful. Slides were current\/updated. I appreciate this as other Yale instructors have opened slides two or more years old without revision during class. The insights into the literature were strong: excellent themes and ways of understanding more in the human (not just Latin American) experience.",
    "I gained greater exposed to Latin American literature which described their cultural identity and the development of their own type of literature. We read from various authors and poets from various countries such as Mexico, Chile and Peru. Some themes we delved into included cultural identity, women's rights, and death.",
    "Gained a lot of knowledge about the coherent themes that ran throughout twentieth century latin american lit",
    "Language skills",
    "We became familiar with the works of famous Latin American authors. Studied new poetic devices",
    "I learned a lot about Spanish literature.",
    "I was familiarized with more influential Latin American authors of the 20th century than I had been before.",
    "I developed knowledge about a variety of Latin American authors and postcolonial thought in the region.",
    "reading of stories, poetry analysis and knowledge of poetry terminology",
    "I learned about a broad number of Latin American writers through an incredibly interesting choice of poems and passages. I think that the course was very good at giving the students a general notion of what Latin American literature is and definitely incentives us to pursue the field.",
    "Poem analysis",
    "The knowledge of great texts and Latin American Literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: This course has minimal work associated with it, and the tests are very easy. The course focuses on reading and understanding texts, rather than writing about them. This way, students are able to actually enjoy what they read, instead of being forced to write about it, as they would in an English literature class. That way, this course is structured with maximum learning and minimum work, which is great. This course cannot possibly be improved, because it is already the best it can be. Weakness: If one does not care about the material of this course, as was the case for me, it is very boring. However, this is no fault of the course itself or the instructor. This is the fault of Yale forcing its students to meet a language requirement, even when some students find no interest in that area at all. This course has no obligation to cater to students such as myself who knowingly take the course for an L5 requirement knowing full well that it does not interest them. Therefore, there is no actual weakness to this course. There is just a weakness in Yale's policy for distributional and skills requirements.",
    "can be a bit more interesting at times.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is by far Profesora Rolena Adorno. She loves to interact with students and makes an effort to know everyone's names and ask questions that relate not only to the work being studied but to life in general.",
    "Strengths: powerpoints, in-depth explanations of the texts Weaknesses: sometimes it was difficult to hear the professor",
    "This course surveyed a wide variety of authors and genres prominent in Latin American Literature, beginning with the origins of Latin American Literature and ending with the connections it has to topics in society. This was a great course overall and the only real weakness was that I wish there was more opportunity for critical discussion of the texts involved, but that is challenging when such lengthy texts are involved.",
    "I liked how the course was structured. We had weekly readings which were then discussed in class, and extremely fair exams on those readings. If you read the readings and went to class, you got a lot out of it. You can get away with not reading them if you go to class since we analyze the important aspects of the text, though you will get less out of and may find yourself lost if your Spanish vocabulary isnt great. A big benefit of reading it at home is looking up the words you dont know so you can have the translations ready come class discussion. Great class though super fair, great content in the readings and discussions, and Professor Adorno is great.",
    "Strengths: Interesting Topics Weaknesses: Teacher is quiet, hard to pick up main points of readings, fast paced discussion if not native speaker.",
    "The class was informative and the professor held office hours often. The course packet seems to be an unnecessary expense because the professor posted all of the powerpoints, which contained extensive quotes from the readings, to Canvas. The readings in their entirety could be posted to Canvas as well and spare the students the cost of the course packet.",
    "it wasn't the most interesting course because we didn't read much actual literature and often read essays talking about or analyzing literature. also it would have been nicer as a small seminar where you could be more engaged all the time. also some variety in class format would have made things more creative and engaging, and not always having the same types of slides\/lecture. also the assessments were not very exciting and maybe more essays would have been fun. the class could have included more short stories to read, or even incorporated some film\/other forms of culture. also i felt that we dida very shallow analysis of some works.",
    "I enjoyed most of the readings; the content certainly is interesting; however, I think the lectures could be more engaging with even more videos, close-readings, or analyses rather than just quotes from the readings displayed on the screen. I also think that the readings could include more secondary sources like analyses or reviews (especially for the poetry unit) just to get a bigger picture\/ understanding of the readings.",
    "Strengths: Exams are very clear on what you need to know, great TFs this semester, interesting pieces that we read Weaknesses: I did not find the poetry too engaging; I also wish we had learned more how to analyze texts ourselves rather than being told by the professor what is happening",
    "The strength of this course is that Professor Adorno makes herself very accessible and she is very willing to help you succeed. The weakness is that I personally failed to see the connections between each of the texts we read. Overall the class seemed very fragmented and out of focus, and I often didn't see the purpose in anything we read. Another weakness of this course is that the syllabus was changed several times, from material covered to what exams were happening when. That was not okay because when students shop for classes, they look at the syllabus and take into consideration how their schedule will fit together later in the school year with their other classes and extracurriculars. Changing the exam dates and formats unexpectedly was not convenient. The syllabus that was posted for this class at the beginning of school was completely different from what we actually covered. The syllabus I read during shopping period consisted of authors like gabriel garca mrquez and cervantes.",
    "It was interesting, not too challenging and had a manageable workload. I kind of wish we read an entire book.",
    "The course did not have difficult readings. The readings were valuable. The lectures were pretty straightforward summaries. But demands for exams, and what the significance of these works was was unclear. It was difficult to stay engaged or hear during lectures.",
    "I learned a lot about the fundamentals of Latin American literature and how to thoughtfully analyze selections of novels and poetry, as well as a lot of Spanish vocabulary. A main weakness was that we didn't get to do any writing or real in-class discussions, as this was a seminar that became a roughly 70 person lecture - I was never given the ability to analyze anything as deeply as I wanted or to make really deep connections or really explore one of my own ideas in depth. It could be simply improved by having a final paper instead of an exam, and largely improved by being smaller and having more thoughtful analysis.",
    "Strengths- very enjoyable and interesting; very kind professor. Weaknesses- not always the most engaging.",
    "The biggest strength is Professor Adorno. She is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. The biggest weakness is that the class size is too big. The class is taught as a lecture and would be much better as a seminar.",
    "The readings themselves were uninteresting and, in some cases, straight up bad. They also were unnecessarily to do - Professor Adorno spent every single lecture reviewing them word-by-word with no interesting analysis. The principal reason people like this course is because it's extremely easy.",
    "the course has great, engaging readings, but the lectures sometimes resulted in tangents about themes of the readings when I was still confused about the basic subject matter, exams were easy to understand",
    "Strengths = a present, active, engaged, and sincere professional of the highest integrity. The only recommendation is to be careful that often pensive moments or very reflective remarks during class in a low speaking voice were completely in audible across the room. It just seemed so contrary to the moment or counter to the spirit of Dr. Adorno's engagement to raise a hand and request a repeat (i.e., perceived by the assembly as not listening, indifference, disrespectful, etc.) so I did not.",
    "I believe that the strength of this course was forcing students to analyze various texts in such detail during class to truly understand the essays or poems. It didn't require active participation which many students enjoyed, but it did require students to pay attention and be prepared to answer any questions or read selected passages in front of the class. Students are also exposed to different types of texts from different authors to gain further exposure to Latin American literature.",
    "Really good readings",
    "Strengths: stories and poems were interesting to read and analyze. Professor Adorno is an engaging professor and makes class very interesting Weaknesses: in a large class, it's hard to get a class discussion going about a certain topic. Lectures could get a bit dull when there was no opportunity to debate an interpretation of a certain line. A smaller class would have been ideal.",
    "This course has an amazing professor but I feel the literature chosen to analyze was weak. The syllabus could have been more profound with more unique writings to analyze.",
    "More conversations between students",
    "The professor is a sweetheart. Some of the readings are really beautiful or thought-provoking. The exams are super straight forward.",
    "The strengths are that it is easy to follow but weaknesses are that there are few opportunities for discussion.",
    "course was always engaging, Adorno made every lecture interesting",
    "The course managed to give a very well balanced idea of what Latin American literature is through a great selection of writings, all done in very few classes. Nevertheless, I felt that the course lacked an analytical side to it, we never truly delved into the meaning of any of the writings, or criticized\/analyzed them thoroughly.",
    "Preambles could be more broad and open to other literature",
    "Prof. Adorno is very knowledgeable and passionate. However, I wish the class had allowed me to practice speaking more. Perhaps this could be done by allowing students to have small-group discussions.",
    "Strengths is the environment. It is a great learning environment."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in Latin American literature, or who needs to meet the language requirement. The course has no homework other than reading, and the tests are very easy. In class, you just reread the assigned reading and discuss it. Because the course was structured this way, students are able to actually enjoy what they read instead of being forced to write torturous responses about the reading, as would be the case in an English literature class. I do have one warning though: if you are taking this class just for the language credit, and you do not care about the material, it will be quite boring. That said, this class is still the best option for your language credit, because all other L5 courses are much more work. This is the most enjoyable way to get your language credit. If that warning does not apply to you, then you will love this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to everyone due to the interesting (and not too difficult) work, and the excellent professor.",
    "Yes, Professor Adorno is a wonderful professor and you will learn a lot in this class",
    "Definitely take this class if you want a pretty chill Spanish credit. You work on reading and a lot of the content you learn through the reading is very interesting, but dont expect to improve your speaking or listening abilities. Professor Adorno is great and offers great analysis of the texts in class (a product of this is you can get away with not reading the texts sometimes, though you may get cold called and feel stupid). Adorno gives great study guides for each exam that embody exactly what youll see on the test. Very predictable and fair. Enjoyed class discussions and readings.",
    "Yes, good course for Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that needs another course to earn the language certificate or if they want to continue to practice Spanish to maintain fluency. It is an interesting course with a professor that can convey literary analysis very well and is willing to answer any question and offer further explanations if necessary.",
    "no, however it is an easy class even if its not super interesting",
    "YES! This class super very nice and well-paced.",
    "I would recommend this course looking to learn about Latin American literature and maybe not necessarily to become a fluent Spanish speaker. Writing and reading are benefits of the course, but it is mainly a literature class taught in Spanish. Prof. Adorno is a fantastic professor and a wonderful human being, so I would definitely recommend taking this class for an interesting but not super intimidating L5 Spanish class.",
    "Yes! Not a stressful class at all, but still read very interesting works.",
    "Overall, I would absolutely not recommend this course. I guess if you are looking for an extremely easy fifth class, go for it, because it was quite easy to get away without reading. But in my opinion, this class was not meaningful or fulfilling, and I gained absolutely nothing. There are more insightful and engaging classes out there with the same workload that I could have spent my time on to enrich myself as a person. Choose wisely.",
    "Yes, it was not too challenging and it was fairly interesting.",
    "I would recommend this to a student that doesn't need to improve language skills and would enjoy the readings. I also recommend this course to someone that wants to take a quicker L5 class if they're not really interested in the language. Otherwise I would not recommend. It's very hard to be engaged with.",
    "Overall, yes - I improved my ability to read and write Spanish and learned a lot of critical theory about Spanish literature. The level of engagement was quite low - it's easy to do well without being super engaged in the material, but Prof. Adorno does a really good job of making the readings understandable.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, for an enjoyable semester of reading some great works by hispanic writers! Probably won't improve your spoken Spanish much, but at least is some weekly practice. Very relaxed class, probably because Adorno was nice enough to let everyone in so we had a lecture instead of a seminar.",
    "Yes. If you have any interest in Latin America or if you like Spanish or literature, definitely take this course.",
    "I would not, unless the student really needs an easy A. It alone made me decide to stop pursuing the Advanced Language Certificate in Spanish.",
    "Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to take a pretty straightforward higher level course and do some reading without having to do too much complicated writing",
    "100% recommended -- masterful teaching, relevant material, strong readings, and fair, highly organized assessments.",
    "I would recommend that you have a confident level of Spanish reading, listening, and comprehension to be able to follow along closely with the texts and lectures. It isn't completely necessary, but it would help. I think that the course is well organized for you to read and learn about Latin American literature with a large group of other students, many of whom are native speakers. All in all, the class had a light workload and exams weren't overly difficult to study for. Participation in class wasn't strictly enforced because there were too many students, but you must be present to class each day and pay attention in case you are called upon.",
    "I definitely would, especially if they're just looking to fulfill the language req. It's very easy but also pretty interesting. The number of people in the class meant you never had to speak if you didn't want to.",
    "Yes! It was fun",
    "If you're looking for a humanities credit or an L5 credit, this class is perfect. Low workload and class can be very interesting.",
    "Yes I would. The teachers and TAs are great and I enjoyed my time in class.",
    "Absolutely! Take it if Adorno is teaching it",
    "If the student is learning how to speak Spanish and wants to learn about Latin American literature, then yes, absolutely. It is very well structured, the teachers are incredibly helpful and the readings are very interesting. However, as a native spanish speaker, I thought that the course was quite light and expected a more analytical side to it.",
    "Yes. The professor is so passionate",
    "Yes if they are not comfortable with Spanish. It is not really a Literature class because there is minimal analysis."
