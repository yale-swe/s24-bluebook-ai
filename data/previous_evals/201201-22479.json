    "Its a gut and I took as a fifth course for a GPA booster.",
    "I'm undecided as to whether I would suggest Vikings to another student. The lectures are disorganized and hard to follow much of the time and the final is incredibly specific and therefore difficult to do well on. It doesn't require very much work and the content is pretty interesting, but don't sign up for it thinking that this is a total gut.",
    "Easy english class, with an interesting perspective of vikings history. I recommend this class because it is interesting yet it does not have a large course load.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone with the slightest interest in pre-Medieval history",
    "Yes it was very interesting and a fun course",
    "Take it for Anders. Vikings are pretty cool.",
    "I took this class because of a legitimate interest in Viking culture, and I'm happier than a puppy with two peters that I took it. A lot of people took this course with the intention of it being an easy credit, and I'm sure you could make it work like that. As for myself, I did the readings and put in a lot of work, and trust me, if you want to get something out of the course there is a lot of work to do. But I feel like I gained a lot from it. Some people complained about the course getting a little boring, but I reckon they didn't do the readings. The readings are really very interesting, especially some of the more \"Wtf Vikings?\" sagas like Egil's Saga.The professors are radical too. Anders Winroth tries to cater to the college-aged audience, and I liked him. Roberta Frank was awesome. too. Her lectures were very informative and interesting, more so if you want to understand the nuances of Viking literature. Also, I could never pinpoint her accent, which added a degree of mystery to the course.",
    "This was a really cute class, that I am glad I had the opportunity to take. I really appreciated the enthusiasm and knowledge of the professors on a topic that is relatively obscure. I wish that more students came to lecture\/ took a genuine interest in the class because this class was very limiting in that sense.",
    "no. incredibly boring and i felt like i didnt learn anything important.",
    "Take it if you need a fifth class or are short on european\/pre-industrial credits. It's a fun way to just learn a whole lot about a pretty obscure and distant era, without having to stress too much.",
    "Take this class.",
    "This is a terrible class. Actually though. It's a huge gut and there's pretty much no work until you hit the final and then they just try to kill you. I'm pretty sure everyone failed it. There's no reason to take it. The lack of work does not make it worth it because it's that miserable. Don't let the adorable lectures of shopping period fool you. DON'T DO IT.",
    "I would not. It makes Dilemma's of the Nuclear Age look like the most interesting class taught at this university.",
    "pretty easy class but can be viciously boring.",
    "I would recommend it, it's an interesting course with not too much work. Although the final is difficult to prepare for.",
    "Overall fun history class with two professors that really love the course material",
    "Easy, fun, interesting. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Vikings! is not purely a gut. It is really interesting, and as a person who did all the readings, it wasn't actually that much work. The hardest part of the class, honestly, is the final exam - it was all identification (passages or people\/things) and some of the questions were ridiculously difficult. Anders is a wonderful lecturer and wears the best bow-ties. Roberta is really intelligent and knows a lot about linguistics of Old Norse, but is not the best lecturer (she reads her entire \"script\" for lecture). Overall, it is not a difficult class, and the material is interesting. If you aren't interested in Viking Age literature, don't take it.",
    "If you need the credit... a few of thelectures are interesting, but most are not. No need to go to class if you do the readings though. I needed an English credit for pre-med. Grading is fairly lenient, especially if you have a nice TA. Still, could find a more interesting gut - viking history is not so interesting.",
    "We all know what Vikings is, but you shouldn't expect to coast through without doing ANY work. You can get through the map quiz... And now that I think about it, probably the 2 short essays too. But if you don't do at least some of the reading, you will crash and burn on the final. Not kidding. It's just too much material to cover\/familiarize oneself with in time to do well. Otherwise, I found it to be a pretty enlightening\/interesting class, and a good way to get rid of pre-industrial reqs if you're planning to be a history major. Also, great for bio majors and sci people who are used to rapidly memorizing facts. Oh yea, they also teach you how to write in runes; useless but awesome!",
    "I would recommend Vikings to a fellow student. It is a unique course covering material that you will most likely never hear about for the rest of your life. It's a fun class with a light workload and was enjoyable.",
    "Definitely recommended, although the final is kind of a hit or miss. It's very subjective with little room to display what you actually know or learned about the class.",
    "Yes--sometimes the lectures are dull but it really is a great overview of the Viking Age. I learned a lot and it was fun.",
    "No laptops or phones are allowed during lecture. The class is pretty easy up until the final \"quiz\" which is all recognition of passages and IDs, and is very very hard. It got curved pretty heavily this semester for sure.",
    "Take it, but do the readings! By putting in minimal effort you will get a good grade, but it's easy to slack of completely. The final quiz is really hard but there is a great curve.",
    "good preindustrial for a history major",
    "English 154 01 is a good class to take if you are interested in any of the following; the history of the vikings, viking mythology and literature, or the conversion of scandiavian to christianity.",
    "Good credit for a history major",
    "My interest had first been piqued because I love Norse mythology and Scandinavian culture so I was hoping that this would be a fun, low-stress way to learn more about this beloved subject. Unfortunately, that is not this class. If you have a good TA, you can learn quite a lot just by doing the readings and going to section but lectures were oftentimes disorganized and repetitive (I fell asleep a fair number of times during lectures out of boredom). Take it if you want an easy gut and don't care if it will bore you two hours every week. Otherwise, skip this class.",
    "Take it. So much fun.",
    "Take it! If you have ever been curious about Vikings, Scandinavian culture, or what was going on before the Middle Ages, this is definitely a cool class. It teaches you about what was really occurring during the Dark Ages and how Viking contributions related to the formation of the European monarchies. Also, I really enjoyed the language aspect of relating Old Norse to English and studying the kennings in the poetry passages.",
    "Never in a billion years.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is on an interesting topic that is often overlooked, even though it remains very culturally significant in present times.",
    "I would recommend it as there is little work and yet it is interesting",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it as a fifth class maybe. A fun class with interesting assignments that is also pretty light on work. Except do only take it if you are genuinely interested in learning about the topic. Its frustrating sometimes when half the class is there only to get a credit.",
    "I would recommend it, very few courses where the professors are so enthusiastic about the topic they are teaching!",
    "A relatively low-intensity class that will introduce you to a relatively understudied and misunderstood topic.",
    "Not super interesting, but really easy so take it if you want a fun class that you don't have to do a ton of work for!",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student because it is a good course to take to broaden your knowledge.",
    "I would recommend it. Interesting class content and great TA.",
    "Easy 5th class. take it",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is an easy class on an interesting subject. It takes very little work and gives good grades, while still being somewhat interesting. Anders is a great lecturer, Roberta less so. Take it if you're looking for an easy fifth class.",
    "Yes, great class with not too much work.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Extremely interesting topic, with interesting professors, and a manageable work load.",
    "Almost no work through the semester. Study for the final though. Seriously. Study for it. People thought the final would be a joke and were really disappointed because it was very specific. Final is based a lot off of readings but you could definitely do well on it if you had paid attention in class, but from what I could tell a lot of people didn't show up to lecture.",
    "I tried this class to do something new. Unless you like Viking culture and literature a lot, I wouldn't take it because it is hard to focus on the material.",
    "Very easy way to knock out your pre-industrial history requirement.",
    "No I would not recommend Vikings. Poorly taught and disorganized. Unless you want to be surrounded by tons of athletes looking for a gut but who never actually come to class, don't bother. There are better and more interesting classes out there. The reading list is boring and poorly chosen, and there's really no point in doing the readings anyway because you'll never have to engage with them.",
    "Didn't have to do a lot of work. Definitely a history class. Yes I would",
    "Take it if you're interested in Vikings and want a humanities credit. None of the assignments are too long and as long as you do the readings you will be fine for the final (put effort into studying for the final, don't assume that it will be a cakewalk).",
    "It's interesting material, but could have been presented better during lecture. The lectures were not very engaging.",
    "Vikings was super easy. As long as you do the readings and go to section, you'll be fine. If you don't do the readings and still go to section- you still might do okay. And if you are just really interested in Viking culture and Scandinavia then you'll have a great time.",
    "A pretty easy fifth class on a subject rarely taught. The assignments aren't bad, but definitely do the readings and go to lecture.",
    "yes",
    "Vikings! is a great survey course about a group of people about whom you probably know way less than you think youdo! It does a good job of challenging your preconceptions about the early Scandinavian people, and thinking about bias and stereotype in primary and secondary documents. I absolutely recommend it for someone who is looking for a kind of unusual English class, but would warn that this isn't a gut--if you slack on the readings, you'll regret it at the end of the semester!",
    "It's ridiculously easy and ridiculously boring class really. some interesting material presented in a pretty dull way but I did enjoy learning about Vikings particularly the journey to Vinland.",
    "I recommend this class if you're interested in Vikings and will do the reading.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning about the history as well as the roots of many English roots that stem from Norse.",
    "Great course if you don't know anything about Vikings. Definitely one of those must-take Yale courses.",
    "It's a great course for having fun and learning about history in an interactive and relaxed atmosphere.",
    "Not unless you have a strong interest in the subject material, because otherwise it will be extremely boring.",
    "Starts out strong, but loses momentum quickly. Study for the final quiz, or it will bite you.",
    "Vikings gives a topical overview of the Vikings through the lens of history and literature. It roughly covers the period from the 9th century through the 11th century and focuses predominantly on Viking culture and exploration.",
    "It's a fairly easy class;as long as you read the major works (easy and fast reads)and do about half of the readings you'll be fine. I'd say its a history gut.",
    "I guess if you are into Vikings and Norse history (basis just a chronology of who-kills-who and how) taught by an unbearably bore professor, this class is for you. Not a great class, but not a lot of work. After the first two weeks, I couldn't take the lectures any more. Much more productive just to go to section and do the reading.",
    "Take it...good change of pace from normal school work...lectures can be a bit dry though",
    "A fun and low-stress class. Gives you a great picture of what the Viking Age was like and covers all bases. Skaldic verse and court poetry is pretty boring IMO, but it does a good job of keeping it as interesting as possible. Take this course if you want a a low stress, low-work credit with generous grading.",
    "Interesting course material, but if you are genuinely interested, find a good section. A lot of people take the class for its gut qualities.Also, don't approach this as a gut. The workload may be light in terms of what you turn in, but the reading list is INTENSE and it will be clear from the final whether you read or not.",
    "Great introduction course to the viking age that gives you a new appreciation of this ancient society.",
    "It was what we thought it would be.",
    "The class has a very reasonable workload and the lectures aren't bad. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for an english credit (total gem for premeds who need English but don't want an intensive writing course).",
    "Honestly, just open up an encyclopedia and read about Vikings. The work was not too much, but the lectures could be really painfully boring (I went to every single one). Some information was sincerely interesting, but I do not think there was enough awesome stuff to fill an entire semester's worth of 2 lectures a week and 1 section.",
    "Deceptively hard with the final exam. As challenging, otherwise, as you want it to be.Recommended? Yes.",
    "If you do the reading for this class and put in some work on the essay and map quiz, you will have an enjoyable time in Vikings. The lectures are tempting to skip, but the subject material is actually pretty interesting. I would recommend this course to students interested in the Vikings looking for a 4th or 5th credit."
