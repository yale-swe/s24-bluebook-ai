   "comments": [
    "It's great, especially taken with the lecture, as it explains a lot of what you do in class and makes it not seem so out of context. The lab write-ups vary from being exceptionally long and arduous to very easy to explain, but overall if you manage your time well it's usually not a problem. As a lab, it's definitely a good choice.",
    "The lab course is much more enjoyable than the lecture, and the experiments are fun and you almost never get to stay for long hours. Make sure to talk to your TA and get feedback from them often to continually do well on your lab reports. I feel the marking gets stricter over the course of semester.",
    "YESit's a cool lab. Take it!",
    "A fun lab, low-stress (in-lab, at least. the reports, on the other hand, were LONG), and much better and more educationally-valuable than the genetics lecture.",
    "Good lab - well organized, sometimes long but usually not, relevant and well-timed. You'll enjoy it more than the lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to students interested in genetics. Out of the lab courses I've taken at Yale, and I've taken quite a few, this was one of the better ones. The experiments that we performed in lab complemented the topics we covered in lecture, especially towards the middle and end. I felt like I knew what I was doing in lab, and why I was doing it, which is often rare in a lab course. Be warned, though, the lab reports can take a really long time to write, so start as soon as possible. I took the Monday section, so for weekends when labs were due, I practically did nothing but work on my lab the entire weekend. However, lab reports were only due every other week or so, so there seem to be weeks where you don't have anything to do, and then suddenly there's a mad dash to write a lab report. It doesn't help that you can't start working on it until you've finished all the experiments, so you will have less than a week to write really long lab reports. That being said, they are manageable if you understand what's going on, and they aren't overly complex.I guess your lab experience depends on your T.A., too, and that's a variable you can't really control. I liked the T.A. so that probably helped make the class better. Overall, this was a good lab course that I would recommend to other students majoring in MCDB, EEB, or any other students just interested in learning about genetics.",
    "It's a good and relaxed biology lab and interesting! I highly recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend. It's an interesting class with fun labs and reasonable grading.",
    "Genetics Lab is a pretty well-structured lab course in genetics. You're given somewhat more freedom with the lab reports than you might in, say, orgo lab, which is nice. I'd recommend it if you need a bio lab.",
    "Helpful for understanding concepts taught in the lecture course. Useful for learning basic techniques.",
    "Good lab class. I definitely felt as though my knowledge of genetics improved and it was really helpful to be able to practice the techniques that we heard about in lecture.",
    "It is A LOT of work. Be prepared. It's definitely not an easy A. The lab reports are arbitrarily graded. There are four pop quizzes over the course of the semester so you have to read the lab before class.",
    "A basic Bio lab. not too bad. reports weren't bad at all, and only every other week. the quizzes were dead easy. Take it if you want a somewhat boring and easy lab.",
    "An extremely easy lab if you've had lab experience (internships?) in cell biology labs before. You do all the expected procedures, like transforming E. coli, running gel electrophoresis, PCR, and sequencing DNA. That being said, there are weekly quizzes on the lab procedures and background. If you get a fair TA, life's great and you don't have to deal with a nitpicky grader and possibly easier quizzes (the TAs make their own quizzes). The lab reports do get a little dense though, even with 5-6 page limits of text, so make sure you have at least 1 entire evening free every week to devote it purely to writing up a lab report for a 0.5 credit class.",
    "It was an okay lab. Sometimes interesting, sometimes tedious. It wasn't a lot of work overall, but if, like most people, you don't plan out and distribute the work it tends to mound up and result in long nights.",
    "It's a great lab - we did interesting experiments, answered challenging questions in our lab reports, and often got out early. The only problem is that the accompanying lecture course is very poorly taught.",
    "Great lab. Start labs early. (Not the night before!) Expect to spend at least a whole day writing a lab report and check with your lab partner to make sure that everything is in order and that you both reached the same conclusions. Expect to work hard and earn your 0.5 credits. This class sometimes feels like 1.5 credits.",
    "Its not a bad lab to take if you need an upper level lab... but it's an intro lab so has all the boring things you would expect to come with it.",
    "It is not fun. Make sure you go over your labs with your TA so that you know exactly what they expect.",
    "I would definitely recommend genetics lab. It's way more fun than the lecture and if you need to take a lab, this is one of the best ones I've taken at Yale.",
    "It's pretty difficult but the labs are fairly interesting.",
    "pretty chill lab. dawson is nice. labs only take about two hours each week, so they're not tedious. reports can be frustrating to write, though, because the instructions for writing them are very vague.",
    "Yes, I thought this was one of the better labs I've taken at Yale. I liked the instructors and my TA. The experiments were also interesting.",
    "Standard bio lab with reports every other week. Fair enough. Pretty good experiments. 4 quizzed throughout the semester. Do it with a friend to be lab partners with",
    "This was a relatively easy lab course. It gave a good overview of the different model organisms used in genetics and helped us practice some of the techniques described in Genetics class. I would recommend it if you have to take Genetics as it made the material more engaging.",
    "Much better than MCDB202 although you must take both concurrently. Helps understanding of the lecture but is hardly anything extraordinary.",
    "This is a great more or less intro level bio lab. Professor Dawson is funny and a terrific instructor. You get to work with a good variety of organisms (E. coli, yeast, Drosophila, Arabidopsis) and perform common lab techniques like DNA extraction, cloning, and PCR. The techniques, however, are fairly basic if you have any prior lab experience. The workload for the class is manageable if you start early on your lab reports, which range from 4-15 pages and are due every other week. I'd definitely recommend itif you're taking MCDB 202 Genetics as well, or as an elective bio lab if you don't have extensive lab experience.",
    "Actually, I would. At first, I thought to myself that I would never take this lab if I knew how many reports there were to write up. But, if you get started on them early enough, the lab is not terrible at all compared to the other biology labs.",
    "This is a wonderful course to take if you will be working in a genetics lab. We learned a large amount of techniques that I have found to be useful in my own labwork and wish I had taken this course earlier because it would have helped me in my own work. The workload is not too much and it is great preparation for future research.",
    "I was a very interesting course. Sometimes the lab reports were hard to write and very complicated but I still enjoyed the labs. They helped me learn the concepts for the Genetics class.",
    "If you need a bio lab this is a good one to take. The lab reports are not too difficult since there are reasonable page limits. Also, the experiments themselves actually increase your understanding of the subject unlike most labs.",
    "It was a very relaxed environment in which to acquire basic biological laboratory techniques. The lab handouts were quite helpful, the workload manageable, and the instructors supportive. I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Sometimes when you're in lab, you have no idea why you're doing some of the things you're doing. You end up learning about what, and why you did thing slater when you write the report. It might be a good lab for someone who has done a lot of lab work before, because genetics lab is pretty elementary in its lab techniques.",
    "Laboratory work can be long and monotonous, but the biggest part of the course are the lab reports, which require a lot of work. I would not recommend the course unless it is necessary for certain requirements.",
    "Chances are if you are looking at this class, you need to take it for medical school. Do it. This lab is well organized and interesting. You get to do pretty cool stuff and it's easier to get in to than a lot of other biology labs. It's a good class. I recommend it to any biology major or pre-med student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab. It is pretty fun, though the lab reports are time consuming."
