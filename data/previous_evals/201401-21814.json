    "If it gets restructured, then yeah take it. Also only take it if demographic processes and patterns are of interest to you. If you only have a vague interest you'll be bored. There are two midterms, a final, a presentation, and a final project. The project isn't too bad, except that some of the data he asked us to collect didn't exist for certain nations and he refused to believe it did not exist. The finals and midterms do not test your understanding of the concepts, it tests your ability to memorize and regurgitate information. So if you can memorize every fact on all of the slides, including the graphs (he would sometimes just put a graph with some of the labels missing and be like what should this label be? It was kind of off-putting) then you'll do fine on the exams. If you can't do this, I don't recommend you take this class. Or I recommend you take it Credit\/D. The class is definitely doable, just if I know what I know now, I would have not taken it or I would have taken it Credit\/D.",
    "This is the first time this class has been offered, so it may be improved in the future. That being said, I would not recommend taking it. I found it slow and boring for the most part, and ended the class having learned surprisingly little over the course of the semester.",
    "It's a real privilege to have this class fill a regrettable gap in course offerings at Yale. Demography is an incredibly important subject and I was glad to have the opportunity to take it with Prof. Wood, who is a great lecturer."
