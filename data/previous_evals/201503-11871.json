    "English 120 is a thoroughly enjoyable class in which you get to read and discuss genuinely engaging essays and greatly develop your skills as a writer through the development and workshopping of five different personal essays that each cover a different theme or topic. It will undoubtedly change the way you think about the traditional essays that you're used to writing for other classes.",
    "If you are interested in improving your creative nonfiction writing, this is the class for you! I had so much fun in this class, and the workload is very manageable. The readings are short and (generally) very interesting.",
    "ENG 120 is a class in which you read essays that teach you how to write essays; if you value learning how to write clearly and persuasively about personal matters and not, I would definitely recommend ENG 120 to you.",
    "ENGL 120 is a great class for enthusiastic writers. With effort, your writing will improve greatly through this class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is an amazing writing class. The style of essay is so much more engaging than the standard English paper, and the loose structure lets you be much more creative. This class is hard, but all Yale English classes are going to be hard, and you will improve dramatically as the semester progresses if you work at it. For this class you read a few professional essays before ever meeting and then go over them as a class looking for the author's strategies. If you are working on an essay, the class will workshop a few of the essays together.",
    "A class that, more than anything, trains you to listen for and reproduce the \"Writerly Voice,\" the \"I-Character\" that makes personal essay such an intriguing medium.",
    "English 120 is an incredible class that will challenge you to change the way you have been taught to write essays in high school and learn how to read with the understanding that every word was chosen specifically and every sentence structured for a reason. Learning how to read for rhetorical strategy is critical to improving your writing. Although I initially struggled but improved so so much. I highly recommend this class.",
    "If you love discussing readings in class, want to be exposed to a new genre of writing (at least for me), love reading and love writing, this class is for you. If you don't, then this class can still be the one for you.",
    "If you enjoy writing, TAKE THIS CLASS! You will watch your writing blossom, and you'll definitely carry the skills you learn long into the future. The style of writing you learn will very likely be something you haven't done before, or at least not to this depth, which means that you'll learn a lot (and the \"modern essay\" style is very useful!). While there are a lot of essays to write, it never quite felt like \"work\" to me. If you can, take it with Shifra! She's not only a wonderful professor, but also a wonderful person; she will teach you how to glean writing techniques from other authors and how to use them yourself, and she'll encourage you along the way as your writing improves."
