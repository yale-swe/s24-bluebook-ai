   "comments": [
    "Useful material",
    "very good.",
    "The course is really well-designed to help students learn the material and keep it relevant throughout the course. The homework assignments are awesome study guides for the exams and everything builds on previous lectures and topics so it makes putting in the effort to learn everything and have it stick really worth it. I understand the class is limited by time and scope but I would appreciate seeing more diverse examples of studies or measures of association to bring in more topics from public health in general.",
    "really liked the section and the applied readings. i also felt it was organized in a very coherent and understandable manner.",
    "great lesson. love the discussion section and my TA Elise.",
    "Strengths: The information is presented in a clear and straightforward manner. Dr. Niccolai appears comfortable in her role as a lecturer. Many opportunities to practice what we have learned in class with the homeworks and practice problems.",
    "Strengths: provide very detailed perspectives into basic topics of epidemiology, very systematic and clear Weaknesses: I guess open book\/open notes exams would be more feasible.",
    "I think I've learned the most in this class than I have in basically any other class I've taken at Yale. Everything is related back to real-world cases, and the material is taught really well. The slides were very helpful and the homeworks were hard but representative of what we had learned the previous week. Assessments were fair, as well.",
    "Very clear lectures and p-sets that prepared you for exams.",
    "Good overview of material; ample opportunities to ask questions and further understanding; approachable and thorough",
    "Strengths: Provides the resources to develop a strong understanding of the basics of epidemiology Weakness: In addition to going over our weekly homework, we should discuss a case study and use that week's material to resolve 'unknowns' of the study. This would help us learn the material more rapidly and identify areas of misunderstanding.",
    "The structure worked really, really well for learning the material. The homework, since it was pass-fail, was a really low-pressure way to learn the material. The lectures were straightforward and engaging. I confess that I seldom did the reading by the lecture, although I did catch up before each exam.",
    "The way it's taught in this course, we mainly focus on formulas, instead of truly looking at epi, which was unfortunate.",
    "strenghts: - The teacher's skills to teach and the way she lead us through the material. - The homeworks, that even they are sometimes painful, they helped us to keep learning the materials. - The review sessions, same as above, help solving doubts for those who do not like to go to office hours. - The Practice problems and review class, very helpfulf for solving doubts and strenghten our knowledge.",
    "By far my favorite course both in terms of content and teaching style. All core courses at YSPH should follow the organization-style of these lessons. I appreciated how accessible the material was given how it was presented, as well as the diverse range of research topics used as examples (as opposed to focusing solely on the research interests of a professor). Professor Niccolai was always accessible while maintaining the interest of others in class in regards to getting through material, and the teaching assistants were extremely helpful. The style of homework and review in TA sessions were a great way to practice mastery of the material while offering a low-pressure environment in TA sessions to ask questions and thoroughly grasp concepts taught in class.",
    "it's a good class. epidemiology is an important and useful skill."

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great teacher. the best course this semester.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great. Entertaining and enthusiastic. Flexible.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good teacher!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She gives very clear lecture and has a great knowledge in epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Our professor is really wonderful!! Linda broke everything down really helpfully and organized the class really well. When we didn't understand something, she was very receptive to questions. I especially appreciated the review sessions she held--rather than just going through and telling us all the answers for the practice test, she broke down specific concepts that the class seemed to be struggling on. She would take the time to try and explain it in a new light to see if we would understand it better that way, which was extremely helpful. This was definitely one of my favorite classes because it was so well taught.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very clear in her instruction and welcoming in persona. No surprises, and the pace was just right. Plenty of resources available for those who need help.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very very clear lecturer with good slide sets.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0approachable; knowledgeable of material; willing and happy to assist",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: Excellent at answering technical questions and explaining material in multiple ways. She also applies the material in class using case studies, which dissipates misunderstandings and gives the students ample opportunities to ask questions. She teaches the entire course like a narrative, which is extremely helpful to remember the content. Weaknesses: The instructor is wary of responding to questions on the topics that are outside her area of expertise. I think she should anticipate questions on disparities and inequalities that students may ask in response to the case studies she presents.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She did a simply fantastic job. Good balance between being responsive to students and keeping the lectures on track time-wise.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Mediocre professor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is amazing, the best teacher I had this semester!! Thanks!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0See previous question- by far best professor, not only with her own impressive research, but also capable of teaching the subject.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think the class was well taught, although I wish there was more emphasis in teaching based off of problems as was done in review sessions."

   "comments": [
    "You learn about principles of epidemiology I that is useful.",
    "useful course.",
    "Very good course for public health, provides a solid epi foundation without being too focused on any one specific topic so it could be easily translated to any research interest.",
    "great",
    "Great course, strongly recommended.",
    "It's a good class. I would recommend taking it even if you don't have to. It provides a good foundation that will help you read and interpret epi literature. The only thing I found difficult is all the memorization! For the final, there's probably at least 15- 20 equations you have to have memorized. That's a lot. I think it's a good class but fairly time intensive because there's so many exams throughout the semester.",
    "yes",
    "Recommend it.",
    "This is a great course! I dreaded taking this requirement at first, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes this semester because I felt I learned so much. And Linda is amazing! She makes class fun and really takes the time to explain concepts if you have questions about them.",
    "This is a requirement but very useful",
    "Would def recommend thus course; it is a necessary component of public health and i found myself using this information in all of my classes; extremely useful",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is seeking to understand the basics of epidemiology. I am considering taking the second part to this course next semester because upperclassmen told me that the course didn't teach enough basic skills to truly apply epidemiology skills at a workplace.",
    "Definitely. Great overview of epidemiological principles.",
    "It's a required course.",
    "Excelent! This is everything that I expected from a core course.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "You need to take this. It's really not too bad."
