    "An ability to deal with primary sources and an in-depth knowledge of London.",
    "I feel like this course helped improve my reading skills. There was a lot of very dense material that was assigned, and it was a challenge sometimes to get through all of it and be prepared to speak knowledgeably in class.",
    "This is a great course in studying \"micro-history\" and using \"on the ground\" primary sources to learn about very particular things in very particular places.",
    "I gained skills in evaluating time period through a cultural lens, rather than a normal chronological series of events."

   "comments": [
    "The course has no weaknesses - the assignments are varied and interesting, the readings were always relevant and fascinating, and Professor Wrightson creates a lovely environment during the seminar. A superb course all round.",
    "I felt as though the reading list could have been cut down a little bit. I really liked the primary source bits of it, but I felt as though every week was a struggle to read everything for class. Professor Wrightson was definitely a highlight of the class. He is so knowledgeable about the subject, and clearly has a real passion for London. It was really fun getting to see him speak about it every week.",
    "Great professor - very patient, kind, and enthusiastic about the material!",
    "Strengths were excellent facilitation of discussion by the professor and engaging texts and student presentations."

   "comments": [
    "A wonderful course if you are interested in London and particularly social history - you will not learn about the politics or chronological history of the time. Professor Wrightson is a wonderful, engaging professor, who fosters a nice, calm atmosphere in his seminars.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course, but you obviously need to have an interest in the period and in English history. London may seem like a very specific topic, but theres so much to talk about just in the city alone. There's a lot of reading, but i found it all interesting, especially the primary sources. And Professor Wrightson is great. You should definitely take a class with him at some point.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--especially to those in the history major looking for a pre-industrial class. London is a fascinating place, and Professor Wrightson really knows what he's talking about. That said, the reading list is pretty thick. The workload is pretty light too--only a couple of short papers. Definitely glad I took this class.",
    "Yes! This is a class in which you can simply enjoy learning and enjoy the history - the professor just wants you to be engaged with the texts and immerse yourself in individuals' lives in early modern London.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed it",
    "I would recommend this class and would caution students against repeating my mistakes. I really wish I had been more engaged in this seminar, because it was a comprehensive case study in cultural history, using London as an example. It wasn't always very engaging, but I absolutely could have tried harder to participate. This is a class where you get as much out of it as you put in.",
    "I would. It caters to quite a specific interest, but if early modern Europe appeals to you, this is pretty much the best class you could take. Really pleasant."
