    "This class has been instrumental in shaping my composition ability and providing me with new tools to apply to my compositions. Most specifically helpful were the lessons on modulations, which I was immediately able to incorporate into my composing and make all of my music much more exciting. I was also surprised to see how much I learned about the field of music theory as a part of the humanities in general: about problems with diversity in the field and the revision we must do in order to prevent the Western canon from gaining any further supremacy over other music.",
    "Harmonic and metrical analysis from late classical through Debussy\/Bartok, a nice focus on modulation and part-writing. Both looking at a score and talking about it and listening to a score and talking aobut it",
    "In addition to learning the \"tricks of the trade\" for 19th-century Romantic music, I also gained experience composing and writing analytical papers about music."

   "comments": [
    "The class was extremely well-organized and well-taught. I can't think of any weaknesses off the top of my head.",
    "Might be cool to include a bit more composition than analysis. This course tends to be heavier on the analysis sideI personally loved it, though",
    "The major challenge for the music department right now is to situate the Western tradition that it teaches within a global context and empower students to critically examine, not just idolize, the works of dead white European composers. That being said, this course is well-designed to teach what it currently teaches."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in writing music. As a composer, you will learn so much about why things work the way they do.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in improving music theory, pls take! Yes, it's a western art music focused course, but we do look at examples from a diverse selection of artists\/genres :) Workload is really light for the amount I gained from the course (2-ish hours a week max in a normal, non-paper\/project week)",
    "yes!",
    "Yes! It wasn't too difficult but I still learned a lot."
