    "The workload is relatively high compared to other courses, but it is useful and makes you a better economist. Below I have marked the workload as heavy, the pace fast, and the difficulty hard, but I mean those positively - a grad course should be pushing you.",

    "This course is good if you are interested in labor economics. The week-to-week work is not heavy, but the final will be challenging if you haven't been following along."
