   "comments": [
    "Great class- lots of independent work if you want to do it. Great reading. It changes the way you think about the types of sources you can use and how you write history.",
    "I would recommend it. It is interesting, the workload is manageable and the final paper is fun to write.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It managed to thread the needle between broadness and specificity, and allowed students to follow their own interests.",
    "The class involves reading a series of representative microhistorical works by theme, which apply a range of microhistorical methodologies.Regardless of the historical field, I would recommend this class to any student in the history department, as the framework can apply to most subjects of study.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student who wishes to explore an array of literature outside of their geographic area and time period, and to do so amongst a group of colleagues who can provide valuable outside critique of a work-in-progress. It is also a great course for practicing various writing styles, and provides a wonderful opportunity to explore the archives and special collections at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "This class was a great opportunity to craft one's own project and work with original documents while engaging with a unique and thought provoking historiography. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I will be focusing on a particular historical figure for my dissertation, and studying contemporary social and political movements, as well as intellectual currents. As such, this course will be very useful as a means to frame individual chapters of my dissertation.",
    "Perhaps more than any course I've taken so far, this one left me both with a stronger link to the history department at Yale, as well as a stronger sense of myself as a student of a chosen discipline (as opposed to a chosen area). I have a much greater appreciation and respect for the art of my profession now."
