    "Yes, great overview class. Professor Zinn is a great lecturer.",

    "Information dump. Surprisingly interesting course.",
    "This was Zinn's first year teaching it, also the first qualitative science class I've taken in a long time.",
    "Bring your best astronomy game, since there's a lot of concepts in stellar astronomy at the beginning. The galactic classification and cosmology near the end is really interesting and worth the wait."
