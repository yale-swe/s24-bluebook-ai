    "MUSI 211 was a rigorous course where you learn many techniques composers used and gain the tools needed to analyze more complex music. I would ultimately recommend this class because the tools from MUSI 210 are finally applied to all kinds of music.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It is a great way to further your analysis skills, learn useful chromatic techniques, and practice writing about music and composing. Take it with Professor McCreless if you can- he is incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and goes above and beyond to make the course a good experience for his students.",
    "this class would have been of more value if my ear training had been more advanced (i was taking 218 concurrently, perhaps with 219 or afterwards would be appropriate). often times we would review a harmonic concept (aug 6, neopolitan, etc), have to write a few for homework, and then for the rest of the semester be expected to hear it in pieces pretty fluently. it isn't a threat to your grade if you don't hear it fluently, but the class was taught under that assumption, which makes it less fulfilling when it moves too quickly. still, mccreless is a really good guy and good teacher. he's very chill. i learned the most by doing my model compositions, so in retrospect i may have wanted to taken a composition seminar instead, or focused only on ear training."
