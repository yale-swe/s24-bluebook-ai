    "Yes.",
    "Yes, the course is worth taking and provides a good scope of security policies.",
    "Interesting lectures and readings! I really great intro to international security!",
    "covers the basics of international security. Not too much work, good course",
    "Really good course if you're at all interested in war history, war theory or security in general.",
    "Very good class. If you are interested in poli sci, or a major it should be required. The tests are very straight forward, and the essays are short. Take it!",
    "Yes I would. Interesting and relevant.",
    "I would recommend this course, it is applicable tot he world today and discusses aspects of international importance",
    "I would do it to get a sense of the field. However, there isn't all that much too this field and so I wouldn't take another course in it.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in international relations but this is definitely not a gut.",
    "I would recommend international security. It was a pretty straightforward class with a lot of polisci theory, but I enjoyed the material and it wasn't very difficult.",
    "Yes, it is a great intro to IR type of course.",
    "Overall, I'd recommend it if you're interested in international security. The readings andlectures aren't very fun if you're not interested in the subject though, so don't take it unless you're really interested. If you're on the fence about whether or not you're interested, then skim the readings before you sign up. I liked the class and got a lot out of it, but it wasn't for me and I wish I hadn't taken it. But, the course is a good course and well-structured. Not a lot of work - two 5 page essays and a midterm and final - or a lot of reading. You can get by with just lectures (you really should go to all the lectures - Kocher does a great job of explaining the readings and tests you on the lectures), but you really should do the reading, too (you're tested on the reading also and should know the main points of the articles). Both the lectures and readings are equally tested in the midterm and final. You need to know everything for those; if you don't know something, it's very easy to lose points. The theories are pretty common sense. If you take the class, ask questions in class and go to office hours!",
    "This class is not very difficult, as long as you do the readings and go to lecture. The material is dry, but the broad concepts are interesting. I would recommend it if you're going into political science. If not, there are more interesting courses out there."
