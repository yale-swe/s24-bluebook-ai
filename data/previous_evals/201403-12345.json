    "I wouldn't recommend it if you think it's going to be a practical class and you want to learn more about Indian elections. The reading is very very dense and discussions not too exciting all the time. I would blame that on class dynamics really, because she did put in effort to ensure everyone remains engaged but you really have to be good with the political theories to really remain engaged in the discussions. Her paper requirements are unfair for departments the class is listed under because it feels like you are expected to write a dissertation, with dense theories, theories opposing your theories, data to support your thesis-- and it's almost like you're writing some unique finding about Indian elections or a book-- but how can you really? So it's only later you find out that your papers are not on par with her requirements but you can't do anything. Torturous to write the papers!!!",
    "Awesome class! Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class because the material is fresh and it is not hard to keep up with the readings and papers."
