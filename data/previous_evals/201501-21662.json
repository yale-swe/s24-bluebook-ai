    "Despite the course title of \"Physical Processes in Astronomy\" (could we be any less specific?), this class is mostly about fluid dynamics, with an introduction to radiative transfer added at the end. If you've been waiting for a chance to learn about the Navier Stokes equations, this is it. Plus, there's cool stuff about turbulence, shocks, and accretion disks, and you finally learn what Liouville's theorem is good for. This course was more theory-heavy than most undergrad courses in the department, and for the most part, the teaching is more old-school, down-to-brass-tacks derivations on the blackboard than you'll find in most courses. But this is great, and a necessary counterpart to the droves of theory-lite exoplanet enthusiasts filling astronomy departments all over the country. Professor van den Bosch is really good at giving an intuitive understanding of abstract concepts, and his habit of occasionally cold-calling on people is a good way to stop people from zoning out.",
    "I would not recommend this to someone I cared about. Studying for the oral exam was painful. Having to go and read through 120+ pages of pdf notes and retaining all of the information was brutal.",
    "This class is excellent. Professor van den Bosch really makes the course; shop it, if you like his style it only gets better as the semester goes on, as you build an understanding of the subject matter. First half is an introduction to fluid mechanics, second half is radiative processes, instabilities, and assorted other topics in astrophysics. The class can seem daunting\/advanced at first, but the professor is really only looking for conceptual understanding of the material, not rigorous knowledge of derivations or anything like that. There were 4 problem sets, a final paper, and an oral final exam."
