   "comments": [
    "PHI 659 is, as the title states, a course on 20th century Ethical theory. Of course, not all possible topics in 20th century ethical theory can be covered. The course instead focuses mostly on questions in metaethics, starting with G.E. Moore and W.D. Ross, then moving to various forms of non-cognitivism, and finishing with some naturalist realism (we read Michael Smith's \"The Moral Problem\").I would recommend the class for any student. Certainly some of the material is really hard, which means that in a given week one might have to really buckle down to try and get a grip on the material (and even then, one might not be fully satisfied that one has mastered the content). But Sam is a great teacher, and does his best to make sure students don't get too lost in class. Even if Sam were an average professor, the topics in metaethics would be interesting and worth exploring. As he is a really good professor, the class ends up being really worthwhile."
