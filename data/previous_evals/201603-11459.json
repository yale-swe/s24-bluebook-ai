   "comments": [
    "I feel I learned a lot! Just a general physics knowledge.",
    "Learned a lot about physics!",
    "Analytical thinking, approaches to problem solving, mental toughness...what don't you learn from a physics course? On a more serious note, this course helped me to see how the abstract concept of calculus applies to physical phenomena, and I thought that that was pretty cool.",
    "Somewhat helpful, if you have to take it.",
    "I have never quite enjoyed physics, mostly because I never remember having had a good physics teacher. This is the first time when I felt I had a good teacher and, as importantly, a teacher who was enthusiastic about the material. PHYS 180 helped me develop perseverance (after the first midterm that did not go as well) and a desire to understand, not memorize, the material. We covered a lot of things in this course (things I had long forgotten), but by going to class and attending Prof. Steinacker's office hours, I found it satisfying to not just compute the answer of a problem, but understand the way it is solved.",
    "Learned what a newton was. LOL",
    "I developed my critical thinking skills and learned how to better work as a member of a team.",
    "This was the first physics course I have ever taken; I was nervous about this at first due to the fact that most people have taken AP physics before the class. However, I was able to do well in the course. Granted, I did have to put in much more work than other people. I learned a lot from this course. First and foremost, I learned about important topics in physics, as listed in the course syllabus. More importantly, though, I feel like I have acquired a whole new way of looking at the world and solving problems, not just in the realm of physics. Those things, along with the resilience needed to keep attempting problems after getting them wrong for the tenth time, will be very useful to me. An insight I have gained from this course is the extreme importance of staying curious. Not just about classes I am taking, but about the world in general. This was a very inspirational message to me and helped me get through a tough semester.",
    "Learned about mechanical physics and how to go about solving problems.",
    "I have learned the beginnings a university physics, which includes topics such as projectile motion, forces, torque, angular motion, momentum, graviton, and simple harmonic motion. This class helps improve thinking and problem solving skills and teaches how to combine several areas of learning for a single problem.",
    "I have taken kinematics before, but this class was helpful in covering all the material again and then delving further into rotation and other topics.",
    "So many. The ability to look at a challenge problem, break it down and then tackle it with a planned strategy. The ability to manage ones time on an exam or time constrained environment. Knowing when to seek out help and not be afraid to admit your shortcomings in the hopes of attaining success. Working with peers in a constructive and informative process. f=ma idk.",
    "physics is life-- everything involves physics, can't escape from it (AGHHHHHH!)",
    "I had a decent amount of physics background before taking this class, but even with that experience, I still improved a lot during this semester, and my reasoning and problem solving skills are much better now.",
    "I learned some physics, and that going to office hours is not as scary as it seems.",
    "As an introductory physics class, I found it accomplished what I expected to an extent.",
    "physical knowledge and problem-solving skills",
    "This course provided a solid introduction to classical mechanics. Unlike AP Physics and other high school physics courses, PHYS 180 provides explanations for every formula, often deriving them from scratch. The class involves a bit of calculus, but enough that a high school calculus background should be enough to prepare one for the class. Topics covered included linear mechanics, rotational mechanics, center of mass, gravity and planetary motion, and transverse waves.",
    "I gained a lot of valuable insight into the basics of physics. I better learned how to approach problems with a more creative and analytical mind.",
    "As someone who had not taken anything more than a simple algebra-based physics class, I learned a lot of material about physics. In addition, I learned how to think more critically, and I made several friends through this course, too.",
    "Knowledge of projectile motion, kinematics, energy, angular kinematics, momentum, and waves.",
    "I felt like the psets taught me how to think from a physics mindset. I had to think of all the different components of the situation and approach problems from multiple angles. Also, this class is one of the only classes at Yale that I've actually done collaborative work on, so I learned how to work with others on psets.",
    "Learned lots of things about physics and the way the world works! It goes a little bit further than AP Physics, I think, especially with rotation, so that was good even if you had taken the course in high school.",
    "A much better grip of physics concepts than I got through AP Physics at my high school. Not only what we observe, but why we observe it from a quantitative standpoint. This course exceeded my expectations.",
    "I learned SO MUCH!. This is a great course for intro physics. It is difficult though.",
    "I've taken quite a lot of physics in the past but still managed to learn lots in Phys 180 with Prof Padmanabhan. I think the section over rotational motion and kinetics was interesting and the problems he gave us helped integrate multiple concepts.",
    "I'm definitely a lot better at physics and creative problem solving in general.",
    "Physics 180 is a basic physics course that is similar to the material learned in AP Physics during high school.",
    "I learned how to solve physics problems.",
    "The basics of mechanics and how to solve these problems.",
    "I improved my quantitative problem-solving skills and I became more comfortable with certain topics that I didn't have a good grasp of when I took physics in high school like simple harmonic motion, waves, and relative motion.",
    "Learned Physics mechanics.",
    "I learned how to do a certain type of physics problem. I did not really learn many principles of physics, but that could be because I have taken intro physics already in high school.",
    "I learned a lot about physics for sure, and I learned better how to ask for help on problem sets from professors.",
    "I learned about physics which I hate and don't believe is true",
    "My problem solving skills really improved. Though the PSETS were not easy, they really taught me to think through the problems and apply the fundamentals correctly.",
    "You will learn how to solve difficult problem and be genuinely proud of the range of problems you can solve.",
    "By taking this course I was able to review and strengthen my understanding of many important physics concepts. The depth of this class also extended beyond physics courses I had had in the past exposing me to new material such as how to apply basic calculus to physics. I developed analytical skills by working through problems.",
    "problem solving skills and practice applying basic concepts to harder problems",
    "I gained knowledge of basic physics in this course.",
    "1D motion through basic simple harmonic motion",
    "I've already taken physics before but this definitely deepened my understanding and showed me new ways to apply the same concepts.",
    "I had taken basic physics before and the class added little new knowledge.",
    "We learned the theory and practice behind introductory physics (mechanics).",
    "Great intro to classical physics, though quite challenging material, well taught.",
    "Developed some basic knowledge of the mechanics of physics. Some development of critical thinking skills, but many of the p-sets had problems that were too difficult to complete on one's own and it was necessary to seek help from TFs to even finish the psets.",
    "How to stay focused on one problem for 2-3 hours straight because that was expected for some of the psets.",
    "I gained a much more solid understanding of physics building off of what I learned in AP physics.",
    "Problem solving techniques, knowledge of physical relationships",
    "I learned about mechanics in physics - forces, work-energy, momentum, rotation, gravitation, etc. I learned how to break down complex physics problems and really apply the formulas to different problems. I do feel that I am more adept at tackling more complicated physics problems than I was before, and I am also better at synthesizing different topics in mechanics.",
    "I learned basic physics concepts as well as problem solving.",
    "How to utilize office hours and group studying methods. Also putting in lots of hours per problem set became the norm, and created a good work ethic.",
    "I developed skills in analyzing questions in a calculus perspective. I also improved my ability to analyze a question and determine what it is asking and the steps needed to find the solution.",
    "The syllabus of this class was very similar to that of a high school physics class, though the problems were more difficult. We did some of the derivations of equations in class, and it was interesting to see the intuitions that equations come from.",
    "I learned how to apply calculus to physics.",
    "Intro physics- kinematics, dynamics, conservation of momentum, gravity, etc.",
    "Great introduction and extension of newtonian physics beyond high school material without getting too advanced. Hard at times, but so many recourses to help explain things.",
    "I learned more physics concepts and how to use equations to find answers.",
    "How to think about different physical situations analytically. Different laws of physics that govern our existence on earth.",
    "I learned basic psychics topics from kinematics to orbital motion. It is a well-paced introduction to physics. I also developed good problem solving skills and a strong intuition for physics",
    "I learned physics in a non-intimidating environment, as opposed to in AP where we were told to memorize many methods and formulas without understanding.",
    "I'vE never taken Calculus-based physics before, so it was especially rough learning to solve my problems with calculus rather than algebra. I leared that it is imperative to have a study group or to attend office hours to get the help one needs as the lecture is a blur of numbers and equations.",
    "This is a standard intro physics course, teaching at a difficulty level slightly above average college-level physics. It requires knowledge of and familiarity with calculus (i.e. MATH 115).",
    "My problem solving skills definitely improved.",
    "I learned a lot about math and physics.",
    "Having already taken AP Physics, most of this material was review for me, but I learned new applications of calculus to this material.",
    "I thought it was a great intro university physics course - went over the things we had learned in high school but in a lot more depth, with many more connections and mathematical concepts and explinations",
    "This class taught me the fundamentals of physics and how to combine different laws together to create very difficult to solve physics problems.",
    "I developed the skill of starting to work on the problem sets early and the habit of going to office hours and study halls. Furthermore, I got used to a big lecture and how to get the best of it.",
    "Good physics background. Using variables instead of plugging in numbers.",
    "Physics",
    "I feel that this course was a good way to learn basic mechanics.",
    "I learned about perservering on problems I didnt quite understand fully",
    "Knowledge about mechanics, about the physicists who led to the discoveries, and about the world in general. Insights into how to the world works and how we as humans can analyze nature around us.",
    "I really developed my critical thinking skills and learned how to work around really difficult material. Also, the Physics 180 really taught me how important it is to be able to collaborate with peers.",
    "I really liked the focus on proofs and derivations. This class helped me to link physics with calculus\/math in general in a way that AP high school classes did not. I always felt challenged to improve my mathematical thinking.",
    "i learned physics",
    "This class will teach you a lot but be prepared to work really, really hard, especially if you have mininal background in physics.",
    "Hmm I'm not really sure how to answer this other than by saying I learned about physics.",
    "this is literally ap physics but the questions are a bit harder",
    "I learned how to apply physics concepts to a wide variety of applications.",
    "I definitely learned a LOT of physics material, from application of concepts to a deep understanding of useful formulas. The focus on derivations in lectures, although difficult to understand in the moment, was very useful for a deeper understanding of the topics.",
    "I gained a better grasp of some of the physics that I learned in high school and learned about some additional new topics. Moreover, this course taught me how to handle problem sets.",
    "I had taken an AP Physics course in high school, but I learned a lot from taking PHYS 180 at Yale. Lectures provided the basic concepts and tools for solving the problem sets, which required a bit of effort to finish. This helped to improve my problem solving skills by bringing these skills and concepts together.",
    "In this class I really learned how to solve and appraoch long, difficult problems as I never had before. A lot of learning how to think in this class. Tough, tough problems though",
    "This course helped me develop an understanding of introductory physics at the college level. I learned how to apply mathematical principles to physics questions regarding mechanics.",
    "I learned about the physics of motion, gravitation and waves. I also learned methods of approaching and solving physics problems.",
    "I guess I learned some of physics. I felt like I had a strong foundation on kinematics, and thus was okay with that part of it, but then for the rest of it, I felt much less secure on.",
    "I developed basic abilities in mechanics, and also grew a new way of approaching problems and a way of thinking that I can apply not only in physics, but in my other courses as well.",
    "I really learned nothing except how to google tutorials and which you tubers were most helpful. This class is super unorganized and poorly taught, which causes students to resort to other means of learning besides the ones the university offers. This course had potential to teach a lot of exciting and interesting concepts about our world, but it failed to do so.",
    "PHYS 180 is a great introduction to mechanics, and I felt very good about the pacing. My problem-solving skills definitely made a lot of progress as the semester went on, and I gained confidence in thinking about a problem and coming up with possible solutions.",
    "mechanics side of physics, how to bear long PSETs",
    "I learned about kinematics, energy conservation, gravity, and waves! Among some other stuff, but those were my favorites to learn about.",
    "Conceptual physics, mechanics",
    "Working through and simplifying complex problems, applying knowledge to new situations, working through multistep problems",
    "Learned strong basics of physics beyond AP physics B level",
    "I got a grasp of basic physics.",
    "Learned basic classical mechanics.",
    "I learned to apply basic physics concepts to much larger, more complicated applications through challenging homework.",
    "I felt this course gave me a very strong foundation with the knowledge of Physics. In addition, it taught me elements of problem solving that can be applied outside the field of Physics particularly in other STEM fields. Outside of the scientific aspect of Physics it showed more of the artistic beauty of the phenomenons of classical mechanics taught in the first semester. Particularly with Physics 180 I found the material was taught in way where you didn't learn how to solve particular problems but were taught the concepts and were well versed enough in the concepts that you would be able to solve the problems.",
    "I learned how to apply calculus skills to non-calc problems and start to recognize the underlying knowledge behind a question that was needed to get the answer.",
    "Very good introduction to mechanics and some gravitation concepts.",
    "I have greatly improved my ability to approach difficult problems in an easier, more logical fashion. My understanding of general mechanics has also greatly improved.",
    "Deep exploration of general collegiate-level physics concepts.",
    "My ability to analyze problems from a physics point of view was obviously improved, but I also appreciate how this course gave me a better understanding of how calculus can be applied.",
    "Learned a general knowledge of physics and problem solving skills.",
    "I developed better problem solving skills. I learned basic concepts of physics mechanics.",
    "Though I did not come into PHYS 180 having a very strong physics background, I really have learned a lot in the class about fundamental physics concepts.",
    "I learned a broad overview of physics principals and how to solve problems.",
    "Good problem solving and applications course that intrdocued me to the basic mechanical physics concepts",
    "I learned a lot more about inertia and torque than I would have imagined was expected of me D",
    "Nikhil is by far the best science lecturer I have had. The class grading may improve though. The TAs were incredibly strict on grading and offered little explanation for their harsh gradings.",
    "Better understanding of kinematics, circular motion, gravitational fields",
    "PHYS 180 allowed me to develop a better understanding of fundamental topics in our physical world. The course also developed my skills as a critical thinker (via the challenging problem sets).",
    "From this course I learned several concepts regarding how the physical (and theoretical) world works. I also revisited and solidified concepts touched on in high school physics. It may have helped develop my reasoning skills and ability to work through problems, but the biggest insight I gained was that I was spending the most academic time on the thing I cared the least about. As an ecology major, I found the concepts interesting and applicable to everyday life, but the hours and hours of mathematical problem sets requiring derivation and integration and trigonometric identities took away from time spent on other classes more relevant to my future path. I found this particularly frustrating, especially knowing that I will likely not need to derive the formula for the moment of inertia of a hollow disk in my future work, and therefore will end up forgetting a lot of what I learned due to lack of use."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength was definitely Professor P. He was absolutely incredible: a great instructor in class and outside the classroom. He put in so many hours in study hall\/office hours and always replied to emailed questions. He really cared about our learning. Weaknesses could perhaps be the homeworks. I felt they were sometimes a bit too challenging when we hadn't even truly grasped the basics yet.",
    "I learned a lot about physics but honestly this class just seems way way too difficult for an introductory physics class. The problems in class were reasonable but the problem sets were way too hard and they took way too much time. A lot of the problems seemed to be more mechanical math than actual physics and it was possible for some of them to spend pages doing math after understanding conceptually the physics problem. I think the problem sets might have been more appropriate for a higher level than introductory physics. Without a strong background in physics (i.e. no AP) it was constantly a very laborious and difficult process to complete the physics problem sets each week. Although it is definitely possible to do very well in this class and indeed on all the problem sets they ranged anywhere from 3-15+ hours to complete and many of the mathematical aspects of some of the problems just seemed very excessive. That said, I did learn a lot about physics and think this knowledge will definitely be useful later on to me. My professor was also an exceptional human being and he gave us every opportunity that we needed to succeed in his class including triweekly study halls for three hours at a time which were really invaluable in completing the problem sets as well as giving us a Piazza as an online forum where we could ask questions about the material and the class anonymously and seek input from the professor as well as work to facilitate each other's learning outside of normal class hours and office\/study hall hours. Additionally, the professor made class fun with things like a rocket demo, using resonance to explode a beaker, and a pendulum to demonstrate energy conservation.",
    "I believe that the course distributes its time a little too evenly, if its intention is to cover all the topics it presents. More time and effort should be spent teaching and presenting the more difficult material at the end of the semester than the comparatively easy stuff we do earlier on. It does a great job of providing students with the resources they need to succeed, however, if the student is inclined enough to pursue them.",
    "I took the unconventional lecture. I enjoy the class but it frustrate me because the professor does not use the class time efficiently... He has to go over to every single table to make sure every single person understands everything before he goes on with the class - but once he's checked on you, you just sit there and wait and do nothing for 10 minutes, because he will be taking to the rest of the 30 students one by one. I strongly think the classes can be organized better if he does not do this. This is the only part I don't like.",
    "I wish things were covered less quickly in PHYS 180. I sometimes felt that in certain classes we went slower, because we could afford slowing down (we were not behind with the material) and in others we went faster. One aspect of this class I did not quite enjoy was failing to see the connection between all the things we were covering. We did kinematics, rotational motion, energy conservation and Kepler's laws, but sometimes I could not trace back how we got a certain concept. The study halls were a strength, but after a certain time they were not as helpful, because there were a few TAs for a large number of students and some of the TAs were less helpful than others. Prof. Padmadhaban was always in the study halls and he was really helpful, but often many people were in the line to ask him. Prof. Steinacker was a strength of this course, but I just really wish we had spent more time with understanding certain concepts by covering more examples in class. Working with peers was helpful to an extent, but there were moments when we could not answer each other's questions. I wish this class had discussion sections, like Organic Chemistry.",
    "I took the flipped classroom section. It was AWFUL. Unless you already have a strong background would I recommend this section, or else you are just lost constantly.",
    "This course is great in the amount of additional help it offers its students. It holds 3 hour study halls 3 times a week, where students can go and get all of their questions answered by TAs and professors.",
    "This course has many strengths, one of which is the engagement of students from all different backgrounds and who have different goals for the future. I do not believe the course was unbearably hard for anyone who was willing to put in the necessary time and effort to learn the material and develop new ways of thinking. At the same time, I believe that the course was engaging for students that have already seen the material previously. This is difficult to do in a course, but I believe this one succeeded. Logistically, the topics in this course flowed well and the progression throughout the semester made sense. It is one of the most coherent courses I've taken here. One minor change to consider is thinking through the dates and times of exams more thoroughly. They always seem to fall at the same times as my other midterms, which makes it hard to stay sane. Also, exams that are at nighttime are awful for a person like me, who gets up and goes to bed early. Moving them forward would probably benefit many people.",
    "I think there's some disparity between what different professors teach the classes because sometimes I felt like some professors gave more help on homework or more info that we would need than other professors. The course is an intro physics class (and the lowest physics class offered at Yale) so I really feel like it needs to be easier. the class is incredibly hard and requires you to put in around 10-12 hrs if not more time into the psets each week. That's a TON of time for people who are mostly not physics majors and who probably really dislike physics - and yes it made me dislike physics even more because of how frustratingly long the psets were. I spent more time on this class than literally every one of my other 4 credit science-heavy classes combined. That is ridiculous. This is an intro physics class that's a prerequisite for so many majors and the professors are treating it as if we're all prospective physics majors who have so much time to learn physics. This class is honestly ruining my sophomore year because of what a time and emotional toll it takes on me. And I know I share the sentiment with many of my friends taking the same course.",
    "This class is hard but there are a lot of study halls and office hours every week. There are also various teachers with different teaching styles for different styles of learning.",
    "The strengths of this course involve Prof. Padmanabhan's dedication to the learning of his students! He's always there for the students to answer questions and gives great lectures! The class may be improved by including more examples (to the degree of difficulty of the psets and exams) during class -- instead of much more elementary problems during class and markedly more difficult ones on our own on the psets.",
    "This course is difficult in the lecture style because the lectures are hard to follow. Would be better as a seminar or smaller lecture. The course is also difficult if you don't have prior physics knowledge.",
    "Strenghth= professors'overall compassion and understanding of what students are capable of. There were no extreme expectations but that is not to say that the professors babied us and held our hand every step of the way. They were extremely valuable resources that cannot be understated. The beauty of physics came alive, especially in Steinacker's class, my god. She put so much effort into teaching us that it made me more invested. That is a huge course strength! The overall format of the course was wonderful and fair. Loved the MidTerm Re-grades as a chance to hone mistakes. Loved the extended office hours and resources (i.e. study hall). Weakness: Maybe try for 7-8 problems per PSet! The last one (with 6) allowed me to take my time on each one and truly figure out the problems without feeling an \"oh my god I still have 9 left to do\" after finishing just one. Also, please no clickers.",
    "Sometimes, the questions asked on the exam or the psets are a bit ridiculous, but they really make it up by having late night study hall sessions or lots of review sessions. The professors really engage in helping the students, it's amazing.",
    "I think the way the course progressed through the topics was very effective and conducive to understanding the topics, and I think there was a very reasonable amount of work, enough to make us work hard, but not enough to kill us. I also thought that the exams were very fair and graded in a not too harsh but not too generous manner. The biggest strength was Prof. Steinacker. The lectures could seem to drag on sometimes if students didn't have energy or want to contribute at all. With that being said, however, Professor Steinacker always made us want to contribute because she is a wonderful person.",
    "Make no mistake, this course is not an introduction to physics. Since so many of the students taking it have taken AP or other advanced physics in high school, the course is taught with them in mind. So it moves fast, and basic explanations are often not included. I had never taken physics before, and was really struggling for most of the course, though eventually I figured out different ways of studying and working to help myself learn the material. It's hard because the professors have to cater to the majority of the students, who are more advanced in physics, but there's no class option that's really an intro. 170 and 171 teach different applications, so would not have been useful to me.",
    "Lectures are very thorough and go through the proofs for all equations and theorems in detail. The PSETS are SUPER hard though.",
    "Strengths: The frequent office hours and study halls held by TA's were a big help The notes posted online were always a helpful resource to look back on in case I was confused during class The assignments and due dates were very organized Weaknesses: The problem sets were too frequent and too extensive to learn from them. They became an assignment that needed to get done rather than an opportunity to learn material.",
    "Among the 3 section, I felt like mine was at a disadvantage because we did not cover all topics as extensively in my section as in the other two. I had classmates in other sections who were ahead of me in the syllabus and had a deeper understanding of the material that their professor presented, when I did not have nearly as much exposure or guidance as they had. I understand that each student must do readings, etc. on their own, but the level of explanation and coverage of topics among the three sections was highly unbalanced.",
    "Great class. No improvements to be made in my opinion.",
    "The greatest issue with the course was the delay in grading problem sets. The problem sets would often be graded long after the topics were tested on an exam, making them useless as . While the solutions are posted shortly after the problem sets are due, it would be nice to have comments back on the problem sets around the same time too. To accomplish this, it might be helpful to recruit more TAs.",
    "Problem sets were excessively computational, roundabout, opaque, and time-consuming, and often did not contribute to a better understanding of the material.",
    "I liked how they had a lot of opportunities to seek help and support from other students and the physics professors and TA's.",
    "Strengths: - The instructors certainly know what they're talking about, and they're always accessible. - The study halls motivate students to get work done. - There is a lot of energy in this course for students to succeed. - The smaller class sizes made the transition from high school to college easier. Weaknesses: - The preparation for exams was weak. Practice tests were often only posted a day or two before the finals, with answers not becoming available until even later. This is unacceptable if you want your students to study more. - The TFs graded differently (even IF the rubric was the same). Some were much more lenient than others. Also, PSETs took FOREVER to get back... There's no reason why they should be three weeks behind in grading. - You can't reasonably expect two problem sets to be done in the last week of classes... even IF the second one was shorter, I had two exams that week and a final lab. More consideration needs to go into when\/how much to assign.",
    "Overall the course was organized very well. A potential space for improvement would be more consistency between the material covered in class and the material tested on the problem sets.",
    "As an engineering major, I think this course succeeded in providing me with a solid foundation for future courses that will build on these principles and problem-solving skills. I felt that the problem sets were appropriately challenging -- they tested us on the concepts we learned in class while being challenging enough for me to feel satisfied when I got to the right answer. However, I feel like organization of the course as a whole (across all four sections) could be improved in a few ways. It would have been helpful to receive feedback on the homework more quickly, and it also would have helped a lot if the instructors had posted practice problems and solutions for the midterm and final exams sooner.",
    "I struggled to do homeworks, but luckily I was always able to receive help from Professor Nikhil's office hours and study halls.",
    "I thought that this course was already really well run. The psets and tests were fair, and otherwise, not much needed to be improved. I would recommend that the professors warn their students early on, that this class actually uses a lot of calculus and to recommend that their students review their calc to save themselves a lot of trouble later on in the course.",
    "Professor Padmanabhan was a strength of this course. Certainly one of the best lecturers I've had so far. Can't think of anything I would have liked to see done differently.",
    "The strength has a name. His name is Professor Padmanabhan. He is the God of physics 180. I really hope he gets to read this note because he was just that great. As a class, I think all of his students appreciate what he does. Physics isn't intuitive for everyone, and he understands that, so he does his best to help everyone.",
    "The course is a lot of work but engaging. It was very easy to get help with understanding material and with tackling homework assignments. The class was a bit difficult in that everybody comes in with different backgrounds in physics but I was able to get the help I felt I needed to catch up.",
    "This course was extremely well taught, however I felt like it moved so much faster at the end of the course compared to the beginning.",
    "Strength = Padmanabhan. He was always willing to take his own time to help students during study halls and office hours.",
    "I hope we could spent more time on the material in the second half of semester, which I think overall students were less familiar with.",
    "I think each instructor is extremely knowledgeable and qualified to lead their respective sections, but coordination between sections could be greatly improved. Exam preparation material and exam information usually was not uploaded to the course website until a day before the exam, causing great confusion among students. Some of the homework questions are also very complex, too heavily focused on algebra rather than physics concepts, and not representative of exam questions. Future homeworks should reflect the sort of questions we solved in class and will be expected to solve on exams. Also, the homeworks were not returned to us in a timely manner and the uploaded solutions were extremely difficult to comprehend, which made studying for the midterms a big headache.",
    "Well taught, good study sessions, great lectures especially the clicker problems. Weaknesses are that some of the problem set problems were far harder than anything in lecture or tests, causing help sessions to be over crowded.",
    "I thought it was a perfectly fine intro physics class. The psets took a really long time and were often frustrating, but Prof. Padmanabhan did a very good job in lecture and was generally an all-around great guy. He was definitely the rock star of this class. It was easy to lose a lot of points on the tests for silly algebra mistakes and whatnot, which was frustrating; I personally wouldn't have minded some slightly more challenging problems on the exams that made the curve nicer, so that they more accurately tested physics ability, but I understand why they did it like they did.",
    "There could have been more smaller assignments to even out grades, but overall it was pretty good. The study halls were great and very helpful in finishing the psets.",
    "This class is so hard. It is so much work. And i feel like everything I learned I will never think about again.",
    "This course offered a very comprehensive coverage of first-semester university physics. The challenging, but manageable problems helped strengthen my conceptual and analytical understanding of the material presented in class.",
    "The study halls were extremely helpful. Lectures introduced basic concepts well; however, significant additional practice was required outside of class to be able to do the level of problems expected. It was nice that after the midterm evaluation, there were more practice problems during class and that the answers were posted with the lecture slides.",
    "The biggest strength of this class was Professor Steinacker's dedication to the class and the students. However, I felt there were many weaknesses with this course. I felt that Steinacker's notes in lecture were not always very clear and this made it hard to follow. As an introductory physics course there should be more structure with lectures. Notes on the board should be easier to follow and there should be a greater emphasis on general trends or concepts. The homework assignments were unnecessarily difficult and were comprised of obscure, tricky questions and no basic, concept-application questions. Because of this, I was constantly struggling to get the homework done and had to go to office hours every week just to understand what the problems were asking. Yet when I finished the assignments I was still not completely comfortable with basic physics concepts because they were not at all emphasized in the homework assignments. Study hall sessions for this course were not helpful at all. The questions were so obscure and poorly worded that it was not even worth it to ask the TAs for help on the homework because they did not know how to do the problems themselves and Professor Padmanabhan would always give roundabout answers to homework questions rather than actually help us, which would make study hall very frustrating and unproductive. It was also clear with this course that there was no communication between the professors. It seemed that Professor Steinacker shouldered much of the work, as she posted most (if not all) of the answer keys for tests and homework assignments and she held more office hours than the other professors combined (which I greatly appreciated as one of her students and which made all of the difference for me in taking the class.)",
    "Steinacker's office hours made this class what it was--without them I wouldn't have learned anything, but with them this was a fantastic, engaging class.",
    "It would be great if a solutions manual for textbook problems were one of the resources so that students could have more example problems.",
    "The homeworks could be significantly more challenging than lecture materials at times. This is remediate day solid office hours and good additional notes, etc. I got feedback slowly for homework.",
    "The three professors taught very differently. I thought the last several problem sets were too time intensive and included problems that were more difficult than things we did in class or would be on the exam.",
    "This is a strong course and a well-organized introduction to classical physics.",
    "class quizzes are useful, but maybe only one a week or maybe having some for post lecture are helpful as well, to implement what was taught in lecture. Example problems in class were abundantly helpful",
    "The demonstrations were some of the few techniques that effectively kept the class engaged; perhaps more demos (if possible) would help keep the students engaged. The first two exams were fair (although I believe a take-home exam encouraged cheating that might not have been possible in a traditional exam setting), but the final was far too hard for all students to complete in a way that demonstrated all the work they'd put in throughout the year and studying for that particular exam.",
    "The psets were way too hard and long, it wasn't possible to do all 10 problems every single week so it would be much more effective to assign fewer problems because then people would be able to do them on their own instead of copying at the study halls.",
    "I enjoyed how we practiced solving problems in class.",
    "Tons of opportunities for help from professors, good teaching, fair tests, interesting problem sets",
    "Overall, the course is organized. Lectures followed a certain path and problem sets more or less corresponded. However, if I had no physics background, it would have been harder to follow, since the structure was implied rather than explicit. The problem sets were also often more difficult than lectures, but study halls were excellent spaces to work on the problem set. I am glad that the course has built in a lot of support for students. The midterms\/final were also all reasonable as well.",
    "This course was well-taught and engaging. Concepts were well-explained and there were a lot of examples to work through for problem practice. Experiments during class put the material in context and helped keep the class refreshing.",
    "The problems on the psets are not things we learn in class, only if certain professors show them in class, but not all professors do the same. Also the pset questions are not akin to ones we see on tests so sometimes it seems odd to do practice that isn't similar to our tests.",
    "The strength of this course is that it builds a solid foundation of knowledge in the concepts of physics and provided adequate detailed examples, applying both mathematics and logic to improve problem solving skills. One improvement could be regarding the fact that there is no set texbook for the course. While it is helpful regarding finding resources, there are limitations such that some textbooks provide better examples than others; some being more helpful with psets. I believe if the professors could provide a list of possible textbooks that would be beneficial to the student.",
    "A strength of the class was the amount of support provided- study halls were especially helpful in completing problem sets. The class could be improved by returning problem set scores more quickly. The problem sets took a long time to be graded, so it was difficult to know how we were doing on them.",
    "The PSETs were very time intensive, but they helped me understand the material we learned in class.",
    "Strengths- I feel like I learned physics, the professors are engaged and committed to teaching, and the format of the course with test corrections and hw being worth a lot of the grade creates an \"effort curve\" which encourages you to go back and revisit things you don't understand. The professors were also very understanding around the election. Weaknesses- class often felt a bit disorganized- often concepts were introduced early on with the qualification \"you don't need to know this yet\" but then revisited later with the assumption that we already understood them. (for example, moment of inertia). Some problem sets were a bit long- personally, I would have prefered slightly shorter problem sets so I could be more sure about my answers instead of rushing to finish them. (problem sets usually took me around 6-8 hours). Also, grading, especially of the midterms and hw, seemed fairly arbitrary sometimes or even incorrect- My first midterm was graded incorrectly and I needed to get it fixed, and my second midterm had a question that was marked as correct but had points taken off that turned out to be in fact wrong but not for the parts of the question that it looked like they might have taken off points for. It was also a fequent occurance that I would do a problem set at study hall with another person and we would end up with different grades for the same question. This seemed to even out in the end, but it was a bit frustrating at times.",
    "Great introduction and extension of newtonian physics beyond high school material without getting too advanced. Hard at times, but so many recourses to help explain things.",
    "If you didn't take AP\/IB physics, be warned. This class is well taught but very time consuming and challenging.",
    "The support for this course was wonderful. The flipped class style seemed a bit less effective for me.",
    "The strength of this course was that it covers a lot of material in great depth. In this way, it will help prepare students for higher level physics courses. The course's instructors devote a lot of time to helping students in study halls and office hours, so that is extremely helpful and makes for a better course experience. Some weaknesses of the course are that the grading of homework assignments by the TAs can be rather vague in their comments of how points are taken off. I also wish that the grades for HW would have come out sooner after students submitted them, so that we could learn from our mistakes in preparation for the next midterm\/exam.",
    "This class has a very heavy weight on homework problem sets, which for some is very beneficial. But for most, the homework entailed many, many hours of struggle, with little learning. I learned more from correcting my two midterm exams than from struggling through homework, where I was only partly sure if what I was doing was correct. I wish the exams were weighted more, but I also appreciate the fact that the exams are not \"make-or-break,\" and that if you really do invest the effort, you can do well in the course.",
    "It provided a good foundation for basic physics. The strength is that it covers a variety of topics. However, I do think that some of the topics could be moved through a bit quicker or more in-depth. For other topics, the teacher's intuition is a lot more advanced than the students'.",
    "It was great that they had study hall for psets and that Nikhil typed up gudies for the psets-- if it weren't for this, they would be impossible. They definitely pushed you to the brink of what you were capable of doing.",
    "Strength: Professors are great: always friendly and very helpful. Weakness: The midterms were good and fair but I thought the final included 2-3 problems that weren't just hard in the sense that we really needed to be a master of the material and work fast, but it was that I don't think we had appropriate tools to solve them (just knowing what we learned in the class- maybe there are students who have outside physics knowledge that could solve them).",
    "It would be nice during lectures to have an easier problem first that establishes the concept rather than confusing us with a challenge problem. The professors' commitment are the strength as review sessions, office hours and lecture notes greatly benefited me.",
    "My lecture section was taught as a standard lecture. The material was challenging, and the lecture style was somewhat disorganized (enough to make certain concepts confusing, especially as I am not so easily able to use the necessary calculus). I find that the hard part of physics is thinking about how to tackle problems--setting up methods for solutions, not finding solutions. I would have liked some more guidance in applying lecture-derived methods to exam and p-set problems. The weekly problem sets were long (10 questions each) and required student collaboration to be finished before the deadlines. This was detrimental to my studying, since things that made sense to me during collaboration no longer made sense to me when I tried to work on my own for exam studying. The course is not curved. However, exams can be redone to regain up to half of the lost points. This helps students understand where they went wrong and why, and how to fix their mistakes.",
    "Support for homework and tests was great. Problem sets could've been returned earlier.",
    "The material is very well taught. However, the problem sets were, more often than not, ridiculously long and difficult. Most problem sets had several problems that the vast majority of students simply would not have been able to answer without working through them with an instructor of teaching fellow. Test corrections, however, were a fantastic inclusion to the course, and reduced the stress level of exams while encouraging the mastery of course material.",
    "One big strength was professor Padmanabhan, he went above and beyond in explaining things to us and helping us with the problem sets. One weakness is how confusing the problem sets got, it was usually challenging to figure out what they were asking",
    "The lectures alternated between repetitive and incredibly fast. There seemed to be little pacing or organization between the lectures. The homework assignments bore little resemblance to the exam questions, this was very frustrating.",
    "The lectures are very clear and engaging with Professor P. The problem sets are very hard and it is important to start them in advance. Homework notes and review sessions and study hall were extremely helpful. I also thought that the test corrections policy was the best thing ever because it helps you realize where you went wrong and also gives you points back on your exam.",
    "The problem sets for this course are, in my opinion, harder than necessary. There were several questions scattered across the course that just took hours and hours, and were no at all representative of the difficultly of the rest of the class, or of the exams. But in general, if you start the p-sets on the early side (read: Tuesday evening, not Thursday evening, for a Friday 5pm deadline) and you'll be fine!",
    "this course has incredible support from instructors, who provide so much help to students with the material, problem sets, and more. I really dont have any complaints. This was the best case scenario for a first semester physics class. my instructor listened to student feedback and adjusted to what students asked for (e.g. more review sessions, practice problems, hw notes, etc) which was appreciated.",
    "Strengths of this course are, for example, the possibility of recorrecting the midterms and the number of office hours and study halls during the week.",
    "Study halls are great. Tests are difficult.",
    "Very interactive",
    "I thought that the homework assignments were too difficult -- they were often impossible to do without working with other students or going to office hours, which was difficult given my schedule. In addition, we received a lot of materials (such as practice exams or solutions) on very short notice, and it seemed like the three professors sometimes had trouble communicating about course details.",
    "I felt that it was well run and that there were enough resources if you had trouble.",
    "I appreciated all of the extra help sessions offered but a lack of physics background proved challenging",
    "Strengths - the professor and her interest in her students' well-being, the topics and material covered, and the immense availability of TAs and Professors for help Weakness - certain PSET's included too much of busy work There is not much to improve about this course, except some of the busy work problems of PSETs could have been eliminated and the homework still would have revealed the core ideas of the lessons",
    "Teaching and good psets are huge learning aides.",
    "Strengths: its fast pace, its rigor, its intellectual depth Weakness: the HW problems are ridiculously hard",
    "This is an extremely challenging class, even if you took AP Physics C. The psets (and test problems) are unnecessarily difficult. I did learn a good amount of physics, but at a very high cost.",
    "Strengths: Class size was ideal (not too large, like some intro classes); teaching style was both interesting and relatively straightforward; my section (Steinacker) focused heavily on math, proofs, and derivations, which prepared me well for psets and exams; Study hall was a great help and Prof P. was always great; Psets were challenging but I always felt they helped me synthesize information. Weaknesses: Psets were too long and took over my whole week...Difficulty was appropriate, but I think that if they were 8 problems instead of 10, they would be more manageable.",
    "problem sets were best way to learn material but were too long, in-class instruction was focused on deriving equations which wasn't super useful, course could be improved by using math 115 flipped classroom method, shortening p sets",
    "The tests were too hard and rarely matched the level of difficulty of class problems or homework.",
    "I feel like I did learn a lot through the course, and the material was well organized. My biggest complaint is that the PSETs took soooo long. I think the amount of time an average student has to spend to do out each problem on a pset would probably be over five hours, which is a lot of time to set aside each week.",
    "The problem sets were a bit too challenging at times. The level of instructor support and opportunities to get help are definitely unique strong suits to the course that made it feel more manageable.",
    "Strengths include the dedication of professors, the in depth understanding of formulas, and the application examples provided in lectures\/homework.",
    "The course is overall well done, though the only thing I might improve upon would be going over harder problems in class so that it would be more manageable to do the problems that come up on the problem sets and exams.",
    "Sometimes I found that lectures did not always prepare us for the problem sets. I learn best by example, so I like to follow problems that we do in class as a guideline to solving similar problems in the problem sets. One improvement would either be to make the problem sets more similar to problems done in lectures.",
    "Very difficult for someone who has not had AP pHysics or a strong physics background. I really struggled with learning the fundamentals as others were learning far more detailed ideas\/ polishing what they already knew. The typed up lectures helped a lot, but the spoken lectures were almost impossible.",
    "This is a good introductory course for physics. I think the teaching was great. Professor Padmanabhan was amazing and really made the class enjoyable. I cannot think of a particular weakness of the course, although it might help to spend less time on the early kinematics equations and focus more on the later material in the course, which was more difficult.",
    "The study halls were extremely helpful, the course would have been extremely difficult without them. I'm my opinion the biggest issue with this course is the enormous range of experience among the students. I think it would be really helpful to add a placement test system similar to that of the math department. This would help ensure that students are placed in the correct physics level.",
    "There were not many strengths of this course. It was poorly designed and for the most part poorly taught. The course was largely disorganized and problem sets were very poorly written. This course could be greatly improved by unifying the material covered by each lecturer and by generally being more organized. The problem sets should be clearer with less interpretations of how something is physically oriented, etc.",
    "I think this course was well taught and fairly assessed. The problem sets were often hard, but ended up bolstering our understanding overall.",
    "It's clear the professors care about the students, but they failed to listen to us as we continually expressed our hardship and feelings about the workload.",
    "I think the course was well-paced, and I felt like the problems given were suitable and definitely were in-line with the material. By far though what I was most impressed with was the helpful staff and professors, who went above and beyond to be considerate help us students feel comfortable about the course the entire semester!",
    "Strengths: profesor's notes are great references, office hours are great, review sessions are great too Weaknesses: very hard PSETs for an intro level class, many students had a great background in physics while others did not or did not at all, not enough practice problems, no discussion sections run by TAs",
    "I think that the class is too long. It is really hard to focus on physics for over an hour straight, and I would be more consistently engaged if it were 3 times a week for 50 minutes each.",
    "Strengths: lots of help available (Professor Padmanabhan has 9 hours of study hall a week but often stays longe + office hours, Professor Steinacker has office hours every day of the week, both are easily accessibly by email), psets are challenging but fair, exam corrections help you learn from your mistakes Weaknesses: grading psets is very slow (we did not get our psets back before the exam)",
    "Very difficult course and inaccessible to students with little prior exposure to physics. Heavy workload and disconnect between psets and lectures.",
    "Loved the set up and how much help was available and how incredibly thoughtful and understanding professor padmanabhan was",
    "The professors work terribly hard to attend every student, but the TFs seemed distant.",
    "The course could be improved by having more online resources like videos to help the student with studying.",
    "Padmanabhan is lovely, but generically a boring topic.",
    "The problem sets were more difficult than the exam questions, but they fostered collaboration and required you to ask for help when stuck on a problem. Definitely helped me to think creatively and in new ways about simple physics problems.",
    "The psets and latter lectures were challenging, but the quizzes were pretty pointless.",
    "Course does a great job of giving you space to experiment with concepts and learn how to use them on your own. Tests are challenging but not impossible, homework problems are meant to teach you specific things. Sometimes the homework can feel like busywork because of its length.",
    "This was a well organized excellent course.",
    "I felt the course was very strong in teaching the concepts but I felt some of the PSETS became tedious and unnecessary with the amount of math that was needed. They became more of a math problem and no longer a Physics PSET. Also, it would be better if the PSETS weren't completely reliant on office hours. If one missed office hours it would be extremely difficult to be able to finish a PSET.",
    "The strengths include many study halls and opportunities to get extra help. One improvement would be to better correlate the problems shown in class to the ones on the assignments and exams.",
    "This course was very in-depth and engaging, and definitely helped me learn more about mechanics introductory calculus based physics. Sometimes the problem sets seemed unnecessarily difficult, and that was occasionally helpful for understanding but more than not seemed like a pointless way to make the course more difficult.",
    "The weekly problem sets were a great assessment of the material reviewed in both class and in the readings.",
    "The true strengths of this class came in the forms of Professor Padmanabhan's teaching and the community that the class fostered. Students were aware from the outset that the class would be challenging, and the professors and TAs acknowledged that; as such, they were extremely understanding and helpful with regard to the coursework itself, and any struggling student had immediate and eager access to help.",
    "Study halls were very useful. Because of corrections, I was focused more on actually learning the material than my grade. The course is weak in that if you haven't taken AP Physics before, you will struggle even more immensely. On the homework, basically everyone struggled with them, but those who didn't take AP Physics (myself included) had an even more rough time. However, the study halls are helpful and so was Piazza and office hours. The professors were really kind and definitely cared about helping us students understand the material.",
    "It's pretty well taught and there are lots of resources. The biggest weakness for me was probably more personal- I just found it a bit boring, which maybe could've been helped by a few more demos in class. Clickers helped. Another minor weakness was the way messages and canvas were set up. There were so many different places to get information that I often didn't realize something was available just because it was buried in a folder. More centralized canvas setup could be useful.",
    "The problems sets were death. The questions were hard to figure out what exactly they were asking for and then it felt like physics principles were the easy part of the question. The study halls were great though.",
    "The course does a good job of helping students develop problem solving skills with the problem sets. However, different professors focus on different things like the conceptual versus the numerical problems. The professors don't always teach the things that show up on the tests really well, and sometimes the questions are really hard to learn how to solve.",
    "The flipped classroom didn't really work, since we only ever did basic problems.",
    "Strength: homework sessions Weakness: feedback from tests",
    "Problem sets were way too difficult and long. Exams were very fair though. Feel like I didn't learn much in class however. Learned most things form the textbook examples and doing practice problems.",
    "Lots of support but very difficult parts and final that made it difficult to balance other courses",
    "I really enjoyed study hall and clicker questions, although I felt like the TAs could have been better engaged perhaps in a smaller group setting. I also think guided research projects would have been useful.",
    "I think the lectures were occasionally too fast, but the lecture notes that Professor Steinacker put up on our Classes v2 page were IMMENSELY helpful as were her office hours!",
    "Study hall was helpful. Problem sets were good. Lecture was too long, not very helpful. It would be better to do fewer, more challenging examples and increase student engagement.",
    "The course was strong in supporting students outside the classroom. Through office hours and study sessions, students could question and learn from TF's and professors in a one-on-one and small group setting. The main weakness of the course was its often unnecessary difficulty. Most problem sets required help from professors\/teaching fellows and could not be done alone. This issue seemed ubiquitous among students.",
    "I think the class is well taught, especially for the engineers who the course seems designed for. Although it moves quickly, it covers a lot of topics and for the most part explains their relevance to engineering and the world. However, the highly theoretical nature and fast pace of the course makes it less appealing to non-engineering majors. There are many outside resources available to students, though I would have benefited from more individual help. Both study halls and office hours grew very crowded as the semester went on, and I would like to see more opportunities for individual or small group help in the future. The two professors with whom I interacted both seemed highly capable and passionate about teaching and their enthusiasm was much appreciated. Frankly, I found the class much too advanced and time consuming for my future interests and this conflict made it difficult for me to engage fully with the material. I have written at length about my frustrations with the mandatory Physics yearlong requirement to the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology DUS as well as my physics professor and would be happy to discuss these more at length.",
    "The problem sets, for someone who had previously never taken AP Physics, were too difficult. I could spend hours answering questions only to find them all wrong when checking with peers. This led to a cycle of frustration and helplessness. In the end, completing problem sets felt like a race to finish rather than a learning exercise."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Whether a physics major or pre-med or another major that must take physics, take 180 with Professor P.",
    "This is an intro physics course. It requires a good basis in calculus, a mind that can think outside the box, and a touch of sadism at times. You're probably not taking this because you're \"oh just kind of interested in physics,\" and if you are, you might want to turn back now. In the former case, just be prepared: this course will challenge you, but it won't completely break you and steal your soul. Put forth the effort to really master the material, do tons of example problems, and you'll be just fine.",
    "I would recommend this course, but I would also say that unless one is coming from high school where they have done physics, they might have a harder time. I had not done physics for three years and it was as easy for me to apply a concept immediately after I had read about it.",
    "Possibly the lecture, but not the flipped classroom. But you can't really get around it when its a prerequisite.",
    "If you enjoy Physics, take this class! Lots of extra help is available, so don't be discouraged if you haven't done AP physics or anything.",
    "Although many people will take this course either way, I strongly recommend it to people who like being intellectually challenged and, at the same time, inspired. I have learned a lot by taking this course (granted, this is my first physics class ever) and feel like I have grown intellectually. It likely sounds cliche, but I truly developed a new way of thinking and problem solving that is very useful in the real world.",
    "Absolutely not if you don't need it as a prereq for anything. It takes up so much time and it definitely did not make me enjoy physics any more than I didn't before.",
    "I would recommend it because it is necessary for many majors and a good learning experience and the teachers are good. Oh and clicker questions are awesome.",
    "The class is manageable. Yes, the psets are pretty long and arduous, but the exams are fair and Prof. P (who's the best!) is an excellent lecturer. If you have to take physics, I recommend 180 over 170, but that's up to the individual.",
    "Yes, if you have experience and interest in physics.",
    "Phys 180 isn't a bad course, but it is definitely very challenging, so I think it would be important to look at the other classes you are taking before you consider adding it to your schedule. Class itself was alright; lectures are really long, but Nikhil is a great lecturer and there's some decent variety with demonstrations, clicker questions, example problems, and general explanations\/theory. For Nikhil's section, we had online quizzes due each morning that we had class. They weren't terribly challenging, but it was kind of frustrating\/irritating to have to keep remembering to do them, especially during testing weeks. The psets can be kind of disproportionately difficult; Nikhil started posting notes about the homeworks (regarding which concepts\/approaches would be helpful for each problem) which did help, but sometimes there were still problems that seemed pretty impossible to figure out. There were a few hours of study hall\/homework help on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays that were really helpful; but they are pretty late at night and the Thursday study hall is always packed (so you are more likely to be working with other students than getting help directly from the professors\/TAs). Nikhil is incredibly kind and approachable, so whether it was at study hall, office hours, or just after class, I never felt uncomfortable asking for extra help or explanations. He's also really active on piazza, which was especially great for non-study hall nights. The midterms were tough, but there was an opportunity to correct problems to receive partial credit back. Overall, there is a lot of work in this class, and the work is difficult, but Nikhil is great (and professor Steinacker was great during her reviews) so if you have to take physics, I'd recommend taking it with him.",
    "If you have an interest in physics and are willing to learn and mull over PSets a bit, try it out! Please try for Adriane Steinacker's class. She is a wonderful woman in every regard and has a true dedication for her students (the other professors might as well but I am just biased.) Physics can be challenging but the course is not designed to \"weed out\" STEM people. It is just a way to explore your budding interest in physics with a lot of \"proverbial safety nets\" to assure you aren't too devastated when things might not click the first time around. Use all the resources such as Office Hours and Study Hall! They make the PSets so much easier and you learn first hand how to do the problems and feel more comfortable for those exams!",
    "If you're interested in physics or you need to take a physics course, this is definitely a worthwhile class-- it really grounds the fundamentals of physics into you and although things can be rough sometimes, professors are always there to help out.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this class. I took AP Physics C last year as a senior, and taking 180 was still engaging and challenging in a good way. Some of my friends didn't take AP and were still able to do well in this class. There is one problem set per week that is very manageable and if all else fails, going to office hours will let you get most of the solutions from the professor. I like physics, and the class itself wasn't too demanding, but BY FAR the biggest reason I loved this class was the instructor, Prof. Steinacker. Words cannot fully express how wonderful she is. She is so dedicated to her students-she stayed late after office hours, even if she had somewhere to go; she learned the names of the students in the lecture (so many names!!); and she brought her own joyful spirit and genuine passion for physics to every lecture, making what can sometimes be a boring subject really fun. People literally hugged her after handing in the final because she is so amazing. If Prof. Steinacker was teaching an English class, I would take it. So yes, I do highly recommend this class with Prof. Steinacker.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, as long as you take it with Professor Steinacker. She puts in so much time and effort to help her students succeed. After I failed my first midterm and met with her, she set up a time for us to meet one on one each week to go over any questions I had. She also has office hours for so many hours a week--probably close to 10 hours. The other professors have few or none. Going to office hours is so helpful for working on problem sets, much more helpful than the physics tables in the evenings, which are always way too crowded. Professor Steinacker is really incredible, and even though I only need to take 180 and not 181, I was considering taking 181 just because of how helpful she has been and how much I've learned since I've started going to office hours.",
    "I took physics in high school, though it wasn't calculus-based, so I thought this course would be a breeze since it's a review. I was so wrong. Don't get me wrong, I loved the class but it's not easy, even if you've taken AP Physics C. I know juniors who took it and say it's one of the hardest classes they've taken at Yale. The PSETS are mind bending and take a long time. The huge plus side is the amount of resources you get. There are study halls with peer tutors 3 nights a week that go basically until midnight. Professor Steinacker is the most inspiring and sweetest and most dedicated professor you'll meet. She has office hours basically every waking hour she's not teaching and she's just wonderful.",
    "If you are not interested in majoring in something related to STEM and are just looking for a science class, do not take this class because it involves a large amount of work. However if you are into engineering or the sciences this class provides tons of practice, and professor Steinacker is an incredible teacher.",
    "Yes, if you enjoy physics I would recommend this to a student. However, the workload is quite intense and only should be done if you are willing to put the work in--otherwise, a very interesting course.",
    "Great physics class! I'm not particularly good at physics, but the professors and TAs (Professor P especially) really devote a ton of time to office hours and study halls and are super helpful. Pretty much your standard Physics I class, but very well taught, definitely the best intro science course I've taken at Yale (having taken the usual pre-med ones). Take it with Professor P!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, even if the student does not need the class. The physics discussed is very fascinating, and it is easy to jump into the course even for people who have not taken AP Physics at all. The resources are there for the students if they need it, as office hours are held every week by multiple professors.",
    "Yes. I think this was a well-taught course. It was difficult, but that's no surprise given the subject. However, the teaching staff provides a lot of opportunities to learn and get help.",
    "Taking PHYS180 with Savan is awesome... He's always positive and is willing to help everyone individually. BUT, do be aware of the amount of work that is assigned in this class... PSETs can easily take up to 10 hours (sometimes more), especially if this is your first calculus-based physics class.",
    "I would recommend this course. Important to show up to classes and go to the study halls for help and clarification on both the material and the psets. If you put time and effort into the class it should pay off. Good if you have some prior knowledge in physics.",
    "Like most people, I took this class not because I wanted to, but because I needed it for a major requirement. However, I ended up enjoying it much more than I thought I would, mostly thanks to Prof. Steinacker's great teaching. She is wonderfully dedicated to the class and her students, and her enthusiasm for the subject is pretty contagious. I think the problem sets were appropriately challenging and helped me apply the physical concepts that we learned. However, because this is such a big intro class, it's very hard to cater the wide range of needs and interests among the students, and I can definitely see how the class can be challenging for students with a weaker physics background. Although the concepts learned in this class may not be immediately applicable to most fields (especially if you're taking this class out of pure interest rather than to satisfy a requirement), I'm glad Prof. Steinacker helped me not only develop a solid basic understanding of physics, but also appreciate the field for what it has to offer.",
    "To be totally honest, I was dreading taking this class as a requirement for my major - I didn't enjoy physics in high school because I never really found the subject matter to be very interesting. After taking the class, I can definitely say that I'm glad I enrolled in PHYS 180. I learned a LOT over the course of the semester. The class was definitely challenging, but there a lot of different avenues to get help. However, I would be a bit wary about this class if you haven't had any sort of exposure to physics before as it does move quite fast, making it easy to fall behind if you don't know the basics. But regardless of your experience level, please PLEASE take the class with Professor Padmanabhan. I've never come across a professor that cares so much about his students' success. He tries really hard to make sure people are understanding the material, so if you're going to take PHYS 180, definitely take it with him! Also, if you're choosing between 170 and 180, I definitely think that 180 is a good choice. I can't really speak to the experience that you'll get in 170, but if you're willing to put in the work, 180 will be a very fulfilling class.",
    "This class was fairly challenging, but I'd recommend it for sure. Do the psets at study hall with other people and they're pretty manageable. If you haven't taken calc in two years, make sure that you review your calc, or else you might be on the struggle bus for some problems.",
    "Intro physics at most universities is a nightmare. Here, it's really not so bad! This is ESPECIALLY the case if you take it with Prof Padmanabhan. That man is a gem. It's definitely helpful having a background in AP Physics but not the end of the world if you don't. You'll definitely need to have some calculus background, too, but probably not much beyond basic derivatives and integrals. The psets will take some time, maybe on average ~7-8 hours a week, so you should start them early, but the professors provide a lot of guidance on how to do them. Again, this is pretty specific to taking it with Padmanabhan. I'm sure the other professors are fine too, but take it with him if you can! He set off a water jug rocket in class, it was so cool!",
    "You probably have to take this. If you want to take higher physics for a major, take a different intro course, but everyone else take this class. Its very well run.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. The class is extremely challenging, but that means that you learn a lot during the semester. Just be ready to put in a lot of work.",
    "I enjoyed physics 180 as much as I could enjoy any physics, mostly because of how amazing and engaging the Professors are.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course with Nikhil! He's the best!",
    "Take it if you like classical physics.",
    "Only take this course if it is required or you have a passion for physics. It is definitely a big time commitment if you want to do well in the course.",
    "Can't really compare with 200 or 260, but it was a solid course. The psets are really killer if you wait until the day before.",
    "Take this course if you need to for your major. One of my friends took it for fun and ended up skipping every lecture.",
    "Definitely learned physics, but the psets can be a drag. (A difficult drag)",
    "Yes, because a basic knowledge of physics is essential in the lives of anybody who wants to understand the universe they live in.",
    "I think that if you have to take intro physics, 180 is probably better than 170 or 200 (avoid the flipped classroom at all costs) as long as you take it with Nikhil (Professor Padmanabhan). He cares so much about his students and really did a stellar job in lecture. The students who take 180 are not necessarily the most excited about physics (there are a lot of pre-meds), which can be a little sad, and I didn't really learn a lot of wholly new material, but I do feel like my understanding of how to approach problems in physics improved. If you're like me and want an intro physics class that is serious but doesn't assume much background knowledge, 180 is probably a good choice, but do be prepared to do some annoying problem sets.",
    "I haven't taken Physics 170, so I can't really compare, but this was overall an okay course. You learn basic Newtonian physics which is good for a lot of requirements. There are lots of resources to help with psets which, though long, do help in learning. It was a lot of work, but if you have to take Physics, take this class.",
    "Heyalllll to the no.",
    "I would recommend this course as the professors present the material well and are very willing to work with students. Additionally, the grading system is reasonable, and the problem sets are challenging but manageable and help reinforce understanding of the material.",
    "Listen up, kids. You think you've got this because you took physics in high school, or because you're good at math, or just because you're smart. Well, I'm here to tell you that you will fail this class if you try to skate by. Not that the professors are trying to make that happen. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nikhil Padmanabhan is a HERO who will do his darnedest to not only help you learn physics but also to help you learn to ?like it? (how?? I don't know, he's just a physics ninja that swoops in and suddenly you understand things). But you've gotta put in the work too. Go to study hall and work on problems with other people. Start the psets early; if you want to do them right, it's going to take time. But they're the best indicator of what's important in a class, and a lot of the test problems are similar to them. Lecture might seem easy, especially if you've taken AP Classical before, but those psets and tests will kick your butt if you don't pay attention to them. That said, grading is very fair, and the class is structured to help you succeed. You probably have to take it no matter what, but if you stick with it and work hard, you'll learn some dang physics.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course to another student. It was poorly taught and made unnecessarily difficult. Lecture notes were not clear and study hall sessions were not helpful because the TAs had difficulty answering the homework assignment problems and professors that attended study hall sessions gave roundabout answers to students rather than actually helping them answer the homework problems. The professors purposefully made the homework assignments overly difficult and long. The questions were all difficult and obscure and there was no emphasis on basic concepts and trends. Because of this, even after finishing a ten-question homework assignment I felt shaky on what I learned because I still had no good review of the basic concepts we had learned. It was also clear that the professors who taught the different sections didn't communicate and this made the course more unorganized and, ultimately, more difficult. I know that, unfortunately, this course is required for most people who are considering taking it so if you do have to take this course, find a professor who holds that most office hours (as attending office hours was the only way I was able to finish the homework) and keep up with the material as best as you can.",
    "Professor P is one of the most dedicated professors known to man. This is not hyperbole. He dedicates four evenings a week (three study halls and office hours) to helping his students learn the material, even though it's like basic algebra for him.",
    "Great professors, interesting psets that are a bit challenging, definitely a solid physics course. It will take some time though if you're not as familiar with physics concepts, and especially if you're newer to physics.",
    "Not unless it was required.",
    "I recommend this class; it's appropriate for a lot of students for a lot of reasons. If you enjoy physics but don't want to live and breathe it, this is a good choice over 200 and 260, and if you prefer straight-up classical physics instead of physics muddled with biology, this is a good choice over 170. If you're premed and have taken some sort of physics before, then this is also a good choice, but if you've never seen physics before then go for 170.",
    "Have a good study group and make sure you have time to go to office hours, otherwise the workload will be impossible. Probably would not be wise to take if not required for your major, but a great intro course when choosing between the 4 offered.",
    "Yes, especially if you're just trying to get the engineering physics requirement out of the way.",
    "I would definitely not recommend taking physics unless absolutely necessary as I think it is much more boring than other science classes you could take, but if you do need to take it, the set-up of the class with test corrections and a large chunk of your grade determined by homework should allow you to do pretty well. The actual classes are painfully boring and you have to attend lecture in order to get clicker points, but it's something you'll get through if you do indeed have to take the course.",
    "No, unless you take it with Professor P. Steinacker was awful and didn't teach us enough to excel on the midterms or psets. Way too much work outside of class though.",
    "This class gave me a more solid understanding of the physics I learned in AP Physics 1\/2. I found it reasonably easy to follow but it could be challenging for someone with minimal physics background.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class, even if not required, take it for the science or quantitative reasoning credit! (depends on who's teaching it, but this semester all the professors were great)",
    "You're probably taking the course because you have to. The coursework is manageable. You can even do an entire problem set in one night, even though your soul will feel drained by the end of it. I would recommend taking advantage of the support (study halls, office hours, Piazza, etc) built into the course, and try to stay on top of the material. Midterms\/final weren't awful and corrections are a lifesaver. I didn't have Nikhil, but he's great. Adriane is a little less clear, but her notes are impeccable. If you want, take the time to know them as people - it will warm your heart.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 180, especially if it is taught by Professor Padmanabhan. It is well-taught, and Professor Padmanabhan's enthusiasm as well as concern for student learning is very apparent.",
    "Yes if you are willing to put in the time and effort into the problem sets and test preparation.",
    "I believe that this course is necessary for building a foundation for knowledge and skills in physics with a calculus perspective. I believe this course is crucial for students in engineering majors.",
    "This is a fairly standard introductory physics class, so I would recommend it if you need to complete some sort of physics requirement.",
    "Yes, this class helped me recall basic physical principles while applying new ones to my previous knowledge.",
    "If you want to learn physics, this is a pretty approachable and straightforward way to do it.",
    "Great introduction and extension of newtonian physics beyond high school material without getting too advanced. Hard at times, but so many recourses to help explain things.",
    "If you're deciding between this and PHYS 170, please consider 170 if you aren't the super math-y type that enjoys psets that necessitate hours of collaboration during office hours to solve.",
    "yes",
    "An in-depth introduction to the physical laws that govern our world. The course tests you on some tricky concepts, but the professors are helpful and make themselves very available in office hours and study halls to help you solve problems. Be prepared to work hard for the PSETS, as they take a long time to complete. Exams are difficult but fair.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to...and if you have to, be sure you're willing to invest hours into problem sets and study halls. If you're not, take 170\/171still difficult, but less so.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to someone with minimal physics knowledge. For someone with more knowledge of physics, I would recommend looking at a higher level course. I came in with some physics experience, and lots of the lectures weren't too engaging for me. But if you're just entering physics, this can be a great and challenging course!",
    "Difficult if you have not taken AP physics in high school, but manageable. It's a lot of work so know what you're getting into if you don't need to take it for your major.",
    "I would recommend this course even for non-stem students if you want to learn physics in a positive learning environment and you are willing to devote about 8-10 hours to doing the problem set every week. Professors are great: always friendly and very helpful. The midterms were good and fair but I thought the final included 2-3 problems that weren't just hard in the sense that we really needed to be a master of the material and work fast, but it was that I don't think we had appropriate tools to solve them (just knowing what we learned in the class- maybe there are students who have outside physics knowledge that could solve them). Tip: Go to Steinacker's review sessions since they are great at summarizing important topics!",
    "Don't take it unless you have or you really love physics. ThE lectures are fine, but the psets and exams have obliterated some.",
    "I'd recommend the course if you're familiar with calculus (especially applying calculus to three-dimensional objects) and have a physics background. I don't know about the 170-171 courses (physics for pre-meds), but I think 180 is better than 170 (I am pre-med). If you can, take Prof. Padmanabhan's 180 section (not the one I took). I plan to take 171 in the spring, since I have not learned or plan to learn the requisite math for 181 (MATH 120). It's a difficult course. If you enroll, make sure to go to office hours and study hall to work on problem sets. Collaboration is the only way to finish the long problem sets in time, but make sure you can also work through all of the material yourself in preparation for exams.",
    "As an introductory physics course, I would definitely recommend PHYS 180. The workload is not too much, but that being said I came in having already taken AP Physics, and my friends who had not previously taken physics struggled with concepts that were already familiar to me.",
    "Great intro physics course - satisfies curiosity and prerequisites",
    "This course is a basic introduction to physics. The majority of the class seemed to have taken college-level physics in high school and was thus very prepared for the work. The course follows the book most of the time, however there is material in the course which is not directly stated in the book. The professors are helpful and it is an incredible advantage to go to office hours for assistance.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this course with Professor P if you can. This class was not easy but I learned to love physics again. Professor P cares so much about physics and stays until midnight sometimes to help you with your pset in study hall. There are very few professors that are as dedicated as he is. I recommend starting your pset a week in advance, going to study hall and review sessions, and asking questions if you have them. Working in groups is also great.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. If you have a good physics background, this course will be a good refresher, without absolutely busting your chops. If you're looking for more of a challenge, look to 200, not 180, but beware - the things that make 200 more difficult may not all be the stimulating intellectual challenge you're looking for. I'd say 180 is the way to go!",
    "Definitely, if you can get Dr. P, it's 100% worth it.",
    "yes. Nikhil Padmanabhan is the best professor I have had at Yale, hands down. It's a tough class but as long as you practice the concepts as much as you can with book problems, psets, and even problems you find online, you'll be so fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone that wants to take Intro Physics. The problem sets, the number of midterms and all the help offered by the instructors make it a great Intro course.",
    "I would. Solid physics class.",
    "Only if needed",
    "Yes but it is a ton of work so be careful",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because physics offers a student a set of analysis tools to aid one in approaching complex happenings in the world around. This introductory course provided a good foundation of the basics of mechanics, but allowed for one to dig deeper into the topics.",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot of useful strategies.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. You really are challenged, but it makes you so much sharper in the end.",
    "This class depends a lot on who your professor is. It's still very difficult no matter who your teacher is. I would not recommend it, but since its a requirement for many majors and pre-med, you don't have much choice. Maybe shop Phys 170 and see which is less painful. Honestly, this is the most challenging class I've ever endured at this university and I'm definitely not alone. I strongly believe that this class is unnecessarily difficult. If you don't have much physics experience, my advice is to get tutoring\/help ASAP because this class is extremely intense.",
    "Pretty heavy workload, especially if you're not hardcore STEM (weekly pset, each took me about 8 hrs). But as far as intro physics courses go, I felt it was a good choice. I have AP physics background and I found the difficulty level appropriate. You may struggle if you have no physics background or only basic level physics. However, the professors know this, and they make themselves very available at office hours and study halls. They are awesome! Also, I like the straightforward learning style (as opposed to 200's flipped classroom style). Psets are hard but it is worth it when you figure out the problems! You learn a lot from the psets and the class.",
    "don't take it unless you need it",
    "This class will teach you a lot but be prepared to work really, really hard, especially if you have mininal background in physics.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student because I didn't really enjoy it. But maybe someone more mathematically inclined than I would enjoy it. That being said, I am proud of what I learned in the course.",
    "it's a good intro physics class but it's SOOOO much work. be prepared. but the profs always help w homework and studying which is great",
    "Be prepared to spend lots of time in study hall in order to do well on the problem sets. DEFINITELY try to get Professor Padmanabhan, he is a wonderful angel who is incredibly nice and accessible for help and who helps you grow as a student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for those that enjoy math, problem solving, and physics. Although very tough, this class is satisfying. It provides a deeper understanding of physics concepts and formulas. You really have to understand derivations and concepts to excel in this class. The problem sets each week take forever though.",
    "It is definitely good to have a basic grasp of physics, and in many cases required as part of the major so by that standard I would recommend the course, though also warn that the workload is very high.",
    "Most people take this class because they absolutely have to. Not a \"take for kicks and giggles\" class unfortunately.",
    "If you have to take physics then 180 is a pretty good option. I would recommend taking it with Professor Padmanabhan if possible. Starting the problem sets early might eliminate some of the stress of the course and if you start studying early then it should not be too difficult to do well in the class.",
    "Because of the large workload, I would only recommend this course if the student was required to take it, was very interested in physics, or had a lot of previous experience with physics.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone unless they had to take it. Problem sets took 10+ hours each and exams were hard.",
    "Yes. It's a cool introduction to the physics of the world around us, and a useful course even for those for which it is not a prerequisite.",
    "No, but unfortunately most don't have the luxury to decide whether or no to take this class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course if you haven't taken physics yet as an introduction to mechanics! The course staff is brilliant and I believe the pacing to be suitable even if you haven't taken AP physics in high school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course with Professor Steinacker--attend office hours! She has plenty and makes it easy for you to get help if you need it.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless he\/she had to take it for their major\/pre-med. This is definitely not a course one should take for fun. The amount of time and energy that is spent for this class is not worth taking it for fun. I felt anxious and stressed out pretty much the entire semester because of this class.",
    "I enjoyed this class, thanks to professor steinacker. I have a really hard time focusing during 75 minute-long classes, but between professor steinacker's thorough online lecture notes, her cool demonstrations in class, and office hours, I felt like I completely understood all of the material in this class. Physics isn't always the most fun class, but Professor Steinacker does her best to show how physics can be fun with cool applications and practice problems. The psets could be tough, but were totally doable with the help of professor steinacker during office hours. On Professor Steinacker: she is amazing!! She is a great lecturer and makes a huge effort to show that physics is lovable and exciting. Professor Steinacker's office hours were also so great-- such a supportive and informative environment. Professor Steinacker also make a big effort to get to know here students, which is super impressive, considering she taught two huge sections. I cannot say enough good things about professor steinacker!!!",
    "Yes, definitely; you will learn so much especially with Nikhil!",
    "This is a great course and you learn a lot about physics. I didn't take physics in high school, so it was challenging in the beginning but I caught up eventually. Workload is psets every week (which usually take up a significant chunk of time), 2 midterms (that you can correct for 50% back), and a final. It's a lot of work but there's a lot of help available.",
    "Yes! I would recommend Savan Kharel's section, it is an interactive learning style so you are expected to read ahead of class but it's worth it because you will never be bored in class!",
    "Yes",
    "Like you do have to take it, and it''s not a terrible course.",
    "Yes, but not as a pure elective. If you are interested in sciences, engineering, or quantitative problem solving, then I certainly recommend this course.",
    "I recommend this course to any student who needs a basic understanding of physics.",
    "Take physics 180 if you need to take physics for your major.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they had an interest in the sciences and were either a STEM major or a humanities major. The knowledge one learns in Physics is present through so many aspects of life that even if one did not use it again it would expand their thinking.",
    "I would recommend taking this course, especially with Professor Steinacker. She was a great lecturer and was incredibly accessible outside of class hours. This was a good introduction to calculus based physics.",
    "I would, as this was a great introduction to college physics, and was challenging yet manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. This class is really hard, however, this is one of the classes where I feel i have learned more than I ever though I would. It also taught me how to be a better students, and i feel like this challenge was worth it. Also the professors are absolutely amazing. Although the class is really hard the professors do everything in their power to help you understand.",
    "If you have to take physics, this is one of the most painless ways to do it.",
    "Nikhil is an amazing professor and super friendly. He always stayed late at study halls and was super kind in office hours. The teachers of this course are very kind and care about students' well-being. The material in the course is straightforward, but homework and exams are difficult. The class will consume a lot of your time (especially if you haven't taken AP Physics). However, if you get started on the weekly psets early on so you don't have to wait until Thursday study hall and start preparing for exams early, you should be fine. You get to correct your midterms which is great and grading in general is kind. The grading in this course made me really appreciate this class because it let students focus more on understanding the material than fretting about their gpa. Other STEM classes should take note.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Honestly, do not take this course unless you must for a major requirement\/prereq. It is not fun. The problem sets are terrible and take a very long time. The questions are not written very well, and some are impossible to figure out without the help of the TA's. However, there are study halls where the TAs and professors stay to help with the problems. If you have to take the class, you will get through it, but probably won't enjoy it.",
    "Ya, if you want to learn physics, take this class.",
    "Take it if you have to, but don't take it for fun. I think it made me worse at physics.",
    "Only if you have to take a physics class.",
    "People spent 15 hours a week on these psets. They require a lot of work and there are always a couple of questions on each the you really need to put a lot of time and effort into and that are very very challenging, but it is very possible to do well on them if you put in the time and work with other people. The exams are very fair. Two midterm and a final. you can do test corrections for the midterms to get back half points. Overall fair grading, but again weekly psets just require a to of time so the workload gets heavy. Compared to 170: 180 psets are harder and take more time. So 180 has a heavier course load and requires some higher level math. Need to do integrals etc. 170 is hard in that it is odd conceptually becuase it is not as straight forward physics. 180 follows a more typical physics curriculum. I will be continuing with the 180 sequence and doing 181 in the spring.",
    "Yes it was a good course with lots of support but the assessments were difficult and sometimes hard to do. The psets are definitely better to do with friends and the TA's",
    "I recommend establishing a study group early and going to study hall often",
    "Not super stimulating but a decent summary of simple physics.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 180 to most students. The workload included a weekly problem set that would take 4+ hours and most students, myself included, found to be unnecessarily difficult and complex. If you're willing to put in the work, go to office hours and study hall, then you'll learn a lot. Also look into PHYS 170 and PHYS 200, as they might be easier than 180.",
    "I think the class is very well taught, but way beyond the needs of some students, and so I would caution students against taking the class unless they have a high level of interest and are willing to delve deep into the math behind physics, or they must take the course. I was in the latter cohort and found the course fascinating, but incredibly frustrating. This was mainly due to the hours spent working outside of class towards something that was not important to me and seemed irrelevant to what I hope to do. Both Professors Padmanabhan and Steinacker were brilliant and I would highly recommend either to future students. Office hours are also incredibly useful, and I found them necessary. They were infinitely more helpful than the high-stress, packed study halls."
