   "comments": [
    "Every section of L4 Spanish has the same syllabus, homework, and exams. There is a lot of work involved (more than 1.5 classes worth), so I wouldn't recommend unless you are either very interested in becoming proficient in Spanish or need to fulfill the language requirement. If you are going to take 140, Safille is a fantastic option. Her energy woke me up every morning, and each class was exciting and instructional. She prepares her own grammar explanations that are better than those provided in the books. She encourages students to speak as much as possible, all in preparation for your oral presentations and exams. With a background in theatre, she believes in defining words however she can without using English. To demonstrate the word \"to chase,\" she chased one of the students in a circle around the classroom. You will improve a lot in that class, and you will probably enjoy her overall too.",
    "SPAN 140 builds on the fundamentals that were taught in previous Spanish courses and hones your speaking, reading, and listening skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. SPAN 140 allowed me to practice Spanish frequently, and after taking this class, I feel extremely proficient in the language.",
    "A frustrating and unenjoyable course. If you like language courses, you will probably be fine, but the class demands a lot of time and has a lot of homework. Professor Safille cares a lot about her students, but her course can be exhausting. Do not take this section if you are quiet in class!",
    "Spanish 140 is a very engaging grammar, reading, and vocabulary-based Spanish course in which students learn all the facets of the Spanish language and how to communicate with others. It also includes a novel which is read by all students and later discussed. I would highly recommend this course to any student wanting to improve his or her Spanish."
