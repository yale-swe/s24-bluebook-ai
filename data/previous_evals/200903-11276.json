    "Very math intensive course.",
    "It's a decent course. It was interesting at first, but then got progressively more boring as you realize that you're doing the same thing over and over again and making the same sorts of arguments. They say it's more mathy than the other intermediate micro course, but there really wasn't that much math involved; there was a ton of problem solving though.Prof. Gerardi is generally good at explaining things, even if his accent is tough to understand at first. And even though he yells at you when you ask questions, I think he genuinely wants to help you understand, even if it seems like he's exacerbated that you could be so stupid as to not get what he's saying.",
    "Only if you want to work incredibly hard for little payoff. I've heard that you have to pay your dues when it comes to Econ and take these classes, but there's no reason that such interesting material has to have the life sucked out of it by a class like this. Take if you \"get\" math and econ. If you don't, bite the bullet and take Intermediate Micro.",
    "You'll have to put in a lot of work, and you'll have to attend lecture. Some of the things we were taught were definitely not in the textbook. The class is theoretical, but it's not impossible to wrap your head around if you're willing to sit down and actually figure out the material. Don't expect to understand it after one read\/lecture, though.",
    "Challenging but, at least for me, well worthwhile.",
    "Take this course if you like figuring things out on your own. The lecture and textbook are highly theoretical and the problem sets and tests are mostly problem solving. So if you want to put in the time reconciling the differences, go for it. You should be good at math to take this class over the regular intermediate micro, but just because you are good at math isn't necessarily a reason to take this class.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a good introduction to theoretical economics, and gives a good grounding in consumer choice and optimization in general.",
    "Take Intermediate Micro",
    "THEORY gives you the formal mathematical background behind microeconomics. Many people in this class (myself included) were not econ majors. So taking the class really clears up the subject...that is once you get a hang of it. The first few weeks are tricky and can be quite scary if you don't have a background in formal math (I didn't) but after the first hump it should be pretty smooth sailing.",
    "If you are interested in a (relatively) mathematically rigorous treatment of microeconomics, and are both comfortable and satisfied by a proof-based approach to learning, Micro Theory is a fantastic course that you should enjoy very much. Problem sets are very manageable and lectures are very clear and comprehensive. Warning: this is in many ways a math class, and if you are not interested in rather abstract theory, consider taking intermediate economics. Otherwise, this is a very enjoyable class.",
    "Class:Overall I don't think this was a very interesting class. I really enjoyed intro microeconomics, but found the material in this class fairly dry. A lot of time was spent reviewing concepts already covered in an intro class, just more rigorously. It did give me some needed practice with calculus and analytic problem solving. However the range of problem solving techniques used was limited.Professor:Gerardi's very derogatory and has trouble answering questions in a satisfactory way. Instead he makes students feel dumb until they stop questioning. Don't let him intimidate you - his condescending attitude is immature and shouldn't be tolerated. Worst professor I've had at Yale. Period.",
    "The class covers a lot of material, so you will learn a lot, but keeping track of everything can be a challenge.",
    "A thorough, math heavy course on microeconomics. Most of the concepts were covered in the intro micro class but not in nearly as much detail. I would suggest taking it if you have a strong background in micro and calculus.",
    "This is not an easy question to answer. I will break down my response into categories, based on where you are in your Yale career and how you are planning to use this class. General notes are atthe end.Ambitious Freshman interested in an econ major: This class just might be for you. In fact, the only time I would recommend this course is to someone in your position. The class is an introduction to proof-based, calculus-based microeconomic models and theory. It helps to be strong in math, but you should also have some of the basics of microeconomics down. You can take this course as your first economics class ever - Prof. Gerardi starts from the beginning - but don't expect any hand-holding if you get lost. Stay on top of your game. That means if you're really interested in taking this class, it needs to be your number one priority. Don't take it with DS and freshman orgo. Commit to this class and it will pay off.Sophomore interested in economics:A) Sophomore who has taken ECON 115: What are you doing? Take ECON 152. If you want math based econ, then consider the class - sit in on the first couple lectures, but keep up with the ECON 152 coursework too because you'll want to keep that option open. Also there's plenty of time for math econ in grad school.B) Sophomore who has NOT taken ECON 115: Take ECON 115. That's not even a hard choice. You will learn the basics of economics, you will. If you are inexperienced with econ and you take this class during your sophomore year you might not want to even look at econ ever again. If you're ok with that possibility and want to try this class out go to the first few lectures, but have a friend take notes for you in ECON 115, because they meet at the same time and you'll want to keep 115 as an option. If you're really interested in economics, don't let this class ruin it for you. you're just a sophomore, you've got plenty of time.Anyone else: Why are you even reading this evaluation? Do you need a social science? Take psych or something, what are you thinking? Seriously. If you have a passing interest in Econ and want to learn the basics, take 115. If you want a challenge and don't really care as much about learning econ but still want some grasp ofthe ideas, audit 152. There is no reason for you to take this class. You will NOT learn economics, and you will spend a massive amount of time on something you don't even enjoy doing. That is not a smart decision. You don't have that many semesters left at this wonderful place, don't waste a class.Some general notes:If you do take this class, there are some things you need to know. Professor Gerardi is very knowledgeable about economics, that's for sure. However, he distances himself from his students and seems to not like them very much in general. He is actually a really nice guy, he just gets easily frustrated when his students don't understand the material. Keep on top of the material - study your notes from the previous lecture before going to lecture, really. During lecture keep your head down and just take extensive notes. DO NOT ask a question unless you think (and are pretty certain) Prof. Gerardi has made a mistake. The only time you should speak or make any noise or movement in class is if he asks the class a question about the material. Then you should answer him as quickly and possible IF AND ONLY IF you KNOW your answer is correct. Go to section if you want to ask questions, that's the right place to do it. Finally, when Prof. Gerardi is writing on the board, if it looks like a 'z', it's probably an 'r', If it looks like an 'e', it's probably an 'a', and a long underscore after a definition or theorem means \"with at least one strict inequality\" (also seen as \"W.A.L.O.S.I.\"). Good luck."
