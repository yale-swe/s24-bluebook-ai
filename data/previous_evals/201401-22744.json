    "Yes, the material applies to students from different fields.",
    "Great course that will prepare you in a very serious way for the work that we are all supposed to be doing as literary scholars in a rapidly changing disciplinary context. Essential stuff at least for all grad students in English. So, yes, definitely recommended",
    "I would recommend this course highly but with the caveat that a number of readings were at times quite abstruse. However, I found the seminar to be highly stimulating and with a great deal of interdisciplinary relevance."

    "Feel like I have a sense of where the field of English literary criticism is at this moment and why. All three of my papers this semester were at least in part inspired by material from this course"
