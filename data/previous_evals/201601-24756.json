   "comments": [
    "It's a class on commitment makinghow to make and keep commitments, particularly those commitments that are most important in life (marriage and family, community, vocation, and faith or philosophy). It's an excellent course, well-constructed, and was a pleasure to be a part of on a weekly basis. I'm really quite sad that it's ended!",
    "Great class - group therapy of sorts.",
    "MUST TAKE THE COURSE. If you want your vision for your life to be fundamentally challenged before you graduate, in conversation with great literature and guided by one of our great political commentators, take this course. You'll really have to think through what a moral life looks like in practice.",
    "I would recommend the class to an undergraduate student or a student who wants to have a creative writing outlet. This is the reason I took the course. While I believe other grad students could benefit from the experience, perhaps the seminars themselves would be a bit tedious. A smaller, graduate level class would be more useful."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know that this class actually helped prepare me for my dissertation. It certainly helped me with my life.",
    "As someone preparing for leadership at the intersection of business and divinity, this course was simply amazing. It was especially helpful to think through moral categories from a perspective that was not specifically religious, but also not antithetical to religion. I wrote my masters thesis this year on the \"contemporary crisis in higher education\" which focuses especially on the marginalization of the humanities. Since I diagnose the crisis as a moral crisis, this class was perfect for my research as well.",
    "This course helped advance my writing skills and I am grateful for the opportunity to have shared my writings with a seasoned writer like Brooks. It allowed me to explore in writing some of the difficult issues I am facing internally that I don't often get to write about, and served as a great therapeutic exercise."
