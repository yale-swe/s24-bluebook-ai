   "comments": [
    "HARDER THAN YOU THINK. Don't view this as an easy class- it's pretty hard when the larger concepts come around. But it's very helpful and very satisfying if you are someone who knows nothing about music theory!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn so much about music and Lalli is a fantastic instructor.",
    "If you are in a singing group on campus and want to truly learn about what you are singing, this is a great class for you!!",
    "Take this class! It's a great intro to the basics of music theory. If you have any background in music at all it will be really easy, and if you don't it still won't be terribly difficult and you will learn a ton. Take it with Lalli if you can, he's wonderful!",
    "YES. If you at all interested in music, for whatever reason, take this class.",
    "Yes I would! I think it is perfect for someone who just really needs to know the basics, or for someone who wants to see if they like music theory, or anyone who performs or is around music",
    "Introduction to the writing and reading of melodies, focusing on pitches, intervals, and chords. Even if you don't intend to pursue music further (I don't), it's a really great way to understand music better.",
    "This is an introductory course in reading, playing and listening to music. I would recommend this course to someone who in interested reading and understanding music beyond just listening to it.",
    "MUSI 110 overall is a class on basic music theory - rhythm, pitch, key signatures, chords, and basic harmonic analysis is covered. Lots of information but really amazing and worthwhile if you take it with Prof. Lalli.",
    "MUSI 110 is a very basic and fun class for people that want to learn the fundamentals of how music is created. It is not particularly difficult but it is extremely cumulative so understanding the topics in the beginning will make a world of difference for understanding later in the course. The course is also very fun and there is a ton of class participation, often in the form of singing. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students whether they are musicians or not."
