   "comments": [
    "I liked that the we were given the slides in advance. The course gave a nice baseline overview of tox and then proceeded to get more in depth with important chemicals.",
    "Very well organized and useful",
    "Useful!",
    "Designed in a way as to encourage engagement of the material through different exercises\/assignments. Lectures can be dense and prompts for assignments a bit unclear. That being said the material is generously available in trying to apply concepts learned.Cheryl FieldsKnowledgeable, comfortable with being conversational about concepts, willing to engage, supportive. Comments on assignments direct and guiding. More than fair treatment of efforts made in trying to answer questions.Jonathan BorakVery knowledgeable, comfortable with being conversational about concepts, willing to engage, supportive. Also fair, encouraging of participation.",
    "This felt like an organic chemistry or biochemistry course. This course should definitely have a science pre-requisite. I wish there had been more public health relevant information taught in the lectures. There was a lot of referring back to risk assessment, which was hard to follow if you hadn't taken the risk assessment course. A lot of listing of various epidemiologic studies and their results, which I didn't find particularly helpful. Enjoyed the group presentations and the papers. A lot of clinical aspects were discussed, which, while interesting, didn't add much to my public health perspective of toxicology.",
    "I found that the course was extremely technical. Not having a science background made much of the class a struggle. It seemed as though individuals with a science or medical background would excel in the course.",
    "Although I did enjoy this course and found the topics to be very interesting, I often found it very difficult to understand some of the topics, since it is based heavily on chemistry and biology, which is problematic if you did not come from this background. However, both instructors are aware of this issue, and were always willing to help clear up any confusion.",
    "Outstanding introduction to basic principles of toxicology, nicely integrates material from risk assessment at the end of the course, instructors are very attentive to students. No major weaknesses.",
    "Great class. Interesting material that is presented in a clinically up to date way. I enjoy Dr. Borak's teaching methods. I think the class was well organized and the expectations clear.",
    "It was one of the best classes at YSPH. Had both depth in biochemical principles and breadth in real world examples and information for public health practice.",
    "Good course on learning basic concepts of toxicology and how to use this knowledge as public health professionals.Weaknesses: a review of some key biochemistry concepts would have been helpful.Dr. Borak's lectures were very clear and comprehensive. Dr. Borak gave helpful feedback and guidance on how to approach the assignments and exams.Dr. Fields was very helpful in providing individual feedback to students. However, the in class reviews of the papers were not quite as helpful, since the papers were reviewed before they had been handed back. I feel like I could have gotten more out of the paper reviews, had I been able to take notes on my graded assignment.In reviewing the assignments, dr. Fields would sometimes ask people to show hands to indicate whether they included something in their paper or had gotten a math question wrong. Dr. Fields clearly cared about how everyone was doing in class, but showing hands on one's performance on an assignment is not something most students like to do and I felt it was not necessarily helpful in better understanding the material.",
    "The course could be structured better.",
    "interesting, informative",
    "Overall, the class was okay. Much of the time, the lectures seemed very long and did not involve much class participation. At times, it was difficult to maintain concentration. Group presentations were nice. The small assignments (papers and math sets) were not terribly difficult. The midterm and final, however, were hard. The material itself was not an issues, but there was so much information and so many details that it was hard to know what to study--especially for the final.",
    "Strengths: very responsive and helpful professors, gave me a new perspective on the risks associated with chemicals and how to interpret risk.Weakness: course presupposes a scientific background, making for a relatively steep learning curve for persons without said background.",
    "Strengths: The problem sets and papers were beneficial exercises. Examples of concepts were excellent, easy to understand.Weaknesses: On exams, memorization of formulas and other questions requiring regurgitation of material did not seem applicable for life outside the course.",
    "The subject matter for this course is very interesting. The structure and execution of it was not the best I've had at the school of public health. I would have liked a concrete document for the syllabus. The information about schedule and expectations was spread over multiple documents, and it wasn't as easy as it could have been to pull up the grading breakdown and things like that. I know people were a little confused about expectations for the exams and presentations. I thought the expectations for the papers were very clear and easy to follow. As far as content goes, I would have preferred to go through the technical content in the beginning a bit faster and spent more time on the toxicological mechanisms of different specific compounds.Since the system won't let me enter text on question 7, here are my instructor evalsDr. FieldsShe was approachable and gave good feedback on the papers. I liked her lectures, and I was very grateful for the time she spent going over the papers.Dr BorakHe did a good job explaining the basic toxicological concepts at the beginning. Sometimes it felt like he spent more time justifying that he was going to cover certain content than he did actually presenting the content. He didn't need to do that. He wasn't as approachable as Dr. Fields, and there were some points at which he was borderline condescending."

    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Excellent instruction and approach",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl did a good job making her lectures clear and accessible to the students. My only suggestion would be changing the way papers\/exam answers were reviewed. I understood that going over papers even before they were graded was meant to help us understand the material before our exams, but I found it very stressful to hear the \"ideal\" answers without knowing my grade on the assignment. I left those classes feeling like I had certainly failed but later found out that my grades were ok. With the mid-term exam answer review I found it discouraging that students were asked to admit whether they were the ones who had gotten questions right or wrong. Hearing that an answer was \"obvious\" or a question was \"easy\" doesn't make you feel better about having gotten it wrong and doesn't encourage you to ask questions to clarify since it would be embarrassing to reveal being the student who got a question wrong in front of the whole class.",

   "comments": [
    "It was an eye-opening course, the assignments really made you think about the toxins in question, I did not like that we had to memorize the formulas for the exams because in practice we would neverhave to do so and it made us focus on pure memorization of those formulas rather than understanding when and how to use them (but maybe they though it would be too easy if the formulas were given). Overall a great course!",
    "Highly recommend to those interested in the concepts and methodologies in Toxicology",
    "Great!",
    "A very qualitative look at toxicology that focuses on critical mechanisms and examples of chemicals that can have adverse effect (with context).",
    "A very good overview of toxicology and toxicological concepts. The course is interesting in that it provides both explanations of the way toxicological mechanisms function and different, specific examples of these mechanisms. It also offers applications to public health policy for those whose interests aren't specifically tox-related.It's a lot of material, which makes exams kind of tough in some respects, but overall would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Would be difficult without a science background. Wish it would be more relevant to public health instead of being just taught a lot of biochemistry and clinical aspects of toxicology.",
    "The course taught me a lot about basic tox. I do feel as though much of the class was extremely technical and required a background in human biology than I had.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Outstanding introduction to basic principles of toxicology.",
    "Great course for anyone interested in enviornmental\/occupational medicine.",
    "Essential for understanding Environmental Health Sciences. Way better than the other EHS option for required courses.",
    "Interesting and helpful course in understanding basic toxicology concepts from a public health perspective. The course was enjoyable and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Don't recommend unless it is an absolute requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Because it is helpful to the future work.",
    "Interesting class. Instructors try to cover topics that would be of interest to young people\/students. You'll learn about dose-response, reactive agents, mechanisms of toxicity, etc. The course is chemistry based. It would helpful to have a good grasp of organic chemistry before taking it.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone with a background in organic chemistry and biology, or who was planning to go into environmental health issues related to regulation.",
    "I'd recommend for students interested in toxicology with a chemistry background.",
    "While I was really excited to learn about toxicology, this course was somewhat frustrating. It doesn't feel like we covered all that much toxicology, and it didn't feel like we knew what to expect. I would recommend this course to people with a good background in chemistry and physiology, but students without that background may find this course very difficult and frustrating."
