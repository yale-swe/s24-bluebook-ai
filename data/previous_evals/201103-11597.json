   "comments": [
    "This is very much a history course. If you are trying to get an Econ and WR credit out of the way at the same time, reconsider. The material is largely boring.",
    "American Economics is a rewarding class to take if you are willing to put in the time and work. The class does put a heavy focus on writing and you should expect to spend a lot of time working on your three essays to get an A. Lecture can be boring at times, but the final draws a lot from lecture so it is important to go.",
    "whether you're an econ\/history major or not, you will learn a lot from this class. The class was straightforward, not too much work, and you get a writing credit out of it. would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Depends, if you need the WR or want the major credit, yet. But there are better WRs offered, though not in the econ major.",
    "This was a good class. I'm usually a harsh critique when I talk about classes on these forums, but this was worthwhile. It's a WRITING CREDIT! You barely have to do any writing and yeah, the final is sort of difficult to prepare for, but they give you the questions in advance. If you're an econ major, and you hate writing classes. This is your solution.",
    "Solid class. There is a decent amount of reading, but material is pretty interesting. With that being said lectures although interesting, are hard to pay attention too. It provides you with a new way to look at economic history and to question different theories.Overall solid Econ + Writing class. good way to kill 2 birds with one stone",
    "It's a great writing credit and I thought the material was very interesting, but probably would not have liked the course if Jeff were not my TA",
    "Course is taught well, and I found that the sections were an important part of the experience. I would have liked to see more emphasis on the 20th and 21st centuries--that may have been a more practical approach. Nonetheless, the professor makes a compelling argument for why 19th century american economic history is important. I recommend it as a good writing credit for econ majors.",
    "it's an average class, not too good, not bad either",
    "American Economic History is an excellent course. Professor Lamoreaux is an engaging lecturer with a strong thesis, a balanced perspective on both economics and history, and a knack for choosing wonderful course readings. While the course became a bit econ-heavy for my taste mid-semester, there is always a nice balance of history in each class. It really isn't necessary to have taken Intro Micro for this class, so don't allow that to be a deterrent, especially if you're taking the course Cr\/D\/F. There is a great volume of information in the lectures\/readings, but the papers and final examination are incredibly fair (the questions are all given in advance) and focus in on the actual important information in the class rather than obscure details.",
    "The topics were very specific, yet we didn't get into much depth. We jumped quickly from topic to topic and the readings sometimes seemed unrelated to each other. Otherwise, it's a good way to fulfill the WR requirement for Econ majors. As usual, pick your TA wisely.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - one paper a month, maybe 50 pgs of reading + section every week, and a final that you have all the questions to. Bonus was actually learning something, which makes this the rare credit that helps you learn without confining you to Bass all semester. I wasn't that into American history when I went into the class (i mostly took it because I need a Wr) but I came out wanting to take more classes on the area. Make sure you shop around for a good TA though because that will significantly change your experience - lectures can be kind of dull (though Lamoreaux def knows what she's talking about) so your relationship with your section is pretty important.",
    "A good amount of reading that gives you an understanding of how the American economy was shaped.",
    "A course with multiple, complementary objectives: (1) to develop an understanding of American history through reading seminal papers in the economics history literature and (2) to strengthen students' writing and critical reading skills.",
    "A survey of pre-Depression American economic history. Would recommend, although I found the writing more enjoyable than the lectures.",
    "Survey course of American Economic History post-colonialism and pre-1900s. Kinda boring at times but not difficult. Three papers and a final. Just read the papers you need to write on and get a study group for the final.",
    "Great course, taught an interesting way to think about history. Mature, let us read and expected us to critique academic papers essential to the study of the discipline. Wish the teacher posted her lecture notes, as the slides weren't very informative. Good class to take, good material to think about, and a good writing credit for economics majors.",
    "Easily my favorite class this semester. It was more of a history class than an economics course. The reading materials were engaging and definitely provided new ways to look at American history. The workload is not too bad, with three papers spread through the semester and a final with all questionsgiven in advance.",
    "Great class for a Wr credit if you don't want to take a straight up Wr credit. The 3 critique papers are fairly manageable, but took some getting used to. The readings are fairly long, but interesting. I would recommend the class.",
    "I'd gladly recommend the class. There's a rather large amount of possibly boring reading that's required, but if you have any interest in how the American economy has evolved since the late 18th century, by all means take this class.",
    "Yes, its a pretty easy writing credit and overall an interesting and well presented class",
    "Yes, it's a great class. You should definitely take it as you'll learn a lot of material that is twisted and presented incorrectly in history textbooks. This class is about why and what if's. If you're into that, go for it. Great for any person in any major.",
    "Make no mistake about it, this class isn't that easy of a writing credit or extraordinarily accessible. However, once you get past the dryness, it is excellent, and the lessons early American economic history has to teach you about the crises facing our world today are relevant and interesting. If you do decide to take this class, Jessica Hanser (if she's still TA'ing), is definitely the section leader you want to have. Definitely recommend, but be willing to put in some elbow grease for a good grade.",
    "Take it!",
    "great class for interdisciplinary thinking and learning big picture trends of US history",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. It is a relatively easy way to get writing credit and is quite interesting. After taking the class I have a much better appreciation for the economic development of our nation. Additionally, this class really teaches you how to think and break down an argument.",
    "I recommend it to students who're interested in both economics and history, and good at reading and writing about economics.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is more interested in history than economics. The course was a good survey of the major historical events in the development of the U.S. economy but it was not as focused on developing economic models as I had expected."
