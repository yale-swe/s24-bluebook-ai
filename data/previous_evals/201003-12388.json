   "comments": [
    "This is a survey course on early music. If one is interested in the subject matter, take the course.",
    "You have to do it so just suck it up and enjoy it.",
    "Obviously, you're only taking this because you have to, so just try to make it through. (Hint: count the number of YouTube videos Craig Wright plays; it's a great pastime.) The first few weeks of the course are the worst, so try to find a way to endure those so that you have enough energy left to pay attention when you get to the Renaissance, which actually has some cool music. In terms of the work - just put aside 1-2 hours every Sunday evening for the assignments and you should be fine. The midterm and final are rote memorization, so just suck it up and memorize everything. The final project is largely a joke, so don't worry about that too much.",
    "No, don't take it unless you are required to. This class will make you frustrated. The tests are pretty difficult and long, and there is so much information you have to memorize.",
    "If you want to major in music you have to take this class, but you'll enjoy it more and learn more if you don't treat it as a chore. There are some gems in here.",
    "I loved Music 350. I would definitely recommend Music 350 to any Yale student, especially those in the music major. I took the course as a requirement, but it truly inspired my interest in early music history. The course has a clear textbook, is taught clearly, features frequent \"guest visits\" by instrumentalists, and assigns a reasonable and manageable amount of work to students. Both the TAs are always available and willing to help.",
    "It's not as bad as they all say it is. There's a lot going on in the period we study and it's not organized very well, but at least read the chapter summaries (they identify what you really need to know) and go into the class with open ears and open mind. It won't kill you.",
    "I didn't find this course nearly as difficult or as dull as many others have. I still enjoy early music, and in fact plan to listen to more of it now that I understand it better.",
    "Tough course on history of music from antiquity to Renaissance.",
    "This is a tough class but it is worth it. If you are interested in music performance, theory or composition, the musical examples are beautiful and quite fascinating. I was exposed to so many wonderful composers in this course. Prof. Wright makes what could be a very dry topic engaging.",
    "About what I expected. Not a fascinating class, but they do as much as they can to make it interactive.",
    "Not many people take this class if they aren't required to. I wouldn't either. It takes a relatively thin body of work and stretches it out over a full semester. There were interesting moments, but if you're going to take a music history class for fun, take 352.",
    "Well, you probably have to take it. But don't let all the whiners about this class spoil it for you. It's actually not bad.",
    "The other reviews are right, it sucks and it's not worth taking unless you have to. But the music is beautiful and the historical and philosophical issues surrounding it are fascinating. Just don't expect much in lectures that isn't from the textbook (which is pretty condescending but a quick read) or utterly boring and unrelated, except for a few interesting guest lectures (Herreid comes to talk about reconstructing instrumental improvisatory practice, etc). It is a pretty solid intro fact-wise; if you care about the material, look for more to read, and if you don't care, at least it's not really that difficult. And music majors: do take it as soon as you know you're in the major. You gotta start from the beginning, Hepo will be more fun - not just insofar as his lecture style will be a breath of fresh air, but because the over-arching narrative of high art music in Hepo 1600-1960 makes more sense when you see its prehistory in 900-1600.",
    "You won't find many non-music majors taking this course, but that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable. I liked learning about subjects that, while not always relevant to music you'd hear in a concert hall, did inform a lot of the music I play and generally made me feel like a more rounded musician. The course is more like a high-school level course than a college-level course in terms of workload and reading, which are both light. Don't underestimate the amount of time needed to study for the midterm and final, though. There is also a final project, which, while it was actually enjoyable, needs to be time-managed along with the final exam. Lecture may often be boring if you're not into the material, but Professor Wright does a great job of learning everyone's name, taking questions and comments during class and also inviting guest artists and lecturers in for more interesting, detailed classes."
