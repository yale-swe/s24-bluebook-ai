    "Amazing! Take it if you're remotely interested in the subject matter -- the readings are light and cover a lot of relevant topics.",
    "yes take this class for a fun look at interesting matters in cyberlaw",
    "Take it if you like the internet.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a really cool and topical seminar with a great instructor. The final project was also a lot of fun! It's also the sort of class that really makes you think about the issues. I came away from the class with as many questions as I entered with, but now I have a framework to arrive at my own answers. Great class",
    "This class dives through the ever-changing and ever-relevant subject of intellectual property in the contemporary world. While the class does explore some trademark and patent material, most of the class is focused on the issues surrounding copyright. This course only meets once a week and is a discussion style seminar. If you don't do the reading, you will be useless in class, so make sure you do read what is assigned. Elizabeth is a fantastic teacher, who is very relaxed and wants the class to engage you and force you to question some of your convictions and prejudiced beliefs surrounding copyright. Work for the class involves reading responses, blogging, and a final project, so there isn't piles of work, but you should make sure to get it done on time! My best best memory of the class was when, uponfinding a sketchy website for a group supposedly helping people sue for copyright infringement, we called them up and had an attorney spontaneously conference-call the class to talk about their reasons for litigating and their views on the copyright issues surrounding file sharing and fair use. This class is a blast, and you WILL lear a huge amount of knowledge on these issues. This is definitely a must-take class at Yale!",
    "Yeah definitely.",
    "This was an excellent course. I viewed the material in a legal way, while it seemed many in the class were focusing on the computer science side, so that took a bit to get used to, but it is certainly workable from either perspective. A whole lot of interesting information about copyright and the current legal structures in place, plus it helped me to clarify my views on how the system should be changed to make more sense. The readings are engaging (and free - no coursebooks!), and definitely worth doing. Highly recommended.",
    "This class is the best class I've taken at Yale. Elizabeth Stark is an amazing person to meet and learn from, and the subject is relevant and fascinating. If you're interested in learning how copyright rules apply in the digital age, considering mash-ups and remixes, creating content as much as learning about it abstractly, evaluating patent and copyright reform, learning about IP law, discussing privacy issues and downloading copyrighted content, or studying the history of digital rights issues from an awesome young professor, take this class.Seriously. Take this class.",
    "Highly recommended--the work load is not too heavy but the topics and discussions were always very engaging. Elizabeth is a great person to know, and an encouraging mentor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Elizabeth is great. The material is fascinating. Take it!",
    "If you're interested in intellectual property law, then I would recommend this class. You'll learn a lot about IP law and all the issues with it that arise in relation to our current digital age. The readings are interesting, the in-class discussions are interesting, and Elizabeth does a good job at explaining all the relevant law and guiding the classroom discussions. There's a moderate amount of work, but it all should be somewhat enjoyable to do if you're interested in the field. The final project is completely open, which gives you a lot of room to do whatever you want to do.",
    "Very interesting material, not that much work, very rewarding",
    "Engaging and enlightening. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. I think in general it's a class that anyone can relate to on some level. As a student at the school of art it informed my work.",
    "Definitely, very interesting material and a fun environment.",
    "HEll yeah. This class is legit.",
    "IP in the Digital Age is a good class, with the potential to be even better. For me, the first several weeks were the most interesting - we got a good overview of theories and problems and ideas that arise in the intersection of IP and technology. A lot of the legal specifics (often some dry case readings that didn't really teach me anything) and seemingly tangentially related topics (like patent and trademark) were less interesting for me, and I wish we'd focused more on broad theories and creative solutions, but for someone particularly interested in the legal side of things, this class would be great (and for someone not so interested in law, it's still great if you just skip the boring bits). The final project was my favorite part of the course, and we put a lot of effort into it to make something great, and the blog posts were fun, but the reading responses didn't add much for me. Also, the class this semester was too big for everyone to participate in discussions; the one time we broke into smaller groups made things much more manageable. But I would recommend the class - it's a great intro to some very relevant topics."
