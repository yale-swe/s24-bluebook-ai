   "comments": [
    "If a psych major and in need of research methods, do not hesitate to take this course. I highly recommend it. I heard only bad things about research methods and dreaded taking my requirement but loved this course and Arielle is incredible. By far the best professor I have had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to any psychology major. Out of the other research method class options this class seemed to be the most interesting and enjoyable. Professor Baskin-Sommers is also a great lecturer and professor.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are a psychology major in need of a research credit! Even if you are just interested in research in general and don't necessarily need it for the major requirement it is still a pretty good class. If you need to learn about research methods, a rather dry subject, you have to take it with Arielle!",
    "originally, i wasn't excited about taking this course, but sooo glad i took it. thanks to this course, i'm now considering a PhD in clinical psychology. would totally recommend if you have to take a research methods class.",
    "Wonderful, engaging class with a really great professor and not a ton of work. Absolutely take this class! I wasn't expecting to like the material, but I ended up loving it. You'll learn a lot about how to analyze and critique psychological research, which is a super useful skill.",
    "I would recommend this course to other psychology majors, because it teaches essential research methods without assigning irrelevant tasks. It allows students to engage during class meetings as well as design a research project. It was difficult at times, but I still value the experience.",
    "Yes, especially if you're interested in working in a lab or designing studies. Even though its application is in clinical psychology, the principles of research design are universal. Also Arielle is a great professor, very in tune with what students are struggling with or not, SO quick to respond on email with detailed answers, really accommodating to students' needs, funny and smart in the classroom, kept material that could have been boring with another professor pretty interesting, best part was that you really felt like she wanted you to understand the material and would always meet to answer questions or divert from the syllabus schedule to spend more time on things students didn't understand. There are two non-cumulative tests, 6 1-page reaction papers to a psych study in the news throughout the semester, and a 12 page research proposal instead of a final. The research proposal is the trickiest one but Arielle and the TAs are really willing to meet with you to help",
    "Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone in the Psychology major looking to fulfill the Research Methods requirement. More than feeling confident about conducting independent research necessarily, you walk away with a much better vocabulary, nuanced understanding, and ability to critique research.",
    "this was baskin-sommers's first go at teaching research methods and she killed it. she made the class super fun and even though the information isnt particularly interesting her style made it all pretty painless. requirements: final paper (research proposal), 2 exams (noncumulative), 6 papers critiquing science articles (not difficult but took surprising amount of time...). would recommend if youre in need of getting this requirement done.",
    "Great course if you want to get a general overview about how to do solid, ethical research in clinical psychology. Even if you don't plan to do clinical research, it's good information to have just in general. Not too much work - six one-page response papers, a midterm, an in-class final, and a 15-page research proposal. The material is interesting and taught by an engaging, enthusiastic professor. And the assigned book (written by another Yale faculty member, Alan Kazdin) is something I will definitely keep to help me with planning out my senior project.",
    "Through this course, one becomes excited about scrutinizing research and one feels well-equipped to do so.",
    "Very useful course! I truly learned a lot and actually will remember these things! I definitely do not think I would have liked the class if it weren't for the awesome professor and nice and helpful TFs. Definitely a must if you are tryna go into clinical psych!",
    "I would highly recommend this course especially if Arielle is teaching it!",
    "Overall, this course was very good. While I took it only to fulfill the research methods requirement for the Psych major, I ended up learning a lot and found the material surprisingly interesting and applicable beyond psychology. Most written assignments involved writing a one-page critique of a psychology article (of our choosing, found online) in which we commented on the strengths and weaknesses of the research designs and methods of the reported study. I now feel like a much more informed consumer of scientific knowledge, and I realize how many of the studies reported in sources from the reputable (e.g. the New York Times) to the not-as-reputable (e.g. Cosmopolitan magazine?). There were two exams, both of which were very fair and reasonable, as long as you studied (although the grading was tough in that if you lost just a few points, your numerical grade would start to drop quickly). That being said, it was not difficult to do well if you put in the time and made an effort to seek help if you did not understand concepts. The final paper was a good exercise in synthesizing all that we had learned throughout the semester. Compared to what I heard about the general research methods course offered this semester, this one (clinical psych) had a more reasonable work load, but then again it did not count as a Wr credit like the general methods course.",
    "Yes I recommend this research methods class to fill the requirement!",
    "Psyc 250 is a class that will teach you how to be an informed and critical consumer of scientific research. You will also learn how to produce your own work if you decide that is a path you want to take in the future. I would highly recommend this class to another student, especially while Arielle teaches it!",
    "Take it! Definitely the best way to fulfill the research methods requirement for the psych major. Arielle is amazing, the class is fun, and this is definitely a must!"
