    "I would recommended the class to anyone who wants to improve their writing and learn about sports. I think it had a particular appeal for athletes because of the content the course covers, but it was interesting to see our class had 6-7 different sports represented. I considered myself a fairly strong writer going in, but I think my writing has improved a lot from the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my fellow students!",
    "English 114 is a good way to relate a topic of your choice to the world and to see the meaning of that topic. I would recommend this course to another student because it seemed to have been helpful for my writing as well as interesting.",
    "The workload was intensive but reasonable. The readings were fairly interesting, but often times the discussions were fairly boring.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student but make sure you are reasonably interested in the topic.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn how to be a better writer. i would recommend it if you like the topic the class is on. Do not take it just because, you should want to be writing about your topics.",
    "Challenging as an athlete in season. Would suggest taking the course as a freshmen."
