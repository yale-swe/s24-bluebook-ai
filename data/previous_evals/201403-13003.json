   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. Although it is a really easy writing credit, you do not learn anything from the class.",
    "I would recommend it to someone interested in the material. It can get a bit dense so make sure you want to be reading about HR issues",
    "We grappled with real-world issues in both a philosophical and concrete way. It really encouraged me to think about practical ways to solve a lot of the world's most pressing human rights issues. This class is very relaxed and not intimidating, but at the same time, I emerged so much the better for it.",
    "Take it. Good class, not too much work for a seminar, and interesting discussions. Professor Sanchez is very invested in the class and global human rights.",
    "I think you can learn the same lessons from this class in a much shorter span of time; much of the work and learning in this class is up to you and what you bring to the seminar. I think there are better Global Affairs seminars out there.",
    "This course has weekly readings, one 5-8 page response paper on one of the books we read, and one 10-15 page policy memo on a human rights issue of your choice. A draft of the final paper is due a month before the final is due, which really helps making your writing the best it can be. Also, there is one group presentation project, and each group is assigned to a major human rights issue, this year the topics were torture, genocide, civil and political rights, and women's rights. The presentation is not too time consuming. This is a relatively manageable writing credit if you need one, however, the class discussions are not always that engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was super interesting and I truly enjoyed going to class every Tuesday. It's a great introduction to human rights.",
    "Good writing credit that doesn't require a lot of work. Interesting material and good professor.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. Broadly, the course seeks to examine what human rights are, how the modern human rights project emerged, what human rights violations exist in the world (and why), and how can governments, NGOs, and international institutions go about addressing them. These issues are indispensable for anyone interested in world affairs, developing nations, human rights, or foreign policy, and the course is accessible both to students experienced in these fields and students studying them for the first time. Professor Sanchez is a terrific teacher. She is bright, energetic, and exceptionally familiar with ongoing debates in human rights law and politics. She was excellent at conveying important insights beyond the readings, and encouraging us to critically (and sometimes cynically) examine the issues we discussed. Professor Sanchez provided detailed feedback on all of our written assignments, and she clearly put a tremendous amount of thought into designing the course. She was also an excellent seminar leader, who kept discussion interesting and engaging throughout the semester. In sum, if you are interested in developing nations, international institutions, non-profit organizations, international law, or human rights specifically, take this class. I highly recommend it."
