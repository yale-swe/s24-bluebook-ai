   "comments": [
    "Enables you write and speak in an interesting and articulate way. I honestly have no clue how people starting out with literature classes even write well.",
    "Take it to fulfill your language requirement or if you'd like to learn advanced grammar in a pretty friendly, approachable setting. Don't take it if you hate fill-in-the-blank exercises or in-class work with partners, of which there is a lot.",
    "SPAN 243 is the course to take if you want better command over your speaking and writing skills. It gives you the foundations you need to be successful with the language. I would recommend the class to all students who wish to improve their grammatical skill before proceeding to courses that already use the advanced grammar structures.",
    "I would recommend this class if you enjoy the Spanish language, in particular its grammar, considering that is all that you will discuss. If you are just taking the class for the language requirement and don't really enjoy speaking Spanish or spending a significant amount of time doing (sometimes tedious) work, then I would recommend taking one of the topic-based classes instead. This is a very good class for those who simply want to maintain their Spanish skills for a semester. Your writing will significantly improve, particularly with the trickier topics like preterite vs. imperfect and the subjunctive, although if you're already used to speaking Spanish regularly, it may not be as useful speaking it. I found that heritage speakers benefitted from formally learning grammar that they had never learned before, while second-language learners became more comfortable with speaking, and reviewed most of the grammar topics. The coursework is a time commitment for anyone, but depending on your background in Spanish, it may be quite easy. In my experience, I found this course to be very similar to the AP Spanish experience I had in high school, except with a focus on grammar instead of communication about various topics. You will read stories and watch movies, which will be the focus of the exercises that you do in small groups and discuss as a class.",
    "For someone who has taken Spanish before but feels a bit rusty on specific Spanish grammatical concepts and wants to strengthen her\/his grasp on some basic concepts before taking a Spanish literature class at Yale, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "It's a great class. If you're wondering what L5 class to take first, take this one. Professor Seymour teaches well, and the daily homework takes 30 minutes -- 1 hour most days and is always relevant to learning the material. The skills you take from this class will actually help you in real-life Spanish, and overall it's an enjoyable experience.",
    "A good, but albeit boring, way to improve your grammar.",
    "SPAN 243 teaches students advanced cases and uses of Spanish grammar, often focusing on exceptions to the rules. I would only suggest the course if the student is genuinely interesting in learning advanced grammar and advancing their academic knowledge of Spanish - if the student is simply interested in maintaining fluency or learning how to write more effectively, other courses, which are easier and have a lighter workload, would be more appropriate.",
    "Spanish 243 is a good course if you've taken spanish throughout high school but don't feel quite ready to tackle literature or something of that nature. However, it is very detail oriented so be wary of that.",
    "I would recommend it if they want to understand grammar.",
    "Good class if you're looking to fill a foreign language class and have AP Spanish or an equivalent as background. Not too difficult, definitely builds grammar skills. Not a lot of practice with speaking, unfortunately, and a lot of busy work. Professor Seymour is great and clearly wants everyone to succeed.",
    "A great course if what he\/she is looking for is improvement of Spanish grammar. The textbook is just about the greatest thing in explaining grammar rules."
