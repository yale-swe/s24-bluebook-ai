    "Do it if you have research to do or are a mech E major",
    "Yes, do it with Joe Zinter. Multiple times, if possible. He cares about his students unlike any other ME professor.",
    "what is this evaluation even for? you better do this or you won't graduate. just pick your advisor wisely, PLEASE.",
    "Required as a senior project! Also can be taken as research for credit. All you have to do is write a short midterm report, final 10 page paper, and there is a 10 min presentation.",
    "If you are reading these evaluations, you probably have to take this class. But if that's the case, why are you even bothering reading evaluations? Hurry along and sign up before the mechanical engineering department runs out of advisors! (Kidding!! This won't happen for, like, another two years assuming the current STEM admissions growth rate.) The only other possibility is that you don't have to take this class. But then surely you're only thinking about taking this class because you've heard from your friends how wonderful it is to pursue independent MechE research in a very low-stress, high-flexibility environment. But if that's thecase, you must really distrust your friends that you have to come and read MY evaluation just to convince yourself that doing research for credit is an awesome gig. If this is indeed your case, I advise that you forego research and spend the next semester focusing on developing better ties with your friends - your enhanced interpersonal skills will serve you well during your future research experiences too! Finally, I admit that there is also the possibility - vanishingly small in the MechE major limit - that you don't have MechE major friends, and that you have stumbled across this course in the depths of social despair. If this is your case, despair no further. Professor O'Hern will be your friend. And he will guide you with excellent advice as well as feedback for your report and presentation. He may even post a Yale Compliment about you to boost your spirits, but these rumors are unconfirmed and dubious at the present moment. In short, you should take this course under any circumstances UNLESS you specifically have friends but don't trust them, in which case you should still take the course merely at a later time. And that, my friends, is what we call a proof by casework.",
    "This 'class' is definitely whatever you make of it. If you come into the semester with a plan of action then you can usually accomplish a lot and be really proud of your project. However, if you waste a lot of the semester trying to decide what you want to do, you will find yourself struggling in the last month of classes to get everything together. Planning ahead is key!"
