    "The class has a heavy focus on Caribbean British fiction and immigrant\/colonial narratives-- students should definitely take a look at the syllabus before taking the course to make sure they are interested in the books. I would recommend the class to students who are interested in the topics covered.",
    "Every student gave a presentation on the author and historical context behind each work, which helped ground each work we studied in how it reflected a certain culture or historical time. I believe he isn't teaching this course any more, but I would highly recommend any course taught by Professor Phillips because he is a fount of wisdom.",
    "Yes, particularly if you're interested in the subject.",
    "It's a pity that this is the last semester for Contemporary British Fiction Professor Phillips and the reading list were absolutely fantastic, and our discussion topics on the \"outsider,\" migration, race, and identity were interesting and very relevant to contemporary issues. The workload was just right. A great senior seminar."
