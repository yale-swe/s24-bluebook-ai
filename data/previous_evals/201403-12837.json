   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to really commit to learning French. It is very intensive, and you absolutely cannot fall behind in the work. I think its a great way to start off learning a language, even if you don't intend to continue on an intensive track, as it really submerses you in it and doesn't allow you to let things slip through the cracks. I would also recommend only taking 2 courses on top of this. The work is most definitely manageable, but you don't want to be rushed doing it. You will only get out of this course what you put in, and if you really want to learn French, then you need to put in a lot of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It has a very heavy workload, but you learn french better and faster than you would in any other class.",
    "FREN 125 is great course for any student willing to put the time and effort into learning the language. The course load can be a little overwhelming at times, so it is best to take this course with at most two other courses to get the most out of it. FREN 125 is one of those courses, where by the end you will have felt that you really learned something.",
    "I recommend this course to people who 1) are very good at languages, 2) are able to work hard over long stretches of time, and 3) can manage their time wisely. The last point is probably the most important one. You'll be in class 2 hours every day, and you'll be doing homework 1.5-2 hours every day. If you're willing to put that in, you will get one of the most rewarding, fun, and useful learning experiences you'll ever have. The course description is not a false promise: you'll be able to speak, understand, read, and write French after just one semester. The Capretz method works, it rewards dedicated work with both fast results and profound command of the language. French is a language that's very difficult to pronounce and aurally understand, and the method really takes care that this is not an issue. The videos were funny, instructive, interesting, and well thought-out, and all the materials work together very nicely. As for the Professor, hands down, Prof. Sherak was the best language instructor I've ever had, and I had many. She led the class with method, deliberation, attention to detail, care for everyone, and an incredible enthusiasm for the French language. Also, I've never seen a teacher take so much heartfelt delight in our learning progress. Prof. Sherak was extremely diligent as well: our tests would end at 7pm on Tuesdays, and she would grade and return all of them (written and oral parts) to us by the next morning - every single week. Every composition was corrected and returned the next day as well. If anyone needed to review with her, she would make the time (she basically didn't do office hours but just met with anyone whenever was good for them). All around, Prof. Sherak was immensely dedicated, super friendly and funny, and pedagogically at the highest level.",
    "The course is an extraordinarily huge time commitment. I would absolutely recommend this course if you have a compelling reason to spend ~200 hours learning a new language. This is not an exaggeration. I am thinking: imminent francophone job prospect, Ph.D. language requirement, a French girlfriend, etc."
