    "Definitely. Especially if this is the first Latin class you take at Yale -- Martial's epigrams are a nice way to ease into college-level Latin (how much better can you get than short, witty poems?). The pacing and amount of work for the class isn't overwhelming for the most part, and who doesn't enjoy reading sexually explicit invective (if you've stuck with Latin this far, you have to appreciate it at some level)."
