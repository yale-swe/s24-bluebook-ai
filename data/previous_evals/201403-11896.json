    "A decent class. Probably better than 440, which I hear is terrible. Had an oral final, which was cool. That said, I'm pissed at professor Schoelkopf. For the first 8 weeks of the course, all of our problems sets came directly from the textbook (Griffith). It turns out that the solutions manual for this book is available online. Unsurprisingly, as happens in EVERY OTHER SCIENCE CLASS, people search for the solutions to problems online. Most people got close to 100% on the first 6 problem sets, because they checked their psets with the solutions manual. No one ever said this was something we should not be doing. 8 weeks into the course, Schoelkopf accused literally the entire class of academic dishonesty because he noticed that some people were using the solutions manual. He then refused to hand back any of our problem sets (he had to keep them as \"evidence\"), and didn't assign any more problem sets for a couple of weeks. Once he did start assigning problem sets again, he just took problems from another book (Sakurai), which of course also has a solutions manual. Schoelkopf handling of the entire situation was petty and unprofessional. If he's too lazy to write his own problems (like really, it isn't hard), he shouldn't be surprised if they try to use the internet to help with their problem sets.",
    "Yes, its hard, like youve probably heard. Less so if youre solid on linear algebra, integral calculus, and differential equations. At least we were allowed to use Wolfram Alpha on problem sets. As the holy grail, or capstone class for the non-intensive major that relied on the knowledge of all previous classes in the major, I found it a bit of a letdown, considering it required so much work to be able to understand the material. When I took it, there were about 2-3 grad students and post docs taking it as well. Im not sure whats applied about it, other than its taught by applied physics faculty (Prof. Schoelkopf did give two lectures at the end about quantum information). I thought Prof. Schoelkopf was a dynamic lecturer who encouraged questions, but was not effective at explaining the often difficult or esoteric concepts of the class. He runs a big-time lab, which may be cutting into his teaching time.",
    "Quantum is an amazing subject and I would certainly recommend anyone learn about it. If they wanted to learn it at Yale, I would recommend this class with this professor. Rob is an expert and excited about the material (a lot of the time) which really makes the class better.",
    "A good intro to Quantum and its fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone deciding between the two quantum courses. I learned a lot and enjoyed it as well.",
    "I really loved this class. Quantum is awesome. Take it before your senior year, don't be like me!! Rob's lectures are good, and the Griffith's book is really excellent.",
    "You are taking this class either because A.) Physics major B.) Deciding between this and 440 and C.) You are interested in the subject. A.) This class will provide with you all the fundamental to understand QM including harmonic oscillators, Schrodinger Equation, pertubation theory, two-particle interactions etc. If you keep up with the material it really becomes beautiful. In our our year, the final exam became an \"oral final\", which tests a very different kind of understanding from standard exams. It was difficult in another way, but Prof. Schoelkopf guides you through the questions. I think oral exams are actually better than final exams (you get a printout of the possible questions to study for) 2.) From what I've heard, APHY 439 is better than PHYS 440. I really enjoyed APHYS 439 and Prof. Schoelkopf is a very engaging professor + he's one of the pioneering researchers of quantum computing. 3.) Yes, this class will teach you all you need to know in a nutshell about QM. Don't bother with the other QM classes, take APHY 439.",
    "interesting class, but it is easy to fall behind. Do the homework thoroughly to understand the material and don't be afraid to go to office hours or ask for help. The book asks unique questions that really test your understanding."
