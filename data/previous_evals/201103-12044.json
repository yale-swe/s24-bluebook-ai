    "Take this class. If you can, take it credit d so you dont stress about papers etc. But either way it is not difficult and incredibly fun.",
    "Yes, this was a fantastic course. If you are eager to learn, the class is enjoyable and fascinating.",
    "This class is really interesting. It presents material about moral psychology that you might not get elsewhere. At the same time it gets repetitive which makes you lose interest. There are a lot of readings which are also slightly repetitive and some are just extremely technical without adding much to your knowledge. I personally would not recommend this class.",
    "If you're looking for answers, then don't take this class. That said, though, it is a great class! I'm not one for philosophy, but I decided to take this in to get out of my comfort zone and explore a topic I don't pay much attention to (morality) and I think it was worth it. Prof. Bloom is a great lecturer so even if you don't take the class, just audit the lectures (as I know many of my friends did). He uses tv& movie clips and experiments to explain the material and also allows for audience participation and encourages questions, all of which made lecture very enjoyable.That said, the second half of the semester was much more time-consuming than the first. And I mean much more! Whereas the readings before could get done in a couple of hours, all of a sudden I was spending 10-12 hours doing the reading and another I don't know how many hours taking notes. Although he said that the exams would be concept-based, they were actually very detail-oriented so that meant extensive note-taking was crucial which made the articles even more daunting and time-consuming. They were interesting to read, though, so that's a plus! Also the reading responses are pass\/fail and a great way to argue a point you might not otherwise believe in just as a thought experiment.I'd recommend it if you're interested in learning more about everything we do and don't know about morality and if you don't mind walking out with more questions than you came in with. Don't expect this class to give you a clear-cut answer of what is morally right and wrong. It's more about what we do know about morality, whether it's innate, universal, composed of reason or emotions, etc. If that sounds interesting, take this class :) It was a lot of work toward the end and the exams weren't a fair reflection of whether you had done the reading and understood the concepts, but the material itself was interesting. So audit it at least! Or take it credit\/d.",
    "The content of this class is interesting and gives you an insight in the moral decisions you make every day. The lectures and reading are interesting and thought-provoking. That said, the sections were a chance to waste 50 minutes of your week talking in circles and getting nowhere. Additionally, the 3000-word essay assignment was long and unpleasant. (All of it had to be about one specific event.)",
    "It covers all sorts of aspects of morality, but mainly leans more heavily towards philosophical understanding of morality. I went in expecting more of a hard science\/cognitive focus of morality, but it was still enjoyable.",
    "A great introduction by a fantastic lecturer to topics in the psychology of morality. Highly recommended.",
    "A great combination of psychology and philosophy for beginners. I always wished intro psych and intro cog sci would talk more about this kind of material, so this class was fulfilling in that respect. Still, it's a lot of material to cover so we didn't go all that in depth about anything.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. The conclusion of the course might not be that extra ordinary, because it is something we all can come up with common sense, but the knowledge that you gain while getting to that conclusion is amazing.",
    "This class is a huge lecture. There are weekly reading responses, 2 tests, and 1 essay. In section, we had weekly debates. If you have already taken intro psych, I would not recommend this course because there is a lot of overlap.",
    "Awesome class. Great for future dinner-table conversations. Covers a wide-range of topics in a a lot of interesting themes. Good class to Credit\/D (the tests are kind of tricky)",
    "Amazing course--my favorite of the semester, and one of the best of my Yale career. Since it's a DeVane lecture, I don't think it's going to be offered again, unfortunately. Paul Bloom is really great!! I would take another class with him if possible.",
    "This was a wonderful class!!! I wish this was offered in a seminar format!",
    "yes",
    "this is NOT an easily graded class. if you want an easy-A lecture, there are much better ones out there. although everybody liked the topics (it's fun to read about religion and whatever), you have to do a reading response every ******* week, write a paper, and do two tests. the tests are not graded nicely either, no curve.read about this stuff on your own and get a better grade taking something else. if you want to take tests where you're responsible forlike 30 readings, take this class, you'll have a ******* blast.",
    "Absolutely! Def a great class to take and the workload isn't bad.",
    "This was a great course with some really interesting information. Although I really enjoyed lecture and the readings, it was a little more work than I expected for an intro\/lecture class. Definitely something to credit\/d especially if it is a fifth class.",
    "I absolutely would! It provides an interesting way to look at questions everyone contemplates. However, you should know that you must take meticulous notes on the readings because Professor Bloom's tests are unusually specific and if you missed a particularly important line in a sixty page reading, you could get that question wrong on an exam.",
    "Interesting,fun class with Paul Bloom! What could be better? A great fifth class.",
    "Not a great class. Lots of detailed reading that you are tested on while lecture is shallow in its content. Overall, I don't feel like I learned a lot. Bloom is a great lecturer, but the class kinks have not been worked out.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The issues we discussed were very interesting and very pertinent.",
    "YES, AMAZING CLASS!! beware, the reading is TWICE as much after midterm!!!",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life- that sums it up.. something everyone is\/should be interested in.. you could read tons of articles on moral psychology but it is a great course to take because the lectures are fun, only once a week (I actually wish it were twice a week), readings are not too heavy, extremely interesting and you talk about them in section.",
    "A course that looks at some of the morality-related issues from Intro Psych in more detail. Be prepared to work hard if you take the course - you need to really invest yourself in the readings and the term paper.",
    "This course was an interesting survey of descriptive moral psychology. The lectures mostly rehashed the readings, which could be 80-100 pages or so some weeks. This amount of work was a bit more than I expected from this course, but overall the course was still relatively light. The readings were also mostly interesting, though they tended not to go into the issues very much. The course is good because Paul Bloom is a fantastic lecturer, so how much you like him will translate to how much you like the course. The final paper assignment was pretty vague and not much guidance is given, but the exams are pretty straightforward if you do the reading and take notes.",
    "Definitely take this course! The class can be challenging at time but it's rewarding and fun!",
    "Moralities was pretty interesting. The lectures only meet once a week so that was a plus. The reading material for the class was very interesting in the beginning but then it got boring for me. It became too philosophy-like; it was too much about specific people and specific arguments about morals. The lectures were also very interesting and well done but they also overlapped heavily with Intro Psych.",
    "Nope. Easy A, but big waste of time. I'd rather get a B in a class that actually teaches me something.",
    "Very interesting. A ton of reading that you have to do in order to do well, and the \"short\" paper was not short. But a very interesting and worthwhile course.",
    "take it",
    "This class was interesting. Not too hard, although the tests were a little nitpicky at times. Overall an excellent Credit\/D\/F",
    "This was a DeVane lecture on the \"Moralities of Everyday Life\", so it will probably never be taught again.Professor Bloom is a good lecturer, but let's all agree that the screaming-girls fanclubs of Professor Bloom are over the top and not remotely warranted. Also, I mean, although cross-listed under the Philosophy Department (PHIL 116), this was primarily a PSYCHOLOGY course, which means that the intellectual rigor of the material was frequently almost-laughable (if they hadn't all been speaking with such serious faces and weren't the sort of people running the modern world).Lecture was once a week for an hour-fifteen, and discussion section (obligatory) was a standard 50 minutes. Each lecture presented a different topic: Empathy, Moral Universals, The Problem of Strangers, the Moral Lives of Primates (guest lecture: Laurie Santos), the Situational-dependency of Moral response, the Psychology of Republicans (\"politics\"), Racism, the Role of Religion, and Determinism.Professor Bloom does research on babies and so this is a central theme of the course. Of course, the \"moral life of babies\" is an oxymoron, and it never is quite explained why we should look to a creature who has virtually no faculties of reason and severely-diminished emotional capacity to explain what a fully-developed human would typically do in situations fraught with moral complexity.The \"politics\" lecture was incredibly offensive to anyone from outside the U.S.-liberal beltways (New England and the West Coast); the starting assumption was that Republicans (and I myself am definitely leftist) are somehow cognitively different from Democrats. Haidt has a fairly good explanation (different emphases on different aspects of morality), but I think in general too much emphasis was made in what makes Republicans different from Democrats (it was never framed \"What makes Democrats different from Republicans?\"), and not enough emphasis on the real challenges of unity and political action in this country. The issue is NOT Republican versus Democrat; the issue is \"stupid and corrupt\" versus \"also stupid and corrupt\". Also, there was this bizarre argument made in class that belief in religion implies support for the death penalty. It seems to me the Christian New Testament (and I'm not religious) and large swathes of the Midwest (where you find lots of religion + NO death penalty) were never consulted. The whole exercise seemed to be a point at how arrogant and na\u00efve New England liberals can act rather than a genuine academic discussion, except that I sincerely doubt the professor or any of my fellow students were joking..The issue of determinism was also strangely used to argue that people don't actually have responsibility for their actions AND HENCE justice should be rehabilitative instead of punitive. Okay..? (What a logical leap!) But does any non-individualistic, non-vendetta culture actually SUPPORT punitive justice in the first place? What does punitive justice even mean? Perhaps because my State has one of the lowest incarceration rates anywhere in the world, and because there is still some aspect of \"honor culture\" remnant (i.e., shaming the offender into repentance, tears, and theatrical public apology can sometimes be enough \"punishment\"), I do not even understand what would motivate California-style \"punitive justice\" (e.g. 3-strikes policy, throw everyone and their mother in prison) in the first place. I also think there was too much emphasis on future reliance on fMRI technology and not enough on fostering good, holistic community-relations that can prevent crimes much more cheaply and non-invasively than any sort of brain scan can.Overall probably not the worst socialscience credit, though..",
    "If you're interested in it take the course, but I learned the most from the readings which you can do on your own time.",
    "This was a great course. There was a lot of overlap with Professor Bloom's intro psych class but I learned a lot of new stuff nonetheless. I doubt it will be offered again, but you never know.There was only 1 lecture per week, which was both good and bad, as the lectures were really interesting. That being said, the course load was heavier than anticipated. Sometimes there could be as much as 150 pages per week to read, which is a lot for a 5th class. The readings were usually very interesting though and quite readable. And it was always nice watching the occasional TED talk for homework.",
    "It's a huge lecture but Professor Bloom was engaging none the less. The work load starts out small but does grow and readings are absolutely mandatory if you are planning on taking the tests.",
    "Yes - would recommend, but the syllabus does not truly tell you the workload for the class - a lot of reading and writing involved",
    "the best class i've taken at yale. obviously paul bloom is the man. the material is fascinating and applies to every aspect of my life. could not recommend this more. a fair amount of work (a lot of reading), but usually very interesting.",
    "Good intro to philosophy, but make sure you study A LOT for the midterm and finals.",
    "Fantastic class. A little reading-heavy but definitely worth taking.",
    "Moralities was an amazing experience. I doubt it'll be taught again, certainly not in exactly this form. But Paul Bloom's once-a-week lectures on morality were absolutely fascinating. He combined research from so many different parts of psychology, teaching us about babies, non-human primates, psychopaths, emotions, etc.It was a fascinating look at a still-developing branch of psychology.You'll read a lot of Bloom's own literature. But the articles and book chapters he assigns are great, if a bit long. There is a substantial amount of reading, but it's all great and worth the read. It's also not essential for lecture, but it is important for the exams.",
    "Yes, it had a very manageable amount of reading each week and the readings were very interesting. Lectures and topics were awesome as well. Would recommend.",
    "Amazing course. Take it if it's ever taught again.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is enjoyable and applicable to real life.",
    "It was like a series of Ted talk. I enjoyed readings a lot, but because of the class size, I don't think I learned as much as I would have learned in smaller lectures.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot about something that's important to all humans in a really worthwhile way.",
    "Moralities with Paul Bloom is an easy class work-wise, but is not an easy A because Professor Bloom's tests are nit-picky and difficult to successfully prepare for. However, the material we learned in lecture and in the readings covers a broad range of interesting subjects--from how to tell if someone is a psychopath to whether or not babies have moral standards. I loved being in this class and always found it interesting and exciting, but feel as though I would have learned more in Intro to Psych. Take it as a fun fourth class!",
    "really good. definitely recommend to anybody",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. i found ti frustrating. Take a different intro course, don't be blinded by Bloom's celebrity status.",
    "Lectures are about random things and the answers to those things are never answered. Huge lecture with a lot of people. Tests focused on small details that were found in one of the 50 articles we were supposed to read. Paul Bloom is very arrogant. The class didn't really teach you anything you didn't already know. There are no answers about morality, so it was more of a class to just get you thinking. Lectures were pretty much a waste of time.",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life was unlike any class I've taken at Yale because of its size and style, and I really enjoyed it. The lectures and readings were always interesting, and I always had great stories about psych studies to tell my friends over dinner!",
    "Just don't take it. Read a book or something.",
    "Moralities was really interesting and forced me to consider certain topics and realities of life that I had not focused on before. The lectures were engaging and the readings diverse yet cohesive. I appreciated the relevance of the topic and its applications in my current life, although I found it frustrating that I left with possibly fewer answers than I started with. Professor Bloom was a great lecturer, and if anything you should take it just to hear him speak, but if you've already taken a lot of other psych classes this might not be for you. The topics can get slightly repetitive and obvious if you are already familiar with the material.",
    "Ifit is ever offered again this course is clearly a must take!! It is the best class I have taken at Yale - you will learn so much and look forward to every single class and even section!",
    "It was cool. You should take it.",
    "Is this even being offered in the future? If it is, TAKE IT! It's wonderful. The perfect mix of an amazing professor, interesting material, and a fairly light workload. Meets only once a week (plus section), with a midterm, a final, a 10-12 page paper, and weekly pass\/fail 500 word reading responses. And you get to discuss fun stuff like religion, racism, politics, and sex.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it if it was offered again. It's also a great class to audit, since the lectures only happen once a week and the material is so interesting.",
    "Summary- cool stuff. DEF recommend it.",
    "A very interesting course, and of course Bloom is a phenomenal lecturer. Consists of a bunch of reading (though it's very interesting it can just be too much time-wise), lecture once a week, and section. Midterm and final plus what Bloom consistently called a \"short\" final paper which turned out to be 15 pages. Overall I'd recommend the class though. The lectures and readings are so interesting it isn't hard to make yourself attend class even though it's during prime nap time, and you bother doing the readings because some of them are legitimately fantastic. Section, as usual, is useless but what can you do",
    "A very interesting class which analyses daily moral conundrums. Definitely recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. It is very interesting material and the course load is manageable. Bloom is a renowned professor for a reason.",
    "Yes. It gave us a good broad outlook on where morality comes from. The course was interesting.",
    "Moralities was an interesting class, and overall not that much work. I would suggest it if you want to hear interesting lectures and put in a minimal amount of work.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student only if they wanted to truly look at the world through a different moral lens. I came into this class thinking that I would pretty much leave with the same ideas and thoughts. But I haven't. I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'm a completely changed person, but I definitely think about things much different. This class is also great because it applies concrete terms to human notions that an everyday person might vaguely be aware of. It's a great class, with a fair bit of reading.",
    "Interesting material, but a lot more work than expected.",
    "Huge class, but the sections were lively. If you are down to do a lot of reading, with a reading response due once\/week, this class is for you. One midterm, one final, a bunch of reading responses, and a final paper. Be prepared to put in a good amount of work. It definitely may be worth your while though.",
    "This class was pretty good. Lectures were usually entertaining and informative, workload was light, but because we covered so much material, we really didn't go into depth with any of it, so it ended up being a very shallow survey of the subject.If you've taken many related classes (e.g., philosophy and sci of human nature, thinking, etc.), you may not get much out of this course.",
    "Take this class! Paul Bloom = Gilderoy Lockhart!",
    "Take this course no matter your major or interests, as long as Paul Bloom teaches it. You will not regret it. If you do regret it, find me and I will pay you for the inconvenience.",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life was a great introduction to the concept of Morality--but nothing more. With only one lecture per week, there simply was not enough class time during which to explore the complex nature of morality.",
    "Yes, it is highly applicable to everything.",
    "HUGE GUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO CLASS!!!!!!!!!!There is only ONE lecture a week even though it says two. Beware though, the sections are extremely dumb. You won't learn anything more than what you already know.",
    "I would recommend it, but you might get frustrated about how repetitive it gets.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if it is ever taught again. It wasn't a whole lot of work, and it was extremely interesting. I am very glad I took this class.",
    "Take it if you want a light introduction to moral psychology, and go in knowing that some of the material repeats.",
    "Yes, it was a really great class that forced me to think very scientifically about ethical issues.",
    "CogSci 152 is an interesting class to take and definitely worth it if you\u0092re looking for a fun class to take that does not have too much work. The lectures were really enjoyable but the class would have been a lot more interesting if the class met twice a week instead of once.",
    "A fun, very basic introduction to how our psychology influences our moral perceptions and decision-making. I would recommend it to someone interested in but completely uninformed about the subject. If you aren't interested, you won't get anything out of it; the readings can be long and they aren't worth doing if you aren't willing to think about them. If you aren't uninformed, take something more in-depth.",
    "fun and interesting lectures. entertaining2 problems1. no reason for a section2. the tests don't do what tests are meant to do. They're full of ambiguity (epic debates ensued over right answers) and 'bet you missed that' questions. They fail to distinguish those who understand the material from those who don't.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It taught me a lot of stuff about morality and human nature that i didn't know and I think it would interest people in a variety of fields because it's about human nature. The readings are understandable and really interesting, no textbook just interesting opinions from books. Paul Bloom is really chill. Just get ready for the final and the 12 page paper (which is not short despite what he says) on the same day, or that's what I had.",
    "If you're looking for an introduction to moral psychology and philosophy, then this course suffices. Bloom is a stellar lecturer and a luminary in this field (he frequently appears on the syllabus). 3,000-word paper came out of nowhere and section didn't really add much to the coursel",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life was an absolutely fantastic course, and I undoubtedly feel like a better thinker for having taken it. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would warn, however, that there is a lot of reading (albeit all incredibly interesting), so only take it if you are truly interested in the subject matter.",
    "Yes! Take it! It only meets once a week and is such a different type of course than anything I have ever taken.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to each and every Yale student. Moralities of Everyday Life takes the question of what is right and wrong outside of the cerebral world of philosophy and constructs a concrete foundation in modern behavioral psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. This class is perfect for anyone interested in the rationality and emotionality that interact to produce everyday moral intuitions and the codes by which we humans live our lives.",
    "Main topics: Strangers, Good and Evil, Religion, Differences, Racism, Foundations, Empathy, Universals, etc. Each lecture covers a different topic. I'd recommend it if you're interested in the evolution of morality, where it comes from, why we make the decisions we do, and free will. At times it's a bit intuitive (psychopaths lack empathy...duh) but once in a while you learn to think of something in a new way. A lot of reading (3-4 long articles a week), and you have to do a reading response every week, so be prepared to do a little work.",
    "Moralities was an awesome though flawed class. It's unlikely that it will ever be offered again since it was a DeVane lecture, but I really think it should either replace or complement one semester of Intro Psych. It's a fascinating look at why people think and act the way they do, based on some of the most innovative and interesting research available. While some of it seems like common sense, a lot of the material we covered was pretty revelatory. Professor Bloom's lectures were fascinating and definitely the best aspect of the course. The readings were also almost always excellent, though occasionally they felt a bit repetitive or there were simply too many of them. Overall, however, I'm one of 500 people who now see the world in a different light thanks to this class.",
    "Interesting topics; very general, but great for dinner topics.",
    "If you are into philosophy, then take this course. I thought it would lean more towards the cognitive science side of the spectrum, however a lot of readings and discussions are about contrived notions. Personally, I wasn't a fan of this, but if you are into speculation and that sort of thing, you may find this interesting.",
    "I really liked the material. Most of the readings (with the strong exception of the Arkes-Tetlock and Banaji et al. series) got me to think about morality in new ways, which is exactly what I wanted from this course. The major weakness of this course was that it gave a very simplistic presentation of the material--very much a \"gut\" class. It would have been nice if we could have gone a little more in-depth, or farther beyond a layman's understanding of the issues. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this course to someone who wants to think about their own morality in new ways. I found this course very valuable to my personal development.",
    "This class was good, but as a Psychology major I was slightly disappointed. The topics in lecture were mostly redundant, and the reading material was very one-sided, and very 'popular psychology.'Sections worked like a freshman philosophy seminar: people who have no fairly little understanding of the material act like they're experts. Especially frustrating when you recognize the shallowness of some of the readings they are basing their claims off of (not all readings were bad, but some were just rambling on about nothing very scientific).The class was too broad of topic and had too many students to really be a favorite class, but good if you want a broad exposure to the course or want to see what taking a class with Paul Bloom is like.",
    "In general, this was an interesting class in which I learned some important things about how to think about morality. I really enjoyed the readings, which were fun\/cool things I would have enjoyed reading anyway, but I got to read them for class. They got really excessive towards the end and I just didn't do half because I felt them to be unnecessary and was annoyed that so much would be assigned. It was hard to stay focused in lecture because there were so many people there. Overall, it was a solid class, but it wasn't the amazing course I was expecting.",
    "It was a really cool class, in terms of the material, the professor and the TAs. Nothing was really new (concepts weren't, but some authors were) if you'd taken Intro Psych and a couple of ethics classes, but absolutely worth considering exploring if you just want a decently easy class that really does a lot to make you understand and appreciate how morality interlinks into our own lives.",
    "A decent psych course, not the best. Lots of overlap with intro to psychology but still pretty interesting. Not terribly difficult although the paper was a pain to write.",
    "Psych 152 is an enjoyable devane lecture, which really gets to the core of the issue of morality, and the underlying psychology. As an introductory psych course, the concepts are very straight forward, and the course definitely provides a very important and interesting way of looking at the world, which is why I would recommend it. At times, however, the large lecture format and nature of the subject can make the material seem very disorganized, but on the whole, it is a fascinating class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. Not very much work and an interesting lecture.",
    "The DeVane Lecture was as interesting as it was striking. The material presented throughout this course provided nuanced perspectives on many issues of morality. I would highly recommend this course to a student wishing to explore the basis of morality and its role in our everyday lives.",
    "The topics were fascinating, and the introduction to some modern moral philosophers was great, as I continue to watch the TED talks and read works by the authors we read, for example Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker--just can't get into Kant for fun in quite the same way you can get into a TED talk or books for modern audiences... Overall, if you are decently into a psych major, I imagine some of the material might get redundant; additionally, if you are looking for a neurological explanation of morality, look for a more focused course. However, as a pure survey of cool experiments, hypothesis and continued work on pinpointing of fundamentally human experiences, etc., this course is wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who knows that they are interested in psychology. Although Moralities of Everyday Life is also listed as a philosophy class, it is very heavy on psychology. Professor Bloom is one of the most fantastic lecturers you could ever have at Yale -- he is interesting, brilliant, and very funny. He makes lectures enjoyable to sit through, you never really want to miss one. There is a very heavy workload each week (3-6 thirty-sixty page articles we have to read plus a weekly 800 word reading response). Take it if you like psychology.",
    "Bloom's Moralities of Everyday Life is a lecture course on moral psychology. The lectures are amazing: engaging and challenging, but the readings are long and redundant, the reading questions feel irrelevant, and the tests err on the side of minutia. I'm glad that I took it, but I'm also glad I took it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "It's a really interesting class. At times, the readings get to be a bit much (there's a lot of it), but it's usually pretty easy to read\/insightful\/applicable to what we're learning in class. If psychology is at all an interest, I highly recommend the class.",
    "The course straddles psychology, philosophy and neuroscience, but never actually delves deeply into any of these subjects. It was unsatisfying for that reason for me, but if you're looking for a class in which you can simply glance over some of the latest popular literature about morality, this is as good as it gets.",
    "Moralities was a fascinating class. Paul Bloom is a really great, really engaging lecturer, and the material itself is interesting from many perspectives - psychological, ethical, etc. I looked forward to going to lecture. One downside was that the readings were often longer and denser than I had expected at the beginning of the course, so the workload didn't turn out to be as light as I expected. Still, it was a great course overall, and I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Honestly, this course wasn't particularly insightful. If you've taken Intro Psych or similar, this will probably seem superfluous. Paul Bloom is an excellent professor, and one should certainly take a course with him before graduating; however, this particular one felt rushed and superficial. The workload is fair, although the end-of-term essay really sneaks up on you. I had a few friends that audited Bloom's lectures, and I feel that they gleaned as much from the course as I did. Overall: legendary professor, interesting material, yet still somehow the course fell short. I suspect most reviews will be extremely positive because (a) it's Paul Bloom (yeah, he has that sort of appeal) and (b) the course was easy, so many will be hesitant to review it poorly.",
    "This class is really interesting, but if you're an older psych major and have already taken a lot of psych classes, a lot of it will be old news to you (especially if you took Intro Psych with Paul Bloom). That being said, I highly recommend it - Paul Bloom is an extremely engaging lecturer and the material is SO interesting. It's deceptively more work than you think it will be - the readings are often way too long, but usually interesting and fun to read. It would have been a fun class to take Credit\/D, I think. If you're at all interested in human nature, then it's a must-take.",
    "Weigh the awesomeness of lectures with the long, but sometimes interesting readings, reading responses, and final paper. A great class to take Credit D.",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life was fascinating. I would recommend it simply because it is taught by Paul Bloom. Be ready for a hefty paper along with a tricky midterm and final, though.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to a friend. Although it was a huge lecture and if that's not your scene, you shouldn't take it.",
    "Recommend",
    "Don't take this class for an easy credit. Also, if you're a psych major you'll be both bored and unconvinced by many of Bloom's arguments. He presents interesting lectures, but the readings that accompany them are long and often one-sided.",
    "Take it! It's such a fun class. But, be aware, there is a wide range of abilities and experience with psychology among students taking this class, so you might work more or less depending on these factors.",
    "One of the best courses at Yale! Must take!! Paul Bloom is amazing and every lecture is incredible. The reading is a lot and the exams are tough, especially if you don't stay on top of the reading. It would be a great class to audit or take credit\/D.",
    "If you're looking for a fifth course in an otherwise busy semester, look no further. Bloom makes lecture (you only have 1 per week) entertaining, the readings are simple\/interesting (with a few notable exceptions), and overall the class is easy without being boring. It's not the sort of course that will challenge you, but it might make you think about a few things you haven't considered before. I'd say most of what you learn is pretty intuitive but it's sometimes funny\/interesting to see the studies behind the logic. The breakdown of grading makes it virtually impossible to stress about doing well (plus the class is easy). The one thing that is a definite drawback is the final essay; it's a BS assignment through and through. But if that doesn't bother you too much, then yes, definitely take this class.",
    "I'd recommend it if you don't mind a class where the primary learning tool is readings. You have to do the readings to do well in this class, and you have to understand them. If I did this course over again, I'd get a reading group set up the first day of class and discuss the readings over a meal each week. I'd also have each person be responsible for outlining a reading each week to make sure I had an outline handy before the midterm and final. Paul Bloom is reason enough to take this course if you don't mind readings.",
    "Good lecture but completely unreasonable workload. Readings for the first week were 2 articles and a TED talk, but after drop deadline the readings were increased at least 4 fold and nobody was able to get all the reading done, it was just far too many pages. The syllabus read a \"short essay,\" but details were never discussed until after the drop deadline when it was revealed it was a 10-12 page essay. An \"essay,\" is 4-6 pages. A 10-12 page paper is by no means what anyone was expecting. Everyone felt cheated. The course could've been great, but we were incredibly frustrated by the heavily increased reading after drop deadline and the completely unreasonable essay assignment. The exams were also designed to get to you to lose points. All around fun material but the reading, the exams, and the huge deception with the essay (I mean really how cruel can you be to say \"short essay, details will be discussed later,\" and then require 10-12 pages on 1 article, something that should take about 2-4 pages), made the students frustrated beyond belief and made us strongly regret taking the course and just confused as to why the Professor would lure us into it with an enticing \"tentative syllabus,\" and then once drop deadline passed, jack up the workload to unreasonable levels. I don't want to think he is malicious but that's exactly what it appears to be. Because the course most likely won't be taught again, these reviews don't even mean anything, adding to the feeling of helplessness.",
    "Ehh take it or leave it. Pretty good but Boom's intro psych was WAYYYY better. Worth the extra work.",
    "Amazing class.amazing professor. Amazing material.",
    "I would definitely recommend Moralities of Everyday Life. The lecture is only once a week, Paul Bloom is really funny and engaging, but also extremely intelligent and was able to answer any students' questions at the end of lecture. Doing the reading is more important than attending the lectures (which are posted online), although it's worth it to go to the lectures simply to listen to Paul Bloom.",
    "YES. This course is fascinating, and it is very relevant to all of our lives. The readings are interesting and engaging, and Professor Bloom is superb.",
    "Fun course. Reading towards the end got absolutely unbearable,(250 per week), but considering it only met once a week, not that bad. Probably would have been more manageable if it wasn't once a week and I was taking it for a grade.Bloom was fun to listen to, first exam harder than promised, but glad I didn't have to care since it was credit\/d",
    "Great class, take it!The tests do require that you know homework readings well (and there are quite a few of them, 60-80 pages a week), so you either have to actually read them or get notes somehow. This year one of the sections compiled notes for all the readings, which made it really easy to study for (ca. 4 hours for each test)",
    "I took this class because Bloom is awesome and I was looking for something in the Psyc department. I wasn't as interested in the subject as I thought I would be, but I generally enjoyed the lectures. During the first half of the course the reading was doable, but after the first exam they became way too long. I ended up splitting it up with a friend because it was just too much to read in a week. There were reading responses due each week, graded Pass\/Fail, but you couldn't entirely BS them. My TA Mark Sheskin was awesome and I really liked section.",
    "This is one of those classes at Yale you should take before you graduate. YES",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life covers lots of very interesting questions about the building blocks of our constructed morality. I would highly encourage this class - no doubt that you need to take the class. Tests are somewhat difficult and the \"short\" paper is 12 pages, but it's worth it.",
    "A wonderful survey course that balances broad scope with in-depth readings, and applies them to everyday life.Would definitely recommend; it provides a lot of basic psychological and cognitive-science knowledge that can be applied in further studies and even in many other fields.",
    "If you're interested in the topic of morality then absolutely, but it is definitely not for everyone.",
    "Take it credit\/D",
    "Yes...although I don't know if it will be offered in the same form seeing as it was a Devane lecture.",
    "Great class. Fun lectures, really interesting material, and Paul Bloom is just great. Makes you look at yourself in a totally new light though.",
    "If you are looking for a broad overview into a few different types of psychology and maybe even philosophy, this is a great course that's very interesting and applicable to life. Never miss a lecture, they're so great!",
    "A great course! Wonderful lectures, interesting topic, and not a lot of class time (only 1 lecture per week), but there is way too much reading that will all show up on the midterm and final. I'd say over 200 pages a week.",
    "I thought it was an ok class even though the readings were WAY too much. What was said repeatedly in 3 DIFFERENT 30 page readings could very easily have been summed up in, oh say only one of the readings. The readings were oppressive and most definitely affected my enjoyment of the class. The description of the class was HORRIBLY misleading suggesting it would be more than simply a psych class. Section kinda sucked. We mostly sat and waited for it to end. I think part of the problem was that we didnt have enough lecture or common material that we had ALL ACTUALLY READ to be able to carry on a coherent conversation. Because of the insane amount of reading, most people just sort of gave up and read enough for a reading response. The one thing that salvaged this class was that Bloom is a very good lecturer. But seriously, if hes teaching intro psych, just take that.",
    "Fantastic lectures, though there is definitely overlap with Intro PsychTests aren't too bad, and are very detail-orientedReadings are a bit excessive...and repetitive...especially in the second half of the course",
    "Psych 152 is a terrific course. The subject matter is fascinating, and Professor Bloom is a really engaging lecturer. There\u0092s a significant amount of reading each week, but the readings are interesting, and discussions in our section were great. There are weekly reading responses, a midterm, a final paper and a final exam.",
    "Moralities was a great Credit\/D class, because the material was fascinating and the readings were good as a little brain-teaser\/amusement among all your other classes. Don't underestimate the writing aspect of this class; weekly reading responses, and a long final paper. Probably repetitive if you've already taken Intro Psych.",
    "It's a lot of fun and Paul Bloom is a great lecturer. There's not tooo much work, but there are weekly reading responses. The tests are tricky, so you really need to do the readings.",
    "A very enjoyable class, with a dynamic lecturer. Some of the lectures were wonderful (Primates, Situations, Differences). While it wasn't life-changing, it was definitely a light, fun class. Would recommendit!",
    "A great class that covers a number of topics regarding moral dilemmas we encounter everyday. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Very interesting course. Weakness is the lecture format (unavoidable) and that the majority of your grade is determined by multiple choice tests. The readings were very thought provoking and my TA was an excellent guide during section.",
    "If the course has its logistics worked out the second time around, I would recommend taking it -- but probably take it Credit\/D. The lectures are great, but the actual work is pretty dense for a non-major.",
    "Great! Very informative and also interesting.",
    "If this course is ever offered again I would definitely recommend it. Professor Bloom is very engaging and we discussed issues that are relevant to our daily lives.",
    "Interesting material, but you cover a lot of it in intro psych. Paul Bloom is really great.",
    "Awesome, if it\u0092s available, take it.",
    "I would recommend this. the reading responses were annoying, but the tests were not that bad. also interesting stuff.",
    "Yes, it was not too difficult, and it was a nice lecture to attend.",
    "Moralities was really interesting, I definitely recommend it -- Paul Bloom is an incredible lecturer and the workload was light\/reading was enjoyable, so it felt a lot like listening to an hour of NPR or RadioLab every Tuesday. Fun class.",
    "Psych 152 was great! I would definitely recommend it to another student who is interest in psychology but don't necessarily have any background in psych. Most of the material was very interesting and overall, I learned a lot from this course. I would take it again if given the chance.",
    "Great class. Recommend it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in some psycological inquiries into the field of morality. This class won't give any definite answers, but will shake most peoples commonly held views regarding moral convictions.",
    "This class was OK. The lectures started off very interesting, however, as lectures progressed, they seemed to get very repetitive. Same goes for the readings; initially, all the readings were very interesting. However, after the midterm, the number of readings doubled and some of them did not pertain to the topic of the lecture at all, and overall it was very frustrating to have so many readings that did not seem relevant. I was expecting this class to be utterly mind-blowing and life-changing; however, I would summarize this class as a reading course that presented interesting new perspectives on controversial topics. I felt like this class merely explained common sense situations with more technical terms. The sections I found not as helpful as I expected. Because most of the students in my section were taking the class CR\/D, the discussions were not very riveting and most people did not care. It would have been more helpful if we would have discussed specific passages from specific readings rather than just briefly summarize the readings and \"debate\" about the reading response from the previous week.",
    "I think there are better psychology courses out there. Yes, Paul Bloom is legendary and he gives very entertaining lectures, but I came away a bit disappointed with this class. There was WAY to much readings. You have to submit weekly reading responses, there is one midterm, and then a final and a 10-12page research paper that were due on the SAME DAY after thanksgiving break. So that was just ridiculous. The material covered is interesting but sometimes it got redundant, and I though Paul Bloom could have done a better job covering material inhis lectures that had not already been presented in our readings. And the midterm and final are not easy. Take this course if you think you have the time to do A LOT of readings. And if morality is something that interests you. Sometimes it was a bit too philosophical for me. Like, too many \"if\" hypothetical situations that are just not realistic.",
    "It was a pretty cool class - you learn about interesting ideas and new ways to think about morality, many of which you'll find yourself applying outside of class. However, it tends to get a bit repetitive, especially if you've taken other psych classes before, and the readings were ridiculously long\/numerous. Besides the crazy amount of reading (and you're expected to remember tiny details for the tests), it's not too much work - two exams, a paper, and easy weekly pass\/fail reading responses.",
    "Take it if you want an easy and straightforward introduction to ethics. Don't take it if you expect any depth.",
    "Great class to take; start on the readings before the night before.",
    "This class was more of a lecture series than a class - with each meeting touching on an individual aspect of morality. The lectures were wonderful, Paul Bloom is a performer. The readings were fascinating, but increased greatly in length as the semester progressed.I'd recommend this class to those interested in psychology in general, but do not expect to leave with any deep understanding of moral concepts.. just some interesting anecdotes and studies.",
    "This class was interesting, but definitely not as easy as it initially seemed. All the work seemed to come out of nowhere on the back end when the readings increased exponentially and a \"short\" 10-page paper was made to be due on the same day as the final (which happened before reading period!). The midterm and final were strange because the tests were mainly multiple choice--a necessity because of the size of the class, but a rather arbitrary way to measure a student's knowledge of the material on questions that really need greater explanation (you know, questions of morality).",
    "This was a fairly intellectual survey of topics in morality that may change the way you see moral\/cultural differences. Most of the reading is interesting and relevant, but some weeks have a lot more reading than others. The exams are fair enough but sometimes deal with minute details from lecture or the (many) readings.Although it's cross-listed as cognitive science, only a couple lectures deal with the brain directly, and you won't be required to memorize anything too technical.",
    "I would say that this is an interesting course. I highly recommend it, even for someone who is not a philosophy or humanities major. It is just a great course with a wonderful teacher and an intruiging topic.",
    "The title is pretty self-explanatory - you delve into everyday moral issues from the perspective of psychology (more psych than philosophy, actually). I would recommend the class, although it might turn out more repetitive and less interesting than you expect (I went in with very high expectations for Paul Bloom). Also, it's more work than it seems - lots of readings!",
    "I don't think this course is going to be offered again.. but I enjoyed the course.",
    "I would recommend this class because much of the material we learned was interesting and useful to everyday life, although there was also an enormous overlap with Intro Psych. The class sometimes felt as if it lacked focus, but taken as nine or ten distinct lectures and topics it was very interesting, just not so much as a cohesive path of information.",
    "It was okay. I could do with or without it. It's definitely more work then let on.",
    "The course is time consuming, especially towards the latter half of the term. The course material is very interesting and applicable to every day life as the title suggests, and If possible, I would take the course Credit-D or Audit it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. Take Philosophy and Science of Human Nature instead. You'll learn everything you learned from this course and so much more. Moralities had so much reading, and the tests did not test comprehension of the material at all; just detail retention.",
    "Don't take the class if you have any ability in any of the relevant areas.",
    "Yes, do it.",
    "excellent. excellent readings, excellent lectures.but the midterm and final were picayune and seemed to subvert the whole point of the class, which brought everything together in a conceptually tight and fascinating way. so thats not the kind of material that i think lends itself to multiple choice, but thats ok.",
    "This is an amazing class. It is very different from the rest. It'll really make you think about the way you interact with others and about your own values and morals.",
    "This is a DeVane lecture, so it's not going to be taught again any time soon. Anyway, the material covered was truly fascinating, and integrated many diverse disciplines. By the end of the course, I could talk eloquently and confidently about morality and win dining hall debates against my friends. The workload was heavy at times, but it was worth it.",
    "yea. there is a lot of reading for this class, but the material is interesting! bloom is obviously a great lecturer, and going to class was a joy. the 500 word reading responses every week were a little difficult to keep up with, especially when the readings were so long, but they definitely helped you for the tests. also if your section is preparing for the test, try and get a group collab on the readings going so everyone can share information on all the readings (that way no body has to do every single reading)the class in general was great though! definitely reccommed. writing the paper was a bit hard, but it really made me think so much more about morality and ever since, this class has opened my eyes to how different views of things affect people's behavior. you really dont think about it until its all laid out for you in class, evidence after evidence.",
    "Awesome, as always from P. Bloom. Fun lectures, relevant reading material, not too much work but enough to make you think.If you're a psych senior or something, will be repetitive. At the same time, comes nicely full-circle with the kinds of things you learn Freshman year.Very enjoyable. Take it.",
    "If this class is ever offered again, I highly recommend it. There's only one lecture a week, but Paul Bloom is such a great lecturer that I would have preferred having two lectures instead of section. The material is really interesting, but don't expect to walk out with any sort of answers about moral questions. Even Bloom will keep his opinions out of it. Sometimes there was really a crazy amount of weekly reading, though.",
    "Pretty good. A fun class, although if you've taken any kind of intro psych course before, you're not likely to learn much here. Also, while interesting, there were a lot of observations that made me think, \"Well, duh. Everyone knows that.\" Still, the reading's not bad--seems like a lot after the midterm, but most of it isn't hard to read. Reading responses are easy too, and the final paper, although long, is not hard to write. Lectures are enjoyable and only once a week. For exams, you'd better do the reading extremely carefully and pay extremely close attention to the lectures. Professor Bloom is nitpicky on the exams, but he likes to ask questions about seemingly irrelevant details from the lectures\/reading. Reading summaries won't help much, but if you pay attention the first time around, you should be fine.",
    "HIghly Recommended. It will open your mind up.",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life was extremely interesting. I really enjoyed every lecture and reading. Paul Bloom makes the class engaging and leaves plenty of room for debate from each side, which allowed us to see the bigger picture. But don't expect to learn what morality is by the end of the semester. If anything, the class left me with more questions than I had going in. I don't regret it though--now I have more tools to figure out what morality means to me (or if I believe it exists at all) than I did before. I would definitely recommend this course. However, expect a good amount of reading. He doesn't assign much at the beginning, but as the semester progresses, so does the number of pages each week. And take note of specific names and examples because those will show up on exams. Also, though lecture slides are posted online each week, it is much more helpful to actually show up, or at least record his lectures, as Paul Bloom does base his tests on material he goes over in lecture--material that doesn't always make it into his slides.",
    "It was ok. Not terribly interesting and too detail-oriented.",
    "WOW. WHAT A CLASS. Best I've taken at Yale. Professor Bloom is a truly captivating professor. It's probably the only class at Yale where I've legitimately been excited to go to class each week. The reading material is all interesting articles and TED talks--all fun to read on their own. The workload isn't bad, with weekly reading responses (pass-fail), an easy paper, a midterm and a final.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. Not too much work, interesting material! Made me think about certain moral issues differently and through unique lenses.",
    "Moralities was, I guess, what I expected. I also took Intro Psych last year. I felt the topics were being repeated all over again. However, there was some new material and it did make me think about things in a different way. This class has a huge potential for section a-holes. I'm not even sure if this class will be taught again, but if you want to learn about it, just take Bloom's intro psych class and you will learn more than enough. The tests were just like Bloom's intro psych tests except more focused on the readings, which became longer and longer as the semester wore on. If you really read every single reading, then you should be fine for the tests. Overall, OK class. I might have taken something else instead.",
    "Fairly good class - gets pretty repetitive",
    "It is a not very demanding course that teaches you about everything, as the title suggests.",
    "Moralities of Everyday Life was great with Paul Bloom. Highly recommended, but may not be offered again. One 10-15 page paper, and 2 tests (midterm, final), plus weekly responses (which sucked a little, but oh well).",
    "If this class is taught again, it's definitely worth taking. Professor Bloom is a fantastic lecturer, one of the best at Yale, and this class is Bloom at his best since he's talking about some of his favorite topics in moral psychology. Only one lecture a week and one section. Section was okay but definitely depends on the people in your section. Be warned that this is not necessarily a low workload class: there was much more reading than expected and the final \"short\" paper was more than 10 pages. The midterm and final were also difficult at points and seemed to test a little too much on minute details from the readings. Overall, these points shouldn't deter you from taking a class that's really applicable to everyday life and further classes.",
    "This is a great last credit to have; not a whole lot of work and pretty self-directed as to when you do the work. The final paper's a challenge, certainly, but of you spend enough time on it before the break, you're fine. The only catch is that because the class is huge, the exams can be horrendously nitpicky, and even of you've actually done all of the reading, there will be some you can't study for.",
    "This was a huge lecture about morality- big surprise, huh? We talked about law, nature, differences, evolution, children, and dilemmas surrounding morality. The lectures were extremely engaging, but sometimes it was difficult to see the overarching ideas in the class, or to follow how specific anecdotes related to the idea he was describing. I think that might have to do with the fact that I don't have much experience with this sort of class, because I'd certainly recommend this class to anybody (even thought it was a one-time class)",
    "Summarize: GREAT class to take if you really want to learn something about the world that you live in, and the actions of people. Looks at the subjects through various lenses, such as cognitive science, real life examples, psychology, philosophy etc. NOT a gut class, but worth it all the same.Recommend: Absolutely, for the reasons mentioned above.",
    "Moralities of Everyday LIfe is a cognitive science course, part of the devane lecture series. All lectures are open to the public and posted online. It is a great class totake for the kids who do not mind a little anonymity and have a real interest in understanding the processes that drive us to make moral\/immoral decisions, display altruistic\/selfish behavior, commit harmful\/helpful deeds, etc. Class size was, at times, overwhelming. That being said, battle chapel is an awesome place to have class. In addition, Paul Bloom is one of the superstar professors here at Yale and posed some really interesting theories during his lectures about the inherency of a lot of these motivations. Everyone should have the opportunity to take his class once during their Yale experience. Why not moralities?",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The lectures are engaging and the reading material is interesting\/readable for the most part. Given that this was the first year it was offered, there were some kinks that needed to be worked out (e.g. the amount of required reading doubled without warning as the semester went on, which is simply not okay), but on the whole, I think this is a fascinating and accessible course if you're interested in the way humans think and feel about morality.",
    "Will not be offered again--which makes sense, because it was never a real class anyways.",
    "I had high expectations for this course, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. While I enjoyed the first lectures\/sections, as the semester progressed the material got painfully redundant. Some of the readings - especially the ones about animal behavior - were somewhat boring and banal. Also, my discussion section was really bad: we just talked in circles, without ever reaching a conclusion. On the bright side, Paul Bloom is a great professor: his lectures were fairly enjoyable and engaging."
