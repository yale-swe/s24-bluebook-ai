    "For the first exposure to Policy Science it was a bit difficult to grasp in the beginning",
    "Question 8.1. The course was poorly structured, and so were the classes. There was no correlation between the class content and the readings.2. The class was advertised as being a discussion intensive seminar; On the contrary, questions raised on readings and class content were skipped over, and never addressed.3. The instructor also displayed favoritism in the class. Regardless of final grades, this was not good for morale.4. The grading system was very ambiguous. There are no ongoing evaluations\/ indicators for one's grades.5. Content-wise, the course was limited to the (un-critical) study of the policy sciences framework. While we dabbled other topics, we talked about them in a superficial manner, without any critical analyses.",
    "10 - This is a truly excellent course and possibly one of the best I will take at the university.7 - Professor Clark is truly excellent, and not only was readily available for discussion with students, but also provided strong mentorship and excellent insight into applying theory and concepts learned in class to real problems.",
    "This is a polarizing course, and a hard one to describe. Some people find it very helpful. Some have other opinions. I thought it provided an excellent way to get some purchase on complex problems, as well as a new way of thinking about policy.",
    "This class provided a good introduction to the policy sciences framework and helped me to understand a new way to approach and understand problems. However, during a good portion of the course, I left class feeling confused and unclear of what had been accomplished in the three hours spent in the classroom. My biggest frustration was that the policy framework was presented as the only way to proceed in natural resource and no attention was given to alternative methods or viewpoints. The assigned readings for the class were often unmanageably long and not consistently discussed in class. Despite my frustrations in the classroom, I found Professor Clark to be incredibly available and helpful when talking to her in one-on-one situations, and felt that the assigned paper and presentation at the end really helped me to understand the policy sciences framework."

    "Presentations by practitioners",
    "Interactive, good speakers, great opportunity to learn the skills of problem solving",
    "The policy sciences framework that we learned was the best part of the course. Learning it in depth and learning how to apply was really valuable. Susan was also a warm, welcoming professor and it was very helpful that she was always available and happy to meet.",
    "There was a nice sense of community.",
    "The subject matter taught. The student presentations.",
    "Concepts and theory of the policy sciences; problem solving skills; goal identification; problem orientation",

    "Susan Clark. Guest lectures.",
    "Professor Clark is very helpful, personable, and accessible to discuss both course material and related professional matters. She is extremely dedicated to her students and the learning process.",
    "This was all new material to me. I did not realize what the material was about until about 3 weeks into the course, and even now I am still thinking about it, considering what bits and pieces I have learned, what I have yet to learn, what I disagree or agree with.Guest speakers were great.",
    "The class really helped me to understand a new way of approaching problems - natural resource related or otherwise - and Professor Clark was really great about bringing in outside speakers who used the policy sciences in their work. These speakers really helped me to see how the policy sciences can be used in the real world."

   "comments": [
    "I'd like for it to be less lecture\/teacher oriented and more dialog\/student oriented when it comes to class discussion time. That would be more in spirit of an openness that the instructor tends to promote, except when dialogs actually start. (Then student comments tend to get cut short.)",
    "Lectures too rambling without enough content",
    "Having the assignments listed on the syllabus, or receiving them more in advance would be helpful (a few were sent out 2 or 3 days before our next class meeting) - there was often a lot of reading and personal reflection\/analysis that took a lot of time.",
    "Clarity early in the semester. A little more organization - sometimes things seemed a bit random",
    "The course could have had better discussion during the class time. it would have been helpful to have the class discussion centered around specific parts of the framework and how to apply it.",
    "More examples of how the policy sciences succeeds in real life.",
    "more discussion among students.",
    "Instructor was not great at facilitating discussion among the group. We had a relatively quiet group of students that needed help from the instructor to open up and engage in fruitful discussion. We didn't really get there....",
    "Maybe a field trip?",
    "Organization of the complex concepts were somewhat lacking. Students often exhibited slight confusion as to where we were going early on in the class. The instructor was great at laying out the concepts, however, a better schedule in the beginning would benefit those not familiar with policy-based integrated frameworks.",
    "I think this course could use more class discussion.",
    "I view the bulk of the course material as a methodology, a set of tools to apply to problem definition and problem solving. However, the supplemental material given to provide context and support for this methodology is substantial and complex. So it would have been helpful for the professor to introduce the policy sciences as a methodology for understanding human problems from the beginning of the course.Class time was not always budgeted to provide time to discuss out of class readings. We often did not even mention the readings assigned. Perhaps in the future, at least 10 minutes might be spent just commenting on the main contributions of each article or piece we read.",
    "I think the time spent in the classroom would be more valuable if it had more structure. As students who don't know what the policy sciences or the framework are, a more concrete, structured introduction and overview of the subject at the very beginning of the course would really help the rest of the course flow more smoothly."

This was very encouraging and appreciated!",

    "This course teaches you a very specific approach to policy analysis. The policy sciences framework focuses a lot on human perspectives and values and uses these to evaluate how a policy works and what is going wrong in a complicated conservation problem. The course material may not become totally clear until about halfway through the semester when students being their presentations, so don't expect to have a good grasp on the framework in the beginning and don't be afraid of all the new vocabulary. It certainly takes time to learn and chances are you won't have a firm grasp on it even after the course is over. Start the final paper early! And go talk with Susan during her office hours -- she is an incredibly valuable resource and she is really helpful in talking through your particular case and helping you to apply the framework to it. Also, keep up with your journals weekly, it will help a lot in the end! Lastly, do the readings and try to contribute to the class discussions - it makes them much more pleasant and more interesting with everyone's contribution.",

Depending on your skills, focus on the reading during the first part of the course, and then focus on your paper in the second part. Do your journals in a timely fashion. Visit the professor during office hours for help on your paper in the beginning, middle and end!",
    "Do not be afraid of approaching the instructor. Take advantage of her availability, as it is quite unique in the grad school environment.",
    "Keep going over introductory material. It will pay off in the long run.",
    "Come with an open mind, and actively seek out the professor and fellow students to discuss material, especially outside of class.",
    "Pick a topic for your final presentation and project at the beginning of the course, and each week apply what has been read and discussed to that topic. I found that I only really understood the policy process framework when I applied it to a process I had been involved in. Applying the framework to a topic from the beginning will help you to understand the process better and give you a leg up on getting your project done."
