    "This course will challenge the way you think about the nation's history, and will provide a lot of ideas for further inquiry.",
    "I would recommend this course as a very good junior seminar. It is small, the professor is cool, and there is a good balance of work. It is not too much nor is it too little.",
    "Take the class if you want to learn about the Spanish Colonial project in North America. Along the way you'll learn a lot about AmerIndian and Mexican history and culture as well as a fair amount about Iberian influences--historical, cultural, linguistic, et al--in the \"New World.\"You'll also incorporate the history of the American West through the lens of the borderlands and frontier critique.It is an altogether terrific seminar sized class with a terrific professor.",
    "Take this class only if you are highly interested in the Southwest."
