   "comments": [
    "I gained a lot knowledge about current political events.",
    "This is a great current events class that kept me involved in what is going on in the world currently and the problems that we face.",
    "Learned general information on current events that I (and everyone) should know about",
    "I learned a broad amount of material relating to current challenges the world faces.",
    "Take this class if you are hoping to gain a greater (although basic) knowledge of global trends and resent events. It is definitely helpful in helping you learn more about what is going on in the world, but for more in-depth coverage, this class is not it.",
    "I developed a new view on the social and political problems that the world has begun to face in the new century.",
    "Got an overview to some issues I hadn't learned or thought much about.",
    "I learned a lot about current issues facing countries that were important topics, especially during the election like refugee crisis, global climate change, Trump election, Brexit etc.",
    "Great class that relates directly to everyday events in today's world. Helps inform you about the state of our world right now",
    "I have never felt like I understood what was going on in the world. The global conflicts and world order seemed to be this code that I just could not unlock. Now, I feel like I have an understanding of most of the global challenges and relationships between the major countries of the world. I can explain how the US is involved in Syria and Iran and Russia, and our relationship with each of these countries. I feel empowered, not disheartened, to understand the news and current events, because of the extensive backgrounds and explanations of this class.",
    "Learned a ton about the world today and how foreign policy is shaping our future",
    "I have gained a much better understanding of current events and their historical contexts.",
    "I was able to get a general understanding of the social, political, and economic happenings of many states, regions, and institutions across the globe, along with the factors and challenges that unite many (if not all) of them.",
    "This course helped me learn a lot more about the background of issues that I was hearing about in the news.",
    "Professor Howorth occasionally speaks very fast, but he is a great professor in that he is knowledgable, clearly explains information, and is an engaging lecturer. I really recommend doing the readings beforehand, as you will most likely be lost during the lecture if you do not have that crucial background information.",
    "I learned more about the global challenges that the world is currently facing especially in the context as to how America's policies and recent policy changes will be influencing future global order.",
    "I learned a lot about international affairs which was actually incredibly helpful and i feel as though I understand the world more!",
    "I feel like I learned a lot in this class going in with very little knowledge on any of the topics we learned in class. We didn't really learn about anything in depth, but it was more of getting exposed to several different topics going on in the world today.",
    "Expansion of current evrnts knowledge.",
    "Gained extensive knowledge about foreign affairs and challenges facing our country today.",
    "Great class.",
    "I learned so many great things from this class. Being my first international relations class, I got such a great overview of many of the challenges facing the world right now and has allowed me to appreciate current world events. Bringing in natural challenges, security challenges, institutional challenges, and regional challenges, there was something for everyone to learn but also be interested in.",
    "This class was an incredible overview of the international challenges that the world faces today. I was able to think more critically about my western bias, and I was able to engage in dialogue regarding current political issues, such as the Iranian Nuclear Deal, with a much greater background to develop my own opinions. I walked out of that class thinking about something new every day, and I would be able to speak to many of my peers about the lectures and the readings outside of class because of the depth of the material. It truly shows how complex the web is between the US and the rest of the world.",
    "This course imply expanded my awareness and knowledge of important current events and issues going on around the world.",
    "I learned a lot about the complexity of international issues.",
    "So many issues that i though i knew about well but turned out to be much more complicated",
    "I decided to take this class because I had very minimal knowledge about international challenges. I found it hard to keep up with the news since I was never very engaged in current events. However, I found this class extremely informative. I can have conversation on nearly any topic (which was my goal going in). I can also connect a wide range of ideas together.",
    "I learned an overview of many modern international issues.",
    "An overall understanding of the current events in the world, as well as the historical events behind them.",
    "Learned a lot about many of the pressing issues of our time. Got a good overview of the history of the issues as well as their current status.",
    "some stuff about challenges",
    "It was a great crash course in modern day issues. Midterm and final, but this is not a gut, grading was harsh.",
    "Great course to gain immediate knowledge of current issues in the field of international relations (specifically security challenges), and also gain an introduction to the history behind them",
    "This course provides a great academic look at international problems and events, as well as the political consequences of many of these issues. The readings provide a stronger academic and theoretical understandings for the problems the world is facing. The course is good for strengthening knowledge of events beyond just basic understanding and name recognition.",
    "Honestly, I think so many of the lectures contained an extreme amount of information, that it was really hard to obtain specific insight",
    "Broad understanding of the issues of international politics - awareness, not always full understanding, of what is going on in the world.",
    "I learned a lot about a wide range of contemporary topics in international relations that spanned the globe, including particular international affairs vocabulary and writing skills.",
    "A huge amount on current events and the background\/perspectives needed to understand the world around us.",
    "I gained a basic understanding about a wide berth of issues facing the world, and specifically the U.S., today.",
    "I gained a breadth of knowledge into the numerous challenges facing our world today and what the underlying factors and powers are behind these.",
    "Learn all about events that have gone on and are going on in the world",
    "Learned a lot!",
    "The skill of analyzing current events (and how to expect\/prepare for their future developments) and political trends through a historical lens",
    "I developed a great understanding of many arias of the world that I did not know prior. It was a pretty broad overview of all there relevant issues of today. Great course.",
    "I learned a lot about current geopolitics and world challenges, and learned how to think about the world we live in in a much more interconnected way.",
    "I learned about 21st century international affairs.",
    "How to connect many ideas and issues across topics and countries. Being able to to this while also thinking of the current events around each topic made me feel more engaged in the election and news in general.",
    "The class is pretty much like reading a really analytical news paper on different global topics every day which i thought was awesome. It did a great job of connecting different issues and showing different global themes and trends that we as a generation could use or would have to work against in the near future.",
    "Great overview of current global challenges.",
    "I learned so much about the world!! I LOVED this class",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about current events around the world. I developed a better understanding of how countries have communicated in the past and how they come to solutions\/agreements.",
    "A good survey course of the challenges faces us today. I found it interesting and I felt it helped broaden my spectrum of knowledge well.",
    "This course gives you the baseline information needed to understand the discourse in current events.",
    "I developed an awareness of issues facing many different regions across the world.",
    "I learned a lot about current world issues and stances on each issue.",
    "now able to have informed conversation about current events",
    "I learned valuable knowledge about the global concerns of the 21st century.",
    "International challenges is a great course for learning about current issues in the world and how they are shaping our future. I didn't realize how much of a Yale bubble I was in until I took this course.",
    "I learned about current events throughout the world in this class.",
    "I learned a great deal about a wide array of issues that face the leaders of the present and the future. The class covered a great deal of information and hit a lot of topics that I found to be extremely relevant to current events.",
    "I got a good general comprehensive sketch of all of the international relations issues that will be the scariest under President Trump.",
    "I learned about many current issues that I never would have learned about in such depth. The class taught me skills that come with being in a large lecture class such as listening rather than taking notes.",
    "I learned about major international challenges and how to connect all of the major occurrences.",
    "Awareness of international situation",
    "An in depth understanding of today's current events and some of the major historical events leading up to them.",
    "I developed a greater range of knowledge on the challenges of our world and how the relationships between nations are affected by these challenges.",
    "I was able to gain a general understanding of the major current global events.",
    "Learned in great detail about current events",
    "I learned a lot more about what's currently happening in the world today on a global level. I have been bad at keeping up with reading the news and current events, and this course really pushed me to keep up and hone those skills. It also forced me to think about things in a way I never had before.",
    "I learned how so many international challenges are interconnected and cannot be evaluated individually. I think many are quick to focus on a certain \"challenge\" for expertise, but this course showed that you cannot talk about e.x. water shortages without discussing security, terrorism, the Arab Spring, etc. Section and the exams helped me learn how to intertwine multiple international challenges into an argumentative essay. I liked how the readings for this course were both academic papers and articles from established news sources because this gave a wide range of opinions on the topic at hand.",
    "Broad overview of word issues.",
    "An unbelievably broad while also in depth understanding of the major challenges the world faces today.",
    "An understanding of the basics of international politics and a brief understanding of the context behind various issues and current opinions on them.",
    "analytical skills",
    "This class was a great crash course on modern issues in political science and current events. It drew right from the headlines, and it helped inform students on what is going on in the world.",
    "a basic knowledge of current global issues",
    "learned about current and past global issues and global politics. Was a very interesting and informative class that kept my attention.",
    "I found this course immensely useful for understanding the host of critical challenges that we face today.",
    "I learned a fantastic general overview of current world affairs and the challenges that face many countries both internally and between other states.",
    "I learned a great deal about current affairs that affect the world I live in, and I developed the analytical skills to understand these issues in context and evaluate possible solutions.",
    "I gained an introductory insight into the field of international relations and political science in general as well as more specific knowledge on a few specific issues and their relation to other issues. This class also helped me better understand current events.",
    "The course is pretty forward with its topics of coverage: I got a pretty broad overview of major challenges facing the world today; it was like a primer for current events, their causes, and likely next steps. One of the few classes I've taken that I've been able to apply to almost every conversation I've had since. (Although maybe that's saying more about me than the course?)",
    "I got to learn what has happened and what is happening in the world and this overall has made me more aware of the many challenges our generation faces.",
    "I learned lots about current events, and particularly how to think critically about international conflicts\/challenges and their potential solutions.",
    "This course gave me specific details about events and issues that are presently happening in the world. Prior to taking this course, I had only known the basic explanation of many of these challenges, but now I am well-versed in the causes and implications that these issues have.",
    "As an American Studies major, I felt like I didn't know a ton about challenges facing the international community at large. It was really helpful to take this class.",
    "I developed a better understanding of current events, and the recent history that continues to shape the modern world.",
    "International Challenges provides a broad overview of a number of different issues in the world, from the UN to security challenges to climate change. It is a good class for those who are interested in overarching themes of IR.",
    "I learned how to look at the world and not just see the little picture given to me by my perspective but I saw the larger story from all sides.",
    "I developed a fair understanding of world issues and how they connect. It was a nice survey course to feel somewhat versed in international challenges (knowing the names of prime ministers, regional groups, different wars and reasons behind them, etc.).",
    "Broad understanding of international challenges",
    "I learned a lot of current events",
    "Even though many might label this a current events course, a lot of of what we covered (institutions like the UN, the G20, NAFTA, the EU, ASEAN, etc., plus the dynamics of different regions like Russia, the Middle East, the global South, Africa, Asia, and Europe, etc., as well as more general challenges like climate change, water scarcity, overpopulation, and so on) will be relevant over the course of this century and throughout our lives. I have found myself whipping out the knowledge Ive learned over the course of the semester during political discussions with friends and family (and even sometimes complete strangers). If you apply yourself to this class and take the material seriously, you can come out with a pretty well-rounded understanding of international political dynamics and how they play into the challenges we'll face in this next century.",
    "By taking this course, I acquired an enormous corpus of knowledge, surprisingly large in both breadth and depth, of the international challenges currently facing our world. I was amazed that one course could cram in so much information into one semester. I also became better at addressing counter-arguments in my writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that it gives a cursory overview of a lot of challenges. The weaknesses are that there are essentially two types of lectures, one that talks about a problem, and one that tries to solve a problem. The two should be standardized.",
    "This was a surprisingly excellent course. I was expecting a flabby gut course that superficially surveyed major topics in IR. While the course was a broad survey, Howorth did a great job of treating each topic with sufficient rigor and nuance. Howorth is an awesome lecturer and expertly curates reading for each class. I ended up learning a tremendous amount about the world and IR topics that I had not known about before. The class is also very painless in terms of workload. Overall, a wonderful survey course that is a great primer to international relations and current events.",
    "Section was intimidating for people who didn't already know a lot about the subject.",
    "We sped through a lot of important things, but also good to have a course that gives you the most vital information about current events.",
    "Extreme breadth does not allow for much detail. Each of the course's parts (ex security challenges, international institutions, etc) might be better as a class? (Obviously each individual class could be a course, but I know that's not the goal and that this course is meant as an overview).",
    "Strength is breadth. Weakness is depth.",
    "Implementing some form of making students more accountable for the readings -- perhaps weekly quizzes worth a small percentage of the overall grade or something along those lines -- would have been beneficial. I know I would have gotten a lot out of the readings, but since there were quite a few of them each week and I knew I could get away with not doing them, there were many that I just didn't get to.",
    "Professor Howorth's teaching style, to me, was very difficult to follow and, at times, not helpful. He moved through the slides very quickly and, most of the time, simply read aloud the information that was written on the slide. The guest lecturers were dry and not very helpful\/interesting. The TF's were great, though.",
    "I thought that overall the course was interesting. The lectures and readings were engaging. It was helpful to have the lectures posted online to refer back to throughout the semester.",
    "TBH kind of a dumb class. The format of one challenge per day doesn't allow for any meaningful depth that couldn't be gleaned from reading the wikipedia page on the issue. A lot of the lectures are just the history of an issue rather than its role as a 21st century challenge.",
    "Lecture was very sporadic but the class is a must take. Especially with our new president, many things may be changing. Take this ASAP",
    "I felt like the main weakness is the 50-minute slot given to this lecture. It could be improved so much by being given a 1hr15min slot. There is so much information and background to be explained in each of these lectures, so I think it would benefit greatly by having an extra 25 minutes for these explanations. The main strength of this course is the way that the readings, lectures and discussion sections work together to explain the challenges. The readings provide a superficial look at the challenge, the lectures explain in more depth the background\/history of the challenge and the challenge itself, and the section allows us to discuss how this challenge could be resolved or not. Between these three exposures to the challenge, I felt like I really understood them.",
    "Strengths: Most interesting course material of any class at Yale thus far Weakness: Size of class and lack of depth in engagement",
    "The course is very interesting, and it is both a strength and a weakness that it covers so many topics, since we touched on many ideas but didn't really come to deeply understand any of them.",
    "The course is strong in generally achieving its ambitious goal of informing students about international happenings. However, it faces the typical survey course criticism of leaving things out. The continent of Africa received one day's attention. A lecture on the Arctic, which I know little about in a geopolitical sense, was replaced with one on Trump (as applied to the topics we had discussed up to that point in the semester). And we all know which of those two topics normally gets more attention. The course is weak in that it tries to inundate its students with facts, yet simultaneously promotes the conflicting narrative that general trends matter more than specific facts, but knowledge of these specific facts can set you apart in grading. I struggle to see how a course that claims to be introductory gives such an obvious leg up to students with a better understanding of the international system, so much so, that it disadvantages those who want the basic understanding. Also, there are too many male TFs. I didn't realize this until the final exam review, which wasn't run that well, by the way, because it turned into a \"here's everything I know about X, regardless of whether or not I think it directly relates to the exam\". It became more complex and confusing, rather than helpful and simplifying.",
    "The lecture isn't very engaging, but I liked that the lecture topics were flexible to respond to current events.",
    "I think this course could be improved with a more standard level of grading -- the TFs' grading varies by each Fellow, so it is not the more fair and just. Additionally, each TF has a different style, so it would be nicer to have a more level standard for everyone.",
    "I wish the course had included some more writing assignments to really keep the students on top of the material throughout the semester.",
    "I felt like it might have been nice to cut some topics and narrow the focus a little bit. I would have really liked to learn a bit more about some of the topics. I also felt like we should have spent more time on Africa after spending so many lectures on Europe and Asia and the Middle East.",
    "Weakness: lecture format",
    "This class overall was great. Great lectures and great sections allowing for comprehension. No weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Incredibly interesting information that is beyond useful to know! Weaknesses: Lectures were sometimes dry, but the material was interesting nonetheless. The lecture slides could be made more clear. The variety of section formats was somewhat annoying considering some students get 100% participating for showing up whereas others are graded differently based on harder assignments.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. The lectures are extremely interesting, and the mandatory section helped clarify the large topics brought up in lecture that could have been hard to digest the first time around. I really would have enjoyed writing a larger paper for the class because there were a lot of topics that I wish we could have gone into deeper, but, after speaking to my TF, I understood why there was a final this year instead of a paper. Regardless, I think a paper would have allowed me engage in the material more at the end of the semester rather than trying to memorize authors and articles to write essays about on the final.",
    "Howorth and my TF, were both incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable about all the subjects. Strengths -- great intro class to exactly what it says. Weakness -- WAY too many slides\/info per 50 minute class. Howorth speeds through things, and there are a ton of names and specifics that could probably be purged from the lectures",
    "strength: relevance of material guest lecturers weaknesses: a lot of kids took it as a joke",
    "very interesting materials and readings",
    "This class is NOT a gut! Many of my peers (myself included) perhaps joined this class hoping for an easy A while learning about international challenges. If you have a surface level understanding of these topics, this course will require you to put extra effort in. The workload isn't too much (depending on your TA). However, don't be fooled. You will need to study a lot to do well. It was my hardest course this semester.",
    "Really interesting readings, but easy for kids to get away with not doing the readings. Lectures were very fascinating as well.",
    "Strengths: good overview, interesting lecture Weaknesses: slightly disorganized, test grading is quite harsh because most people do well",
    "The course was informative with in-depth information and exactly what I was looking to get out of the class. However there was such a broad range of topics and so much information and history it was hard to get a full grasp on the material in lecture\/section.",
    "Lectures could be improved a bit. Slides often contain a massive amount of information, including many dates, names, and acronyms, and Howorth flips through them too quickly. It may be possible to copy down everything on each slide if you are using a laptop, but it is hard to both do so and pay attention to what he is saying, to fully grasp the significance of each lump of data.",
    "was very biased...everything seemed to come out of the US democratic party's platform. we never saw two sides of an argument (and this is not coming from a republican)",
    "The material at the beginning, mostly the environmental concerns, simply wasn't engaging. It was material that I've covered a million times before in high school science classes, and it didn't really have any more depth than my initial forays into those topics. Then we got into material that I had no real background in, many of the economic institutions,asian regions, etc., and were able to provide only a cursory view. The setup of one lecture per topic leaves some topics woefully undercovered and gives others more time than they really require. Many of the readings also felt badly chosen. A 20 page UN report with refugee statistics is not particularly helpful. It definitely felt like the readings required a lot of triaging. Overall though, it was definitely interesting (and got more so as the class went on) and gave me a much better understand of a lot of current events. It gave a nice mix of historical background, current situation, possible solutions, and implications for the issues discussed, and it was graded fairly.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, but felt that maybe fewer topics should be covered in greater depth.",
    "Less liberal bias. This course is so left wing",
    "Strengths: It covered a broad area of topics well. The midterm was easy, and I would've appreciated a study guide so that I could take away more of the important information (its hard to study for something as broad as current news).",
    "The main strength of this course is that it is taught in a broken down, simple way that makes the material easy to understand. It is simply a matter of focusing and doing the work for one to succeed. It could be improved by focusing on which readings truly matter. I feel that many of the readings extended beyond the scope of my understanding (because I have a limited knowledge of traditional political science theory), which made it a little more difficult to understand the more speculative pieces.",
    "There is too much information in the course - it's basically an overview of every country and its problems and it becomes extremely difficult to gain any real insight",
    "I think the sections could use some universalizing, so that they are run similarly across the class, that way each student would receive the same information as all others.",
    "Strengths: Professor Howorth is very knowledgeable and his TAs were excellent. The topical changes each lecture kept the course fresh and were in-depth enough that they did not seem superficial. Weaknesses: Sometimes there was not enough information on slides to allow students to thoroughly review the lecture (even with good notes). Spelling out some of the abbreviations or uploading the lecture slides with an additional small paragraph blurb in the notes would be very helpful. While the exams test synthesis of the semester's topics, they still rely heavily on rapid fire regurgitation of facts and figures.",
    "The material and lectures were awesome, the readings were a bit long and the lectures although engaging, tried to cover too much material every class",
    "I thought this class did a good job of balancing depth and breadth. This was largely due to how well chosen the readings were. The readings tended to cover aspects of the subject matter that aren't commonly known, and the different readings had very little repetition between them. Additionally, the lectures tended to expand on what was covered in the reading rather than just rehashing it. Overall, this made it so that a class with a fairly light work load, still taught a lot. The sections were also well run.",
    "Section is good but lecture is boring. Just read off the slides",
    "Many issues covered thoroughly. Its strength could also be its weakness in how its breadth floods the student with material and perhaps prevents one from digging too deep into a particular subject (no papers).",
    "I appreciated having a final exam instead of a final paper because it forced me to really learn the material and get a thorough understanding of the class.",
    "This class is really interesting and a great way for any student to get a good understanding of current affairs. Professor Hoyworth tried hard to keep his opinions out of the way of facts, with the exception of the Brexit lecture.",
    "This class is a great survey class of all the challenges that our world is facing. There is A TON of material but it was very interesting and you didn't need to know it all, you just had to be able to see the connections between the issues tackled in class and talk about them. The class could be frustrating at times as every single lecture's topic could've been a class of its own. Overall, this was a very good class though.",
    "The course was extremely interesting and I loved doing the readings and attending section and everything else however I didn't think there was enough engagement, I would have loved there to be more assignments actually like writing a paper or something, surprisingly.",
    "I think the difference in TFs across sections was difficult to overlook especially in terms of grading",
    "This course was very interesting and hit on a lot of topics. One thing I would have appreciated learning about that was not covered was the global burden of disease.",
    "Honestly thought the course was great - the pace could get pretty fast, but never unmanageable. The lecturers and guest lecturers were all great.",
    "even though I was very engaged in the class, I don't think grading was fair and the lectures by TFs were unorganized.",
    "Strengths include the topics of the lectures and material on the slides. The sections are also really great. Weaknesses include people not showing up to lectures.",
    "I think this course of course suffers a little from a lack of depth, due to the pace at which it switches topics, but it does pack an amazing amount into a short amount of time, which I really enjoyed.",
    "The lectures could have been presented in a more interesting way. The strength is that it does give you a lot of useful background to the subject matter.",
    "enjoyed the engagement of the course and the material, including its relevance to issues being currently faced by the international community.",
    "I thought the course was great",
    "If you are trying to find a low workload course then this is probably the one for you. I do not think that it is a particularly valuable class unless you plan on further studying some of the topics discussed in the lectures. Each lecture is an entirely new issue in the world so you do not have enough time to go in-depth on anything. I think the class would be better if the number of topics was decreased and multiple lectures focused on each one.",
    "The strength of the course is the breadth of topics that it covers, however this is also its weakness, as it becomes almost impossible to delve into any of them too deeply.",
    "Strengths: knowledge of prof and guest lecturers Weaknesses: slides could be kind of hard to read; inevitable challenge",
    "This course is strong because it is very interesting material and the TFs are very knowledgeable and eager to help you. I felt that this course was weak, however, in the area of preparing newcomers. At times I felt that the lectures went very quickly and were hard to follow and that the flow of new information sometimes came too quickly.",
    "The class was very well structured and flowed well. Lecture was engaging and entertaining.",
    "Strengths: interesting material weaknesses: none",
    "I think it would be better to have a final paper rather than a final exam. The final exam was not structured well. The midterm was structured better.",
    "I think that this course was quite liberally biased which I found unfair. Both sides of all conflicts should be presented. Forever, it was nice that we were able to learn about such a broad range of topics, but it was extremely cursory.",
    "A strength of this course is how much it covered in such a short amount of time and the level of depth actually achieved in this short time. That said, I think a weakness is that kids who have a background in political science or the like have a really big advantage.",
    "I think a strength of this course is how current the material was that we were discussing. For example, after Trump won the election, Professor Howorth dedicated a class to talk about how a Trump presidency would affect various of the the topics we had already discussed throughout the course. Also, in many of the lectures, Professor Howorth would include material that had broken into the news less than 24 hours before lecture, so it was great to be learning about such current events from an intellectual and more practical perspective. One weakness of the course was how surface level some of the lectures were because of how many different topics that were covered throughout the semester. For example, to have a lecture just called \"Africa\" to discuss everything going on in the continent and how that impacted the rest of the world generalized too much. It was nice to have an overview of so many international challenges, but I think that we could have excluded a couple to give others more justice that they deserved. Also, I thought the course was very Eurocentric and Asia Centric. We had one lecture about Africa, a couple about the Middle East, and absolutely no mention of Latin America. I think a lecture should at least been devoted to Latin America or that Latin America should have been incorporated into existing lectures.",
    "Both the strengths and weaknesses include the broad nature of the course. We managed to learn an unbelievable amount of information that one could say made the course difficult to manage, but by the end everything came together extremely well.",
    "good TA's. works better as a seminar",
    "easy course, lectures not super necessary to attend",
    "sections were strong I thought. The small discussions we had were very useful. Guest speakers were a nice touch so I would recommend continuing that.",
    "Overall I thought that this class provided a great overview to world events.",
    "The lecture was always interesting and the section was good. The only weaknesses came during the TF led lectures.",
    "The course jumped around a lot, which was its nature but having more of a structure would have made the information easier to learn and especially to relate. The overarching themes of the course were unclear.",
    "The class is very general because of the nature of the material. Each topic is covered pretty quickly and the professor has to pick and choose topics because the subject is so broad. That being said, it's taught fairly well for a lecture and I feel like I learned a lot of facts, although much of the material is subjective by nature. Discussion sections helped to clarify the material as well as to get me to think about it more deeply.",
    "Lecture was a bit difficult to follow but section truly helped supplement everything.",
    "The lectures were very information-packed and hard to understand if I didn't have background knowledge on the subject, so most of the studying\/learning I did was in section or on my own. I thought the format of the midterm was good, and the TAs were very good at helping us study pertinent information",
    "The strengths of this course is its diversity of topics and the way themes are interconnected. While I think the class did well in trying to summarize the important points of each of our topics discussed, I wish we could've gone more in-depth on certain topics. Granted, I understand that it is hard to both cover a wide array of topics and do so in a deep matter.",
    "International Challenges provides a broad overview of a number of different issues in the world, from the UN to security challenges to climate change. It is a good class for those who are interested in overarching themes of IR.",
    "Incredibly interesting topics however the lectures were often sort of dull.",
    "One of this class's greatest strengths was its breadth and how many topics it covered. I feel like I am well versed in a greater spectrum of global topics, or at least enough so that I would feel clued in to many more worldwide news\/events. On the other hand, that means that we never got very deep into any one topic, so it was more like a glossing over of global events\/history. I'm not sure if this could be remedied however, because the class covers so much.",
    "Strength: Gave intro survey to a lot of different topics. I feel prepared to talk about different challenges with beginner-intermediate proficiency (nice for \"cocktail party\" conversations). Kept us updated on the news. Not too difficult, so nice as a 5th class. Weakness: I don't think the structure of the class is very conducive for learning. Its too hard to learn all about China in 50 mins -- so I often felt like I was getting very surface level knowledge that didn't feel complete.",
    "Hard to engage with material",
    "Professor Howorth should consider revising his powerpoints and lectures to be better organized and to contain less extraneous details. He does state throughout the semester that the aim of the course (and the object of the exams) is not to memorize a bunch of meaningless facts, but to understand the main trends and themes of the material. However, it is not clear just *how* students should go about constructing those main themes until after the midterm, when theyve seen the kinds of questions that are asked on the exams and know just to what extent they need to engage with the details. Studying the powerpoint before the midterm, I wasnt clear on how much detail I needed to know. It would be very helpful to students if Professor Howorth included (both in lectures and powerpoints) main takeaways and themes throughout his notes, very explicitly. This would reduce a lot of the stress in studying for the exams and comprehending the lecture, because a lot of the material we covered (like the Bretton Woods institutions and ASEAN and BRICS and the messy history of terrorist activity in the Middle East) was actually pretty foreign to me, and took some time for me to wrap my mind around. This process was complicated by the fact that I had to wade through a lot of details to construct the main ideas in the lectures\/powerpoints.",
    "lectures are super engaging. only possible downside is if you need grade padding there's only a midterm and final (and section). but personally I liked that there were only two assessments, because it made for less work.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is also its biggest weakness: its incredibly comprehensive and expansive syllabus. The course attempts to tackle practically ever major international challenge of the 21st century (with the notable exception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) in one semester with about 25 50-minute lectures. As such, one gets an incredibly comprehensive introduction to the major issues facing our world today, from climate change, energy, drones, and terrorism to Russia, China, Iran and ISIS. I very much admire and appreciate that the course was so ambitious and sought to cover so much in such a small amount of time. However, in trying to be so comprehensive, the course inevitably falls short, and one finds oneself incredibly exhausted at the end of almost every lecture, feeling that a tremendous amount of information was crammed in and that one didn't get a very strong grasp of what was in fact crammed in. As such, I recommend restructuring the course to an extent. I recommend keeping the course's structure and topic regimen; but I recommend that within each lecture, instead of trying to cover such an enormous amount within said topic, trying to cover less within that topic and giving those themes and ideas their due time so that they can be properly understood by the students."

    "This is a tremendously interesting course, and most anyone would benefit from taking it.",
    "Would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "Definitely would recommend if you want to stay up to date with what is going on in the world and understand how those things will affect the United States.",
    "I guess I would, but it was nothing special.",
    "Lectures are great.",
    "If you're a polisci or global major, as long as you've taken some classes and you read the news in your free time, you won't have to do anything except for show up to section and exams. If you're not and want a very broad overview of international issues, then this class offers that, but don't expect much detail on any one particular subject.",
    "Yes. Interesting survey class with not much work.",
    "If you want an introduction to the world of international affairs and political science, this is a good place to start.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student who needs a social science credit. That is why I took this class and it was a solid choice. The work load was not too heavy and the weekly topics were interesting.",
    "Probably not. TBH kind of a dumb class. The format of one challenge per day doesn't allow for any meaningful depth that couldn't be gleaned from reading the wikipedia page on the issue. A lot of the lectures are just the history of an issue rather than its role as a 21st century challenge.",
    "Definitely, it was a fairly easy class but I got to learn about very interesting and relevant topics. The professor even tailored it to current day happenings such as the Trump election.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that understanding how the US is involved in the rest of the world is critical to being a good US citizen and citizen of the world. A lot of people, like myself, are sometimes overwhelmed by how complex these issues are and just decide not to try to understand them. This class gave me the opportunity to understand them. The lectures are interesting and explained in depth.",
    "Awesome, awesome class. The TA can shape your experience, so make sure to get into a section that challenges you to think!",
    "I would say that this is a great course for anyone who is interested in contemporary global affairs. It covers a wide swath of material (and therefore not in great depth), but you will come away from it with an enhanced understanding of issues facing our society.",
    "Yes! Great course.",
    "Yes! It's interesting and useful.",
    "I did not enjoy this course enough to recommend it. Compared to what I understand about this course's past, it is no longer a gut. That isn't my problem with it. I think people should have to go to class to do well, but then again, I think class should be exciting and engaging enough to enjoy lectures more often than not. I'd estimate that I legitimately enjoyed 1\/6th of the lectures, at most, and I am a Political Science major. Adding insult to injury, my favorite lecture was offered by a guest professor. Section determines how you feel about the course, probably. At least my TF (Louis Wasser) did a reasonable job of limiting the dominance by people who knew the most coming in.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in the subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in an overview of the big things the world is dealing with today.",
    "Take it if you care at all about things outside of the US. Pretty simple and straightforward course organization and not a demanding workload. Great 5th class.",
    "As someone with little knowledge about International Affairs, I feel as though I gleaned much information about the most pertinent issues facing our world today. A must-take class for people who would like to be more aware about current challenges!",
    "Yes, but i would warn them that basically everything depends on the exams so to study really really hard for those!!!!!",
    "Yes, especially for people who want a broad crashcourse in current events. It's not too difficult, but urgent and captivating.",
    "I would recommend this to students who want to get exposure\/a base knowledge about several different topics relevant to the world today. It's also not a lot of work, so it's a good 5th class.",
    "To have a perspective on current events, very useful.",
    "International challenges was a great class. Very interesting to learn about so many conflicts affecting the world right now and was a great overview to so much information. There were also several different larger topics which allowed everyone to be interested in at least one or two parts more than others. But beware, this used to be considered a gut but it wasn't this year. Midterm and final were more conceptual than anything and sections made sure you did the readings by quizzes or reading responses throughout the year.",
    "A true gut. ~ 1% of my total workload this semester on this class as an Applied Math major.",
    "Take this course! So important to learn about the world, even if it is in more of a survey format. I personally didn't read the news much before this class so I learned a lot. In terms of workload, I never did the readings besides when I was required to for section and still did well on the midterm but it honestly depends on your TA. Some are definitely harder than others and even the way they conduct section varied significantly. The readings were really interesting though so do them when you can, I just had a busy schedule. The lectures were sometimes dry but Prof. Howorth is very knowledgable.",
    "Take this class! But don't be fooled by it being called a gut. More specifically, It is a real class that is graded like a gut. The TF's and Professor Howorth actually want you to learn, and it would be such a shame if you did not engage with the material to the level that they want you to. The class does have a chunk of readings, but they are all interesting and current! Lecture is SO good, and section is actually helpful for this class, even though it is mandatory! Do what is good for you and your education and take the class!",
    "Yes",
    "If you are someone who lives under a rock, then this class is NECESSARY for you to take to be a well-informed citizen. If you are someone who does not live under a rock, this class will still help develop your knowledge on important topics and issues going on around the world.",
    "It was a good introduction for world issues, but it was not very in depth.",
    "This is a great survey class of international current events. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a fifth class or with a desire to keep abreast on modern challenges in an easily digestible format.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a surface level understanding of international challenges and want to be conversant. That is why I took the class.",
    "Yes! The course material is really important stuff and the professor is really interesting and funny in lecture.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course because it is a good overview of the many international challenges we face today. I do feel like I have a better understanding of international relations and issues.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if you are looking for a current events class. It was not as \"gutty\" of a class as one would expect however, so be ready to put in effort to do well.",
    "Would definitely recommend to any student who does not feel comfortable discussing all of the current social, economic, political, and environmental issues around peers. The course gives a broad overview of all these different modern issues and provides great readings if there are particular subjects you are more interested in. It is also not that much work.",
    "it is a total gut, but the class was very biased...everything seemed to come out of the US democratic party's platform. we never saw two sides of an argument (and this is not coming from a republican)",
    "With the change to a final exam instead of a paper it is much less of a gut than in past years. However, the workload was completely manageable. For the first midterm you can easily get a high-b to low-a with almost no reading, minimal studying, and going to section (which is mandatory anyway) depending on your level of past exposure to the topics. The lectures got more interesting to me as the course went on. Once we were into economic institutions, regional concerns, and security issues the lectures became a lot more engaging, so it's worth sticking it out through the slightly slow beginning of the course. Overall I would recommend it, especially as a fifth class. And if you can get David Minchin as your TA he's incredible. Section with him was probably better than the actual lectures.",
    "This will greatly enhance your breadth of knowledge on modern day challenges, but be wary of the heavily liberal slant to the course. Professor Holworth makes no pretenses to being unbiased though.",
    "Yes, if you want a good foundation in the current standing of international relations and security challenges. It gives you a good overview of the state of geopolitics and how many issues are interrelated.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the materialbut do not approach it with the simple assumption that it will be easy. The workload does vary between each TF. You'll come out with a much better understanding of international events and learn a lot along the way, which is satisfying.",
    "i mean nah - you'll never go to class. not worth your time",
    "Definitely would recommend. I had a strong background in international relations and still learned a great deal. These are fundamental topics that every college student should know.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone who has the slightest interest in engaging with the world today. Don't take this thinking it's a gut though, it really isn't: you need to study intensely for the midterm an the final and depending on your section there is weekly writing to keep you reading the assigned material.",
    "This is a great class. It is not very hard at all. The workload is very light and the tests are super fair. However, you actually do learn a lot about very interesting topics. The class does a good job of balancing breadth and depth. The readings are interesting and well chosen, and the lectures are engaging.",
    "Yes, it provides a broad view of a variety of international relations topics.",
    "Interesting class and fairly easy and low workload",
    "Take",
    "Howorth's a legend, great course to take, especially if you are interested in international relations.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to students who do not have a good understanding of international challenges, regions and issues. It goes into brief history and then modern issues that are very relevant. Not too much work at all, don't need to do the readings but they are very interesting and you do need to use them in the midterm and final.",
    "This class is certainly a little harder now that there is a final instead of a paper. Not a huge workload but expected to have a very good understanding of the implications of current events. Easy if you read a newspaper or book.",
    "Take it! This class is a great survey class of all the challenges that our world is facing. There is A TON of material but it was very interesting and you didn't need to know it all, you just had to be able to see the connections between the issues tackled in class and talk about them. The class could be frustrating at times as every single lecture's topic could've been a class of its own. The midterm and final were actually very fair and kinda fun. There was no need to do the readings and you could miss a few (or a lot) of lectures and not really feel lost. The material was easy to catch up on by just reading the news, which was really nice. The workload was just amazing: a midterm and a final, no need to do the readings and the class was interesting so it was nice. I totally recommend this class but would just warn that it's not actually a gut but you'll learn a lot and it won't be overwhelming so take it :)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting with a small workload and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, if they are willing to put in work into the readings because they are critical.",
    "I would absolutely recommend challenges to another student.",
    "This is a well-organized survey course that explores many of the world's pressing issues. I love the fact that the information was so current and that we addressed international issues as they were unfolding. Professor Howorth is an excellent lecturer and very approachable. I would definitely recommend this course to anybody with an interest in international politics.",
    "Sick class, teaches you a ton of things which are really relevant and important to know about simply to get whats going on in the word",
    "Yes! Take it! Prof. Howorth is a legend & always has amazing guest lecturers.",
    "YES. If you want to learn more about international issues, I highly suggest, but you do have to know a lot going in to fully understand lectures. I learned the most just studying for the final at the end and sitting down and really slowly going over the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this! Not only was it super easy (yes gut), but it was also very interesting and not bland at all. This course is VERY useful for just your daily life to be read and knowledgeable about many important events and issues the U.S. and other nations are facing. It's not like you can just do nothing though - the midterms still require a bit of studying the lectures and memorizing information\/events\/etc to get an A. Other than the midterm and final, there was no work besides talking in section. I came away from this course very satisfied with how much I learned because I studied pretty hard for the exams. This course may be what you make of it. You can skip all the lectures and not try and maybe pass with a B+\/A-, or know just most of the info presented and make at A and feel like you are much better read on current events. It really helps you know background info and the different opinions for a lot of news.",
    "Not much work, and yet interesting and engaging.",
    "If you are looking for a straightforward class that will give you a strong background to current events then take it. The lectures themselves could have been more interesting. I would say that it is a very useful class.",
    "Yes because the information discussed throughout this class is important for us as citizens of the human race to be aware of the issues not only facing us, but those around the world.",
    "Yes. Not necessarily useful in terms of critical thinking, but extremely relevant and allows you to essentially consume pertinent information while studying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a good 5th (or 6th) class and fulfills a distributional requirement",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially for students that do not follow the news on a daily basis.",
    "Great and interesting course. Teaches you a lot about the world and not a lot of work.",
    "If you want a class that will not stress you out then this is probably the one for you. That being said, I would not recommend it if you plan on taking it for any other reason. I do not feel as if I learned that much throughout the semester.",
    "This class is very applicable to current events. It is helpful in understanding what is going on in the world. The lectures have a lot of information but they are interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in either politics or current events. It provides a good, general survey of topics and issues that are important on the world stage today and in the near future.",
    "A good general sketch of the challenges facing the world in the coming years (climate change, North Korea, Russia, ISIS, etc.), which are simultaneously interesting and terrifying. Professor Howorth is pretty entertaining, and many folks in the class neither show up or do the readings (which is kind of sad) so a small amount of engagement goes a long way relative to the median student. Bewarecan be really depressing. On the first day of shopping week, the \"going over of the syllabus\" ends up sounding like a list of possible causes of the apocalypse. Grades come from a midterm, a final, and section participation.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the knowledge I learned during it was extremely valuable. It provided me with information I will take with me far beyond this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. However, it is no longer a gut. This class requires actual work and participation. The course covers major events in the 21st century and makes you feel aware and knowledgeable.",
    "Yes. Interesting and good info",
    "Yes, good material and not too difficult to understand.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "I would recommend this course because I actually did learn a lot in a short amount of time. It made me a more culturally fluent global citizen.",
    "I would recommend this course to Yale students interested in being introduced to political science and current events. This survey class allows you to learn a good amount about a broad range of topics, which is helpful from both an academic setting to an everyday setting.",
    "Great course. Lecture can be a bit dry, but section was actually kind of fun.",
    "Yes very easy and you learn a decent amount.",
    "Yes every student at Yale should take the course before graduating.",
    "This is a great course if you end up in a good section. The material is interesting enough if you haven't been in a PLSC or many history courses and want to dive a bit deeper into every day issues. Overall it's a relatively easy and enjoyable course that will make you more conversant and help you to develop and reflect on your own opinions about the state of the world.",
    "Yes I would. You learn a lot",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for an engaging class with little outside work. The course material is interesting, and section discussion is the best part of the class.",
    "yes, it is easy and also gives a basic overview of many important issues",
    "I would recommend this course because It is interesting and because i think it is necessary to know about the challenges the world is going through so that people can help correct them.",
    "Yes, it is really rewarding if you are globally minded and care to understand the many challenges of the 21st century.",
    "Absolutely, a great way to explore international relations particularly if you are interested in pursuing a global affairs major. Also reasonably easy to get a good grade if you pay attention.",
    "100% absolutely - learned a lot and the workload was manageable",
    "I would recommend this course. It's interesting, not too difficult or time consuming and I learned a lot. Perhaps it wouldn't be worth your time if you already know a lot about international relations and current events but otherwise I think it's useful and practical knowledge I can apply to the world around me even as a STEM major.",
    "If you're interested in learning more about international relations, this is a great survey\/overview. It's not as gutty as people think, but it also doesn't try to make things more difficult than they need to be. The readings are interesting; the lectures are relaxed and sometimes have guest lectures; the sections are hit or miss; the midterm and final are pretty standard fare: IDs and essays, with options to choose from. Shop it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any other student looking to learn about the world and what is happening. It is well worth the time.",
    "Yes; this is a good overview class for people who feel like they don't follow current events but feel like they should understand them more. Workload is very manageable, so I would recommend as a 5th class",
    "If you want to gain a more thorough understanding of issues presently occurring throughout the world, I would recommend this course. Topics ranging from climate crisis to issues in the Middle East, as well as an improvised lecture following the election, are discussed, which leaves students with a knowledge of causes and implications behind issues happening today.",
    "As an American Studies major, I felt like I didn't know a ton about challenges facing the international community at large. It was really helpful to take this class. The lectures are all about a different topic- obviously it is impossible to cover everything about a particular topic, but Professor Howorth does a great job of presenting and simplifying everything. Pretty easy, chill class-- just a midterm and final, and they give you key terms to study ahead of time. He is a great lecturer and you learn a lot (although much is admittedly depressing).",
    "I stumbled into this course because I was a looking for a SO credit (STEM major), but I'm glad I took it because it definitely helped me increase my engagement with current events (which was, admittedly, pretty low). The lectures were straightforward (at times a little too straightforward), but if you take it for what it is -- a broad survey course -- it's pretty good. The grading was pretty arbitrary and TF-dependent, since there were literally only two actual exam grades from the entire semester (in addition to section attendance\/participation). Some of the best lectures, I felt, were the ones given by guest lecturers, but Professor Howorth is engaging and it's definitely not a boring class.",
    "International Challenges provides a broad overview of a number of different issues in the world, from the UN to security challenges to climate change. It is a good class for those who are interested in overarching themes of IR.",
    "This class should be required.",
    "Aparrentlyl easier when it was a final paper. The final exam could have been easier, but I put so little effort into this course. I wrote an essay on something I knew nothing about lol.",
    "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.",
    "I would recommend it if you need an easier 5th class. It definitely equips you with interesting facts and a surface level knowledge of different international challenges that are important to be familiar with. That being said, the surface level engagement of the class made it less captivating.",
    "Yes it's not only specific to political science majors and good material to know",
    "PLSC 143 was a good but sometimes frustrating class. If youre planning to take it, you need to walk in with the attitude that it is not a gut, and that it really does require your attention and effort. If you want to do well on the midterm and the final you need to do the readings and keep up with the material. This can be difficult if, like me, you believe prior reviews that this is a gut class and that it neednt demand much of your time. I often fell behind on the readings and this made section and studying for the exams stressful. But I took the class pretty seriously in the second half of the semester and came to appreciate how relevant and applicable the material is. Even though many might label this a current events course, a lot of of what we covered (institutions like the UN, the G20, NAFTA, the EU, ASEAN, etc., plus the dynamics of different regions like Russia, the Middle East, the global South, Africa, Asia, and Europe, etc., as well as more general challenges like climate change, water scarcity, overpopulation, and so on) will be relevant over the course of this century and throughout our lives. Its true, the lectures are often a lot of facts, details, and extraneous information that you have to wade through and extrapolate from to construct bigger themes (without much guidance) on the exams. Section is helpful for this I realized on the midterm that a few of the essay questions came from discussions we actually had in section, so that was purposefully designed. The amount of detail you have to digest, combined with sometimes disorganized lectures (especially when they are delivered by TAs), is what can make this course pretty frustrating. But they really mean it when they say that knowing the big themes and trends is the main objective. So if youre going to take International Challenges, just make sure you dont treat it like a gut. Keep up with lectures, do the readings, and engage in section. Do all of this by keeping a running list of the general big themes and ideas in mind, and make sure you can put these themes into context by giving two or three examples from both lectures and readings. Do this, and you should be set to do well in the class.",
    "definitely take this course. I took it as a poli sci major, and learned a lot. also a great class to fulfill a SO if it's not your area, because everything is SUPER relevant to what's going on in the world and is interesting. least work of any class i've taken at yale, and one of the most engaging classes. Howorth is a riot to listen to. lectures actually make you want to go to class. only possible downside is if you need grade padding there's only a midterm and final (and section). but personally I liked that there were only two assessments, because it made for very little mandatory work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether or not said student is interested in or studying international relations and current events. No matter what, if one pays attention and goes to lecture and section, one will walk out of this course with a very comprehensive appreciation of the world as it is today in such a way that no other course I've taken or heard of at Yale can offer."
