    "Astronomy& Physics (B.S.) majors are required to complete a two-semester project. This is a great opportunity if you put the effort into finding a lab that's doing work you find interesting. Note - you don't have to work in the astro department - you can design astro-related projects with advisors in physics, G&G, mech e, etc. Go have fun!"
