    "Although it might seem dull to read academic papers every week, the way that Ms. Adams decomposes the papers and helps to apply them to the broader world makes it all more enjoyable. I learned a lot of new ways to think about economic studies and their broader implications. Additionally, the coursework is minimal, and you don't really need to do the reading for class because she goes over all the studies anyway. I would definitely recommend it as an Econ seminar!",
    "Economics of the family looks at topics like marriage, dating, divorce, female labor involvement, paid maternal leave, and raising children in a quantitative way. It i centered around looking at the research done in the area, and so it is pretty econometrics heavy, but I think you could get by without knowing too much. Class is structured with the professor lecturing for the first half and students presenting for the second half, which both could get a bit dull. The only work for the class is one really long paper and a presentation, so that was pretty chill.",
    "Dr. Adams is great, and I really loved Econ of the Family! It has been one of my favorite Econ courses I've taken. The course gives you an entirely new avenue of Econ in which to think and opens your eyes to new facets of Economic thinking that you might not have noticed before. This is absolutely a course for someone to take if you are interested in the Economics (that should be) behind policy regarding family planning and gender politics. In general, it gives you a new way to look at family structures via game theory, utility optimization, and other Economic models, which is really fun and novel compared to your average Econ class (as well as thought-provoking and intriguing)!",
    "weekly readings\/discussions, midterm paper, final paper, presentation",
    "Good class to learn about family economics - interesting stuff, not a lot of weekly work, but the final project can be slightly hefty. Easiest if you have thesis interests that align with topics taught in this class."
