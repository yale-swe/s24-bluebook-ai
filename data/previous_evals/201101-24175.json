    "The opportunity to study in detail visual material from the British Art Center is a rare gift! Wandering in the archives of the BAC has been such a pleasure and an unforgettable educational experience.",
    "I would have liked to be able to take out more than one book at the time from the library.",
    "Resources were available, but Bryan\u0092s one weakness might be his ineptitude with the computer. Each and every powerpoint (all the images) must be organized and placed onto the classes server. Often the stuff Bryan shows in class is only available in the special reserves section of the British Arts Center, and we unfortunately don\u0092t have enough time to dig stuff out. If they accompanied his lecture notes, that would be tremendously helpful.",
    "The resources that I needed for my research could all be found in Yale Library. I used several hardcopies of books on Olmsted as well as library internet resources.For my convenience Professor Fuermann has lent me a book to use till the end of the term.",
    "-the British Art Center, which we visited at the end of most classes to look at archived drawings that we had seen during the lecture.-spring break visit to England!"
