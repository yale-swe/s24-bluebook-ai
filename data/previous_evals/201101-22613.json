    "Advanced level french course. Read a lot of interesting if depressing books and work on grammar and writing.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Any language at Yale is a big time commitment, but you will have a lot of fun in FR140 alongside learning the language. If you can afford the time it's a great course.",
    "A continuation of French 130 which goes farther into French culture (including a serious WWII unit) while maintaining the grammar and speaking paths of the previous semester. The student is expected to find the reading less challenging, and to successfully follow more complex plots.",
    "Ruth Koizim taught our section of French 140. She was excellent! She is a tough grader but very compassionate and eager to help her students. Her teaching style has really improved my French.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any and every student. It is a wonderful academic environment.",
    "If you want to continue learning French, like I said earlier, then take it.",
    "Language requirement, and the projects were interesting",
    "Lots of work. Lots of french.",
    "Highly recommend it.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. Great reading material and a fantastic teacher.",
    "even if you've taken french 130 and think u have a good handle on the language, be prepared to do a lot of work. there's really not a good way to get around it (i tried to no success) and if you care about your grade, you may have to hustle a bit. Also, the five absence rule gets crazy difficult to follow late in the year."
