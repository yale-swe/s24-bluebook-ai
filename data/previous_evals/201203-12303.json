   "comments": [
    "it's a wonderful class! if you can get in it, take it! It's truly wonderful, very laid back time schedule because it meets only once a week, but the paper will take a while to read! Prof. McKee is wonderful, don't miss the opportunity!",
    "A great class for any economics major, especially if you haven't had a lot of exposure to primary economics literature.Highly recommended!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the material. You will learn both about Aging and also a great deal about economic modeling. If you want to understand more of what it actually means to be an economist, take this class.",
    "Take it! Even if you are not interested in the subject McKee is a wonderful teacher and person. He is great at picking the right amount of reading so that you really understand (and actually do) it and you get a lot out of the class.",
    "If you can get in, it's probably the best senior Econ seminar out there.",
    "Very good course. Not too much work but engaging material. Take this course as a seminar - McKee is the best econ professor I've had!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor McKee is great. You get a much better sense of how to read and understand an economic paper. Plus, writing the research proposal is a really good experience.",
    "Economics of Aging is a fantastic seminar in which the student learns how to both read economics research and begin to approach starting to do one's own research. Co-teaching the class, reading the papers, and writing a research proposal is an incredible way to begin to transition from just acquiring knowledge through intermediate courses and begin to think about developing new knowledge.",
    "Professor McKee is awesome, but I have mixed feelings about ECON 466. There were ~25 people in the class this semester, and as a result, it felt a bit too much like a lecture and not enough like a seminar. We didn't have many class discussions, and when we did, they were structured as such and didn't develop organically. In terms of the course's content and requirements, each week is centered on one area of aging (bequest motives, aging in developing countries, health and aging, retirement, etc.), and you're assigned 2 papers to read on the topic. To focus on the major points of each paper, McKee requires that we complete a short worksheet for each paper. The papers are time-consuming and very challenging, but if you stick with them, you'll learn a lot. Each person must present a paper in class, and you write one twenty-page paper over the course of the semester as well. I originally suspected that the course was going to be more microecon\/econometrics heavy, and though many of the papers make use of microecon\/econometrics extensively, I'd really say this is a more macro-based class. The papers are very \"big picture\" and topics are usually considered at the policy level, not at the level of individual decision making, so don't take this class is macro-based thinking isn't your cup of tea. McKee was great and very approachable and understanding over the course of the semester.",
    "This was an awesome Econ seminar. Professor McKee is a really awesome, relaxed professor, and the range of material is fascinating -- especially if you're interested in micro-level decision-making behaviors. Each week you'll read a couple of (mostly interesting) papers and fill out short worksheets (which are actually great because it means you'll do\/understand the reading). There's also a research proposal with various checkpoints over the semester, which is totally do-able and Professor McKee makes himself super available to help you out. And each student will make a presentation for one of the classes -- also totally doable because you'll meet with McKee first. Overall a great class!",
    "A great survey of a variety of topics in aging, that conveys complex information in a clear and well-taught manner. If you can get in, I would absolutely recommend. It takes a topic that initially I didn't have much of a specific interest in and made it engaging and fun. Absolutely take it!",
    "Great economics seminar. Not that much work - just a weekly worksheet and 1-2 economics papers to read. The only major graded assignment is an economics research proposal, which Prof. McKee really guides you through. Would recommend if you need an econ credit - you won't learn how to run empirical analyses, but will gain some cursory knowledge from reading econ literature on aging, which is actually a very interesting topic.",
    "I would recommend this class to other economics majors only. If you don't have a background in economics, some of the papers may be difficult to understand.",
    "Econ of Aging a fairly interesting class with a very cool professor. Every week we read a few academic economic papers related to aging (retirement, health, pensions, saving, etc.) and discuss them. You learn a good amount about econometrics and how real-world economics is actually done. The papers can be hard to understand sometimes, but Doug is excellent at going at a good pace and making sure people understand. It's a great economics class if you're looking for a seminar with a reasonable workload and a cool professor.",
    "Great class - you read a lot of interesting papers and learn about the major issues in the field of economics of aging. You get to write an empirical paper which is a lot of work, but can be rewarding. Also, Professor McKee is really helpful when writing your paper."
