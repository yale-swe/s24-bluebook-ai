    "I would recommend it because the materials covered in class are essential to breaking down a lot of misconceptions that Americans have about how the United States came to be. A study of American history would be incomplete without this class. One thing to watch out for, however, is the long readings and long class. If there are a good number of people in the seminar (i.e. more than 8) and everyone contributes their thoughts, it won't feel like its dragging on.",
    "This is generally a small class, but it's definitely worth taking. Because it's small you can contribute to the conversation so easily. Prof. Alyssa Mt. Pleasant is super nice and super helpful. The paper is a historiography one, and it's a very interesting intellectual exercise. You learn a lot, the readings aren't that much. Solid seminar.",
    "Light reading, but thoughtful topics. Historiography essay may be difficult compared to other research papers, but it's worth it if you are student of history.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the seminar since the history discussed places \"colonial\" history in particular in such a different context and is so important to our concepts of our \"nation's\" history."
