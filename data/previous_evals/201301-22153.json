    "This class is kind of a joke. Don't take it unless you really really want to read all of Kundera's books and you think you won't get sick of them (which you will because they are all the same). No one reads the books and seminar is the most painful think ever. Kvk is delightful and hilarious which makes the whole thing worthwhile kind of but not really.",
    "If you like Kundera, or small Czech women in hats, take this class.",
    "If you like Kundera, read him on your own, every novel we read was fantastic but this class did nothing to improve my reading experience. If, on the other hand, you're looking for an easy fifth class that will add little to no work to your schedule, this is the class for you.",
    "Great books, crazy professor, bad discussions. If you read Unbearable Lightness of Being and liked it, that's probably the reason you're thinking about taking this course. We read almost all of Kundera's works in one semester and it got boring after a while. Some of his novels are similar and his tone is mostly consistent throughout so it became hard to distinguish between the books.",
    "No x1000000",
    "Yes, take this class if you want to read great literature without stressing too much about the actual course load.",
    "Great class, but the readings and reading responses do take a lot of time."
