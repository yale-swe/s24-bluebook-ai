    "Orgo II Lab isn't too bad at all. It's better than Orgo I Lab because you already know all the procedures and you're just making different compounds. There's only two long lab reports so it's not too bad.",
    "You're probably taking this class becuase it's a requirement, but as far as labs go it's decently fun and the out of class work isn't very time consuming.",
    "Same as 222",
    "Most of the experiments in this course will be similar to the later labs of the first semester (the synthesis ones). The course could use some more advanced techniques instead of synthesis after synthesis. The same nit-picky grading applies, unfortunately, and the penalties become somewhat more severe.",
    "Lot of work. Busy work, like rewriting the procedure, given in the lab manual, three time: once in the EP, once in lab notes, and once in the PL.Depends on the TA. Tip for success: get the same TA as last semester. Knowing his preferences will give you a huge edge up over the rest of the section.",
    "Not too much work and you really learn a lot!",
    "its orgo lab--clearly you don't have a choice.",
    "Yes, I would because it is an interesting course",
    "Fine lab. A lot of reflux, filter, recrystallize, filter. Lab experience depends on how much you like chem labs and who your TA is. Go for Sam or Alex - they are both great!",
    "BORING. Though we are doing reactions it's second semester without the thrill (that's a strong word I guess). In fact it's too structured. Your grade is based on fluff in your reports and summarizing the procedure ten times. There is no thinking except sort of for the final...",
    "you prob have to take it so try and go in with a positive view. honestly it is not too too bad and there are not many lab reports",
    "Solid organic chemistry lab, with experiments that are useful, applicable, and not too draining overall. I think that your experience depends heavily on your TA, but not much can be done about that -- try for Sam or Alex if you can!As in CHEM 222L, Christine DiMeglio is excellent. Despite having huge lab sections, she clearly cares and makes an effort to get to know each student and make herself accessible. A++++++ for her.",
    "Yes \u0097 It is a required course for many science majors\/ premeds, and it is so much more organized than gen chem lab. The lab builds off the techniques you learn first semester, so you actually get to synthesize compounds, like banana oil and aspirin! The class is also not graded on the success of your experiment, but rather the experimental methods and analysis of your results, so it is much less stressful than gen chem lab.",
    "like 222L",
    "It's not exactly something you'd take for fun, but it's a pretty fun lab. You get to do more complicated and interesting syntheses, and the post-lab assignments are less demanding. Make sure you remember basic techniques\/set-ups from first semester and that you have an IR table handy!",
    "Orgo Lab II is the most fun I have had in a chem lab at Yale. It's great because you finally feel like you understand the concepts and techniques, and at the end of the lab you have a tangible product! Lab never runs too late, and assignments are very reasonable. You are probably going to take this lab because you have to, but I think it's enough fun and little enough work to take even if you don't haveto.",
    "In this lab you develop technique for syntheses and running various kinds of reactions. I would definitely recommend this class especially if you are taking the corresponding lecture class since you get to see some of the material in action.",
    "You're probably taking this course because it's required. That being said, it's actually pretty fun. After the first semester of lab, you already know the important techniques. So this semester is about performing syntheses. Make sure to be very thorough in all of your assignments and stay on top of everything. Grading is tough in this class and there is sometimes a ton of work. Overall, this is easily the most enjoyable and educational lab course I've taken at Yale.",
    "All you ever do is mix stuff, heat, and characterize. Can get boring if you don't talk to other people and joke and lighten the mood during lab.",
    "As far as lab goes, chem223L is pretty good. The lab environment itself is pretty laid back and the post-lab assignments aren't too bad. It's so much better than gen chem lab and even better than first semester orgo lab, but still be prepared for a few long, tedious experiments.",
    "Overall, this is a good introductory organic lab course. The requirements and expectations are fair. The course is not particularly time consuming, as there are only a few full lab reports to write. Students are also not graded on yield, so it is not difficult to do well in the course.",
    "Take this course if you want to major in chem engineering, or chem, or are premed. It's really not that bad if you do the reading and are careful in lab. Sometimes yield is low. Actually, all the time. But don't worry!",
    "You probably have to take it but it's not as bad as first semester. There are only 2 full lab reports and you don't have to do a post lab assignment for all the labs. You will also get out before 3:30 most of the time",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. As a continuation of Chem 222, it allows you to apply everything you learned in the previous lab. The experiments help to clarify many of the points made in lecture. Professor DiMeglio is one of the most helpful professors at Yale, and she always make sure that each student has a firm grasp of the concepts of each lab.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to. Really, it is better than first semester of Orgo Lab and leaps and bounds better than Gen Chem lab. DiMeglio is helpful and the lab manual is straightforward. The assignments take time, but they are not obnoxious and you have clear instructions on how to complete them. Plus, they play music in lab! That's awesome, right?",
    "Like semester one but less work. Do it.",
    "CHEM 223L is the second semester of the organic chemistry lab sequence. Although synthesizing the expected product can sometimes be frustrating, the reactions are much more interesting than the first semester. This semester focuses more on reaction mechanisms and reagents rather than technique (which is covered in the first semester).",
    "I would definitely take this course along with the lecture. Taking the two concurrently helps to understand the topics more easily. The labs were more in depth than first semester orgo lab, and took a little more time. However, you do learn a lot, so in the end it's worth it.",
    "The second semester of Organic Chemistry lab is insome ways better and in some ways worse than the first semester. On the one hand, there are less assignments and many of the experiments are interesting syntheses. On the other hand, some of the labs are very long and in general it is more difficult to be above the average. The end of lab exam was much fairer this semester, I thought, however.",
    "There's basically no reason to take it unless you're required to, but it is a good class and it really helps your understanding of the chemistry. I would recommend it.",
    "This is the most enjoyable AND most informative lab class I have taken at Yale so far. The lab class greatly enhanced my lecture\/textbook orgo education. This is basically a cooking class, except no eating...",
    "Second semester Orgo lab was a lot better than the first. You get to do a variety of synthetic experiments, which is a lot more fun than doing experiments and writing reports on which recrystallization solvent is the best or which TLC solution works the best. It's not too much work, just weekly experimental plans and a few post labs, and only two full lab reports to turn in. However, the grading on all written assignments is decidedly annoying (for example, -1 for each time you don't put your last name on a page, -0.5 for imperfect bond angles on ChemDraw figures, etc.) but once you figure out your individual TA's likes and dislikes, it should be pretty smooth sailing.",
    "slightly more work than half acredit should be but not as bad as other labs",
    "If you have to do it, it's not the worst lab I've ever taken.",
    "This is a straightforward lab with some pretty cool syntheses (e.g. aspirin).",
    "It's way better than gen chem lab, which sucked. The reactions are fun, the environment is pretty low-key, with music playing on the radio, and you work at your own pace at your station.",
    "Obviously you have to take so yes",
    "Labs can be interesting, learn interesting techniques\/syntheses. much better than Gen-Chem lab in terms of tedious work. However, occasionally difficult to obtain results. One person won't get good results every 2 lab sessions or so.Lab reports can be difficult however much fewer than previous labs, not too much work altogether but still worth more than 1\/2 credit of work.",
    "By far the most time-consuming class I've taken at Yale (well, except for first semester lab). And it's a lab. Copying procedures into experimental plans, then lab notes, then post-labs is absolutely ridiculous. Plus you have to copy it without copying it too directly, or it could be considered plagiarism according to the course packet. I don't know what they want... There's only so many ways you can say \"Add 500 mg anthraldehyde to a 50-ml round-bottom flask.\" Nothing is more torturous than all the lab write-ups for this class.",
    "If you need a lab credit, this is a great lab to take. The workload is the perfect amount for 0.5 credit.",
    "Yes. It is a great, straightforward lab, run by a very good instructor. Professor DiMeglio is wonderful and always willing to meet with students one-on-one during office hours, which is a good resource if you take advantage of it. Be careful with preparing lab reports and such. There are certain formatting stipulations that you need to adhere to very closely if you expect to do well. I didn't really follow thesamples Prof. DiMeglio gave us in the lab manual, and it came back to bite me when I got my graded lab reports back. KEY IDEA: The reports are more about the formatting than the organic concepts, so just make sure to follow the samples very closely, and you will do fine The organic concepts are easy to understand, and very much a peripheral part of this lab experience (which is kind of silly but very true).",
    "Obviously, you're taking it because you have to. It's not too bad workload-wise as far as science labs go.",
    "It's a lab--take it because you have to, and don't if you don't have to. Duh.Get a 10 on one EP and then use it as a template and you'll be fine.",
    "Chem 223L is a good lab course. You apply all the principles and techniques you learn in Chem 222L and carry out a different synthesis each week. As such, the course is repetitive and relatively low-stress. The workload is very manageable. While you should avoid the organic chemistry lecture course at all costs, organic chemistry lab is a very enjoyable lab course.",
    "Yes - one of the most organized, solid lab courses at Yale.",
    "Pretty much everyone taking the class is required to take it. It's much more enjoyable than gen chem lab but it's also more work. The lab reports take a lot of time so start them EARLY!",
    "Great lab, one of the most enjoyable. Do not be apprehensive about it!",
    "Excellent!! Dr. DiMeglio is fantastic - she really cares about students and wants to make sure you learn the lab techniques. The TAs are really helpful, too. The later labs build off techniques from earlier ones, so make sure you understand what you're doing. And all the labs build off first semester techniques - I found it helpful to bring last semester's packet to lab in addition to this semester's, just in case I needed to reference a procedure. The best part is that the labs this semester are really applicable - we synthesized aspirin in the final lab!!! Orgo lab is the best lab course offered at Yale.",
    "Much better than gen chem lab. Still very annoying, and I still felt terrible after certain lab days. The labs are typically draining because there are so manyparts to them, but some of the procedures become repetitive, so you know what to do. Still lots of busy work because of the experimental plans, which you have to prepare for each lab, but I like those better than quizzes.",
    "The second semester of Chem lab is much easier than the first. You don't learn too many new techniques so it's mainly just applying the things you learned first semester in a new way.",
    "You're required to take it--take it? It's a fairly fun lab, so go ahead!",
    "Great course! A lot like the first semester lab, but by this point you know the techniques and understand the theory a lot better, so it's more rewarding.",
    "Take it for a requirement.",
    "Most likely you're taking this because you have to. It's not bad, especially after Lab I, but does feel repetitive.",
    "Better than 1st semester because you are familiar with the structure and have a lot of techniques under your belt. This allows you to be more efficient and do actual syntheses and understand and appreciate them.",
    "This is probably the best lab class I've taken so far, which is ironic seeing as the class it is coupled with (organice chemistry) might just be one of the worst. Dr. Dimeglio is super nice as long as you follow instructions and is open to meet with students all the time. Most of the TA's are great, though I would recommend Alex if he is still doing this course. The quality of your TA is really what makes or breaks the course for you. The workload is manageable and does not consist of one lab report a week, making it a gem. I'd definitely reccomend it, I had a great time. Make sure you've got a good TA and good friends in lab and then, even if everything goes wrong and you're there till 4:30, time will still fly by.",
    "Chemistry 223 is an excellent continuing lab course for organic chemistry. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in chemistry. The course teaches a great deal and the TAs and professors make you feel at home in the laboratory. I loved it.",
    "It's much more enjoyable than General Chemistry Lab! :)",
    "It's definitely the best lab I've ever been in - much more enjoyable than General Chemistry!",
    "Basically the same as first semester lab. Procedures are a little longer but you should be faster at things now anyways; you'll keep getting out well before the end of lab. As always, staff was great. High marks required attention to detail but were achievable.",
    "This was a fantastic class with a fantastic professor. Definitely take it concurrently with the lecture class because it helps you understand and solidify a lot of the material learned in lecture.",
    "This was a very fun lab. Most labs ended early and it was a very laid-back and friendly environment. I loved Professor DiMeglio, and the music that was constantly playing was a nice touch. Lab reports and PLs are not due every week so there is not much work.",
    "Sure - it's not too much work (especially if you type your EPs and have a database of chemicals somewhere in old word documents), and even the two lab reports are painless.",
    "if you're premed, you have to take this course; otherwise, don't bother.",
    "I would recommend the course because it reinforces the concepts discussed in lecture. It is a relatively large time commitment, and a lot of the work may seem like busywork at times, but it is worth it. It is also required for Pre-Med and the Chemistry major.",
    "Yeah! It's a good class and is very fun!",
    "It was a great complement to Orgo II. Very enjoyable and educational.",
    "Yes, if you have to, otherwise not.",
    "Chem 223L was ok. The labs themselves were informative and connected well to the class. However, the grading and assignments were the bane of my existence. Try your best to learn how your TA grades, and if possible, try to get the same TA you had last semester. I know all of you care about your grades so give a little more time to this class and its work than you normally might have to ensure that you're all set. Most of you also have to take this class as a requirement, so best of luck. To all the others, if the class is modified, I would recommend it.",
    "Take it! Chem 223L is a great lab course. You get to synthesize a bunch of the skills you learned in first semester and learn new ones while actually synthesizing real compounds like aspirin. You learn a lot, and the chill, relaxed environment of first semester is still present. The only real downside lab-wise is the somewhat tedious lab write-ups and inane deductions, but those are pretty much to be expected after first semester. Luckily, you have to complete very few Lab Notes (LNs) during second semester, so there's not as much busywork.",
    "CHEM 223 was a nice continuation of CHEM 221.",
    "Second semester orgo lab. Nothing special, fairly enjoyable.",
    "Clearly reading this review will not help people make a decision concerning taking this course, but Professor DiMeglio really does a great job making this course fun.",
    "This was a very good lab course compared to others I've taken. It is by far, the most laid back lab course at Yale and there's always good music on while we work. its a very soothing relaxing atmosphere. This course is not stressful at all, except for the 2 or 3 lab reports that you'll write during the course of the semeter. The TA's are nice for the most part and grading is not that picky. As long as you do you work and put in the time, you will be fine. This is a great complement to the orgo lecture course part 2 and should be taken concurrently. It is really fun to do some of the experiments, watching all of the colors change, and actually understanding the reaction mechanism behind what you're actually doing. Altogether if you approach this class with a fun attitude, it will be fun. you can joke around with your TA and your nearby friends and have a really great time in this course. This one's a definite recommended course.",
    "Orgo Lab is fine. it's basically following a set of instructions and hoping to get product in good yield and purity. There are only a few actual lab writeups but EPs are weekly. Not bad at all.",
    "Great lab. Really fun and relaxed. You learn a lot.",
    "Everything you learn in organic will make so much more sense at the end of the semester, which is super helpful for the final.",
    "Orgo Lab II is pretty fun - the labs you do this semester are much more interesting (more syntheses instead of techniques). However, there is a greater chance of you having poor yield. Also, the labs this semester are longer than first semester. In addition, there are more reports and EP's. Make sure to check before hand if the EP's have mechanisms!! (I underestimated how long mechanisms take, and as a result often would not have enough time and lose points). The guidelines for all the assignments are the same as for semester 1 though.In lab, my advice - make sure you rinse the solution in the Buchner funnel with MINIMAL, ICE-COLD WATER. I found that most of my product was lost in the filtration step. Also, in the banana lab - BE CAREFUL WITH THE SEPARATORY FUNNEL. Those instructions aren't just for nothing, since you have to write a report on that lab.I would recommend orgo lab though - seeing the procedures used to synthesize drugs was very interesting. NMR is also a very important type of analysis.",
    "If you are taking the lab it is likely because you are pre-med or a chem major and thus you are required to take it.That being said, the course is fairly demanding but it does a good job of tying in topics from lab into experiments. Make sure to be thorough in your lab reports, as many points are lost because of a lack of attention to small formatting details.",
    "Chemistry 223L is an excellent laboratory course and well suited for the student taking the corresponding lecture course. Assignments can be tedious, but are always manageable. Prof. DiMeglio is very accomodating and puts forth a class that is a perfect buttress to the lecture material. I would recommend this course.",
    "Great lab course. Pretty stress free and manageable. Not too much work. Beware though, the grading can be pretty harsh. But once you understand their expectations and know whattheir looking for on EPs and Post labs it gets much easier.",
    "You have to take it for pre-med and some science major requirements, so it's not a matter of whether I recommend it. Nevertheless, it's not that bad if you're organized enough to keep up with the work and don't let it build up.",
    "The most interesting chemistry lab I've taken at Yale, although it requires a lot of effort."
