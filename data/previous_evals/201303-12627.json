   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is adamant about improving their writing ability. Writing is studied from the perspective of a specific topic, so discussion of writing technique is incorporated into the analysis and critique of published essays and composition related to the topic of interests. My writing has improved so much within the past 8 weeks. I am a more efficient writer, and am more confident in my writing ability.",
    "Topics we discussed were interesting. The amount of work though is sometimes a bit much. Having a paper due every other week along with readings is a lot to deal with.",
    "Yes, take it if you want to learn how to write and think in a more academic manner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I learned a lot and greatly improved as the semester went on. If you're unsure about your writing, this class will help you immensely over the course of the semester.",
    "Ifyou want to improve your writing or learn more about drug policy and addiction, then take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to my fellow students. I would tell them that it possesses a heavy workload, but that it is a very rewarding course.",
    "Well worth taking",
    "I would definitely recommend this particular English 114 class to anyone interested in the topic of \"Drugs, Addiction, and Society,\" first because of the fascinating discussions the class features, second because of Professor Matuozzi's engaging teaching style, and thirdly because this class can seriously help any writer improve provided he or she invests the effort."
