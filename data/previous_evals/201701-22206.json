    "I learned more about recent advances in machine learning and their applications.",
    "This course provides a great overview into the many applications of machine learning, broadly. While general understanding of concepts is very useful, we're exposed to high-level techniques, specifically as applied to biology.",
    "Learned a lot more about Machine Learning and graduate level math.",
    "None",
    "I learned a lot about the various machine learning and data mining techniques as they applied to biomedical data analysis. I also got a chance to further practice my presentation skills.",
    "I learned more about machine learning, and (crucially) not just deep learning. I didn't learn that much biology, but that didn't seem like it was really the point.",
    "Great understanding of machine learning",
    "I learned an incredible amount about a specific topic in machine learning thanks to the research presentation, and got a fantastic overview of the frontiers in machine learning and biology.",
    "It forced me to read papers somewhat related to my research",
    "The course was a very interesting experience in a seminar setup. Many presentations were intriguing and exposed me to a variety of new ideas and trend in deep learning and their applications in several fields."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed us to cover a good range of material. However, the fact that each hour-long talk tried to cover four papers on a pretty advanced topic meant that it could be a struggle following the material for the talks. Getting us to do some form of preparation before each talk and finding ways to keep students engaged during the seminar (instead of just having us mainly listen to the presenter) would certainly help us take more away from it.",
    "Very weak course",
    "The course was interesting for the most part. There were some topics that were less interesting than others. I'd like to see more guest speakers if possible.",
    "Student presentations are good, and usually seemed pretty high quality.",
    "The class required students to pay attention to others' presentations as well as present. That is a strength. No weaknesses could be determined.",
    "Strengths: - Class seminar setup is more interesting than classical lecture setup - The class covered a variety of concepts and trends in Deep Learning The class would be improved if we had the choice to focus on a few (4-5) topics in the final report instead of having to write about almost all presentations."

    "Advanced topics in machine learning tries to cover a wide range of material. Student talks take up most of this seminar, and it can be hard to stay engaged if the presenter is going too quickly on a new topic or if you're not too interested in the topic. Not much work at all, just putting together your presentation and submitting a summary of the talks at the end.",
    "Absolutely, yes! It's a great course. In this course, you will learn a ton about machine learning, and also learn how to give an effective hour-long presentation about a highly technical topic. You'll also have a great time -- there aren't a ton of seminars with a close-knit feel in STEM.",
    "No",
    "Yes, anyone who is interested in ML or data mining should take this if they have time and space",
    "Yeah, if you're interested in machine learning and want to learn more about it--but only if you're cool with learning it mostly from other students in the form of presentations. Having interest in\/experience with biology would definitely improve your engagement.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a surprisingly fantastic course. I learned an enormous amount from my fellow students' lectures, and the exercise of preparing an hour-long presentation on a specific topic in machine learning was an eye-opening exercise, albeit one that intimidated me greatly, that has armed me with confidence to read primary literature in machine learning and computational biology.",
