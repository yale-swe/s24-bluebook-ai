   "comments": [
    "You get to class with lots of cool people. You re-read the assigned readings (in class!) before discussing them. You talk about the readings. You do reporting. You write up really fun pieces, a voice, a structure, and a voice\/structure. SUPER FUN!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in journalism long-term, as it improves your writing immeasurably to read so many great authors and help edit your peers' work.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. keep applying until you get in. it's incredible. absolutely astoundingly wonderful.try to take it in a semester that you're taking 4; be warned, if you want it to, reporting for the three pieces can take up all of your free time and get overwhelming. but it doesn't have to.i took it during a semester where i had 5 classes, no guts or credit d's, and it was overwhelming but manageable.",
    "A fantastic non-fiction writing survey focusing on authorial self-creation (voice) and structure.",
    "A lot of work, but if you're up to careful, frequent reporting and careful, intense revisions, you've got to take it!",
    "Take this class. Take it if you can get in, and if you can't get in, keep trying. Especially keep trying if you don't write for a campus publication, because Strebeigh tends to give weightier consideration to those who make clear their intentions to pursue journalism. It seems like it may be harder to get noticed\/weasle your way into the class if your name isn't attached to the YDN or the Globalist, but onceyou get there--WOW. (And you won't feel \"behind\" everyone else in the class, even if they're all the editors of the this or that. At least, I didn't. Once you're in, everyone is on totally equal footing.)",
    "I thought the major weaknesses of this course were due almost entirely to disorganization. The lack in the TYCO packet of any kind of structure -- chronological, alphabetical, thematic -- made it maddening to find the weekly readings. The assignment due dates were also very hard to figure out at first.The discussions were nearly always great. Fred Strebeigh is a force of nature in the classroom, and even if people aren't especially prepared, he will steer the seminar in the right direction.The work load of this class is a little too high really to get everything you can out of it. It's clear that other members of the class spend no more than 20 minutes reading and commenting on your essays, which is unfortunately necessary when you have to read and comment on 5 pieces for a single class. Professor Strebeigh's comments were a little cryptic -- you might feel like you're teaching yourself to write rather than getting concrete instruction. Also, be prepared for some serious YDNophilia.Take this if your course load isn't too bad and you can get in.",
    "Incredible class. If you get in, you shouldn't think twice about taking it. Professor Strebeigh offers so much help to his students and is such a joy to listen to in class. This is one of those few courses that makes you wish the semester was longer."
