   "comments": [
    "Sure. It's better than not taking a Spanish class for a semester and letting your budding Spanish skills die a little.",
    "Take it with Barbara. She is really nice and a great teacher. The problem with the course is it doesn't really improve your grammar but it can improve your vocab and fluidity in conversation significantly, you just have to apply yourself. Also, while it's not that easy, it really isn't too much work and not too hard to do well.",
    "Spanish 151 is a good class to take to improve your speaking skills, and you won't regret taking it with Sra. Safille. She's tough, but she's always available to help you with whatever issues you have, and she genuinely cares about her students.",
    "SPAN 151 is a fairly easy but fun course to improve your speaking skills. Sometimes the readings are boring or the discussions dry, but there are some fun activities and movies. Barbara Safille is a wonderful professor, and I highly recommend taking this course with her. She is super fun, fiery and cares about the subject. She cares about her students as well though, and does everything she can to make your life easier as long as she thinks you're putting in a good amount of effort.",
    "Essentially you do readings on a certain theme, learn corresponding vocabulary, and use the readings as a jumping-off point for conversations to improve conversational skills. I would recommend it, but more for someone who needs to keep up Spanish skills from high school than learn new Spanish skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to you if you are interested in practicing spanish and don't mind having a class on friday.",
    "I really enjoyed Conversational Spanish with Profesora Safille. For the most part the readings and films were interesting. But the best part of the class was really Profesora. She really wanted us to succeed and learn Spanish, so she would share stories from her life to spark our conversation. My speaking and reading skills have absolutely improved. But my grammar has not benefited similarly because there are few times we focused on grammatical errors. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and learned a good deal.",
    "It's only three days a week and is enjoyable, I would recommend it"
