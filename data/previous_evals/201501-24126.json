    "Not particularly unless you are specifically interested in this subject. I took this course out of a general interest and though I learned some things, overall I don't feel as if I've learned a great deal about the period or the region despite attending almost every lecture and regularly doing the reading. Lectures were a bit dry, but I generally enjoyed the readings.",
    "History of the Mediterranean is a great class that takes a unique, two-sided approach to the material. Super interesting even if you're not a history major, and there's not too much work. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student, History majors and non majors alike. Its construction around a historically essential region, as opposed to any one nation state or ethnicity, is incredibly interesting and enriching.",
    "I would recommend this class to my fellow students. I learned a lot about the time period, and it had a very good reading list. I would recommend that they make sure to put effort into the essays.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student."
