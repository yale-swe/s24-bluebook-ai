   "comments": [
    "Everything about this course was great, with the small exception of the extra lunchtime lectures during the second half of the semester. Staying to see the speaker for an additional hour is great when I have the time, but repeatedly being told that the extra hour was mandatory (when noon is often a time when meetings are scheduled for other groups or with advisors) was a little frustrating.",
    "Great introduction to all aspects of clinical trial development and stats; wonderful integration into real world\/industry.",
    "I learned a lot in regulatory affairs. It's a great course and I think one of my favorites at YSPH. The text book is great!",
    "The course provides a strong overview of regulatory affairs, and Professor Makuch brings a lot of expertise and personal experience in the course. I was particularly happy to hear from other guest lecturers from diverse backgrounds (pharma, law, FDA)",
    "This was an amazing class - gave the opportunity to learn the basics about the FDA and regulatory approval for new drugs and biologics. Not to mention that half of the class is driven by speakers from all parts of the regulatory environment both domestic and global. Keep it just the way it is!",
    "Overall, I think this course is fantastic. The material, while not covered in class all the time, was sufficiently covered in the textbook and in the professor's slides. Where the value is in this course is with the professor himself. His stories and knowledge of the industry is an endless resource for students interested in the field, and anyone considering a reg affairs path should take this course. Perhaps the course could be a bit more focused on figuring out what students should ultimately walk away from in the course, as it felt a little too broad and unfocused at times.",
    "Great overview of regulatory environment and much-needed topic for public health students",
    "the speaker series is good.",
    "The first half of the course was slightly slow, very anecdote-heavy, but not super engaging. The speaker series was awesome and worth taking the class for.",
    "None",
    "I think the speakers were interesting. They had a lot of good \"real world\" anecdotes.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures and the visiting speakers were great. I learned a lot of things I never would have learned from a book.",
    "Easy class, cool guest lecturers",
    "Class textbook is unreasonably expensive, students don't learn much reg. beyond the FDA, which is a bit misleading.",
    "Great speakers and lectures",
    "The array of guest lecturer invite by Professor Makuch were amazing! Without this class, we would not have the access to professionals in the regulatory sphere. I would appreciate it if we could go through the material in a more logical manner that follows the book\/readings assigned.",
    "The strength is that the professor knows the material inside out. The weakness is that there is no engaged learning. Our homework is to read from a very dry textbook and answer questions that can be easily found by skimming the pages. The homework doesn't support our learning or motivate critical thinking. Also, the professor doesn't help the students integrate the massive amount of information into a timeline or system. He just talks at. The TA could be useful here but she is a waste of space. She doesn't provide timely feedback for the homework or hold study sessions. The course could be easily improved by changing the content and the TA.",
    "It was a fun course.",
    "The seminars are very helpful that the professor invited professionals in the regulatory affairs field.",
    "Guest lecturers were very good, but given other course commitments it is not feasible to change the required hours of the course lectures midway through the term."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Fantastic professor, tons of knowledge on the subjects, but sometimes easily distracted from the material. I don't think this is a problem because the stories were the true value of the course, but there were times where I didn't feel like I completely understood the material.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Good.",

   "comments": [
    "The course and material is very dry, but the class itself does not come with a huge workload. I wouldn't recommend it to another student unless they had to take it or had extra space in their schedule to take it, because there are better\/more interesting classes to take.",
    "Overall, a great course to take if interested in FDA positions or knowledge. Very interdisciplinary perspective of regulatory affairs, from biotech to stats to law to policy.",

    "Hidden gem at YSPH - take it!!",

The course provides an excellent overview of reg affairs, and the professor works hard to ensure you have both knowledge of the concepts as well as knowledge of what really goes on within the US government and its regulation of the pharma industry.",

    "This is an interesting introduction to regulatory affairs. I'm more interested in regulatory affairs after taking this course.",

    "As long as you know where the content is in the book, you'll pass the course.",
    "Probably would be easier with some background knowledge, but was a fun course.",
    "A nice introduction to regulatory affairs and new drug development processes."
