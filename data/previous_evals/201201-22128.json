   "comments": [
    "Heat transfer with Dr. P is a great course. I would highly recommend all of his classes to anyone who wants to gain a strong conceptual understanding of the material. Meet with him to discuss assignments and projects.",
    "Well, if you're looking at this, you probably have to take it. The material is really applicable, not just to engineering problems, but to everything around you. The key to enjoying this course and doing well is to have a good attitude about Kailas. You MUST like him and not have an attitude about his required section or his sometimes absurd methods. He's a quirky guy but all he wants is for you to learn! Get started on the final project early, too....",
    "This course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. The information can be somewhat dry, however, the final project at the end of the semester (modeling a Stirling engine) can be quite fun. The professor is also very helpful and is always willing to meet with you if you have questions. Nevertheless, you should be warned that the homework can take a ton of time and thatsection is pretty much mandatory.",
    "ABETs have to take it, but maybe you might consider if you are interested in learning more about conduction, convection, and radiation beyond high school physics. This course was a very good overview of heat transfer concepts and was also a good review of some fluid mechanics. Prof. P is very dedicated and puts a lot of time into teaching, which is really appreciated. The final project is work (especially if you leave it till the end) and overall the class workload is large, but I thought it was manageable as long as you stayed on top of everything.",
    "Useful to know and understand and fairly well taught once you get used to the professor. Problem sets are quite long and tedious, however, and the final project is long, annoying, and feels unnecessary."
