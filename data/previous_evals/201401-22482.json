    "Yes.",
    "SS II provides an extension of the topics covered in Solid State I and explores additional topics including corrections to the relaxation time and independent electron approximations, magnetism, and superconductivity. I would highly recommend this class to any physicist.",
    "Of course I will recommend, especially to students who will be working with the electronic properties of solids. SS2 is one of the most basic but important courses for any student studying the applied side of physics."

    "These are very important and basic physics.",
    "Although many of the topics covered in this course are not immediately relevant to my current research, they may be in the future, and are also important for developing a comprehensive knowledge of physics as a whole. Insights gained from this class will definitely inform my research.",
    "Generally speaking, I need all the knowledge from this course to call myself a applied physicist. The electron-electron interaction, superconductivity, BCS theory, etc, are all basics one definitely needs to know."
