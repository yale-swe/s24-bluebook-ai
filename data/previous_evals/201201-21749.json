   "comments": [
    "A sociology course focused on the Middle East, I couldn't tell you what the main take away from the course was. Vague, unfocused, not sure what it is supposed to be.",
    "A survey course on the different Islamic social movements around the world. Great for understanding that part of the world, gives you a new perspective!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot, and I think this is a topic that everyone should have some knowledge of.",
    "Great class. Best MMES seminar I've taken thus far, and Professor Wyrtzen did a great job leading the class. We managed to discuss these groups in a sociological framework without getting to the point where we split hairs. I took this to learn about different terrorist groups, and I think I came away with a better understanding of how and why they operate, as well as what many other groups in the region do. If you're looking for an MMES class that is actually modern, this may be your best option.",
    "Islamic Social Movements provides a brief glimpse--through the lens of social movement theory--of prominent (predominantly Middle Eastern) social movements that operate within an Islamic framework. I recommend this class if you have a background in Middle Eastern or Islamic studies. As someone who knew very little about Islamic activism before entering the class, I found that discussions were difficult as they were completely dominated by students already versed in the subject area.",
    "This course is an analysis of the major social movements in the Middle East, starting from the Muslim Brotherhood moving all the way through the current state of Al Qaeda. Students analyze these social movements through the sociological lenses presented in the first few classes.",
    "This class is very interesting. We started of by studying social movement theory and then went into case studies as disparate as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Iranian Revolution, the Afghan Taliban, and the G\u00fclen movement in Turkey. It's hard to deal with the multiplicity of the topic effectively, and sometimes our critical lens slipped and we wound up talking about international security policy instead of about the sociology of these movements. Be on guard for that. Still, I would recommend this class to people interested in some background on and insight into what is too often described as monolithic \"Islamism\".",
    "Definitely take this if you get in - A great, informative, and interesting course with a fantastic professor.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. Take it even if you don't have an extensive background in Middle Eastern Studies. The class is really centered on the key themes at the beginning of the semester, and you have to reference those themes in your final paper on a topic of your choice. Besides the reading responses and the midterm, the class was extremely manageable.",
    "Great class. If you want to learn a lot about the middle east and important movements. The readings were great and manageable. Pretty mid level class in terms of work load.",
    "Perhaps - it was a good introduction to islamic social movements, but discussions during class weren't particularly engaging or interesting...",
    "Islamic Social Movements covers a different movement each week, placing great emphasis on the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda. Each discussion uses social movement theory as a lens. For example, how did the Muslim Brotherhood succeed through resource mobilization, framing, violence\/contention, and opportunities\/constraints? While this approach was too broad and theoretical for me as a history major, others may enjoy it. Professor Wyrtzen is very knowledgeable on the subject, and you will benefit from his personal experience in North Africa. However, beware the students in the class! My peers loved making generalized, inappropriate comments on Islam, and Professor Wyrtzen did not focus (or quell) their thoughts. This made the class very frustrating--although you could have a different experience with a different group.",
    "This is a very thorough class that gives you a strong foundation in social movement theory before tackling specific Islamic movements. Prof. Wyrtzen does a good job balancing between guided discussions and mini-lectures. Very relevant material, good prof. Take it!",
    "MMES 291 looks at many different Islamic Social Movements - from the typical (MB, al-Qaeda) to less well known ones (Gulen, TJ). Very important, enjoyable, and interesting material! Looking at this material through the lenses of Sociology is very different than a Pol Sci analysis though so dont assume that the seminar will run the same way a Pol Sci one would. The final paper is relatively short (~12-15pgs) on a topic of your choosing - open ended but that means you can make it interesting for you!",
    "While some of the weeks are very reading-intensive, this course is definitely worth taking. Professor Wyrtzen is wonderful and the material is interesting even for non MMES or Sociology majors.",
    "A solid course. Covers major players in ISM history: Qutb, Iran, Muslim Brotherhood, Gulen movemnt, etc.Recommended for anyone with any sort of interest in better understanding a major phenomenon in Middle East history and contemporary politics.Midterm 5 pgsFinal 10-12 pgsReading fair and interestingDon't take it if more than 18 people are enrolled. There will be too much you'll want to say and not enough time to say it."
