    "Intro to Bio Anthro is a real treat. It is one of the most informative and fascinating courses that I have taken thus far. Viewing the Human Race as a species is a remarkable perspective which reveals so much about who we are and what we come from. I feel like I have actually learned so much in this class. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in figuring out that curious, strange, and downright fascinating species we lovingly call Homo sapiens.",
    "You only get 36 classes at Yale: don't make this one of them. Humanities majors looking for that science credit, find something else. Not only was this class boring, it was way less applicable than I hoped it would be. I regret not dropping this class.",
    "Great science for the not so science-inclined. Prof Watts is great and very fair with the course.",
    "I would recommend this class for people who are genuinely interested in fossils and ancient primate species, but not to someone who just wants to get rid of their science distributional requirement.",
    "I would recommend this class for humanities majors who need SC credits.",
    "Kind of boring but not too difficult. I went in expecting it to be an easy science, but actually found myself really liking it, especially near the end. the first part of the course is more sciencey, but it gets interesting once we talk more about modern humans.",
    "Bio Anthro is a good science credit. The material is interesting, especially the second half which is more relevant to modern humans. Professor Watts is a great professor and makes himself very available to students. There are weekly PSETs that do take a bit of time but they help prepare you for the exams.",
    "If you want to learn about humans, do not take this class. Less than 2\/3 of it is about humans. The majority of the class is about monkeys, etc. I took this because I thought I would learn about the origins of humanity and how our biology affects our lives, but from this class I realize that these things can be very dry. You'll get more out of the class if you go to lecture, so take this if you can stand boring lectures (I cannot. I always fall asleep, so I ended up never going). Nice professor and discussion sections are OK. Not difficult at all, but it's not a gut. Beware of the second mid-term. OK class.",
    "A very informative, straightforward survey course. Not too hard -- a lot of the material is actually pretty intuitive, so as long as you pay attention during lecture, come to section, and go over your notes before the tests, you shouldn't have a lot of trouble. The midterms are pretty fair, and the problem sets aren't super difficult or extra; in fact, they're really useful studying tools. Definitely a good science credit for humanities majors, but also just a good science credit for humans, because it offers a very different and enriching perspective of our societies and behaviors that you don't really get from the other social sciences. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend it, but just know that the tests are extremely detailed. and he throws in multiple choice, but its the hard kind where you have three options and the forth is -all of the above, or -none of the above, or -a and b only - so its kinda hard.",
    "Absolutely take it! Not the easiest class ever, but very rewarding and fun!",
    "It is a great course, especially for a non-science student. Although the first lecture may seem dry....STICK WITH IT! It is a great course. Go to lecturer- it helps a lot in trying to understand certain concepts.",
    "Very satisfied with this course!",
    "This class is worth taking. It is a moderately easy science credit that opens doors to anthropology classes similar to it. It is a cool topic. Just remember that it certainly will not be the funnest class you ever take.",
    "It was okay. I would recommend this class to an anthropology major who needs an intro course in bio anthro. There might be more interesting science credits out there, if that's all you're looking for. It wasn't extremely difficult, but could get boring. Be prepared to hear a lot about monkeys. A lot. Your TF can make the class much better, as mine did. Psets about once a week (varied), two midterms, and a final.",
    "A pretty interesting science class that you will likely take if you are not majoring in science.",
    "a pretty good science class, not one of my favorites but a decent course. however, the material is actually super-interesting and useful, just buried in a lot of monotonous (but necessary) information. during the second third of the semester, there's a lot of minute changes in anatomy between species covered that i didn't find particularly engaging. labs are short, fun, and interesting (you get to work with real ancient hominin and primate fossils!) and the TFs put a lot of work into making them worth your time. i would recommend it if you need a science credit or if you're really interested in anthropology\/archaeology\/anatomy (i have a friend who LOVES anatomy and like actively reads about it, didn't know it was possible)",
    "An introductory survey course on the evolution of primates and humans. Lectures can get be dry, but Professor Watts is kind and is really passionate about what he's teaching--it's a pleasure to learn from him. He and the TAs put together some really great sections--for most of them, we got to handle real fossils and plaster casts of primate and human bones. Exams and problem sets are fair, and easy to do well on if you study. The class spends more time on primates than on humans. The class made me think about diets, infant rearing, species, mate selection, etc. in new ways.",
    "ANTH 116 01 is a good introduction to biological anthropology. It starts with a more biological approach and then goes on with a study of different monkeys, apes, homes and ends with a study of human behavior. I would recommend it for someone who is an anthropology major and is ready to memorize a lot for each exam.",
    "I would recommend this class for an interesting and easy science credit.",
    "I took ANTH 116 to fulfill my science requirement. It was an easy science credit that provided an interesting overview of human evolution. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great course. The majority of the class is taking it for a science credit, but if you are an anthropology major you will not be bored. The lectures are very up-to-date especially in the area of genetics research, and the topics all extremely interesting. The material starts with the principles of evolution, covers an overview of modern primates and the history of human evolution, and finishes with topics pertaining to modern human biology\/anthropology. Professor Watts is a great lecturer and very nice, and the opportunity to handle bones in the lab is cool. There are several psets, a very minimal weekly workload, and two exams which are very straightforward if you've been keeping up. A really enjoyable class!",
    "Excellent introduction to the material and both the professor and TA are super knowledgeable and excited to teach. Not too much homework although since there was no schedule for the problem sets, they sometimes would appear randomly or would be closely packed together. The class is more geared towards non-science majors so is slightly simpler than most intro science classes, but overall a good way to get a basic understanding of the concepts presented.",
    "I initially just took this course for a science credit, but I ended up extremely pleased with this course! I am not a science person in any respects, so I was nervous about taking a Science credit at Yale. However, I was extremely pleased to find that this class was very accessible to non-science majors while still being a meaty, interesting class that was worth my time. The material is a lot and detailed, but certainly manageable by any terms. Professor Watts is a really nice guy and holds review sessions that he holds help guide your study of the concepts. In fact, it was not even that hard for a non-science major to get excited about studying. The material is really interesting, and I really liked learning about something that I knew absolutely nothing about - apes, primates, and evolution. It's also meaningful information to be able to know about the human race in which we all belong. How did we as humans get to where we are now? How do scientists go about exploring these mysteries? It's very much a puzzle in which we do not have a lot of the pieces, so it is fascinating to be able to watch biological anthropologists try to piece it together. The workload is not much either - you do need to study for the tests a good deal, but they are reasonable, and there are 8 problem sets based on concepts learned in class and lab. Lab is mainly looking at fossils and learning how to take detailed and observant notes. You can mostly do this in groups, which is great. Also the labs are only an hour long, which is fabulous for non-science majors. Lastly, this course is also really not numbers heavy either - it is focused mainly on concepts."
