   "comments": [
    "That Math120 was a waste of my time.",
    "I have definitely gained a lot of skill about engineering related maths. It helped me understand more about the application side of calculus rather than just the theoretical side.",
    "Taking this course with Professor Bennett was an absolute pleasure. She is a fabulous teacher and really taught the fundamental concepts and applications of multivariable calculus quite well. If anything, I think that the last chapter was a little rushed. However, the class was very fair and very well created. I loved the exam structure (4 exams) and the lecture structure.",
    "You learn everything you need to know in multi, but in a MUCH better pace compared to MATH120. I've learned so much about vectors, planes, integrals (double and triple). Not sure what I'll use it for in the future, but I enjoyed this class so much!",
    "I learned how to apply multi variable calculus skills to real life situations.",
    "Multivarable calculus, vector calculus, vectors and 3 space, partial differentiation, up through divergence theorem and stokes theorem.",
    "Great overview of everything in multi variable calculus. From what it seems, it is a great alternative to math 120. You learn just as much but at a slower pace. The tests may have been easier but the psets were very long and hard.",
    "I learned how to think in a multi-variable calculus kind of way, by breaking it down into single variable and then synthesizing it and being able to apply it.",
    "Very good course on general 3-space geometry, surface and line integrals, vectors and vector calculus, and, of course, multivariable calculus.",
    "I now knpw hpw to calcuate volumes and ares in three dimensions and to used Gauss, and Stokes theorem to calculate the work done by a moving force either in fluids or mechanics. Also if you want to learn to apply math in solving physics problems this a course for you.",
    "In addition to learning a lot of math, I developed ways to visualize and think about abstract topics from the professor's demonstrations.",
    "You will learn multivariable calculus with an emphasis on applications to engineering.",
    "I learned how to use multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned how to think in 3D, which sounds silly--but is the first time I have ever been asked to do that. This is also the first math class I have ever taken in which no one dares even ask \"when will I use this in real life?\" because all of it is so applicable to engineering and life in general. The psets were worth a lot so I learned to spend a lot of time making them perfect and then getting together every week with my friends to check them over--so I learned a lot about collaborating and discussing differences.",
    "I learned multivariable calculus and how it could be applied.",
    "It was an incredible and challenging course. Professor Bennett was great and really helped us understand when we had to visualize things in 3-dimensions. The lecture notes were really helpful, the homework was well selected and the system of 4 midterms and no final helped the course go smoothly. It was a better experience than I had previously with Math 115."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Fair grading of Psets, Simple Exams, Four Exam Structure for Course with best scores weighted higher, Weakness: Dry lectures, Unhelpful TA's. Though I can't keep citing her for everything, I feel like Office Hour sessions such as those ran by Steinacker in the Physics Department are absolutely wonderful and I feel a course like ENAS 151 would benefit tremendously from this Study Hall\/Office Hours Combination. And with an individual like Professor Bennett, I think this model would be the ABSOLUTE best thing for the course.",
    "Professor Bennett is amazing. The only problem with the course is that there are a lot of psets and they take up a lot of time and sometimes the exam material is not in proportion with in class material.",
    "This is a fantastic class to take and far better than Math 120. It is amazing to see how the mathematical concepts are applied as opposed to dealing with proofs. But the number one strength of this class was Beth Anne Bennett. She is an amazing professor who cares about her students and cares about transmitting the information in truly the most understandable way.",
    "The course was very well taught and structured, however I think more time should have been given to the last chapter of the book. It was a little bit rushed, and thus the final test was a little rough.",
    "Strength: FANTASTIC PROFESSOR. If Bennett is teaching, then this class is amazing! I hear the first semester ENAS151 is a joke, but not with her! In class she is very detailed in her examples, and does everything she can to make the content more digestible. She also takes time to get to know her students too. She makes herself available during office hours and goes over anything else you didn't understand. Also AMAZING TA's too. DJ was one of the TA's and if you are lucky enough for him to be a TA, you're set for this class. He once stayed for over 30 minutes past his scheduled time to help us on a really difficult pset. Just goes to show there are very caring people in this math department. In terms of grading, you have a much better chance of getting a good grade in this class because of its setup. Psets together make up 30% (!!) of your final grade, so good grade boost there. No final exam truly, just 4 \"midterms\" and your best 2 count 20% and your other 2 count for 15% of your final grade. Definitely better than MATH120 where if you mess up on one midterm you're unfortunately at a bad place for improving your grade. Weaknesses: You have psets due every week (even exam weeks). Unfortunate, but totally doable. At first, the first pset due on exam week was monstrously long, but Bennett listened to our feedback and after that, she goes easier on us with psets during exam week. After that, no real weaknesses.",
    "The lectures in this course follow the book very directly. The example problems in the lecture are always very easy compared to the ones encountered in the homework or exams. Showing tougher problems in lecture might be more helpful. This course also didn't have review sessions for the exams like many stem classes which made getting ready for the exams very difficult. Towards the end of the semester, the exam problems were much more difficult than the homework problems which made the tests challenging since we only had the homework problems as practice.",
    "This course goes too fast. It is more important to learn the material well than it is to learn a lot of material. I liked that it was not very theoretical.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the professor. Professor Beth Anne Bennett is amazing; she is extremely clear, she plans her lectures very well, knows how to answer questions, her lectures are super easy to follow if you just pay attention. Biggest weakness of the course is that a lot of times you do things without really knowing what you are doing. I realize that the course is designed to be that way as an alternative to Math 120, but I still think that a little more background and understanding might be helpful, rather than just learning which formulas to use where.",
    "The only weakness of this course was the enormous amount of material that had to be taught in only 14 weeks.",
    "I really liked the focus on psets. However, the questions were very algebra oriented. The problems with the questions came mostly from doing the calculations as opposed to the multi variable calculus and it was annoying when this consumed most of the time spent on them.",
    "This course was GREAT! I honestly was really dreading this course because of what so many friends had said about Math 120, but I ended up really enjoying it! Professor Bennett is AMAZING! Only improvement I would make is that the tail end of the semester was really fast and all the material (which was the hardest) was smushed into the last couple of classes. Also, the tests were pretty wishy-washy: some were incredibly simple, some were way too hard or long. However, it was Professor Bennett's first time teaching the course, so I think she could definitely improve on these flaws with now that she has a semester of experience with this material.",
    "This course was well organized, the lecture notes were pretty helpful and the professor knew all of her students even if the number of students was very high.",
    "Honestly was very good. Not many ways it can be improved. Perhaps some of the exams could be made a little more similar in difficulty to the homework but overall I very much enjoyed this class. Best math class I've ever taken",
    "This was an awesome class. Prof. Bennett is amazing, the material was fairly interesting, and I really learned a lot.",
    "The course was designed well. However, sometimes the homework during the week of the exam was difficult to fit in with the work from other classes and the extra time spent studying.",
    "In general I think this course is much much much better than Math 120 because we go at a slower pace and have four 1.5 hr long exams as opposed to 3 shorter exams. The textbook we use is also very good and I really learned a lot from it. If I ever missed class, Professor Bennett would supply lecture notes, which was insanely helpful. My one complaint would be some of the psets were extremely time consuming; however, I feel as though I learned so much from them so I do think the difficulty was not senseless.",
    "I think the course was very well taught and the concepts explained effectively."

   "comments": [
    "Better than Math 120, actually 1000000000000 times better. CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. Doable exams. Workable PSETS. Not lost in the muddle of 120. As long as with BENNETT.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who is considering majoring in engineering",
    "Absolutely. If a friend was choosing to take this or MATH 120, I would tell them to take this course 100%.",
    "Yes! If you have to take multivariable calculus take ENAS 151!",
    "This was a good multi-variable calculus course. It focused on the applications and uses of concepts instead of the origins and proofs, which made for a much more interesting class. Professor Bennett is a fairly dry lecturer but she is great at explaining ideas and is extremely capable of teaching the concepts and answering deeper questions when asked. I have not taken Math 120 but based on what I have heard from classmates, this is a far better course.",
    "Only if you have to. But Dr Bennett is amazing",
    "Take this class over MATH120. Best decision of my life and I shopped both! Granted, I'm sure if you got Miki in MATH120 then I can understand (maybe) why you chose MATH120, but overall I am so happy to have chosen ENAS151. Anyone who just needs a math credit (e.g. premeds) and placed into multi can digest this class very well. Don't worry that it's an ENAS course because it's truly just multi and no physics application (except for 1-2 problems on a pset).",
    "I would recommend this course to mechanical engineering majors",
    "If you are choosing between this course and Math 120, I would recommend this one, but really only if it is taught by Professor Bennett. Professor Bennett is amazing; her lectures are so clear that I almost never got lost. The only caveat is that if you are someone who likes to see proofs and why things work then maybe this class isn't for you. However, I found that as a second semester freshman engineering major, I had so many other hard classes to worry about that it was nice to take a slightly easier ENAS 151 rather than math 120.",
    "The psets are real long but Professor Bennett is honestly great - both in that she possesses the rare skill of actually being able to explain mathematical concepts really clearly, and in that shes really understanding and nice. If youre taking this course, I would highly recommend doing it with her if you can. The material is also pretty cool, its just a really fast paced course. One thing that did annoy me was how as the course got further and further along, the material got more and more complicated and the examples in class would be less and less completelike she would show us how to set up problems and then not solve them out, even if the next steps were actually not that intuitive. But this is more of a problem with there being too much material for the class time.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you get Dr. Bennet. She is an amazing professor, and you will learn just as much as in math 120 but at a slower pace and with a more forgiving curve.",
    "YES, Professor Bennett is an excellent teacher and the lecture notes are incredibly helpful. The timing of topics in relation to MATH 120 is slightly different, but in this course, it focuses more on applications, rather than proofs. I personally think the grading system is more forgiving than MATH 120 (30% p-sets, 20% each for two highest exams, 15% each for two lowest exams).",
    "YES! I definitely recommend you take this class! I would recommend it over Math 120 if Professor Bennett is teaching. Although I (obviously) didn't take 120, what I've heard from friends who did is that 1) having grad students teaching the classes was NOT helpful at all and 2) the course moved way too fast (despite having almost exactly the same material as ENAS151). Content wise, ENAS151 is probably no easier than Math 120, but at least if Professor Bennett is teaching the course, you will come away with a much deeper understand of the math.",
    "Yes, if you have a good professor such as Professor Beth. Please try to do the p-sets ahead of time since they take an enormous amount of time. Also read for class if you can, the lecture will be much more helpful that way. Office hours are also very useful if you have questions. The material can be hard, but if you put in every effort, you will learn a lot in this class.",
    "Absolutely. Great Course.",
    "Multivariable is a hard class, and this is a hard class as well. There is lots of work, but it's a super fun class that's well taught. Prof. Bennett is a really good professor.",
    "Before ENAS 151, I really hated math. Not only did I hate math--I feared it. However, I knew I would have to just get through it because I wanted to be an engineering. Surprisingly, I LOVED THIS CLASS. I found it much more intuitive than calc 1 and 2, and I actually felt as though there was a purpose to everything we learned. Did I crush every exam? No. The last two were pretty tricky. But whatever grade I get, I now finally love math and see its beauty. In my opinion, a fair trade.",
    "Yes, you will actually learn the concepts.",
    "This is an excellent course and is a much better alternative to Math 120.",
    "Yes, especially if Dr. Bennett is teaching it. The course is Math120 without the proofs and with practical applications.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for any student that wants to learn multivariable calculus and is trying to decide between Math 120 and Enas 151. The grading system is good and I feel the 4 midterms method helps us learn more (since we are continuously being tested)."
