    "This was a really intersting class. There is a lot of reading assigned and while you can get away without doing it all, it's much more helpful to do as much of it as you can. You won't get called out for not doing it but you also won't get much out of the class if you don't do it. Wargo is a great guy and classes were enjoyable.",
    "Take the class if you want a broad sweep of the current energy\/environ issues. The class is different each week- group presentations, field trips, speakers- which make it a lot of fun. Finally, the topic for the research paper is so broad, that you can basically write about whatever you want.",
    "Most a course focused on the final paper with great lectures and a few group projects.",
    "In many ways it's a continuation of Wargo's spring term lecture. I took both and am glad I did; this seminar afforded me the opportunity to delve deeper into some of the more interesting topics of the spring term lecture.Juniors, a word of advice: take this course with an eye tilted toward your senior essay. Keep a list of questions you find yourself asking about the material you read during the course. What's interesting to you? What would you like to know more about? What areas are poorly understood? This list should help you find an idea that is both interesting and important.",
    "Yes--it is interesting and not too hard and gives a good overview of the various issues with energy and policy that we are facing today.",
    "Take this class if you care about the subject material.",
    "Only if you're going to use it for your major or as an elective.",
    "This class taught me a lot about a wide range of issues, from green building to coastal development to wind energy. The class does not really follow the syllabus, and discussions seemed to lack energy sometimes. The issues are very interesting and worth learning, though, and Professor Wargo is very knowledgeable.",
    "Solid overview of environmental regulatory issues. Wargo's a good professor, you should enjoy the class.",
    "Good class to go in depth with the issues listed on the syllabus, not too heavy of a workload throughout the year, but the final paper is pretty long and boring to write if you aren't careful about picking a topic. Wargo will allow you to chose pretty much anything, so just pick something interesting."
