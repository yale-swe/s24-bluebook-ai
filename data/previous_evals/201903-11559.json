    "This course dives deeper into the classical interpretation of mechanics and physics. Key takeaways for me were applying differential equations to physics problems, Lagrangian mechanics, orbits, collisions, special relativity, and thermodynamics.",
    "I learned a variety of topics in classical physics. A lot of focus was given to Lagrangian Mechanics and Harmonic Motion",
    "The course covered oscillations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, central forces, special relativity, and a bit of thermodynamics. There was a strong emphasis on problem solving techniques for Lagrangians and oscillations that helped me a lot.",
    "I did of course learn physics, but more importantly I learned how in general to approach physics-related problems. Also, we went over some theory that I'd never seen before, like Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.",
    "I gained a deep and rigorous expansion to my understanding of classical mechanics and an introduction to the principles of thermodynamics.",
    "Covers most of advanced classical mechanics, skipping rigid body rotation, as well as basic thermodynamics.",
    "This course goes further into many of the concepts from intro physics classes. You develop skills manipulating formulas and understanding physical phenomena",
    "I learned an extraordinary amount not just about classical mechanics and thermodynamics but how to approach and think through problems, especially in the sense of knowing when you can break the rules and approximate.",
    "Learned about advanced classical mechanics : Lagrangians and hamiltonians. And special relativity and thermodynamics",
    "An overview of classical mechanics, covering Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics, along with Special Relativity and a brief introduction to Thermodynamics.",
    "We learned a lot of advanced skills in classical mechanics and were able to start getting into some of thermodynamics.",
    "Techniques for solving mechanics problems such as Lagrangians and Hamiltonians.",
    "I learned a lot about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and a bit about other topics (special relativity, thermodynamics, force laws)",
    "This course was largely an introduction to advanced classical mechanics. We covered harmonic oscillators, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, central forces, collisions, and special relativity. At the end, we did a little bit of thermodynamics too.",
    "A great overview of several approaches to classical mechanics, as well as a rapid-fire introduction to both special relativity and thermodynamics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The problem sets allowed us to further our understanding of the materials covered in lecture, in a way as good as, if not better than, other classes I've taken at Yale. Additionally, I was able to \"teach\" what I had learned through the two papers. The papers were extremely consuming, however, and the due date of the second one cause it to take presence over studying for the final.",
    "strengths - Nikhil, Naim, the support weaknesses - the physics papers",
    "Prof P is definitely the strongest part of this course. Even when the content is difficult he keeps the class engaged. The material covered is also very interesting especially Lagrangian Mechanics",
    "Nikhil is an excellent teacher. He explains concepts thoroughly and really goes through the methods used for each type of problem. I had already seen most of the oscillations we covered in Physics 260, but Nikhil taught them so well that it felt like I was seeing them for the first time. I achieved a much higher level of understanding thanks to his lectures. The problem sets were a very reasonable length and a good difficulty compared to exams.",
    "This was a great course! Well-paced, well-presented, and overall one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. No complaints here.",
    "I found this course very well-organized and well-taught. Nikhil was always prepared for lecture, enthusiastic about the material, prompt and effective in answering the many clarifying questions that he fielded, receptive to providing feedback via email and setting up times to meet outside of class -- and humorous on top of everything else. Some areas of the content were more engaging than others, but they all will obviously be useful for further study of physics. There were no explicit weaknesses to the course itself or the material it covered. The course was quite challenging, however, and while there were certainly some students who excelled, I don't think I was the only one who found it as such. Most of all, I wish there had been more resources to rely upon for practicing the concepts that were most essential and most pertinent to the exams. Nikhil did an excellent job providing us with review sessions around exam time, but I would have appreciated additional practice exams or, most crucially perhaps, practice exams that actually reflected the length and complexity of the actual exams. I freely admit that I was underprepared for the midterm. But I was feeling quite good and confident going into the final, not under the impression that I would earn a perfect score, but confident in my ability to handle problems of each type that would be on the test swiftly and without much struggle. Ultimately, I did not even finish the exam and found it, much like the midterm, a vastly different test from the practice exams we were provided. I understand that perhaps this is the point of exams, to test students in applying the skills they have learned to new tweaks on old types of problems. But in the case of both exams, I felt that Nikhil vastly overestimated the class' ability to quickly complete problems of the difficulty he chose to assign. I expected problems that were collectively more straightforward that homework questions; what I found instead were four- and five-part questions, some of which with variations on certain topics that we had never once practiced or encountered and others that did not reflect the application of a particular topic that we had concentrated on. I walked out of the exam with the sunken feeling that I prepared well and that it had still turned out to be useless. Though I'm sure that I can improve my preparation, I feel that any course which leaves an earnest and diligent student feeling this way after the final exam has a weakness in the way it is structured or taught.",
    "This is an excellent class - you will learn a lot of physics and math very quickly with an awesome instructor. The problem sets will force you to learn the material and are very satisfying.",
    "The class was very well taught with very interesting lectures. The homework was a very reasonable workload and the class also offers several office hours and study halls for help.",
    "It was a great course; I felt that we covered a lot of material but not at an overly hectic pace. Sometimes it might have been helpful to have concepts explained to me one more time, but I guess that's what office hours are for. My one complaint might be that for some of the problems on the homework it seemed impossible to know how to approach the problem on your ownyou wouldn't know where to start before going to office hours.",
    "Great class learned a lot would recommend",
    "Nikhil was the driving force of the course! He came every day with such enthusiasm and gave such clear explanations that it made class a joy to attend and the material very engaging. He also offered more than enough support and helped is through the class.",
    "The course started off great but fell apart a little in the last few weeks. I understand that our schedule got crunched but we were receiving less feed back the last few weeks and we had an unreasonable amount of work for one class to have during reading week when that is our study time for exams and time to do final projects.",
    "Strengths: Allows some notes for exams (good for studying and helpful on tests). Office hours were helpful (but emails were not). Exams were fair. Review sessions were helpful. Weaknesses: The textbook is written confusingly. Most homework problems were very hard and time-consuming.",
    "This was a strong course overall. I liked the balance of proofs and application\/example problems. However, I felt like the topics in the second half of the course were a bit rushed, particularly the thermodynamics section. I also really didn't appreciate that we were expected to do a problem set and a project during thanksgiving break, and we were expected to do a problem set during reading week. These are times that are specifically set aside for students to spend time with family and to study for exams. Particularly over thanksgiving break, the amount of work I had really took away from my ability to spend time with family.",
    "The strength of this course was the amount of attention paid to students' learning experience. Concepts were explained clearly, there was ample help for homeworks and tests, etc. The only weakness I can think of is that at the very end of the semester we had three major assignments due in a matter of days and it got to be a little bit too much.",
    "Prof. P. is a phenomenal lecturer, and I always felt like I walked out of class understanding something better than when I walked in. However, things felt pretty fast at the end of the semester and it wasn't easy to keep up. Usually, problem sets were very useful in helping develop a greater understanding of the material, but every so often, there was a question or two that felt completely out of left field and irrelevant. Ultimately, the class was really well taught, but suffered sometimes from organizational hiccups."

    "Yes! If you do decide to take this course, make a study group!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who likes physics.",
    "Absolutely. This was the best taught physics class I have taken so far at Yale. Nikhil is an excellent teacher and the course covers pretty much all the bases between its two semesters.",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in physics, this is the course to take. An in-depth and well-exposited tour of physics, without being too much of a time sink. Also, it's just a good time. Very highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who are either very interested in classical mechanics (and have the appropriate mathematical and theoretical background) or who are required to take it. The depth of the material, mostly in terms of its terminology and applicability, makes the course quite challenging.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in diving deep into classical physics. Professor Padmanabhan is an excellent instructor.",
    "I think anyone will enjoy this course, regardless of their major.",
    "This is a great physics class to take after the intro sequence. The pace was great, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend itcomparing my experience of this course to friends' experiences of Phys 410, I think this is the clear choice. The lectures were great and the whole course was pretty comprehensible without being easy or boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student it was very interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, especially if Nikhil is teaching it. He made this course a joy even though there was some tough material.",
    "Only to students who need it for their major.",
    "I struggled, but learned new things. If not taken for the major, it could be a good Credit\/D\/Fail course.",
    "I would. The first half of the course (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics) provided a cool, novel way to approach mechanics problems, and the second half presented topics that are relevant for an overall understanding of physics.",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Padmanabhan is the best physics professor I have had at Yale by a huge margin. The course material isn't the most mind-blowing stuff, but in his hands it is fun, accessible, and interesting. Best physics course I've taken at Yale.",
    "I was planning on shopping both 401 and 410, but after the first lecture with Prof. P. I didn't even bother to go to 410. He's clear and understandable, and he does a great job of explaining instead of just telling as he introduces new concepts. 401 was a no-brainer for me, and it's easily one of the best physics classes I've taken at Yale as far as quality of teaching goes. So yeah, I recommend it."
