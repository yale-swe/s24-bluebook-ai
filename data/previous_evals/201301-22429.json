    "If you took 110 and liked it you really should take 120 its that simple. If you are one of those rare people that have already taken Egyptian in high school you should be familiar with nominal sentences nouns, adjectives, and basic verb forms as well as how to read and translate hieroglyphs before taking this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn a fascinating language. The workload is manageable, although it's certainly not a free language credit. You'll have to do a decent amount of practice to really learn this language, as the grammar is very different from English. If you do the work in this course, you're pretty much guaranteed to get the grade you want. There are ample extra credit opportunities at the end of each semester, and the instructor will keep you updated on your current standing so you can decide how much extra credit you need. Overall, this class was a great way to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "Definitely harder\/more work than EGYP 110, but also more rewarding. By the end of the semester, you'll be reading full-length texts, and although it'll be a struggle to decipher them, it's a really cool experience! Keep in mind that the beginning of the semester is kind of rough because you're doing more grammar stuff, like a bunch of verb forms.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I mean, it's sort of required if you want to get credit for L1, but it's also really fun! My one piece of advice: make a chart of all of the verb forms you learn. They get really confusing and jumbled after a while.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It is not too much work and you learn an awesome and totally applicable life skill. You laugh, but in 10 years when other kids forget the fluent spanish they learned, the hieroglyphics students will without a doubt be able to write peoples' names at parties and get tons of love. Yeah, take this.",
    "The continuation of EGYP110: Certainly a bit more work, but more exciting as well (and required, if you want to get credit for 110). Still, a great course\u00e2\u0080\u0094I almost didn't mind waking up early for it."
