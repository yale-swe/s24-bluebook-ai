    "If you like DS lit and French, this is a great class for you.",
    "I loved this class--probably my favorite of the term. Great books, great professor. I loved feeling like I was in DS again (though I would imagine it would be a lot of the same sort of thing to take this class as a freshman in DS). Pretty light workload--it's pretty much exactly the same as a DS class but with less reading. Discussions were almost always fun. Professor Duval is wonderful in every way. I put off the language requirement until the last possible semester, and I couldn't have imagined a better way to fulfill it.",
    "It's simple: if you liked Directed Studies and love French, TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "A spectacular class. Professor Duval carefully devised a syllabus that would both be enriched by DS and stand on its own. My French - written, read, and spoken - has greatly improved, thanks in large part to the personal attention of Professor Duval and the fabulous Lauren Pinzka, who serves as the department's writing tutor. Professor Duval's standards, for discussion and essay-writing, are rigorous but entirely reasonable, and he is extremely adept at providing guidance without constraining creativity and innovation. Overall, I feel that I have gained a very solid introduction to some of the basic works French literature and am looking forward to building on it.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you can place into L5, and loved or are loving DS. This was offered for the first time when I took it, hopefully it will be offered again! Professor Duval is a really charming man who leads a great section. It is doable with DS at the same time, there were three of us who were doing that. Writing the papers is a challenge, as the level of French Professor Duval demands is very high. As such, do not expect gentle and cuddly paper comments--two pages, single spaced, of close criticism will be written. Having said that, the comments are immensely useful, and never unfair. You will learn a great deal about French literature from the medieval times to Sartre, and will bring in your first semester DS knowledge of classicism.",
    "French 171b is a French literature course for studies who are currently taking or have taken Directed Studies. I highly recommend this course to any directed studies student who has taken L5 French, not only because you will get to read some of the directed studies texts in the original language, but more importantly because taking this course will show you a whole other aspect of directed studies lit. In reading these French texts, all of which have an either indirect or direct relation to the texts read in directed studies lit, I found I was able to better understand the influence and legacy of those ds works in terms of how they fit into the literary context of their time, and how their structure was reinterpreted and reused by later writers. This is also French course--I recommend it only for students who feel very comfortable speaking and writing in French as you will be expected to participate in class and write papers in DS style (only in French). That said, this course will definitely improve your spoken and written French. Though we did not cover any grammar topics or do any vocab in the course, the reading, writing, and speaking involved in this course definitely improved my general comfort with French."
