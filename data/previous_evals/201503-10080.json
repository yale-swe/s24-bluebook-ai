    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan was a fantastic TF. He always had a great sense of humor about our section, and did a good job explaining the more challenging parts of Patristics if we didn't get the answers in class. He was quite good at getting people to talk.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0I got a lot out of sections. Ryan was a good facilitator. He also recapped lecture material sometimes which helped me understand it better. Given that there is so much material covered, it may be a good idea to do a 2-3 minute recap of lectures every section to make sure we've got the key points.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan seemed very well prepared each week and did a good job of fielding questions from the seminar members.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Great job when teaching in the classroom. Ryan really helped us understand tough concepts. Sometimes, the method of just having people ask questions in an unguided way fell a little flat, particularly when people either a) understood the content pretty well (Augustine) or b) hadn't read or hadn't grasped it at all (...Leontius?) Some more active guidance of discussion here could be helpful. Working through some of the Trinitarian and Christological stuff on the board was hugely helpful to understanding the course material, though.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan was a great TF. He always seemed very knowledgeable about the topics that came up in section, and he was almost always able to give a clear and insightful response to questions that came up regarding the texts we looked at or the ideas expressed therein; in those rare cases when he could not give a complete answer to a question, he was able to indicate where one might look to find the answer. He was also quite timely in communicating important course information and in responding to questions or other matters via email.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan complimented Prof. Beeley really well. Where Professor Beeley introduced very abstract topics, Ryan was able to bring them down to a level that our small group could understand. Ryan excelled in explaining and re-explaining the material to out often stone-faced class. Ryan's biggest challenge was our class. We were often so confused by the material that we simply didn't know where to begin with questions. In these times, Ryan was able to open discussion by starting with very basic concepts. He will make a fine professor someday and I look forward to taking a class with him again!",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan really knew the subject-very helpful explaining it. I thought his section was great. Really great TF.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Great! knowledgeable, willing to answer questions on related topics, willing to engage current issues, willing to spend lots of time outside lecture\/ section to meet and help, very approachable",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0not always great at managing discussion in section \/ sometimes would have been more useful to have structure, or a heads about what part of the reading we would be focusing on in order to be more prepared was very available through email and in person was encouraging of our own thought processes and was very able to explain difficult concepts when asked",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Strengths: * Well-prepared for each session * Comfortable with \/ Knowledgeable of the material * Varied the lesson plans given the group's response and the material for the week * Emphasized particular content that was most important * Facilitated discussion well * Calm demeanor while being very engaged with the content of the course Needs \/ Suggestions: * Continue to explore teaching strategies that would \"force\" greater participation of all members of the section (could be a small written task to open or close, for example.) * Since section is part of our assessment, is there a way to provide feedback to students on how we are doing in section?",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Very capable. Knew when and how to facilitate a meaningful discussion; knew when it was important to make sure specific information was conveyed.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan was a great section leader for this course. He directed the flow of conversation to incorporate all the major elements we would need to know for our assignments and exams, while allowing the students to explore the complexity of the ideas the course covered. He was also very good at keeping the section on topic, a rare gift. He comes highly recommended.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0He handled the sections and clarified the lecture material well, but sometimes it seemed that his one-on-one capacities suffered by comparison.In the context of the larger group, he was very helpful and knowledgeable, emphasizing the proper points and tying off the loose ends of our lecture, but on an individual basis I did not think he seemed particularly thrilled.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Best part of this class was section. Ryan was great, and would break down the confusing parts of lecture for us. He was very available both after class and via email, and I appreciate that he reached out to us to talk about PhD programs early in the semester. Awesome TF!",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan was great! Very helpful at breaking down Beeley's denser lectures and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan was an excellent TF, and in my opinion our discussion sections were the academic highlight of the week. He was excellent at fostering intelligent and focused classroom discussion, at answering questions, and at presenting opaque material in a lively and comprehensible way, and all with a great deal of good humor. Excellent.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan was communicative and was a fairly good facilitator. He asked questions and tried to use diverse pedagogy to have us engage with one another and with the material. For these reasons he was a good TF. I would have liked a bit more strong leadership from him however. Some of the most helpful sections were when Ryan would write on the board and teach, clarifying things that were unclear from lecture etc. Sometimes I felt like Ryan was not as confident when students asked him questions leaving me unsure of who I should be asking clarifying questions to about the texts.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan is especially skilled at taking more difficult ideas and passages and making them accessible to first-time patristics readers. He did an excellent job engaging our section in discussion, even when we were reticent to engage and speak to the material or each other. I looked forward to my discussion section every week.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Ryan brought a thoughtful, open-mind to his leadership of the sessions. He encouraged others to ask and answer questions. He also did a nice job with straight-up teaching, which was necessary for some topics. If I had a suggestion, it'd just be that he teach a bit more -- he did it well and I think with so many of these writers, a 5-10 minute teaching bit at the beginning of each class may be useful. This is a minor suggestion, though. I thought he did a great job.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Joseph McAnnally-Linz \u00a0Did a wonderful job of facilitating discussion in our section by providing insightful comments and activities. Possessed sufficient if not exceeding knowledge to help with questions that arose in lecture and made time to address them.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was a good teaching fellow. He was a strong leader and did a good job keeping the group on topic. Something I really valued is that Tom was honest when he did not know something but encouraged us to look into it and get back to him. He clearly has an educational background and this was a great assist.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Only asked leading questions, did not encourage critical or creative thought.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0He gave noticeable effort every discussion and did a great job catering to the diverse needs and questions of the students. My only complaint is partly due to the limited time available in section but he could have addressed some of the questions in much more detail, or from a \"deeper\" standpoint rather than surface level questions. I have no major complaints though as he did a generally great job and could tell he was working hard at it.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom knows exactly how to conduct a good section in which everyone participates, and difficult concepts are clarified. We were lucky to have Tom as our section leader in such a difficult class.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0I think Tom did a great job at helping us break down some the concepts to ensure our understanding.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was a wonderful teaching fellow, and I hope, for all of his future students' sake, that he continues to teach. He facilitated discussion in a professional and courteous way, and was always friendly and approachable inside and outside the classroom. Were I grading Tom's performance this semester, he would received the highest marks possible.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Excellent.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom is a well-organized and very patient section leader. Tom always had a well thought out plan for our section and made expectations quite clear. He is also quite patient given all of the questions raised by class members, many of whom were first year students adjusting to YDS expectations. I think Tom did a nice job keeping section discussions on track. A few voices dominated a little, so a little more of a strategy to include all voices would maybe benefit the section. Overall, though, Tom did really well with this.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was a good TF. He was really helpful when I wanted to go over my mid-term test that I was not happy with. He was caring and showed the information well to us.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was an excellent TF. Discussion sections were well-organized and helpful. No suggestions for improvement, he's great as-is!",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0I really liked Tom as a TF; he was helpful, available out of class, and came thoughtfully prepared to section. We had a large section with a lot of people who wanted to talk and Tom successfully was able to keep everyone in the section involved. He also creatively used a variety of ways to keep us thinking through materials (i.e. how to handle difficult Biblical passages according to Augustine). Tom helpfully directed and steered section but I would encourage him to consider ways to use as few words as possible in section. While the students did talk a lot, the more we are able to talk and explore in section, the better!",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Strengths: Knowledgeable about material, acknowledged when he didn't know something on the rare occasion that it happened, open-minded about interpretation, allowed class to guide discussion as they desired, was able to lead discussion when necessary, very helpful in explanations and answering questions Weaknesses: Sometimes asked guiding questions that allowed little interpretation",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was a fantastic TF who was readily accessible and a great aid. I have nothing to complain about, only good things to say. I greatly appreciated his skill in balancing the many different voices in our crowded sectional. To reiterate, he was fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0I very much enjoyed being in Tom's teaching section. Because he is an historian, he often filled in the gaps that Prof. Beeley left open upon the conclusion of his lectures. I also commend his ability to facilitate good discussion. There were a few students in my section who had a tendency to dominate, and there were also students who were not very talkative at all. Other teaching sections may have, in fact, been dominated by the more assertive students, but Tom very effectively encouraged the quiet students to offer comments more than they may initially have been inclined to do so as well as prevent the more assertive students from dominating discussion. Generally, his class was a very positive experience for me, and I commend Tom for his efforts.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was very good at giving us instruction, at explaining terms, and facilitating discussion towards the important material from lecture. I always knew that every section would enhance my understanding of the week's material.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was a great TF - there's no other way to put it. He balanced extra lecture with discussion in the sections, guided the discussions well, and knew when to ask questions vs. foster thoughts and conversation. He was available outside of the assigned hour, and provided very helpful feedback. This was my first semester in my first year so I only have two other TFs to measure him against, but he stood head and shoulders above the other two. Thank you, Tom. My patristics section was truly a highlight of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Strengths: knowledge of the material Weakness: Allowing free flow of discussion. It seemed to mechanical and did not allow for counterpoints from students to other students. The topic would switch before the previous point was exhausted.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0I usually find sections to be next to useless. I learn by reading, listening, and synthesizing information more than by discussing it with others. But, particularly later in the semester, I found the sections in this class to be quite helpful. We worked through difficult passages in detail, which really helped clarify things.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was great at engaging discussion. I really enjoyed discussion group, and he really took the time to unpack and streamline dense concepts.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was always available after class to discuss any assignments. He also often stayed after class to explain concepts that remained unclear. He did his best to make sure everyone was heard, and that those who found it easy to talk too much were reined in so others could speak up. He was always quiet pleasant as well, it was easy to approach him with questions.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was excellent in helping people to learn & grow no matter the knowledge base and experience they came into the course with. I enthusiastically would recommend him for anything.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom did an excellent job in keeping up with the class contents and addressing the assigned weekly topics with our large group. Ideas for further improvement are as follows: The notation style used to follow the primary sources is new to us and could have been explained better: e.g. how to notate or locate paragraphs and chapters in the extensive primary sources. Context was frequently missing throughout the course in class and in sections. For example figures from 2 main schools (i.e. Antioch and Alexandria) are contrasted, while the schools of thought are never explained (i.e. schools of theology vs exegesis). Also, a brief explanation of the \"Pentarchy\" (5 Christian Sees) as such would be very helpful. Tom was also very gracious in giving guidance for the exam but this guidance came a bit too late after the mid-terms. Same goes for the study guide coming in so late but this may not have been under Tom's control. Tom managed a large group very well but the dynamics of such interactions was not always comfortable. For instance, the style of the Raise your hand if you want to speak rule at sections, was disorienting and restrictive to some folks with extensive professional experience in large interactive corporate meetings. Overall a great effort and Tom's warm and engaging style of teaching was greatly appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom encouraged participation which was VERY welcomed but he did not do it in a demanding way. He just made the quick responders more apt to pause before blurting out what they were thinking. Tom also used visual graphs\/maps\/charts which was VERY helpful in understanding difficult material (such as different incarnation terms and dates for the variety of writers). Excellent TF and I'm sure he will be excellent Prof.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom is extremely well organized and enthusiastic about the material; he is very good at breaking material down and making it understandable. He is an asset to the class."
