   "comments": [
    "In-depth understanding of astronomy, basic astrophysics, and cosmology. This includes knowledge about exoplanets, Mars, black holes, and more. This course gives scientific insight into all of the big \"buzz\" questions about astronomy, like \"will we go to Mars?\" \"is there life elsewhere?\" \"what are black holes\/dark matter\/dark energy?\" and more. I learned to work with a lot of concepts in physics and astronomy, carry out a variety of mathematical calculations and conceptual applications, and definitely convert a lot of units! Super fun on the whole.",
    "I learned a ton about astrophysics, rocket physics, mars, black holes, exoplanets, and more!",
    "I learned all about the current frontiers and controversies we face today in modern astrophysics. I think I also learned how to explore new topics I am not that familiar with. I learned so much it is hard to put it all down.",
    "A better understanding of outset space in general",
    "This class taught me so much about the world we live in, how scientists go about experimenting\/forgiving things out, and the depths of space. Im so happy I took this course.",
    "This class really helped me see astronomy in a new light. It was not extremely scientific but had just the right amount for it to be interesting and relevant for those of us who don't particularly want to go into STEM.",
    "A good understanding about the general physics underlying astronomy.",
    "I learned about black hole detection methods, dark matter, life on Mars, rocket science, methods of finding exoplanets etc. I've learned how to calculate mass of black hole, parallax, circular orbits, etc.",
    "This class provides an overview of some of the most important topics in modern astrophysics and astronomy, including colonization of Mars, detection of exoplanets, black holes and dark matter.",
    "I learned a lot in this class. It was a great environment to learn more about astrophysics and get an introduction into some newer and relevant fields of research in the area (dark matter, black holes). My QR skills were tested with p-sets, and there were 3 papers along with 2 midterms.",
    "this is my second course with professor fischer - she is great! i found it incredibly interesting and i appreciated the smaller class size - it allowed us to ask questions, get to know the professor, and engage with the material more. i am a history major and found this to be an enjoyable science.",
    "I loved this course! I learned so much about many topics in astrophysics black holes, exoplanets, radial velocity, and so many more things. Professor Fischer was also amazing; her teaching style is extremely clear and consise.",
    "I love Debra Astro\/basic physics\/astrophysics knowledge\/really cool information about what professors like Debra are doing with their funding!! Really cool to learn how the world works and how it all started Essential intro course to Astronomy",
    "I learned so much about astronomy, climate change, the challenge of accessibility of science, and about myself as a learner.",
    "I learned not only a great deal about the future and current state of astrophysics, but also how to integrate science into real, tangible scenarios.",
    "I learned about the study of astrophysics and the scientific methods used to discover celestial objects such as exoplanets, black holes, dark matter, and other objects.",
    "I learned about black holes, relativity, dark matter, Mars and its habitability, the creation of planets, how to detect exoplanets, rocket science and a bit about the astronomical research process. I learned a lot and really enjoyed it. I feel like I finally have a grasp on what the field of astronomy is really all about.",
    "In this class, I learned a broad and introductory spectrum of concepts having to do with galaxy formation, deep space objects, black holes and dark matter, and other concepts related to our place in the universe."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are almost everything. The lectures were super fun and engaging--I especially enjoyed how Professor Fischer had us do some work\/practice on the problems in class so we could learn and work with the material before having to do the problems on our own in problem sets. In terms of weaknesses, there might have been too many deadlines at some points in the semester (submission of paper, peer review, a problem set, final paper, etc. all at once), but I think that could maybe mitigated if we did 2 instead of 3 papers or something of that sort.",
    "Actually an interesting class, but at times confusing and hard to follow -- nothing that cant be solved by reviewing the slides and attending office hours, though.",
    "The teaching was fantastic! Only concern is that sometimes the pset questions did not reflect what we had been learning and required separate teaching.",
    "This class is incredible. I have no criticism. I think everyone should take it.",
    "I did not feel prepared for psets from what we covered in class",
    "Some teacher dont use Canvas, but i appreciate how much Canvas was used in this course.",
    "A strength is that the professor is so great and really loves interacting and helping students. I did feel like maybe the slides\/lectures that were uploaded could be more comprehensive.",
    "Strengths: really appreciated the multiple office hours hosted by both TAs and Professor Fischer. Found that they were necessary to complete PSETs",
    "Strengths: good class size for everyone to be engaged, very helpful TF's and professor, very cool guest speakers, the freedom we had in choosing paper topics, the assistance we got on homework problems. very fast Piazza response Weaknesses: might be helpful if we did more practice problems in class that were similar to the ones on homework.",
    "I think the course provided us with a great overview of new developments in astrophysics, but I feel like the psets (especially the last two) were very vaguely connected with the actual class material and required that we know concepts that were never mentioned in readings\/class to do well on. That was extremely frustrating for me, considering that I went to class diligently and was still struggling.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Prof. Fischer does a great job of making the class engaging and chooses very cool topics for the modules.",
    "This is a great course. I would say a strength is the professor and TFs since they are extremely committed to helping students learn.",
    "i think the workload was a bit too high at times - 5 psets, 2 exams, 3 papers. maybe do only 1-2 papers instead of 3.",
    "I dont really have any improvements. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I actually quite enjoyed the essays, it made me feel like I was learning more than just the class content. My only concern would be to have greater separation between p-set due dates and essay due dates because I often felt constrained by time. Strength: debra and the tas!",
    "Amazing course overall. I loved it and Professor Fischer is the BEST.",
    "I loved this class. I really think it made difficult science concepts more digestible. Astrophysics can be daunting and intimidating but this class made it fun and engaging.",
    "The lectures were fantastic as were the problem sets. The first midterm seemed to be poorly put together, but afterwords, great work was done to improve the second midterm.",
    "This class was a great course for non-STEM majors who are interested in the field of astrophysics. Its balance of PSETs and Papers made the workload more bearable, as an English major, and I felt like I learned a lot about the subject in a low-pressure way. Most of the PSETs covered the problems that we went over in class, but occasionally we had PSETs where the questions felt like we had not discussed the proper method that needed to be used to solve them, which was frustrating.",
    "It is a great survey course that teaches you about a lot of the basic elements of astronomy and its current frontiers. You learn a bit of math that helps you to further understand it, but never too much that it is impossible or too difficult even for non-math students. It is defiantly not a guy in terms of the amount of work that goes into the class: two midterms, five p-sets, and three essays, but the material itself is not that hard. The amount of things studied is amazing because you are always moving on to something new and interesting and therefore dont get bored. You also learn a lot about the current topics of intrigue in astronomy, which makes you feel very well-verses. I was able to hold my own in conversations with astrophysics and astronomy majors. Its also all Very interesting.",
    "This class was one of the better structured classes that I have taken in my time at Yale, and I have no complaints about how we handled material! It was a joy to come to class every day."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I think this class is really instructive in a lot of fascinating concepts and ideas about astronomy, I came out of it really thankful to have learned about the things that I did. It's a bit work-intensive at times, but the work was by no means incredibly difficult or overwhelming, and I often came out of it enjoying it. As a non-science major, this class is perhaps the one of the only classes in which I actually enjoyed the problem sets, if that says something about the work.",
    "This class is a semi-gut. It's not a gut in the sense that you have no work -- because you have 5 PSets, 3 papers (with first and final drafts due), and 2 midterms (but no final) -- but it is a gut in the sense that you can do pretty well without trying very hard. Overall the class is actually interesting, you just have to put the work in.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a QR\/Science credit who has some background in math\/science. It is not hugely challenging if you have taken ASTR 130, but I can see how the amount of new and unfamiliar information might be overwhelming for someone completely new to the area. It definitely was more interesting than the other QR credits I might have taken, so the extra work I had to put in was worth it.",
    "YES! Fantastic course with fantastic professor and a great topic. Well planned and learned a lot.",
    "Yes, this is the best class i've taken at Yale. Everyone should take it.",
    "Yes. This course was so fun.",
    "There are a ton of assignments so its easy to get a relatively good grade because nothing counts for very much, but I dont actually feel like I learned that much. I enjoyed the Professor and the TAs and the material was cool generally, but most of the time I was lost.",
    "Yes. Debra Fischer is one of the most engaged professors Ive had.",
    "Definitely! It's a great class.",
    "Yes! It gave me the background I wanted in astronomy in a fun and supportive learning environment.",
    "100%. Astronomy is a great way to look at the universe from a different point of view. You realize how small we are and it really helps put your life into perspective. With the enthusiasm of the professor and TF's, your love for science and the universe will grow exponentially and you'll feel like an actual astronomer!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any non-STEM major that is interested in the universe.",
    "Yes, but take it if you are passionate about the subject. If you are just trying to find an \"easy\" class, take Trees or Bio the world and us.",
    "yep - great science credit! and the grading is scaled in such way that advantages the student. if you put in work you will most likely see results!",
    "Yea",
    "I would highly recommend.",
    "Yes, Debra is a GEM; she cares about her students so much and is so passionate about the subject. Plenty of opportunities to really dive deep and get hands on experience of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Definitely expanded my worldview scope; she also makes BOMB cookies",
    "YES! Professor Fischer is fantastic and this class is a perfect introduction to space. It made me consider switching my major to Astrophysics...it was that good.",
    "Definitely. I never enjoyed a science class until I took this course.",
    "This class was a great course for non-STEM majors who are interested in the field of astrophysics, with its mix of PSETs and papers, and the fact that it only has two midterms and no final!",
    "I would recommend this student to anyone even remotely interested in astronomy. You learn about a lot of different topics and will come out of it more informed and more interested in space and its study. Professor Fischer is also hands down of the best teachers Ive ever had and she does a great job explaining complex astronomical terms in simple, easy-to-understand ways. Its a great course for non-stem people still interested in space.",
    "Perfect class to get a science credit. Prof. Fischer is one of the most amazing humans I've come across among Yale teaching staff. Incredibly clear and engaging during class. Covers some incredibly interesting material. Very well organized and designs her course to facilitate student learning. Unbelievable course if you get the chance to take it",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody interested in a heartbeat! It was truly the class that made my semester as engaging as it was."
