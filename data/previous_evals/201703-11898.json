    "Logic! And a slightly more rigorous way of approaching proofs.",

    "Rigorous examination of the foundations of first-order logic. Very well organized",
    "I learned many different proof based methods and a basic understanding of Godel's completeness theorem.",
    "I was introduced to the methods behind proofs.",
    "Introductory mathematical logic was learned.",
    "This course built toward a proof of the completeness of first-order logic. Over the semester, I developed familiarity with using sentential and first-order languages while also examining how each system functions at the metalogical level. I also gained experience writing proofs, especially proofs by induction and by contradiction."

   "comments": [
    "This is the most structured class I have ever had!",
    "Very interesting material especially for math students.",
    "The course material is sequential and the problem sets reinforced the material. I would have preferred more frequent, shorter problem sets.",
    "The course is very structured, in a helpful way. The material is covered with ruthless efficiency, while office hours are helpful in filling in any gaps left by the pace of instruction.",
    "The particular strength of this course is its structure: the semester has a clear focus toward the proof of the completeness of first-order logic. Individual pieces may feel disparate as they fall into place, but Professor Shin emphasizes how each element becomes important to the final proof in the last few weeks. Professor Shin's teaching was a highlight as well. I was glad to have a small lecture, with Professor Shin running the sections and grading the problem sets. She is an excellent teacher."

    "Yes! Sun-Joo is great and the psets are enjoyable and not too hard.",

    "This will be an easy yet interesting QR credit! I really enjoyed it!",
    "This course is ever well organized and taught. I never thought I would feel so comfortable doing proofs! This course improved the way I think.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "I would; this course introduced useful ways to think about philosophy.",
    "An intellectually difficult, but rewarding introduction to the formal system of first-order logic. Highly recommend to anyone who might be interested.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone with experience in proof-based math. This course is challenging without being overwhelming, and Professor Shin is an excellent teacher."
