I also understand the modern world in a new light because of the fault lines - geographical, cultural, etc. - that Professor Foster illustrated.",

    "This is a wonderful course! The highlight is Professor Foster--his lectures are always riveting and informative. The chronology in the second half of the course is occasionally difficult to follow, but it is still very interesting.",
    "This is an incredibly comprehensive course of the world of Late Antiquity. There are few ways to improve it - every lecture and reading brought new insights into this world.",
    "It had a lot of readings and the key terms were very many even though we were tested on approximately 10.",
    "The course is logically structured and easy to follow. I wouldn't change any part of it."

    "I would certainly recommend this course. The topic is very under-appreciated these days, and Professor Foster makes it come to life.",
    "It's so worth it. You'll never look at the modern world the same way.",
    "Yes because the topic is interesting and the lecturing, Ben Foster, makes a compelling argument as to how the middle east developed.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student so long as they had a decent interest in history. If they don't find the subject matter interesting, they won't enjoy the course, but in my opinion the subject is engaging."
