   "comments": [
    "A lab which consists pretty exclusively of using excel",
    "EVST 202L provides a good support to EVST 201. I would recommend taking them concurrently. While the practical was hard, the lab itself was easily one of the easiest courses I have taken while at Yale. I would recommend it for how fun it is!",
    "The course was definitely doable: labs were completed and turned in every 2 weeks. The concepts were pretty interesting and did gave more detail on topics presented in the main course. Be careful with which TA you chose.",
    "Not a great lab. Only reason to take it is so you can take the lecture portion of the course.",
    "I would summarize Atmospheres lab as a series of basic applications of atmospheric, oceanic and environmental knowledge. Including water sampling, data analysis and manipulation, and in-field research, the lab allows students not necessarily experienced in science to learn the fundamentals of scientific research and reports.",
    "Why on earth would you take this course unless you have to? And since you have to take the lab with the main course, don't do it unless it's absolutely required.",
    "Low workload lab 2 hours a week with lab reports every 2 weeks. Highlight was a field trip along the Quinnipiac River. The lab really supports work done in EVST 201 in a hands-on way. However, while labs were clear and straightforward to complete, statistics and graphs were often time-consuming and tedious.",
    "It's an interesting lab especially at the beginning and a good first lab at Yale.",
    "Yes, its an easy lab. It's not too much work (5 labs each making 2 weeks) and is only 2 hours. You get to do interesting things like travel down the qpac river and launch a balloon off the top of the geology building. If you work efficiently enough in lab, you can get most of the lab report done there. Be careful when for the global warming debate. It seemed that your presentation factored equally if not more into your grade than content.",
    "It is the lab accompaniment to oceans and atmospheres. You will get a more hands on demonstration of the concepts learned in the class.",
    "Necessarily, I must recommend this course if I recommend 140. It is good practice with excel and with data collection, although interpreting data might vary depending on your grading - for my group, it seemed very lenient, so I was not sure if I had grasped the concepts correctly. The trips to the Quinnipiac and the Global Warming Debate are the highlights of the lab section.",
    "It's required to take with the class, it's not too much work and is even fun sometimes. Not sure how useful the concepts are though.",
    "It's required if you're taking EVST 201, so you might as well pick a section with your friends\/people you can struggle through it together. The first few labs are actually interesting and teach you meteorological techniques, but be prepared for heavy Excel practice. However, the benefit is that it is half the time of a typical STEM lab, and lab reports are due every other week with plenty of time in lab to ask questions.",
    "The lab is required to take the course, and although it is often extremely easy, it can sometimes help solidify the concepts taught in lecture.",
    "Well, if you're taking Oceans and Atmospheres you have to take it! The labs can help a little bit with the class material. The climate change debate was awful though, where the assignment is to debate whether or not climate change is real. I heard complaints from a lot of students who felt that the existence of climate change isn't a debate any more and felt this class backtracked and forced students to research climate denial science that has since been disproven. That lab could certainly be worked on.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning how to make basic lab measurements. The workload was very manageable and the labs were interesting. That said, I felt that we didn't learn much outside of EVST 201. The lab reinforced EVST 201 material and taught us how to use basic measuring devices which was helpful, but I didn't feel that it was necessary--especially if you already know how to use lab measurement devices.",
    "I would not recommend this lab. Don't take unless you have to for your major. It's a waste of time, you don't learn very much, and the grading is weird.",
    "You're not allowed to take G&G 140 without the lab, and this lab shouldn't discourage you from taking the course. The lab reports could take a long time (especially when we had to use excel) but weren't too hard. You're a little at the mercy of your TA, since a TA who explains things well would make this course a lot easier, but even with a less good TA it's doable.",
    "It's a solid lab course, and I'd recommend it overall. Some of the computer work I found boring, but it's all useful information to know."
