    "This course should be very valuable to anyone going into forest or woody plant botanical sciences, but I didn't feel I got out of it as much as I would have liked. It seemed there would have been good opportunity to integrate lab or visual\/field trip experience with the course, but it was not done. It was all lecture.",
    "Question 1: The readings were not helpful because so many textbooks were assigned. It was too expensive and cumbersome to deal with so many textbooks, so I just bought one. It was somewhat helpful.Question 2: The class would have been much more helpful if Professor Berlyn would present and follow an outline for each lecture. Each lecture appeared to have no architecture to it: at nearly every point, I did not know what I was learning or how it was relevant to other things we had covered. In addition, Professor Berlyn puts up slides, reads or explains a part of the slide (often full of dense text) then whips it off the projector before we can understand how it relates, what it's key takeaway is, or write down what it says. I felt like I never knew what I was supposed to be learning at any given time."
