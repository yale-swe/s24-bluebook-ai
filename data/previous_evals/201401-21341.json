    "BENG 421 is very very great. Professor Constable is nice, approachable and knows his stuff. The assignments (a grant proposal and a research paper--both pretty short) are extremely informative and not too hard. The tests are fair, and Professor Constable tells you pretty much exactly what concepts will be on them. The material is very interesting (not very math-heavy), and if you want to get an overview on all the stuff people use nowadays to see inside the body, take this class. You learn about X-ray, CT, PET\/SPECT, Ultrasound, MRI (a lot), and a little Optics. I very strongly recommend this class.",
    "Really interesting class! A good overview of medical imaging. The workload was pretty reasonable -- two papers, and the two exams (midterm and a non-cumulative final) were both really fair. Prof. Constable evidently knows a lot about the subject matter, and is a great instructor. I'm not a BME major, and I came into the class with no background in imaging, but definitely found it accessible. Would definitely recommend!",
    "If you are interested in imaging, I'd say this is a good class to take. The lectures can get a little disengaging, because you get the ppt slides and don't really have to take notes. The papers you write are honestly not the most exciting to write, but the material of the class is pretty interesting and you get a good overview of ultrasound, CT, PET\/SPECT, and especially MRI.",
    "Good course if you are interested in learning the details of how MRI and other imaging modalities work. Sometimes a little dry\/boring but generally interesting"
