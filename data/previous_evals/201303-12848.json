    "It helped me to think about the relationship between verbal and visual representation and the way that poetry and visual art can take this relationship itself as their theme.",
    "In the end the was perhaps too specifically focused on topics that will probably not coincide for the most part with those of my dissertation research, through no fault of the course. Though it may still come into play in unexpected ways, and it certainly deepened certain aspects of my knowledge of the discipline, especially in terms of broader theoretical trends and concerns.",
    "I had not ever thought of the issues that this course brought to bear, and it opened up an entire new avenue of thought for me that will continue to be fruitful. I am very grateful for it."
