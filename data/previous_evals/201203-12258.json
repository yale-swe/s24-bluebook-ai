    "Take it if you like the subject.",
    "I would definitely take the class. Not because of great teaching in the class, but because reading all the material and completing the problem sets forces one to learn the material.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are prepared to read the textbook which is pretty dense, and Shiller's book on the Good Society. I didn't, as I was taking it credit D, and felt I didn't learn a lot of the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in a possible career in the financial services industry.",
    "Boring lectures& heavy workload... I wouldn't recommend this course",
    "I would definitely recommend the class IF you're going into Finance. The class gets very technical and there's a ton of intense reading-600 pages to memorize for the final. The class has a good format-2 non-cumulative midterms, a final and 6 psets. The math part of the exams is actually easy as it comes straight from the psets but the qualitative is hard as it comes from some obscure part of the book. You will learn a lot in this class and definitely stuff you will need to know if you're thinking about finance.",
    "I thought the material for this class was very interesting, and really liked doing the reading and learning the material. Don't go to Shiller's lectures, especially if it's at 9 AM. His voice is just so soft that it'll lull you to sleep. The recipe to doing well:-Read the books. This is huge. The exams aren't just quantitative but a large portion of the grade comes from readings and lectures.-Read the transcripts of Shiller's lectures online, or watch them. They hardly change.-Go to guest lectures to lock in the easy questions on exams regarding them.-Grab a friend and bust out the Psets every other week.-Spend more than one evening studying for any of the tests. There's a lot of material. At times it felt like taking two classes, between studying the textbook, the additional readings, the lectures, and the math.Voila.",
    "Great class, must-take if you are interested in going into finance. Particularly helpful for people interested in S&T (you will gain a deep appreciation of the different financial markets).",
    "This class teaches you so much about financial markets, and you will walk out with a nice framework of where all different aspects of financial institutions fit in. Also, there's a really nice balance between qualitative stuff& quantitative stuff(although they get somewhat formulaic).Reading is a lot, and the textbook does a nice overview of the materials (yet it is somehow unclear at points). But I have to say, looking back upon the semester, it was so worth it.",
    "Random scattered questions on random vocabulary that has little to do with course = 1\/3 every examMemorization of complex formulas that are really long and forgettable = 2\/3 every examFinal exam = THE SAME, but worse, FOR THREE HOURSGreat teacher, nice TA's, interesting material, HORRIBLE TESTING FORMAT.",
    "This class presents very interesting and relevant information, especially if you want to go into finance. However, I would recommend just watching the lectures and looking at the material on Yale Open Courses instead. You will not get that much value added from actually taking the class vs. Yale Open Courses. In addition, there is a TON of reading and the exams are a pain, since they involve memorizing and being asked about lots of arbitrary facts from the readings.",
    "Fantastic intro course. LOTS of material. Fantastic textbook. Less than fantastic lectures, but if you read his lectures online they are great and he says really interesting things there. Easy midterms, harder finals. Seems like there'll be a difficult curve now.",
    "9am? nah",
    "Very hard class",
    "Enjoyable course as an introduction to finance. A lot of studying and work but worth it. Take it!",
    "Unless you think you can memorize an entire finance textbook, don't bother with this class. Even though Robert Shiller may be famous, he is a terrible lecturer which is only made worse by the fact that the class was at 9 AM. The lectures have little or nothing to do with the exams, which is why less than half the class actually went to lecture. Also the structure of the class was super unorganized, probably because Shiller was constantly off to other parts of the world to promote his new book. The TAs were useless, and I don't think anyone went to section after the first one except to pick up their midterms. A lot of times, I felt this class was sort of an afterthought for Professor Shiller and the TAs, which is unfortunate because I feel like I wasted a credit on this class. You definitely learn more from just reading the textbook.",
    "Memorize Fabozzi textbook and you are fine",
    "Good class. I had read evaluations from previous students that hated the testing, saying that much of what was tested had to be memorized from the insanely boring textbook. It wasn't like that. Half of each exam focuses on the mathematics of financial markets. The other half focuses on qualitative knowledge about the history and processes that take place in financial markets. It's a good class and explains much more than just investment banking and the like. Much of the class focuses on the theme that financial markets can do good for society.",
    "The material is very interesting, and I've learned a lot. I took John G's Financial Theory course last year and I prefer Shiller's course as it's more practical. But since everything about the class is on Open Courses and the professor constantly shows up to class at least 15 minutes late and runs out of time at the end, there's no purpose in going to the lecture. Out of a class of 100+, around 15 show up to class at each given lecture. The presentation of the material can be greatly improved. The professor seems to be very aloof.",
    "Take it if you really want to know more about finance. Just be warned: the exams (2 midterms, 1 final) are split into two parts: half are questions from specific pages of the textbook or specific lecture slides and can be quite trivial, while the other half are the math concepts taught by the TAs and featured on the problem sets. If you don't go to lecture (or at least watch the open courses lectures and look at the lecture slides like I did) and read the textbook, you will probably do poorly in this class.",
    "take it credit\/ d\/ fail",
    "Econ 252 is an overview of financial markets. You have two lectures and section each week, you have six problem sets over the course of the semester, you have two midterms and a final. The class involves a lot of reading that is definitely mandatory in order to do well on the exam. You learn a lot as a result of taking this class, so it is highly recommended, especially for a person considering pursuing a career in finance.",
    "For all the hype, not the greatest course ever. Boring lectures and pretty difficult coursework lead to disappointment. Maybe take this as a credit\/d if you're looking to get by and learn what you can, otherwise you'll be working a ton for a b.",
    "I hated this class possibly more than I have hated any other class at Yale. I am an econ major and I went in excited that this would be similar to an economics class, where you understand concepts and math and how they fit in with the real world. This class was nothing like that though. There were no concepts to understand and the math was a joke. This class basically says, \"memorize 600 pages of a dull, dense textbook.\"BUT, despite everything I just said, I learned more useful information in this class than I probably will in all my other classes in all 4 years combined. All those buzz words you hear in the news (derivatives, mortgages backed securities, credit default swap, etc.) that if you are like me you know little to nothing about, you will understand thoroughly after this class. This class will teach you the basics of just about anything and everything you can do with you money and how it is all regulated and taxed.Will you hate this class? If you are like me and everyone in the class I knew, yes. Should you take it? Probably.",
    "Relatively boring lectures. Interesting material. I would suggest reading the transcripts of the lectures on Open Yale Courses. The material by itself is pretty good.",
    "Only take this course if you want to put it on your resume, learn the basics of how the financial system works, or want a difficult econ course.",
    "Recommend w\/CR",
    "It is a great class, teaching you foundational knowledge about the financial world. Just make sure you really want to learn and are willing to put in the time for it. Because it is surely the whole lot materials to digest.",
    "Excellent course. Very dry at times but I would recommend it to anyone looking into finance or economics. DO combine it with more interesting courses. Consider it a spelling class - not at all intellectually stimulating, but creates the infrastructure in your mind for future learning that is intellectually stimulating.",
    "You learn a lot from the textbook while preparing for exams but the lectures are slow and boring",
    "Shiller is not what you are probably hoping for. He's absolutely brilliant, but tends to get a bit of topic in his lectures. Honestly, you will learn many financial terms, and probably absorb a lot of ideas from Shiller about morality in finance, but you will only learn by cramming for the exams as the lectures leave something to be desired.",
    "yeah do it. the overall message of the course is: finance isn't a horrible profession for horrible people. it actually does a lot of good in the world. also, this course gives you a good excuse to read the textbook which is a GREAT resource.",
    "It's a very poorly taught course - the Professor took the lectures very cavalierly, arriving in class almost five minutes late every time, and the lectures started almost 15 minutes behind schedule. The content was mostly lifted from the textbook, and Shiller's lectures and explanations weren't breathtaking either. He did have some interesting anecdotes about his travels though. The TA's were ok, but didn't take enough interest to attend lectures either. Their slides were ok. In conclusion, take this class if you must, but you probably won't learn much which you already didn't know if you're an Econ major",
    "Absolutely. Take this course for the material alone.",
    "Take it if you need an overview on the markets, but be prepared for some really picky exams and hard psets.",
    "Good for Ibanking prep. Lots of memorization but conceptually not a difficult course. Significant amount of reading involved. Exams are oddly specific so you are expected to know everything. Shiller is generally not an engaging lecturer, but if you are interested in the history of finance you may find him more interesting.",
    "Consider taking this course only if you want to go into finance and\/or are interested in getting a general overview. Otherwise don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Do not take it because of the brand-name of Robert Shiller for sure. Be prepared for underwhelming lectures, and every nit-picking detail of the huge amount of reading involved. Exams are half qualitative, and half-quantitative (which is the more-doable part). That being said, I did learn a lot from studying and reading by myself (not so much otherwise).",
    "It is a good introduction to financial markets, not only the technical, mathematical side, but also the institutional and legal aspects.",
    "You will learn about finance, but more from the readings and less from the actual lectures.",
    "Yes! This class is useful and you'll learn a lot about financial markets and different asset classes. Even if you don't go into finance in the future, the topics are covered are broad and everyone should know what they are to be well-informed. Perhaps take it Cr\/D\/F. Be prepared for a lot of readings, independent study, and getting tested on materials that are from pages and pages of readings",
    "I think the material itself is fascinating, and every Yale student should really understand these financial basics before going out into the \"real world\". Unfortunately, Professor Shiller, though I think he does really care about his students and does try to teach, is not very good at lecturing. He always comes to class late, and we start at least 10min past 9am. He never knows how to work the technology (you'd think he'd either learn by now, or if he can't he'd learn to have someone help him at the beginning like my other aged professors do). Because he starts late, he never manages to finish his slides. And his slides really don't make much sense. They're too removed from the textbook, and most importantly, the material on the slides are nearly never tested, because he bases the exams on random phrases in the textbook and also on the TA lectures. The 6 extra TA lectures are optional, but they teach you the math\/quantitative parts that the psets are based on, and that the exams are based on, so how can you not go to the TA lectures? Having them on Friday morning 9am is quite unkind. I think he should completely redesign thecourse and examine how exactly to go about teaching it, because in the end we're not learning enough of the actual important material.",
    "Yes, definitely. Don't slack off tho.",
    "I would recommend this class, the knowledge is worth it.Strengths: Interesting info, good survey course of finance and its different disciplines. The mathematical formulas you have to memorize are at least major ones in finance.Weaknesses: Curve is tough, tests entail a time crunch. Shiller sometimes goes off topic and tells stories that are only half related to the slides (at least they're interesting).We had interesting guest speakers, gave good insight.",
    "Financial Markets is a great intro and overview to finance - especially for the less math inclined. In comparison to Financial Theory, this class will explain all the terms you need to know in finance and how the whole system works, without letting challenging mathmatics take away from learning the basics. You also cover a fair bit of psycology, how people perceive financial markets and different careers, and a general understanding of financial and economic terms from a slightly higher level. If you like econ, or really want to know how the finance system works, take this class!"
