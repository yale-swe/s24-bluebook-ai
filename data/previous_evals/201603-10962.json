   "comments": [
    "This course offers a completely different view of IR. By studying good and bad statecraft, students learn what mistakes were made as well as how they could have been fixed. The professor's depth of knowledge was extremely impressive and made the course unforgettable.",
    "I developed skills in evaluating effective (and ineffective) statecraft which I think will be helpful in the future in analyzing uses of statecraft to address particular issues.",
    "I learned how intergovernmental diplomacy and crisis management works. Specifically, I learned about American diplomacy, how to best conduct it, and what makes it unique relative to other countries.",
    "In depth understanding of many cases of statecraft, but mostly a lends through which to analyze the way a country cohndjxfs statecradt.",
    "You learn the do's and don'ts of negotiation, and what makes a good mediator.",
    "I learned, from scratch, the idea and art and implementation of Statecraft. I'm a physics major, so this global affairs seminar was wholly new in ideas and organization. I loved the class, however, and Dennis ross was beyond interesting - which makes sense, since he is one of the world's foremost experts on the Middle East. I learned how negotiations take place, the history of various cases of Statecraft, etc. Overall, I learned a lot from the course and would hope Ross decides to teach it again.",
    "Real-world application of foreign policy, negotiations, and mediation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It would have been good if we had gotten through the syllabus or at least that the syllabus was updated. Also, it would have been helpful if the professor was more accessible.",
    "The strength of this course is its infusion of policy and theory. All the readings were extremely interesting and the lectures closely followed the reading.",
    "The strength of the course is having the chance to be taught by someone as fantastic as Amb. Ross. It is really up to the student to decide how much he\/she wants to benefit from the experience by doing the readings, going to office hours, etc.",
    "The main strength of this course is Professor Ross. He was incredibly interesting, as he has had a really incredible career working in statecraft and diplomacy, so learning from him was cool. He had great stories and insights to share, and the case studies were very interesting. The workload was also fairly light, which was nice.",
    "The readings were very interesting, and I the focus on specific cases was very helpful. Getting to learn from Professor Ross was also a great opportunity. However, class discussions didn't add much to my understanding. They tended to involve a lot of recaps of the readings, without adding much of a new understanding.",
    "Extremely intrresting and engaging, incredible stories as you hear about policy making from someone who was there at the table when they were made. Perhaps a tad more theory can be incorporated into the class next time.",
    "Strengths: the experience and insight that Ambassador Ross brings to each case study - you really develop a strong understanding of what occurred to make it either a good or bad example of statecraft. Weakness: I wish the Ambassador was around more often for extended office hours to give the students more of an opportunity to get to know him. He is so fascinating, and yet there wasn't a lot of time to meet with him.",
    "Great method for studying: the case-study method worked quite well, combining common and non-common times. Well curated articles and books. Weaknesses -- Professor Ross could've done more to foster dialogue. It seems as if he was more interested in us arriving at his particular point instead of having a broader discussion. Class seemed to drone on a bit at times."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in diplomacy.",
    "Dennis Ross was really interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Super recommended. Amb. Rosss is super engaging and the class will really shape the way in which you think of statecraft.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as a very interesting but low-workload class on how to effectively employ diplomatic tools in statecraft and how to use a particular framework (Ross's statecraft framework) to analyze foreign policy.",
    "If you are interested in diplomacy, then this is a very interesting course to take. It is especially worth while if you don't know a lot about these issues already. Getting to talk to Professor Ross, and getting to learn from his first hand experience, was really interesting. The course isn't super hard. The readings take a while, but aren't crazy long, and there are only two assignments all semester. The down side is that those two assignments are basically your whole grade, which can be a little intimidating. The readings were really interesting, but the class discussion was mostly just a rehashing of the readings.",
    "Absolutely, incredible opportunity to sit in class with professor Ross and take a close look at US statecraft",
    "Yes, this was an incredible course!",
    "I learned, from scratch, the idea and art and implementation of Statecraft. I'm a physics major, so this global affairs seminar was wholly new in ideas and organization. I loved the class, however, and Dennis ross was beyond interesting - which makes sense, since he is one of the world's foremost experts on the Middle East. I learned how negotiations take place, the history of various cases of Statecraft, etc. Overall, I learned a lot from the course and would hope Ross decides to teach it again. I took this course because I'm really interested in Middle Eastern politics and Israel especially, and overall this was a great decision. The amount of reading varied, but the whole course was structured around Ross's book on Statecraft.",
    "If you want to learn about foreign policy beyond an idea, and instead see the real-world application of it across different administrations, this class is fantastic. Just be prepared to spend most of class time arriving at the points that the Professor wants to make."
