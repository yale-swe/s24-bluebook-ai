   "comments": [
    "There are a LOT of readings for this class, but DO THEM. You'll be so glad you did. Skowronek's lectures are some of the best around and this class is definitely a must-take for poli sci majors.",
    "Even though I hope to work in politics in the future and have worked in politics previously, I would not recommend this class to another student. It was very boring, un-engaging, and not that interesting, and the material was taught in a very confusing way. You mostly learn about the structure of the presidency and how it's role has changed over time, not really about individual presidents.",
    "It gets a little boring halfway through. Skowronek gives you his theory by the end, and it might be frustrating if you don't fully buy that theory. He also spent two sentences of the entire semester on Lincoln, and while he justified this by saying Lincoln didn't transform the office of the Presidency, I would have loved to learn about Lincoln in a class called the American Presidency. While not a gut, it's just a paper midway through the semester and a final. You don't have to do all the reading, but you must read the books by Neustadt, Edwards, and Skowronek to do well on the final.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other Yale students and have already done so. I think this class gives a student crucial information to understanding how our government operates and how it has come to operate in this way. Professor Skowronek is an excellent teacher as well as scholar and I am happy to have taken this course.",
    "A quite fascinating study of the development of the modern presidency. I was skeptical at first, but the course gets interesting once we get to Jackson. You don't really have to do the reading as long as you go to lecture. Also, be wary of the fact that the 10-page take-home midterm is 30% and the in-class final is 60% (section is 10%). Professor Skowronek is renowned in the field and really knows what he's talking about. Good luck reading his handwriting though!",
    "An enjoyable course that teaches a lot about America's history and its Presidents. Take it!",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "A good lecture about the development of the presidency as an institution. Very cool way of thinking about the presidency. Having had an interest in the presidency, I very much enjoyed it.",
    "Definitely take it, great class, but it does have a lot of reading. like a LOT.",
    "It's a really interesting course, but take it CR\/D\/F.",
    "I hated this class but also really value the information I got from it and how much it changed how I look at politics and the political system. Lectures could be really dry but also informative. Assigns an impossible amount of reading but a lot of it is really interesting, so just find which ones you find interesting and do those. The final is worth most o the grade and I really messed up on it, so just be prepared for that.",
    "Take this is you really want a better understanding of how the presidency has developed and is the way it is today.",
    "I would summarize Political Science 205 as a nice comprehensive class on the American Presidency that covers the institution of the presidency from both an historical as well as a political science perspective. The class uses clear political science theory to analyze developments that we are familiar with from studying American history and thus the class lets us look at the presidency in a new light. I would recommend this class to another student,",
    "Good class, though lecture can be a little dry. Reasonable workload.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the Presidency as an institution.",
    "Yes. I learnt a lot about the evolution of the office.",
    "American Presidency was my first political science course at Yale. The readings were rich and plenty. I would recommend this class if you know you are passionate about politics. Some tips: stay up-to-date on current events, pick and choose the important readings and do them, don't spend time on trivial information.",
    "I'm glad I took this course as I emerge from it with a much better understanding of the historical development of the presidency. I especially appreciated prof. Skowrownek's presentation of the fantastic stories about the presidents, most if which I'd never heard before. The theory aspect of the course I found sometimes less interesting -- esp. regarding the bureaucracy -- but I even discovered the value of studying the bureaucracy.Prof. Skowrownek has a dry lecturing style and I would encourage him to engage he class more -- by writing more on the board, asking students questions in class, and even bringing in visual sources\/slides. He could also stick around longer after class to answer questions and show more interest in keeping us engaged during class. However he was definitely willing to meet outside of class.",
