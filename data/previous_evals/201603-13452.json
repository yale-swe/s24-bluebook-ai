    "You gain some experience engaging in college-level seminar discussions in a small classroom setting. While the course is described as a writing-intensive course, there wasn't actually that much writing (3 papers with 10 pages total) As it is a historiography class, you also read a number of excerpts from historians, philosophers, and social scientists of a variety of schools of thought, but mostly Western. The amount of reading increases over the course but you gradually get used to it.",
    "Learned how to analyze historiographical texts, critical reading and thinking, and historiographical analysis.",
    "I learned to read and write more critically with a perspective on many branches of history that have developed within the field.",
    "I learned to analyze some more difficult and dense texts with a critical eye.",
    "How to write academically, how to understand the study of history in its many varieties.",
    "Learned a lot about different historical approaches which will help me in the future to analyze historical texts with a more critical eye.",
    "I learned a lot about how history is studied. Various approaches to history. I also got a better foundation of the timeline of the world, because we used a lot of key events as reference points for discussion.",
    "I learned to better think about how to view the past. Realizing that there are different methods of viewing the past can be very enlightening.",
    "I developed writing skills. I also learned how to contribute to higher-level discussions in the seminar and how to analyze the text thoroughly and identify interesting quotes for discussion.",
    "Historiographical context for any other history course. Essentially, an overview of the discipline.",
    "I learned different approaches to studying history. I learned how to deeply analyze documents in studying history."

    "Professor Semmel is the primary reason to take this course. He's a fantastic professor who is quite knowledgeable and always comes prepared to class; he's a wonderful person to introduce you to college level seminar and writing classes. In discussing historiography, he seems well acquainted with a number of schools of thought, and his background in British history adds depth to what would otherwise be a survey of different historians. One of the reasons I was looking forward to this course was that it was a writing credit, and I wanted to practice writing some more papers through this seminar; unfortunately, we only wrote 3 papers of lengths 1-2, 3-4, and 6-8 pages. Because of this, this class wasn't particularly challenging in terms of the work load, but I would have liked to write a bit more to practice writing and have some more assessments for the grade.",
    "Strengths: Fun readings, great teacher, few papers.Can't think of any weaknesses on the top of my head.",
    "I think that it's a great course that surveyed a variety of branches of history, their pros and cons, as well as key writers\/critics of it. However, I definitely wish that a little more time could have been spent studying big history at the end rather than a quick 20 min discussion of it at the end of a lecture one day.",
    "Strengths: difficult and challenging reading that pushes students, discussions in class were well organized. Weaknesses: some readings were dry, and not enough writing in the course for it to be a learning experience.",
    "Strengths - the readings were very engaging Weaknesses - since the course does not need to be grounded in a certain region of the world, maybe including texts from various world cultures could enhance our understanding of the way other people conceive history",
    "Most readings were very interesting, but some were long and difficult to get through. I think small group assignments and presentations would've been helpful in getting all students involved.",
    "Strengths: The course allowed for discussion about a multitude of things. Going off topic had a purpose and a relevance to history during our discussion. Weak: Sometimes the readings were hard to really understand without the proffesors help. But when he went through the text with us it made a lot more sense.",
    "Fantastic and captivating discussions and class. Sometimes the readings got to be a little bit unnecessary. There were only graded papers, so maybe more essays would help students learn and have a greater opportunity to grow.",
    "The course benefits from interesting reading material. The reading workload was always manageable and interesting. Moreover, the discussions were almost always enlightening.",
    "One change I might suggest is eliminating one unit in order to make more space to go into greater depth in the other units. Perhaps more time discussing teleology and comparing different works?",
    "This class fostered fantastic discussions due to its structure. We analyzed our readings before class and then came to class where we each feed from each other leading to a discussion that presented me with numerous new insights and perspectives."

    "HIST 089 is a great freshman seminar to kick off your freshman year. It's not particularly difficult in terms of the material or workload, and the professor certainly is a great person to work with. It's probably not a class that will drastically change your view of the world but it will provide you with some new perspectives to consider if you are interested in taking further level history classes or seminars in your Yale career.",
    "Yes, brilliant professor, interesting course material, and really changed a lot about the way I think of things. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but would warn them that it might be a little difficult to keep up in discussion at first with a lot of European political\/economic history references that one might not be familiar with without a strong background in a high school history.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students majoring in history or otherwise interested in the field, as it was pretty technical.",
    "yes it is s great writing credit and professor semmel is great to freshman and an excellent teacher",
    "Professor Semmel is engaging and guides discussion very well. Would recommend taking it if he is the professor. We ended up writing less than the amount on the syllabus which was nice. Readings and discussion were usually very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. I feel like the amount of reading was doable, and the discussions were intellectually stimulating. Also Professor Semmel is amazing.",
    "Yes. Professor Semmel is fantastic and will help you to develop opinions and perspectives on the past.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the foundations of history and the different ways of studying history.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially for a freshman, because it introduces you to a college seminar style class."
