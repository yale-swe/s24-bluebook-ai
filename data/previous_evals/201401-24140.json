    "Strengths: always current - the instructors find a way to make the class relevant and timely to discussions of emergency planning (talking about the olympics and ebola outbreak, etc..). the class is informal which is a nice change from some other settings.weaknesses: not very well aligned with the syllabus; don't necessarily know what to expect when going into class.",
    "Excellent background in emergency preparedness.",
    "The biggest strength is the small class size!Additionally, you gain FEMA course certificates.",
    "strengths: overall introduction of emergency planning",
    "The curriculum is structured properly to allow course topics build upon one another. By the end of the semester we covered a wide variety of emergency situations as well as understanding government structure, response, and third-party efforts. However, I think we could have benefitted from engaging in more interactive presentations where we create drills or exercises and work through these exercises as a class."

The course covers the formal structures of emergency preparedness at a government level but it also allows students to critically think through and plan for a number of public health emergency situations. The skills and topics learned in this class can be applied to a number of strategic planning scenarios."
