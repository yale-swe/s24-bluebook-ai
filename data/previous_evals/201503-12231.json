    "This is a good class to take if you don't know anything about African History, and you want a fun approachable way to get started. If you already know a lot of the basics, I could imagine that you might find the constant shifting from place to place a bit annoying.Still, I would highly recommend it.",
    "As a senior in her penultimate semester, I have to say that this was the best course I've ever taken at Yale. Lots of readings for sure, but worth all of the time and effort. Everyone should take this class.",
    "The weekly books were amazing, and honestly the first African literature I'd ever read in an academic setting. There are only two essays so your only responsibility really is the weekly novel and showing up to two lectures per week! If you haven't realized that you don't know much about the African continent, this class will make you realize that. Even a few African students in our class learned more about their own histories (considering their textbooks were most likely written by the same people who wrote ours). While I don't know everything about Africa after taking this class, it has really encouraged me to take more African studies courses in the future to enrich that. Also it's a relatively small lecture so it's still intimate and personal!",
    "Absolutely take it if you're willing to put in the work to focus every lecture and read the books. If not, you do not do yourself or this class any justice. Magaziners lectures are on a whole different level. He is poetic to the point that it is freaky. Other than Jay Winter, I haven't encountered a better lecturer in the history department. This class focuses mainly on the time from about 1850 to the present. That means there is a shit ton of material to cover, seeing as every African country became a European colony other than Ethiopia and Liberia, both of which had their own fair share of troubles. Magaziner deals with this material overload by focusing each lecture on a particular country, group, or theme. In this way, you will get a crazy good survey of different narratives throughout the continent. The lecture on Christianity is unbelievably good-and his approach to understanding why decolonization generally failed is really nuanced and complex. Be warned, if you wanted to learn about north or South Africa, this is not the class for you. Even though colonialism reared it's ugly head in Arab North Africa, Magaziner never talks about it. Virtually the entire course focuses on equatorial Africa, with a disproportionate focus on East and Central Africa. It is one of the class's greatest flaws, but if you accept it going in then you won't be disappointed. You read a novel every week-some are better than others, but each has a historical purpose, as they stand in for primary sources. Read them like that, and you will like them all.",
    "Take this class or any class with Professor Magaziner you can get into!",
    "This is a fantastic class! Engaging with the lecture material through the novels was such a unique aspect to the course and I learned so much about what the lived experience in colonial and post-colonial Africa was like. Professor Magaziner's lectures are more like performances and are so engaging. Highly recommend this course!",
    "Yes! Would definitely recommend. It is definitely a survey course, which is at times frustrating, but it provides a very good introduction to African colonial history and is a good opportunity to figure out what areas you want to pursue further study in. Really though I would recommend it for the novels. The reading list for this class is incredible and I think my historical understanding of the material was greatly enriched by my experience reading the assigned novels.",
    "It's okay--reading novels makes for a fairly historically non-rigorous semester, but lectures are cool.",
    "This is a great survey course of colonial and postcolonial Africa. The syllabus is composed of novels (you read one each week) and supplementary readings. It's a very creative way to learn the material and stay engaged. The workload is not insane, but you need to keep up with lectures in order to write a substantive paper. Paper prompts are a bit tricky-- you need to incorporate novels with lecture materials and supplementary readings into the midterm and final papers. There's room to be creative with the papers, but you do need to have read the novels in order to choose the right ones to juxtapose. The task is to think of the novels as primary sources, which is a very unique approach that I haven't gotten from other classes! Be sure you know going into this course that it is very thematic. It covers a lot of time in a semester, so this course doesn't test your knowledge of details. However, it is an extremely engaging introduction to the subject matter if you've never learned anything about colonialism in Africa. For anyone who's never taken history course at Yale, this one is highly recommended!",
    "I would recommend. Very good, interesting history lecture. You probably won't leave feeling comfortable with the basics of African history, but you start to scratch the surface, and it's fascinating all the way through. If you're like me, and don't absolutely love LAAA history requirements generally, take this one.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class. First off-- don't be scared off by the novel-a-week requirement. I'm someone who specifically didn't major in history because I'm an unbearably slow reader, and I had little to no trouble doing the reading (in fact, this class made me a faster reader and convinced me to start reading novels for pleasure again, esp. ones by African authors). The novels are just that compelling. That said, understand that if you don't read the novels, you won't get much out of the course, nor will you do well, in all likelihood. Overall, this course is an incredible novel-based approach to Africa's broader narrative of colonialism. Each class focuses on a small handful of really interesting stories illuminating colonialism's impact on a certain region-- whether that story centers around a specific leader, a whole tribe during a certain war, a specific custom thrown into jeopardy, or how some Western power disrupted the political systems of a whole slew of nations for 50 years, each story is very engaging and worth learning about. The reading complements the lectures really nicely by providing glimpses of everyday life\/narratives in the regions\/time periods covered in lecture, with a specificity and humanness that is just really hard to capture in a lecture alone. Magaziner is a great lecturer, and the discussion sections were fantastic. The writing workload is also relatively small, and the lack of a final exam allows you to enjoy class and write down the important things without fretting over recording small details. Very few criticisms to offer, so make room in your schedule for this course. ESPECIALLY in light of all the recent race discussions on campus, I'd almost argue that this is a must-take. Definitely opened my eyes to the rich history of a whole region of the world I've really learned shamefully little about, and gave me a way to talk about this history without resorting to sweeping generalizations or other common pitfalls that people fall into when discussing Africa at large.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. Professor Magaziner is fantastic, the novels are all very interesting and entertaining, the essays were fun to write. Lecture was NEVER boring, Magaziner creates a great class environment and section is cool. Overall, an amazing experience, learnt a lot and had fun.",
    "This was a fantastic course in all respects. Professor Magaziner is a thorough and entertaining lecturer, and is really there for his students. The focus on novels drew students into class discussions, supplemented fact-based lectures, and provided a great lens through which to explore African history. At times, I disliked spending so little time on such interesting parts of history, and wished we had more time to focus on the Congo and Ujamma, but I realize more thorough exploration of these topics could have taken an entire semester. Overall, exceptional. You would be crazy not to take this class during your time at Yale.",
    "I loved this class for the first half and then it got repetitive. Prof Magaziner was super interesting but pushed the same message for every class yet still managed to make every class pretty interesting. All things considered, I did love this class and learned a lot. grading was tough though and assignments ambiguous.",
    "Absolutely would recommend",
    "AMAZING COURSE!!!! Professor Magaziner is a WONDERFUL lecturer and gifted storyteller. I loved every minute of this class. Course syllabus is exquisite. TAKE IT.",
    "Awesome lectures, awesome reading. Would highly recommend even if you don't know much about Africa. I learned so much and it was the best way to learn this topic.",
    "Without a doubt. I learned so much about the effects of colonialism and was absolutely amazed by the books we read.",
    "HIST 332 tries to bridge the gap between fiction and nonfiction by using novels as primary sources. The novels cover a huge span of time, geography, and style, which makes each weekand each discussion sectionvery unique. The concept of the class (in addition to Magaziners beautiful lectures) are reason enough to take the course. Be warned, however: the class does try to tackle about 250 years and an entire continent in one semester, which means that many complexities are glossed over. Magaziner recognizes, in most cases, this necessity and seems open to exploring those complexities with students outside of class (if they so choose), though.",
    "Take it. Magaziner is one of the best lecturers at Yale.",
    "An interesting class. If you enjoy reading fiction, and prefer writing papers to taking exams, this could be an ideal history course for you. But the novels you read don't always connect to what you 're learning in lecture at the time.",
    "TAKE IT!!!! you will not regret it.",
    "I don't even know what to type in this box. Professor Magaziner is the best lecturer I have ever had (as a senior) and I have been talking and thinking about this class all of break. He is thoughtful and critical enough to include the stories of historically underrepresented persons, he speaks clearly and engagingly, and he believes in the power of history to affect the way we live the present. PLEASE TAK THIS CLASS. It challenges you in all the way that a college class should. TAKE THIS CLASS. It will make you a better human being.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else, but only if they are committed to going to lecture and doing the work.",
    "A class about colonialism (in various forms) in sub-Saharan Africa. Required readings are twelve novels by various African writers (except for one white European dude). There are many other recommended readings -- scholarly articles that are sometimes hard to read. Two essays in which the student puts the readings and lectures \"into conversation with one another.\"",
    "It's a heavy course. You read a novel a week, there is weekly section to discuss the novel and 2 papers. Although it's a lot of work, I would recommend this to everyone who is at all interested in learning about the effects of colonialism on the continent.",
    "Faced-paced and exciting survey course. Lectures are engaging. The readings are novels, which leads to an unusual history course\/papers. Overall, an important course on a subject (African history) that doesn't get nearly enough attention. Will add depth and complexity to your view of colonial history.",
    "Take this class before graduating from Yale. This class teaches you how and why Africa is the way it is. It informs how the African story is so complex and multi-faceted and how the solutions to 'African problems' are not so black-white. You learn so much about Africa in such a short time. Professor Magaziner is a great teacher and the novels you read expand your knowlwedge on African literature. Take this class with Magaziner and you will enjoy every minute of it."
