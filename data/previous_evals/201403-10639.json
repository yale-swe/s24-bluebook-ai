   "comments": [
    "The course is every single thing you have ever learned in engineering mathematics.",
    "Remember all the math courses you took in undergrad? This covers them. Great refresher course, be prepared for it to move very fast. I would recommend this course. I have already applied some concepts here in my research and I think it is important for engineers to have the math backbone to the work they do.",
    "I will recommend. But it is mandatory for many Mechanical engineering students.",
    "Very useful class for any math-heavy engineering field or research project.A good review of the important concepts in math. I would definitely recommend the course",
    "This course is a great refresher for linear algebra, differential equations, vector calculus, and complex from an undergraduate math or engineering major. The problem sets and exam questions are quite fair and relevant. However, do not take this course if you are looking to learn this material for the very first time. It will only cause frustration as the pace is relatively quick for deeply understanding the material. (i.e. undergraduates take an entire course on vector calculus which is covered in roughly 2-3 hours in this course). Great professor for reviewing the math material however.",
    "I would recommend. It covers most of the topics that we could encounter in solving engineering problems.",
    "This class has a lot of material",
    "I did enjoy the class but wouldn't recommend it to someone with little math background.",
    "The course, likely, covers all, if not most, of the major mathematics that you will require for engineering. For me, it summarized all of the mathematics that I covered in undergraduate in one semester, making me wonder why I went through them in the first place. In fact, someone with only a background in calculus could get away with engineering for the rest of their lives having taken, and done well in, this one single course. I would recommend a student in the engineering disciplines to take this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another graduate student, as it is a good introduction to graduate mathematics.",
    "It teaches the fundamental mathematical principles necessary to pursue research in an engineering discipline. I thought the course was well taught. The topics were not only interesting, but useful. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "It is a requirement, and the material can be quite useful for other classes."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Didn't really deepen, but refreshed my knowledge.",
    "The course was full of many \"aha\" moments as concepts being taught triggered memories of undergrad work and equations I hadn't thought of in years. I have been able to apply some of the concepts in the class (such as partial differential equations) to my modeling for my research.",
    "It help me to go through the most useful part of mathematical method.",
    "Helped explain Fourier transform very well, which is used heavily in my research.",
    "This was a great course to refresh my knowledge of college math for engineering applications.",
    "For students entering graduate school without a clear research interest in mind, this type of general math course may be useful. For me, I am starting at a point in graduate school (MD-PhD program) where this course really plays no role in my ongoing research. It was math for the sake of checking off a box. And that was made it frustrating at times",
    "Not really. It was part of my departmental requirements.",
    "The course did an excellent job reminding me of the mathematical techniques I learned during my undergrad while also covering some topics that were new to me. Not terribly applicable to what my research is about, but certainly has made me more comfortable in the mathematics used in engineering.",
    "I had a fairly deep mathematical background already but this class addressed my weaknesses in complex algebra and calculus (much appreciated)",
    "It extent my understanding of mathematics in engineering area, which is good for my further study.",
    "This course greatly expanded my view of mathematics and will allow me to drive into other advanced fields without much more trouble.",
    "I had seen most (if not all) of this information through previous undergraduate courses. It did provide me with the opportunity to refresh my memory on these topics and to hone my skills.",
    "It was an effective overview of engineering mathematics"
