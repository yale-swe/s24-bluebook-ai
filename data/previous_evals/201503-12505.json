   "comments": [
    "If you have to take L4, take it! It's not a bad course.",
    "Take this if you're interested in pursuing Spanish through the L5 level.",
    "Take this class with Professora Len! She is so kind, accessible, and really helps you to feel comfortable trying to speak Spanish, even if you don't feel very fluent. The class is requires a consistent amount of time each day, but the work is painless and is really helpful in allowing you to expand your Spanish skills. Take this class if you want to see your Spanish abilities grow and are willing to put in the work necessary to do so.",
    "A lot of fun but great for your Spanish.",
    "Clearly only take this if it is a requirement and you need it for your language distribution. There is some form of an assessment (in class essay, quiz, exam) EVERY WEEK, so be prepared to spend a lot of time on the class. Leon was a good professor though, and there for students if they need extra help.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class -- it is a very manageable course that will greatly improve a student's grasp of the Spanish language.",
    "If you want\/need to keep learning Spanish, then definitely take it. It's not too much work and not too difficult, but I also feel as though I didn't improve my Spanish speaking ability as much as I could have.",
    "SPAN 140 can be described as an intense, homework-heavy class from which a student will learn a lot, but only if a significant amount of dedicated time is put into it. While a great deal is covered in class, the majority of the fundamentals of the Spanish language that is learned in this class occurs through independent studying and work outside of class-- class time is reserved almost exclusively to general review and, in large part, expanding upon the material learned outside of class. Despite the intensity of the work, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, because there is definitely a benefit proportional to the work one puts into the class."
