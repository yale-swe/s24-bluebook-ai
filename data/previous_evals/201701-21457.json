    "I found that my speaking abilities and reading abilities became much stronger.",
    "French grammar, literature, and conversation.",

   "comments": [
    "The class was fairly big, which meant that it was hard for a lot of individuals to get time to speak (in order to improve their speaking abilities). Most of the texts weren't particularly good.",
    "Strengths include Sac de Billes Weaknesses include the Diversit stories and just how long homework takes",
    "Weakness - I don't think we should read La Symphonie Pastorale - it was definitely a higher level of French than we know, there was too much vocab and structures we weren't familiar with, and the novel itself wasn't that great Strength - I really liked Diversite. I definitely feel like I learned not only more French through the two units but also more about different cultures",
    "The syllabus has obnoxious amounts of homework on some nights and then none or very little on occasion - could be balanced better to give a reasonable amount at all times. I also do not feel like the identifications are truly representative of grasp of the language, as it comes down to memorization of textual descriptions and dialogue rather than understanding of the premise of the text. The constant practice is grueling but effective.",
    "The course introduces a lot of important material. A lot of grammar and vocab was learned. A weakness would be the amount of work the class assigns. It takes away time from other work for other classes. Since the assignments tended to be really long, completing the work became more of a plug and chug situation to get the grammar work done. Even though these exercises were helpful, sometimes I felt it hindered my learning a little bit because I wasn't paying as much attention to what I was doing (simply because I had so much other work to focus on.",
    "I don't think the textbooks are designed in the best way to fit a student's needs. For example, much of the course is based on auditory comprehension and recognition of texts through that comprehension, which is a difficult skill to practice with the materials provided.",
    "Strength: relates grammar concepts to literature, fairly comprehensive Weaknesses: the literary analysis was not always relevant to what we were learning )it was English Literature level analysis in a language I didn't understnd.",
    "Overall this course was very good. Everything was organized, and students always had time to clarify the material they weren't comfortable on."

    "If you are taking this course, it is mostly likely because you are forced to by Yale's arcane language requirement. Personally, I felt more confident with my french abilities at the end of L3 than at the end of L4. The readings are ok; there are only a few that are actually engaging. The grammar is somewhat random but there is a lot less of it than there is in L3. In general though, try to be in a section with one of the department lecturers instead of a grad student, since they are generally better prepared and better at teaching. But all in all, I'm sorry that you have to waste 1.5 credits to take this class. Bon chance!",
    "Yes, but its hard so take mostly guts along with it!",
    "Recommended if you truly want to learn the language. Easier than L3 but the workload is still daunting. Languages are NOT a gut at this school.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that is looking to improve their french.",
    "Yes, it provides a thorough learning experience and it was a great way to improve my knowledge of the French language.",
    "Yes, but only to round off the French program at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course because the stories you work with are pretty interesting and the lessons aren't too hard to understand.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student."
