   "comments": [
    "Take it if you can!! The workload isn't overwhelming and the discussion is interesting. The 20-pg paper is manageable although just make sure you start it well in advance.",
    "A critical engagement with thematically grouped papers of Hamilton and Jefferson. Seminars compare, contrast and investigate the writings of these two formative US founders. The final paper must deal with the time period but beyond that the student is free to choose any topic, subject to instructor approval.This course provides an introduction to the early US republic through the lens of Jefferson and Hamilton. Highly recommended for juniors as preparation for senior essay writing.",
    "Definitely take it. You get to analyze in-depth the writings of two of the most complex and fascinating men in American history. The only caveat is that you will not learn as much about the period (e.g. concrete facts, dates, events etc.) as you may be expecting. But this is no reason not to take the class. In fact, it may be a reason to take it--the class is different from your ordinary history experience. Different in a really good, and interesting, way. Take it.",
    "This seminar is one of the best in the History Department. Honestly, between Blight's and Freeman's, take Freeman's. Her detailed comments on the final paper are much more constructive and she is much easier to stay in touch with throughout the semester. Oh, and the material's fantastic too.",
    "It's on the surface a history of the revolution, particularly political history, but on a deeper level, the course is a look into the personal opinions, lives, thought processes, desires, etc of two of the most famous men in American History. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in American history and all those who want to improve their writing skills in history.",
    "Absolutely. Getting to know the period through these individuals is a double whammy. And Professor Freeman is peerless at Yale for how much she cares about and will help with your writing.",
    "Highly recommended. Professor Freeman runs a great seminar and will really teach you how to write a good history paper. The material is very interesting (biographies of TJ and AH to begin with and the rest is their writings) and Professor Freeman knows it as well as anyone.",
    "Take the course! Even if you don't know much about the Founding Fathers or early America, this class is accessible to you.",
    "Prof. Freeman is GREAT: engaging and fun in seminar; generous with her time, serious, and attentive to detail when working with our term papers. Couldn't ask for more in a teacher. On the other hand, the class made me totally reconsider being a history major. If being a history major emphasizes squinting at 18th century primary sources with the hope of coming up with some kind of pathetic original point, instead of learning actual history from the historians, then I want out!",
    "The class depends a lot on student comments, so I think it really changes depending on the composition of the class. Professor Freeman is very rigorous about paper writing and wants you to do it her way. If you take this class, just be prepared because you will have to turn in a polished rough draft the week after spring break, and she will line edit it and give it back to you having changed every single sentence you wrote. Then the final draft is due during the last week of classes, before reading week. Very good material though - I would recommend it just to have the chance to read Jefferson's and Hamilton's actual letters. I thought the class was slightly overrated, but that could just be me. Also, you have no idea how she calculates the grades in this class, which would have been good to know in advance.",
    "This was a really good course. I learneda ton about early America! Readings were largely unnecessary, because it was easy to participate in class discussions without having read many of the documents and because the themes of the course made themselves clear with minimal reading. when I did read, I enjoyed the little details and quirks which were apparent in the letters. Freeman was an excellent professor, but the section was so full that \"discussions\" often degenerated into going around in a circle and having everyone share his views one at a time, which really cut into our ability to argue back and forth and tease out a nuance. I think she could have done a much better job of directing discussion, but she was great at helping our writing and at lending us some of her considerable knowledge and insight into the Founding Fathers. I learned a lot, just found discussion to be rather unfulfilling because we had to go around in a circle sharing our views, and the views didn't necessarily have anything to do with what had just been said. But if you get the chance, take the course!! You'll learn a lot and it's interesting stuff.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're really interested in the material. I was, as it turns out, only moderately interested, and since everyone else was so passionate and knowledgeable I felt a little left out. But Professor Freeman is really enthusiastic and great, and the big paper assignment is (while tough) SO helpful, especially if you're preparing to write a senior essay next year.",
    "This course is a good way into a very interesting period. It's not a philosophy course; instead of parsing the universal qualities of Hamilton and Jefferson's writings, we looked at them for evidence of their own role in politics and of early American political ideas generally. Discussions were lively, and Joanne Freeman gives great support in paper-writing--the paper was probably my favorite thing about the course. One caveat: be sure you really want to spend a semester reading things by only two people (and without much secondary literature). I enjoyed it, but I think I prefer reading a wider variety of sources."
