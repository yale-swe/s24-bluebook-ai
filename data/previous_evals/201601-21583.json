    "Not a class to take on a whim. You must be ready to buckle down and keep up with the material. It's not particularly hard, but a lot of material is covered in a short amount of time, so if you fall behind you'll have to catch up sooner rather than later, but Tim is really helpful in meeting with you and making sure you're doing ok.",
    "This class is hard but you will be amazed by everything you have accomplished at the end of it. You think it's not possible to learn a language decently in a semester, but meeting for two hours five days a week, along with outside work, makes it very possible. The class also gives new insights into language itself and may lead you to pursue interests you didn't even know you had. Professor Robinson is amazing and will look after you, especially since the class is fast-paced (though it doesn't often feel too overwhelming). If you love languages and\/or really want to learn ancient Greek, take this class.",
    "YES! You have to want it (it's a lot of work), but I thought it was totally worth it.",
    "Hard work that pays well. It is a real commitment but in the end you can actually see how far you've come."
