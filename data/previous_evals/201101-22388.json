    "Take this class! Dina is absolutely great and it is amazing how much Hebrew you will learn with her. Israeli songs, movies, ... take it!",
    "I'd recommend this course if you're interested in Hebrew, since you'd have to take it anyway. It's not too much work, and I'd say you learn a reasonable amount. You have to practice speaking and listening on your own a lot if you want to get better because there's not much of that in class.",
    "Don't take it with Dina if possible.",
    "Good course, you learn a lot of Hebrew. Not an easy language, don't take as a gut.",
    "Good class; a bit heavy workload, but that is true for every language.",
    "YES! Loved it. The intro Hebrew program is excellent, and Dina is wonderful.",
    "Hebrew is not a bad way to fill your language requirement. It's definitely a credit and a half worth of work and you have to stay on your game, but it's an enjoyable way to get your distributional requirements out of the way. Dina is not the easiest teacher, but is very good, and cares a lot about her students. You'll learn a lot, but not without hard work."
