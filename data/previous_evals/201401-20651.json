   "comments": [
    "Professor Lalli is an amazing, and peculiar, professor. The theme of this course changes every term, so it's hard to say more than that--sometimes it's pretty basic stuff (varied levels of singing ability; learning fun repertoire) and easy enough and sometimes it's a lot more challenging (more repertoire, varied subjects, regular quizzes including identification of tracks). Basically, make sure you know what's up before going in to it. But it's worth it! He takes so much time to work with everyone individually, as does Sara Kohane. She's amazing--a fantastic accompanist but also really helpful with the interpretation of the repertoire, languages, some vocal technique, and performance. The opportunity to get coachings from Sara and Lalli is amazing!! Don't pass it up.",
    "I took the course as an instrumentalist, and the course gave me great exposure to vocal music and repertoire.",
    "Music 222 is a leisurely walk through different styles of singing from Baroque arias through Tchaikovsky romances. Don't expect to be overly challenged or to have a rigorous education in music theory or analysis. Expect to sing a lot, listen to a lot of professional and fellow student musicians, and to perform some. A good low-key fifth class for singers looking for a place to try out their pieces or for instrumentalists looking to get their feet wet with vocal music.",
    "If you like to sing, take this class!",
    "Lalli knows a ton and is a really interesting guy\u2014a don't-miss resource on vocal repertoire and technique. But check whether the syllabus states what will actually be expected of you in the course, in terms of assignments, grading policies and rubrics, and final exam."
