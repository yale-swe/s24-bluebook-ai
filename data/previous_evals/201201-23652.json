   "comments": [
    "I thought this course provided a really unique perspective on a lot commonly discussed issues. I've never taken an anthropology course before, so I sometime found it frustrating that we often just talked about theories, not application. But overall, I really enjoyed the course.",
    "The course incorporates more than gender, but includes topics of race, ethnicity, nationality, etc. The theme of transnationalism and feminism resonate throughout and the differences btwn trans and international. Definitely not something I knew before taking the course.",
    "Take this course! If you learn nothing at all, you at least learn how to view politics and mass media through a more critical lens!",
    "I enjoyed it but it was a bit slow!",
    "As an introductory sociology class, this class was so refreshing. It discussed very engaging topics and was not heavy on the work at all. Just plan to spread out (or try to spread out) working on your two essays. Our class size was small enough that it turned into a lecture and was a really neat space where some of the most novel ideas were able to be exchanged. Take it!! Especially if you are looking for something a little lighter on the workload, but STILL ENGAGING, to take.",
    "Gender in a Transnational World was a wonderful introduction to WGSS.Though most of the information is perhaps nothing new to someone who has done a lot in the field of gender studies, the class style and the way the information is presented encourages constant self-evaluation of thoughts and development of a real understanding of the structural influences that shape issues of gender, race, identity, etc. The workload is definitely manageable, and the tests and essays are fair. I would definitely recommend thisclass to another student. It is one of the few classes at Yale (I believe) that really encourages learning for the purpose of learning rather than self-promotion and has really made me evaluate my educational choices (in the best way possible)."
