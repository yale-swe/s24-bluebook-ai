    "GBI is a survey of all the subjects that Adam Glick (& the other authors of the course) have decided are important for an undergraduate education. Each week, we read readings, watched videos, and watched an expert lecture about that week's subject. Then in class, we discussed the general strengths and weaknesses of that fieldi.e. is the stuff its experts are saying consistent? Are there any holes or gaps in its predictions about the world? In what ways is it ridiculous? etc. I'd recommend this course to a student who likes to argue\/debate and is okay with getting his\/her logic torn apart regularly and often brashly. The course is also fun for students who hate narrowing their interests down to one subject. Prospective students should note that Adam Glick uses the course nominally as a way to introduce students to the different fields contained within it, but primarily as a vehicle for dismissing Ivy-ish political correctness and arguing loudly and excitedly. It's definitely never boring, and it was really cool that Adam Glick got so many experts to come in and discuss their fields firsthand. There were two papers and one final group project.",
    "Great Big Ideas is the only class offered at Yale where we not only learn about ourselves, but learn to see the world through a difference lens. The class has taught me the importance of being wrong, to question the world around us, and perhaps that the world is here to both enjoy and improve. Ive learned false dichotomies--as frustrating as they are--can promote a new understanding of an issue or a new understanding of the edges of our personal morality. Without realizing it, I've begun to speak up in my discussion sections and seminars.The fear of discussing politics and philosophical questions with friends has vanished. Within the past three months, I've made persuasive arguments and plain stupid assertions, but more importantly I've been humbled by the process. Yale is no longer a place where I live in fear of being politically incorrect, but a campus where discussion is valued. This seminar is one I will never forget and has forever changed the course of my Yale career",
    "GBI is one of the best courses at Yale. If you get in, and you aren't afraid to speak your mind and defend your opinions, you should absolutely take this class.",
    "This class is interesting. Definitely not 100% good, not 100% must take but interesting. The teacher is a bit crazy, very smart, definitely not PC or traditional. He can play favorites. His grading seems a bit arbitrary and doesn't necessarily correlate to how much work you put into the class. Will make you a better arguer and thinker, but won't necessarily teach you anything concrete. You should have an opinion, speak up, not need the grade, and be able to make friends because it's way more fun with friends.",
    "Great Big Ideas is the best course I've taken at Yale. Period. End of discussion. If the course is being offered this semester, go to the first session and apply. If you're lucky enough to receive a spot in the class, TAKE IT. The course is a whirlwind tour of 12 different fields and is unlike any class you've taken or will take at Yale. In particular, the classroom is flipped (you read relevant material before class), participation is actively encouraged, and breadth is valued over depth. Adam is one of the most caring, hardworking, compassionate, and humble people you will ever meet. He will force you to challenge your convictions, to grapple with uncertainty, and to take risks. Over the course of the semester, your view of the world and of your education will constantly change. Ultimately, Great Big Ideas is a very unique and transformative experience. You'll get out of it what you put in, so be sure to prepare for each class, ask questions, participate, and keep an open mind.",
    "Your biggest mistake would be getting into this class and not taking it.",
    "I absolutely recommend it, and I have. This class will change your entire approach to education.",
    "this class is phenomenal. actually phenomenal. it's great in everyway and you should definitely try to get in if possible. what a guy.",
    "Believe the hype. Absolutely take if you can get in. Earth shattering existential crisis and change of life direction.",
    "Adam Glick's \"Great Big Ideas\" is the best course I've ever taken, both at Yale and elsewhere. It's hard to express how un-hyperbolic that statement is to someone who has never taken GBI. No other class has forced me to grow as a thinker like this seminar did. No ideas or assumptions are safe from scrutiny, as Adam guides the luckiest eighteen students at Yale through this twelve-week survey of thought. The classroom discussion was intense as we intellectually sparred with one another in a search for some truth. It got heated at times, fueled by Adam's purposefully controversial presentation, but that just added to the wealth of ideas being exchanged. Yes, Adam will say some outrageous things in this class. But the purpose is not to be obnoxious or offensive; rather, he is trying to get us to defend our values. A big thing you learn in the class is that if you find something disagreeable, you better damn know how to articulate why. The class could be considered a gut because of how little work was involved, but that would be missing the point of the class. I did not spend that much time doing work for GBI, but that freed me to spend hours bringing these new ideas spurred by GBI into late-night conversations with friends. The freedom is meant to allow the ideas to continue growing. You may not learn too many facts in this class, but you will cultivate a better understanding of how to think and how to defend your conclusions.",
    "I'd like to begin with BESIDES WATCHING YOUR CHILD BEING BORN THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST AMAZING THING TO HAPPEN TO YOU IN LIFE. I don't even know where to start. To call this merely a \"class\" would be an injustice. It's so much more than a class. I've gotten so much out of this class to the point where my answer to this questionnaire wouldn't change if I got an F rather than an A. Adam Glick will change your life forever, and shape your views on life in unimaginable ways. And you better be ready. Through heated arguments and debates to dinners with some of the most renowned thinkers, you will never be more intellectually stimulated. If you are fortunate enough to take this class you are in for the journey of a lifetime. This class alone has made my Yale experience; it is unlike anything you will ever be able to do in your life, and may be more significant than all of your other 35 credits combined. Easily. Adam Glick, I tell you, is a genius. There arent any other classes that are truly as interdisciplinary as this one. And if theres anyone who can run it, its Adam Glick, who invests so much time into each and everyone one of his students. Take it, take it, take it. It will easily be one of the most fulfilling, memorable, game-changing things you can do with your life. The rating options for this survey range from poor to excellent. I think there needs to be a special rating system designed just for this class. It should range starting from excellent as the lowest option, and have ten grades above excellent.",
    "It's hard to get in, but if you do ABSOLUTELY take this class. This course is lifechanging and I am not exaggerating. There are three things about this course that are particularly excellent. 1. Is that it is a flipped classroom so you watch video lectures and do readings at home, and class time is solely dedicated to discussion. This is great because you learn the contemporary thinking on a certain subject and the \"big ideas\" then go to class and tear all of that apart. This forces you to think critically about any information you are given (even if it is from esteemed professors or Nobel prize winners) and think for yourself whether or not you agree with it. The second remarkable thing about this class is the breadth of topics you cover. I went from knowing about maybe one or two of the subjects included on the syllabus to having a fairly decent understanding of all 15. The best part about having one class cover such a wide breadth is that you begin to notice reoccurring themes, ethical dilemmas, and questions. You begin to connect subjects and view them from a new perspective that you would not have before. Lastly, I think the most amazing thing about this class is it's overall goal. It will not give you any distributional or major credits and it doesn't help you master any specific skill (except maybe arguing haha). What Adam what's the class to do is \"not to teach you how to think, but how to live.\" And while it sounds kind of flaky and absurd, I think this is what we should be focusing more on in our education. The point of this class is to force you to question your own beliefs and discuss things you don't really know enough to take a confident stance on. To test the waters. I'm sure this class has taught me more about myself than I'm currently aware of even, but it has certainly changed the way I look at education.",
    "Great Big Ideas is a life changing course. I've never changed my mind on so many things before, and that's a good and rare thing in Yale! I've come out of this course with a profoundly changed view of life, and it's a course that I think about all the time, whether it's in discussions with friends, in other classes, or when reading the news. If you can, take it. It's a wild ride, with a truly remarkable instructor, Adam Glick, with incredibly interesting people (the class is selected for a really fascinating set of characters). This course should really be available for more people!",
    "A class that tears apart a different subject each week. This is one of the rare classes that will change your life, if you let it."
