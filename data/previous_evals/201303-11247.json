   "comments": [
    "Semmel was a great professor to have, good at leading discussions. Occasionally we got caught up in minutia but that was infrequent and even then they were interesting debates.",
    "Great panorama of historical and political thought, highly recommended for its discussion of complex ideas and the strong foundation it gives you in political philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend both DS and this section. DS in general: it's a lot of work, but the content is fantastic, the professors and classmates really outstanding, and the papers really aren't that bad. You will learn so much. H&P is the least fulfilling in the fall because it wiggles back and forth between straight history and political philosophy, but the texts are interesting, and it's still worth it. Professor Semel is a great guy and a smart, interesting professor. He's really thoughtful and also works hard to let the students run the flow of the discussion, which usually is effective (though occasionally leads to some odd tangents). He also gives good feedback on papers and grades very fairly.",
    "H\/P was probably my favorite and least favorite of the DS strands this semester: the history part was my favorite, the politics part was my least favorite. They really are two different things. Overall, the course emphasizes political thought over history, but some of the historians are really interesting (Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy, and Tacitus were the five historians we read; Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Augustine, Maimonides, and Aquinas were the political thinkers).As far as Professor Semmel goes, he has a great sense of humor. He returns papers slowly, but that's not a huge deal. The fall semester reading list is not his speciality, but he does a good job with it.",
    "History and Politics is definitely the weakest of the DS courses first semester because the texts are not as interrelated to each other. Still, Aristotle's Politics, Livy and Herodotus are incredibly influential works and worth reading and discussing with other DS students. Professor Semmel is a very nice person and his sense of humor creates a comfortable class atmosphere. Still, he does not lead particularly productive sections and allows the class to get onto long digressions led by the most vocal members of the class. Compared to the other DS classes, Professor Semmel's grading is much easier although he takes a very long time to return papers. If you're looking for a section that is not extremely stressful or difficult but is still at times entertaining and interesting, Professor Semmel's section is a good choice.",
    "A comprehensive overview of Western historical and political thought from Herodotus' The History to Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologae. I would recommend this course, but not as highly as the other directed studies courses, and I think that a lot needs to be improved in it.",
    "I would say that this course is a great summary of the history and political thought of Rome and Greece, in addition to some Islamic writers. It is an interesting course but the subject is very specific to a particular student interest group. I would recommend this class to a student who loves reading about history and government.",
    "Professor Semmel is a wonderful guy. He's super sweet and usually runs a pretty strong class. If you have him, you should probably keep him. He is a great friend and has a great sense of humor. However, sometimes he lets the class discussion get a little off topic. Still, he's a great professor and a super nice dude.",
    "H&P was the least enjoyable of the three sections to me, but I still feel like the experience of reading what we did - and absolutely read all of it, it's manageable - was an invaluable one. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to put in the work and explore some of the readings outside of section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it does an amazing job in introducing a student the relationship between history and political thought that has shaped western development.",
    "This course provided a great balance between historical readings (Herodotus, Thucydides...) and political philosophy (Plato, Aristotle...). Sometimes the history aspect could get a little redundant but in general these two types of readings complemented each other very well.",
    "DS rocks. Take it!!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend DS to everyone. First semester of H&P seemed a little unguided, but it's worth it to take the rest of the classes."
