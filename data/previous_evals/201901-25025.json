   "comments": [
    "I gained hands-on lab experience in which I determined salivary cortisol levels. I also learned how to record this lab experience into a lab notebook in order to more fully learn from each lab and make future labs run more smoothly.",
    "So much!! I learned the scientific method all over which I didn't realize I needed. I learned specific skills like micropipetting but also how to think about science. I also learned a bunch about excel which I didn't expect to learn and how to reach science papers.",
    "I learned lab safety skills, pipetting skills, and how to work collaboratively in a laboratory. I also learned about the nature of hormone analysis and how to run\/read an immunoassay kit.",
    "I learned a lot about lab protocol, performing assays, and data analysis.",
    "I learned how to use micropipettes and run an hormone ELISA. I also learned that labwork is not for me!",
    "I learned how to conduct biological anthropology research.",
    "Wow, so much! The crucial difference between a hypothesis and prediction, statistical analysis, how to draft a project proposal, poster-making, basic hormonal processes, thinking in critical, scientific ways. I learned so much through this class!",
    "This class improved my confidence in lab work and my knowledge on how to undertake my own projects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The small class size allows the instructors to get to know students and fully support them. We are given enough time, practice, and support to understand and perform labs well in a comfortable environment.",
    "A strength to the course was definitely the small size of the class because our instructors had time to dedicate to each student. Also, having the accompanying discussion prior also made it very clear what the plan for the day was. Some days were, understandably, a little slow and maybe having more practice with the pippetors would be useful during those slow days.",
    "The strengths of this course was that we learned much about lab protocol and specific assays. The weaknesses of this course was that much of the learning was read out to us or presented during lab time, and I personally that feel that the students could have taken it upon ourselves to learn the key points about lab protocol and then be given more time in the lab to practice.",
    "Strengths: great opportunity for undergrads to get involved with labwork in an accessible, friendly, community-based way Weaknesses: sometimes Maggie and Claudia wouldn't use lab time for lab, but instead just continue with lecture. This was brutal, and it was really hard to focus for such an extended period of time. Also, the in-lab minilectures on hormone elizas were not very clear.",
    "I thought the class did a great job of teaching everyone how to conduct scientific research. I think the final research project was a bit too ambitious but enjoyed the process in general.",
    "Strengths: The seminar setting, openness to working with students of varying levels of science experience, individual attention, necessary scaffolding, such kind and committed teachers! Additionally, the weekly reading responses were so helpful and I loved how we went over them in class together, so we could hear what our peers were thinking. It made me feel so much more comfortable in sharing my own ideas. Weaknesses: I wish the engagement with academic material (e.g. reading responses) persisted through the entire class (decreasing a bit towards the end but not disappearing entirely, as it did at the end of this class)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student that has has little or no lab experience if they are looking for a good place to begin gaining lab experience, as well as to students that have some lab experience but would like to learn about studying hormones in humans. This is an engaging course, so I would also recommend that students that take it be willing and able to fully participate so that they can gain the most out of it.",
    "Yes!! It was incredibly beneficial to me. I didn't think I ever could do lab work before I took this.",
    "Yes! I feel like lab classes at Yale have a poor reputation for being incredibly stressful and a lot of work. This course was nothing like that and I don't feel like I lost out on any of the learning experience of a lab course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that has never worked in a lab before or led their project within their lab. The freedom given to the students to perform their own assays instead of rigidly following an experimental outline with a clear outcome will change students' perspectives on lab work.",
    "If you are interested in science and have never worked in a lab setting, then definitely yes! The time commitment is a little hard to swallow at first, but there is very little outside of class work for lab (1 hour \/ week) and its 0.5 credits, so I think its worth it!",
    "I would, its a great way to learn whether you would like a career in STEM or not.",
    "Absolutely absolutely absolutely! Especially if you want an introduction to thinking about\/engaging with science and a chance to learn with others and have more intimate, conversation-based learning.",
    "Yes, it is a very engaging and interesting class that teaches valuable skills for those wishing to gain confidence in lab work."
