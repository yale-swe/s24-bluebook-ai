   "comments": [
    "The class is great! It delves into how technology can help tackle global challenges. It is definitely a useful course for life and very eye-opening. I would very strongly recommend this class to another student.",
    "Easily one of the best courses I have ever taken.",
    "This class was about discussing global challenges and creating\/discussing technical solutions to those challenges. The basic idea was to look at a variety of different challenges\/solutions and use those to build a latticework of mental models to solve future challenges. We also worked on writing product requirement docs (PRDs) to explain our solutions in a concise manner. The seminar was very well run. Everyone did the readings and we had some great discussions, and Justin did of good job of adding his commentary while letting the class discuss. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "A must take if it is offered again. You will learn amazing things, challenge yourself and be constantly held to a standard of excellence that will be refreshing and a wonderful academic exercise. Everybody should take a class like this - and after a few initial glitches get sorted out- this will turn into one of the best Yale classes ever if it is continued. The field trip was amazing- seeing Google's insides and talking to some really cool guys. Justin himself is a great guy to learn so much for. Really, if this kind of class is there again (and I think there should be more of this), you should not even be thinking about not taking it. TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Phenomenally interesting course about technology and it's evolving uses to tackle serious global challenges. I guarantee it will raise your interest in the tech world no matter your background. Justin is great!",
    "Take this class if you want to create your own online applications, want to work as a product manager or if you're just generally interested in online products. Also take it if you want a writing credit without writing standard essays. It is not a gut class though, you will need to do (almost all of) the reading and put work into the product requirement documents that you write for your midterm and final. Conclusion: interesting class, not very academic but I'd take it again, learned a lot.",
    "Yes definitely take this class if you are interested in product management! Or technology or global challenges. Super interesting, my favorite class of the semester. The reading are interesting for the most part, and the workload is pretty low. For the two essays, just make sure you have an awesome idea. Highly recommend!",
    "This class has by far been one of my favorite seminars at Yale. I might be biased because it covered topics I was really interested in: basically finding ways to use technology to improve the world. I think the fact the class was at 7pm really helped it. Even if you were having a rough day by the time it gets to evening you've regained enough energy to be able to really participate in discussion. Really learned so much from both the professor, who's had the coolest experiences as a Product Manager for Google Ideas, and the students in seminar, who were all amazingly smart, interesting, and all seemed to have ridiculously diverse double majors for some reason (e.g. MechE and Global Affairs, wat) Definitely a class I would recommend to anyone if it gets offered again.",
    "Yes! Definitely. This class is awesome and should really be offered again. It's been a great semester, because of the teacher (Justin's pretty cool), the guests who come to visit and share their real world experiences and just sort of ask for your opinions and thoughts, and the topics themselves. Of course, another great thing is the people who take the class, and the discussions we had were really interesting and thoughtful.",
    "If it's offered again, take it!",
    "Take this course! Interesting readings, great discussions. Reading is manageable.",
    "If you ever have the opportunity to take it you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD. This is probably Yale's best class.",
    "I would recommend it highly to both CS and Global Affairs students, but especially to CS students. I think it's fun to start thinking about products in a class setting, which is rare in the major.",
    "This was a fantastic course--ranking as one of the best I've taken in my four years at Yale. The material was fascinating, timely and relevant and superbly well supplemented by real-world tech design reports and visiting guests. The assignments were a great forum for creativity and gave you a chance to go through the product design process (with feedback from a current Google Product Manager for Google Ideas--pretty useful, one might say). I strongly recommend this class, both for tech-oriented folks and those with humanities\/global affairs interests.",
    "I would strongly recommend GLBL 341 to a fellow student. Over the semester I learned application-specific details (concepts about prospective users, etc.), but more importantly developed significantly in my critical analysis skills surrounding technological design. This course was, as I have said elsewhere, the best I have taken so far at Yale: it attacked issues from all levels - looking at the overarching concepts all the way down to the small but important details. Having now designed real-world technical solutions to significant global challenges, I feel better suited to design other projects or applications going forwards.",
    "If you want to learn how to apply technology to global challenges, theorizing about it in this course will leave you with nothing real gained (at least compared to other Yale courses). The class discussions were useless. Maybe (if the course were rebuilt completely) this class would do better as a lecture, so maybe you could consider taking it then. But I would very much suggest that if you want to learn about this subject, that they invest instead in a global affairs\/political science course dedicated to a specific global issue, mix it with elements from a mechanical, electrical or computer engineering course, and learn how to apply and build product interventions in that context. There are also other courses at Yale where you can actually build technology in class and apply the designs to specific global problems, which I think sound like much better uses of time than this class. This class will teach you NONE. OF. THIS. If somehow this class is taught again (and in its current form, I really really do not think that it should be), I think it would be a much better use of the students' and the class\u2019 time to decide on a few global challenges to explore MUCH further (internet security in revolution contexts, health care supply chains in India, whatever.), spend the whole semester learning about the nuances of those specific global challenges, and learn to apply tech design concepts to that challenge accordingly. Maybe the professor would be open to that - so as a student you could push for that type of syllabus. However, if the class structure doesn\u2019t change tremendously, DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. If you have the least bit of background in global affairs, you don\u2019t learn anything substantial new about tech design, and the shallowness with which issues are discussed will be really frustrating. If you have the least bit of background in engineering or product design, you ESPECIALLY don\u2019t learn anything new - not about tech and not about global affairs. You will also spend your semester working with a professor who is arbitrary and biased, and you will not (intellectually or academically) enjoy your time in this class, except for the free food and random Google swag, which honestly would be a really dumb reason to waste a Yale course credit on. THIS COURSE MAY SOUND REALLY COOL (AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN), BUT THE ACTUAL CLASS TIME ITSELF ENDED UP BEING A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME."
