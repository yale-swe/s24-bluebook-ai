    "I would highly recommend this course to any senior in the Music Department. Shostakovich is the most performed 20th century composer and his status in the canon is quickly rising, yet the amount of time spent on his music in the Music History sequence is not proportional given the prominence of this composer. By the time you leave this course, you will know more about Shostakovich and his works than you will probably know about any other composer you have studied in the music curriculum at Yale.",
    "McCreless is brilliant and nice. Shostakovich is one of the most important composers to study because his life and music was a battle ground for ideas about a composer's role in society, politics and music, and the balance between tradition and innovation in form and harmony. You really need a course devoted to surveying his works and digging into some of the larger and more famous ones in order to really appreciate what's going on in those battlegrounds. I came into this course thinking Shostakovich was the composer every teen needs to worship during their angsty phase and then move on from, but I'm amazed at how much more there is. To paraphrase McCreless, this class is a page turner until the very end.",
    "Shostakovich is an amazing composer, nuff said."
