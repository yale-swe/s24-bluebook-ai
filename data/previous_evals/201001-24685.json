   "comments": [
    "Take it for the unique perspective on history and take it for Professor Gaddis.",
    "Study of biography - both fictional and nonfictional (whats the difference anyway). You read a book a week but discussion normally segues into more global musings on the writing of history and biography as opposed to in depth discussion on each book.",
    "This class is fine, and if you have taken a Gaddis lecture and loved him, then I would take the class. But I wouldn't take it just because you think you should--there are better classes at Yale. Writing a biography is a fun project.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The reading list is much more diverse than one might expect, and the professor brings a blend of curiosity and authority that makes discussion stimulating. Highly recommended!",
    "This class is very enjoyable and laid back. The writing assignments, if you put a reasonable about of effort, should not be too bad at all. And Gaddis always makes the seminar interesting.",
    "yes",
    "If you get the opportunity, take it. A lot of work. But, eventually rewarding. The syllabus is fantastic.",
    "A book a week. Three challenging writing assignments. Professor Gaddis expects a lot from his students and has high standards. If you put in the work, the entire experience will be extremely rewarding. You will need to write a long biography term paper. Professor Gaddis is very passionate about biography as a form of history and the fact that he is working on a biography of his own makes the class even more interesting.",
    "Fantastic class but be ready to work. It has been one of my most challenging and rewarding classes at Yale. I learned a lot about myself as a writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar. However, be prepared not only for a great amount of reading and writing, but also a very draining experience. Writing the autobiography was the most difficult assignment I've ever had in college. In order to truly meet Gaddis's expectations- and your own- it was necessary to write something that required a lot of introspection. That process can be painful. In addition, I found writing the biography to be an extremely rewarding experience, but very isolating. Devoting oneself to dutifully analyzing another person's life is a daunting task that shouldn't be taken lightly. However, the benefits of the course are great; it is wonderful to end the year with two pieces of writing that you can truly be proud of.",
    "If you manage to get into this class, consider yourself lucky. It was a profound academic experience. Professor Gaddis is an amazing teacher. The final project for the class, writing a biography on a subject of your choice, is not only a rewarding experience but also a fun one. I recommend this course without the slightest hesitation.",
    "Of course. Take it if you can get in.",
    "This class is like the John Gaddis book club. The biographies do not focus on only one area of history so except for the discussion of his successful the biographer was, each class is distinct from the previous ones. Still, Prof. Gaddis is a great teacher no matter the subject of the biography.The final paper is challenging but also rewarding and (I hope) great prep for the senior essay. It forced me to use th archival materials Yale offers in a way other hsitory seminars have not."
