    "The class is difficult but excellent. At once demanding and relaxing. The pace is fast and the material is complex, but the learning atmosphere is engaging and fun.",
    "Its a great class if you want to learn sanskrit.",

    "If I go on to PhD work in Religious Studies, I think Sanskrit will not only be required, but extremely important in that work. So, it deepens my work by giving me access to important texts. This course has also had a profound effect upon my conception of language learning. It has been a very positive experience. A great semester."
