    "Economy of Japan and its path in the 1980s and 90s. And related economies like China Eurozone and USA.",
    "I strengthened my understanding of forensic macroeconomics",
    "I learned the skill of forensic macro. This essentially means being able to digest the research around a certain narrative of an economic phenomenon and then looking for economic phenomena similar to the central phenomenon that was researched and well-understood. In this seminar we first looked at the causes of the \"Lost Decades\" of post-1989 Japan and then spent the rest of the semester looking for parallels between certain national and regional economies that had gone through similar crises since then, are currently going through similar crises, or are vulnerable to similar crises."

    "Strengths: robust classroom discussion Professor Roach interesting material engaging assignments Weakness: too many readings to actually do it all",
    "One of the most engaging courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "This class is perfect!",
    "Lecture style with opportunities to ask questions",
    "Very well structured. Very good lectures and clear arc to the entire course. Student presentations integrated well into the course. One improvement would be to have more discussion of yen suppression. I think that was an important issue that deserved more in class discussion.",
    "Course is very well organized in a way that's great for learning. Can't think of too many weaknesses.",
    "I thought the structure of the course was great as is. I liked the half-and-half structure of the first part of each class being Roach's explanation of and subsequent discussion of the week's readings followed by the second half of a student presentation taking the week's area of focus further."

   "comments": [
    "As long as you are okay doing a decent amount of work, I highly recommend this course. First and foremost, you do learn a lot. The first half of the class is Japan-centric, and then in the second half you apply these lessons to the world at large. I didn't have a particular interest in Japan beforehand, but it is an interesting way to look at the world. Professor Roach is a solid professor. He is very accessible for office hours and even took the class out to dinner on the last day. Obviously, he's a superstar and has a lot of interesting stories about his encounters with world leaders. The grading seems to be reasonable. Prof. Roach gives VERY detailed feedback, but rarely gives a 100% on anything. I would have preferred fewer readings, but hey, thats a Yale seminar.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, 100%. One of the best Econ courses Ive taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. It's the best Econ class I have taken at Yale. The knowledge and skills you developed from this course will be lifetime assets!",
    "Yes! Great econ seminar",
    "Yes. Prof. Roach is really nice and helpful and gives great feedback. Weekly responses one final paper two small papers and a presentation. All are manageable and have clearly stated expectations. If you try it shouldnt be too hard you just have to stay on top of things",
    "Prof. Roach is great. The class really helped me solidify my Macro knowledge by analyzing Japan and then analyzing other economies by comparing to the Japanese experience.",
    "Yes, the professor is great, very knowledgeable and kind.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. Anyone interested in leverage and financial crises should take this course."
