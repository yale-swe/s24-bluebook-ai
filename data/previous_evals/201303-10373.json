    "It's a pretty laid-back class - you watch a Forman film once a week and write a response. Midterm is a screenplay (which is relatively easy and fun to write) and final paper is ~10 pages. Forman films are definitely hit-or-miss...don't just take it because you liked One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest because everyone likes that movie. Overall, I'd recommend it. KvK is hilarious.",

    "Definitely if you want to learn about European movies and have fun",
