    "This is the first required class for the Religious Studies major. It has a great series of readings, so really try to do them. It's easy to let readings fall by the wayside, especially Junior Spring, but the class is almost exclusively reading and discussing, so it's in your best interest to structure the time to do the assigned readings. Also, the class only meets once a week for a two-hour slot, so you have to be on your game. If it comes at a rough point in your week, bring snacks.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It is wonderfully and passionately taught, the readings are excellent and manageable, the discussions are enthralling and illuminating and just fun. You start by reading the classic writers on religion and transition into a more issue-based approach. Professor Khawaja is particularly skilled at directing the comments (without being overbearing) to always make a productive and interesting discussion. This is also a perfect class for non-religious studies majors: it is a wonderful and thorough introduction to the subject and your classmates will all be passionate about the material (it is required for junior religious studies majors).",
    "It's required for RLST, but I took it just for fun, and would recommend it as a stand-alone class to non-majors as well.",
    "The readings take forever. But if you're a major you have to complete this course. By the end of the semester the early philosophers begin to make sense and you can see their usefulness. Tough it out."
