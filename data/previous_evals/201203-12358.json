   "comments": [
    "Class gives a pretty good foundation for learning financial accounting. Important to keep up with the readings as that will be the most helpful in getting through the course. Everything basically comes straight from the book and its authors.",
    "You can learn everything from the book (though the book has some typos). Since the class requires you to read the chapter and answer questions online before that chapter is covered in class, class ends up being really boring (especially at 9AM). Overall, this class is a good introduction to basic accounting.",
    "It is a pretty boring class, but if you want to do anything in business it's good to know. I think you should take it if you want to go into business, just don't expect it to blow you away as far as quality.",
    "Take it if you are going into finance or accounting.",
    "take it if you're looking to go into finance\/business. also great to take cr\/d",
    "Yes. If you are going into business \/ finance, you must know accounting. it is getting harder and harder to pass as a liberal arts student who knows nothing about the real world. you can learn accounting on your own, but why not learn it in detail in a class environnment?",
    "Introduction to accounting. Straight forward, class with weekly homework assignments, a midterm and a final. It's early, but you should come to class because it is required in the syllabus.",
    "Yes if you need it for your career and won't be able to learn it on your own. No if otherwise.",
    "Good course if interested in the material.",
    "Yes, because everyone should take ACCT but not a great class",
    "Highly recommend this course if you're interested in finance (partly because there are no other undergrad options). It offers a great intro to Accounting. The book is fantastic and the online module is a good learning tool. Midterm, Final, and homework assignments were all reasonable. That being said, 9AM class is tough (especially with attendance) and you have to self teach yourself the material",
    "Take this course at your own risk. Most of the people who take this course are peoplewho plan to work in finance after graduation and only take it because it looks good on their resume. The professor is awful, and he only makes it worse by requiring you to come to class. He never answers his emails. How can a professor teach a class and NEVER answer an email? He drones and doesn't bring anything to the material that you cannot get from the book. Luckily, the exams are multiple choice and he makes the class sign up for an online study tool designed by the book's publisher in order to practice the material. While simplistic I found this tool helpful to better grasp the material. I found the exams relatively straightforward since they were mostly multiple choice with a few short answers. However, the final exam was SO UNFAIR. He gave about three-fourths of the class a copy of one of the chapters and then when he ran out of copies allowed the the rest of the class to use their books. How can a professor allow a quarter of the class to use their books on an exam while the other three-fourth's of the class uses one chapter that was photocopied?!?! Schiffres needs to retire, because he clearly does not care about his students, nor the course.",
    "I wish the class had another midterm to help give students a sense of how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing. Going into the final, the midterm was the only assignment that I had received a grade from. I really have little idea what my grade will be. While I may regret taking this course if I do poorly, I do think this is a useful subject to learn. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be going into banking after graduation, and I found that this class definitely improved my intuitive sense of how companies work, even after doing an internship beforehand.",
    "Great intro!",
    "This should be a must take class for everyone.",
    "good"
