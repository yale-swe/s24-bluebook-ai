    "I learned how to speak, read, and write French with more fluency.",
    "My French improved drastically. I am now more comfortable reading, writing, and speaking. Though I had already learned most of the concepts taught in this course before, I feel that this course taught me those concepts in a more nuanced, and generally correct way. I would not have the level of proficiency with these concepts had I not taken this course. I also learned far more! My vocabulary is far larger than it had been before the course.",
    "This course greatly improved my French language skills. It reinforced into my brain many topics I learned from 121 last semester. We also went through a lot of books, which helped my reading abilities a lot."

   "comments": [
    "Reading novels and watching films keeps the class interesting. Full immersion into the language is good but 5 days a week can be exhausting. It is difficult to keep up with the course work in an engaged manner because there is so much.",
    "I thought the course was very well designed to improve the fluency of all students, I really liked the immersion model.",
    "The seminar style class was useful in facilitating conversation and helping other students understand words or ideas that are not clear when the professor first explained them. The weakness of the course is that if a student is struggling, it can be difficult to find help. It is possible that those resources were advertised at the beginning of the semester, but I had a difficult time finding extra help.",
    "One strength of the course is that it immerses you into French language for an hour each day of the week. When you only here French during this time, it's easy to develop language skills and to start thinking in the language. A weakness would be the fact that French in the classroom can't fully prepare you for French in the real world. There are differences between what is being taught and the vernacular a young French person would use when they speak."

   "comments": [
    "If it is for your language requirement, sure.",
    "The French classes at Yale are really well taught, and this was no exception. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their fluency.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if a student is really interested in learning at this slower rate. I would recommend the L3\/L4 intensive track for students interested in learning the language at a faster rate, and who go in with good French already.",
    "Yes. This course is a great way to improve you French skills. The content you go over is enjoyable. The books and films you study are interesting and fun to talk about. Being immersed in the language and culture for an hour each day helps advance your abilities substantially."
