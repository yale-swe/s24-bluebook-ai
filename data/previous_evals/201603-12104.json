   "comments": [
    "- gained insight on what concepts or topics are of primary interest in other disciplines when it comes to talking about racial formation (I.e. \"Democracy\" in political science, \"aesthetics\" in art history, \"narrative\" in history, etc.)",
    "This course was an excellent survey of the intellectual and political history of African American studies. Weekly writing exercises helped me think through how African American studies across the disciplines connected to my own work and world views.",
    "I gained a much more thorough perspective on what interdisciplinary studies means and I gained insight into how to incorporate different methodologies and sources into my work.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of major historical and methodological issues guiding African-American Studies as a field in the course. It was interesting to trace the development of race as a concept, through various disciplines and historical periods. I think that it will prove useful in my work.",
    "Through our class discussions and the added expertise of Professor Lebron, I was able to gain a more critical perspective into the historical and social constructions of race and identity within African American studies. These insights allowed me to take an interdisciplinary perspective when examining questions surrounding race and identity formation within my own research. This class was invaluable and Professor Lebron played an intricate role in fostering a safe and inclusive environment, but also challenging us as graduate students to think more critically about these issues.",
    "A foundation in African American intellectual and creative thought. We covered everything From Du Bois' double consciousness to Dorthy Roberts' examination of race in the field of medicine. As someone who studies African Americans in the twentieth century, I greatly appreciated the wide variety of texts assigned in this class.",
    "This was good introductory course for a student in the Af-Am department who had not done that type of work in undergrad. I was introduced to some of the important literature and scholars in this field and began to explore the creation of race in the United States.",
    "I gained a lot of insight and skills from this course. Some of the particular skills learned was researching scholarly journals and preparing proposals. Overall the greatest skill was how to begin putting together a prospectus of a potential research topic.",
    "I learned much knowledge and insights around the relationships between racism and capitalism. I also learned and developed deeper ideas around the ways in which conceptions of blackness and whiteness are formed in the United States. And when ideas associated with these races become economically, socially and politically relevant."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - gave opportunity to have conversations across disciplines about how the material being covered relates to their field, making for a very lively discussion - professor was willing to seek feedback and adjusted the class as necessary Weaknesses: - discussion could have been more directly related to the process of theorizing (comparing, contrasting, expanding) concepts of racial formation - could have included more recent texts on the subject - should not have cut the more recent texts from the syllabus - should have included more artistic texts (literary, art history, music, etc.)",
    "Strengths: -Student introductions of weekly readings were a great way to really dive into critical issues within the text and also to get to know peers and what resonated with them -Socratic seminar-style facilitation enabled really thoughtful and well-directed discussion -I really liked the journal review exercise because it was an opportunity to situate oneself in the discipline more clearly -Professor Lebron was flexible and responsive to students' needs -The content was strong and covered a wide range of the discipline -Guest speakers coming in to talk about their own trajectory in the field was really helpful for learning about different pathways through academia\/helping us anticipate or situate future selves and what we should be doing to reach those goals Room for growth -I wish students had the opportunity to share and discuss some of the work they were doing. This could have been helpful for fostering a culture of future collaboration and also helped us on our research prospectuses -We did not feedback on our journal review exercises. I would have liked feedback to help me think through my research prospectus more clearly -I would have liked more direction on our research prospectus - its format or key resources to leverage",
    "Strengths of the course include the formatting - having a week for viewing materials at the Beinecke early on pushed me to think about my final project early on. A weakness of the course is that some of the assignments such as the scholarly journal assignment were not very integrated into the rest of the course. I would have preferred to do such an assignment in coordination with the final project on a topic that related to my research prospectus.",
    "One of the strengths of the class was its engagement with the topic of racial formation. I think that was useful, and highlighted most clearly in our discussions of DuBois, Ngritude and Stuart Hall. I think an area for improvement would be a deeper engagement with the contemporary issues raised by black studies about the topic of blackness itself. I wonder what this might have to do with the idea of a course about racial formations in the United States, which, at least on a nominal level, seems to orient the curriculum towards a more sociological and historical outlook. There's something to be said for a more theoretical engagement with the topic of race and blackness, although the class, as it stands, was nevertheless very useful for me.",
    "Strengths- -having graduate students from different home departments, such as, sociology, history, political science, English, American studies, art history. -the combination of those perspectives and disciplines coming out in our discussions, especially when posing questions for discussion. Weaknesses- -clearer and more accurate syllabus. Was a bit confusing at times keeping up with what was due and when, in addition to what needed to be read. -student presentations were too long, I believe as a class we gained much more by jumping directly into the discussion questions.",
    "The wide variety of texts, class discussions, presentations were all strengths.",
    "I enjoyed the class discussion very much, because of the range of knowledge that was brought to the class I felt like I was able to learn a lot about this new field I was entering. Unfortunately, I was not always sure how to completely engage with the text and days when we had a guest speaker, it did not feel as if we got to the important content of the readings we did for class.",
    "The strength of this course is the focus on helping first year grad school students to think other parts of the PhD process outside of the classroom. Such as the writing of prospectus, journal survey, and speaking with librarians about access to archival materials. The weakness of the class is probably less focus on racial theorizing and understanding some of the discourses associated with racial theories.",
    "The strengths of the course was the instructors ability to engage with the students. The class discussions were always rich and fruitful. Some of the readings seemed superfluous but the strength of the course was definitely the instructors devotion to the students and ensuring that class discussions remained intellectually fruitful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I believe that this course is an important one for all students to understand how pervasive race and racism are in structuring U.S. and other white supremacist\/anti-black societies. Although I think that the class could have been run better to facilitate more contemporary theorizing about racial formations, I still believe that the course is an important one for students of all disciplines.",
    "I would for all the reasons that I cited in my previous response",
    "Yes, as it pushed me to engage with material I typically do not work with which was both challenging and eye-opening.",
    "Yes, because the ability to bring so many wonderful students with varying expertise is probably unlike any other course another student has taken. This was a special course!",
    "Absolutely. In today's political and cultural climate, this class is more important than ever before. I would highly recommend another student take this course. Regardless of what your field of study is, America's preoccupation with race is so ubiquitous that there will always be an opportunity to incorporate theories on racial formation into your research.",
    "Yes, I would. I think overall the class needs to be taken by anyone who joins the Af-Am department.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The readings are broad in terms of themes and periods and it offers a firm foundation in the field of African American Studies.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. There were many benefits to learning about racial theorizing. The book list was a very good collection of diverse authors and research methods. It is unlikely to find another course like this throughout the university.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to others. While sometimes the readings were excessive the conversations were riveting and I learned a lot about race and the multifaceted functions of race in the United States"
