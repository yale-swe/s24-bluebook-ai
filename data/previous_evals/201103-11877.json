    "I would recommend it. Not too much work and pretty interesting especially if you have no prior knowledge about science policy.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in science policy. Prof. Fleming has a lot of personal experience in the field and, more importantly, has a lot of really cool friends. Much of the course was a set of seminars with lots of interesting people: President Levin, a congressman, an NPR reporter, a former NSF director, a former NASA director, a physics nobel laureate, Yale's PR chief, and more. The only downside to all of these guest lecturers is that the course didn't really seem to have a clear direction. It was also Prof. Fleming's first time teaching the course so I imagine it will only get better. She was genuinely interested in the subject, a pretty good lecturer, and interacted amazingly well with the students given that the course was a midsize lecture. The workload was pretty minimal (3 short policy briefs and a final paper) and quite interesting. I took this class credit\/D as a 5th credit; with no concern for my grade, it was very easy and it was great to just come in and listen to these cool people talk without having to take notes or anything of the sort.",
    "Great way to get informed about science policy and pick up a writing credit on the way. I'd say about 3\/4 of this class was science or engineering students. I'd recommend it because the discussions are actually quite interesting and the textbook is not dense and unbearable.",
    "Great class if you need a WR\/ want to see cool speakers",
    "The main assignments are \"policy briefs\" that do not connect with lectures and were so confusing that each TA would give different instructions. Additionally, only number grades were returned, as briefs and grader comments were never actually returned to students. The material is stupidly obvious.Professor Fleming announced sections halfway through the course - I'm pretty sure that's not allowed without additional credit being awarded. This course is a trainwreck. It's an easy trainwreck that's a decent gut for science majors, perhaps, but its lack of transparency and organization make create too much aggravation for me to recommend it.",
    "Really great class. Exciting and venerable guest speakers, and gets you a great perspective on how science is funded and how these policies are enacted, which is useful for someone intending to go into the sciences, but also probably interesting to others.",
    "This is a fairly easy writing course (with a long final paper) that gives you a chance to explore issues that bridge science and public policy. I found the papers really fun and fairly easy to write. Aside from the work you put in and the speakers, feel free to skip most lectures.",
    "Good class, great WR credit for science majors. Guest speakers are big plus you get some good ones.",
    "This course is very good. Do not miss lectures. Do not miss sections. But above all, do not miss the amazing guest lectures. You will learn things about the real world and how stuff gets done. The papers in this course are fun to write if you think about your topic before you dive in. All in all, it is an excellent way to get a writing credit.",
    "interesting class; great guest speakers.",
    "Good class, though there was definitely too much emphasis on exposition and not enough on analysis. The guest lecturers are plentiful and most are pretty interesting though, which makes up for the less exciting bits of the course.",
    "Great writing credit and offers the opportunity to do research for papers about current science policy issues. Lectures are boring and unrelated to anything you'll write about. Class participation was graded, which was ridiculous, since it was a large class--unless you were one of the kids constantly forcing your way into the conversation, in which case everyone else hated you, there was no way the professor could recognize your participation level.",
    "Sometimes interesting, sometimes dry. I enjoyed learning how science policy is actually made, and getting a glimpse of what big science means to this country and in the world. However, most of the guest lecturers were really boring, and the class wasn't as practical as I thought it would be.",
    "This is a really great course to take. It gives you a unique perspective on science and how it related to public policy\/how it affects public policy. I had never thought much about the relationship between the two until this class, and it is a very interesting thing to think about. The course work is minimal, but very interesting and relevant to all citizens of the country and especially of the scientific community and political science community.",
    "This class is a good introduction to lobbying in science policy and the politics of science. Flemming is a really good professor and the lectures are as interesting as science policy can be. Guest lectures are awesome, try to go to them all. The writing memos are not too difficult, make sure you get it right if you mess up the first one. Get Adrian as your TA he doesn't bs you.",
    "Phys 320 is a GREAT writing credit for science majors.",
    "if you like science policy then this is a good class. that said the textbook is super boring and at a very very low level, i.e. it's like a textbook you'd expect for a middle school class. However, Bonnie&the TFs are great and they make up for the horrible textbook. The one caveat is they do tend to talk about women in science A LOT...so if you're not a girl in science then you might find it a bit tedious...",
    "easy WR credit. 3 memos, 1 final paper. sections = worthless. readings = unnecessary (don't buy the textbook). cool guest speakers. worth taking for an easy WR!",
    "People are probably going to destroy these evals, but I thought the class was good. I understand that this is the first year that professor Fleming is offering the course, and this is why there are kinks that need to be ironed out. That said, I think it has a lot of promise, and will probably end up being the easiest writing credit ever for science majors. I felt like we didn't have a lot of guidance on the policy memos, there was no rubric, so we didn't even really know what we did wrong and the grades on the memos felt kind of arbitrary. The memos had almost nothing to do with the class, which was weird, and I think next year the memos need to be discussed in class, so that everyone gets the same message. Like, go through this is what a memo should be, this is the structure, this is why this example is good and this is why it's bad, etc. The guest speakers were amazing, and they all had really great perspectives to offer, and since they were the main reason I signed up for the class, I pretty much got what I was expecting. I'm kind of worried about my grade because they never released averages on the memos, and I have NO idea if they're going to like my paper (since that seemed to be what determined my grades on the memos).Also, and this was really annoying, we had NOOOO idea what was expected of us on the paper. The TAs would all say different things, then the professor would say something different in class when we asked what the format would be. Even as I was writing, I had just kind of decided that I was going to do what I thought they wanted, and stop caring about what they had said on about 4 different occasions, so that is really scary.Bottom line: if Professor Fleming comes up with formats that she wants us to follow for the memos and papers, then this will definitely be a class worth taking, but if nothing changes, then I'm not really sure I can recommend it, unless you don't care at all what grade you get and just want to listen to some awesome guest speakers.",
    "Pros-Interesting subject matter - i definitely learned a lot-Some cool speakers-will likely be better in the future as it was the first year and it was already pretty good-Dr. Fleming really cares about the subject(s) and is a pretty good lecturer. She also has good stuff to say and really cares about the subject matter.-I enjoyed (or retrospectively enjoyed) all of the writing assignments. Writing briefs is a very relevant and valuable skill that is kind of new and different (writing credit is a plus too)-final essay and presentation is pretty interesting and valuable (And watching others present is kind of cool too)Cons-Some speakers are dry\/boring-book is pretty dry and not that helpful-section isn't always helpful\/valuable (this will likely improve in the future)",
    "Science and Public Policy is an easy writing credit (three 1-3 page papers then a 10 page final paper) and lecture isn't mandatory. The writing aspect is also different than other writing credits because you are writing policy memos - no fancy prose, direct and concise writing with lots of evidence (statistics).",
    "I would recommend this very unique class. Almost half the classes were with awesome guest speakers (former leader of NASA, former congressman, particle physicist, Richard Levin...) and the course has an easily manageable workload. The policy memos are very short as far as writing assignments go, which means you'll spend less time researching but more time trying to fit all your points into a page or two. Prof. Fleming is very pro-science funding but doesn't always back that up with data, so make sure that won't irritate you. The class sticks mainly to physics policy, but you'll truly need only an interest in science\/physics, not prior knowledge.",
    "yes, it's a good deal for a WR for non writing people, but the material is only somewhat interesting. A lot of good speakers though, so that makes the classes better.",
    "Yes! This course is a good overview of science policy as well as being a good review of general governmental structure and policy. Most of the guest speakers are from varied backgrounds (directors of FermiLabs, Presidential Science advisors, NPR science reporters) and are enthusiastic and share a lot of personal experiences that demonstrate different aspects of policy that effect science. The policy brief at the end really allows you to focus on an area that is important to you and develop a meaningful proposal.",
    "If you never went to class or opened the textbook, you could still get an A in the class. Because this was the first year this class was offered, I guess Professor Fleming didn't really know how to structure the class.",
    "This class is the perfect class for any science major (or non-science major, although the class is primarily science and engineering majors) who wants to just learn about science in the \"real world\" ...and who needs a writing credit. Probably the easiest and most interesting way to get a writing credit. Great TAs, you don't actually need to do any of the reading, great guest speakers. It's one of those classes at Yale that you go to, don't take notes, and just purely enjoy the lecture. Take it if you are interested, if you want to become interested, or if you want an easy writing credit.",
    "Boring lecture, pretty interesting memo writing assignments, really gets you aware of what's going on in science in the US and at least makes you read the science news in the New York Times. I would recommend the class especially if it continues to be a writing credit.",
    "If you're a science major, take this course - you'll meet lots of really amazing people (the guest speaker slate is beyond incredible) and also get a peek into the complicated and interesting world of science and public policy. The workload is very light and the grading is very lenient once you establish a rapport with the TFs. If you're not a science major and don't have any real interest in science and can't feign as much interest in science as all science majors manage to feign in your major's courses, then please don't ruin this experience for the science majors. Also, if you have a single woman-scorning misogynizing bone in your body, please (actually, why am I being polite about this?) GO get it surgically removed and pulverized before considering this course - the most agonizing class discussion I have ever sat through occurred in this class when a couple of douchebags decided to make clear how little regard they have for women in science. As a man in science, I was perhaps never more embarrassed to share any sort of connection with these other men in science. It was a testament to Professor Fleming's poise and grace that she did not summarily roundhouse drop kick them in the kidneys, though that would have been far better than their just deserts. In summary, I would recommend this course to all students excluding douchebags. So, the question you should ask yourself is not as much \"Should I take this course?\" as \"Am I a douchebag?\" (A much less important, but still relevant question is \"Do I need a writing credit?\")",
    "A MUST TAKE CLASS. Definitely take Science Policy if it's offered again. It's a unique opportunity to meet some of the biggest names affecting science in America from a former head of NASA to Senator Foster. Professor Fleming and the TAs made this course accessible and engaging for students of all majors. A wonderful way to get a WR credit.",
    "Physics 320 is a great class, and I would recommend it to another student. The course provides an overview of Science Policy in the United States, and Professor Fleming does a great job presenting the course material. The guest speakers are very interesting and the coursework is manageable. Overall, Physics 320 is a great course."
