    "Basic survey of the field of environmental ethics. This is a very cool field to do a survey course in. Since it is a very young and still developing field, by the end of the semester, I knew the names of pretty much every dominant thinker. It was thrilling to read a paper that referenced 5-8 other authors, and know the central arguments of each of these authors.",
    "I now have a solid foundation in environmental ethics. I can structure an argument, apply ethics to environmental problems, and generally engage in discussions at a much deeper level.",
    "I developed a bit of a grounding in formal ethical theory, and got a solid overview of a variety of topics existing at the intersection of ethics, philosophy, and environmental issues.",
    "I learned about traditional ethical concepts and contemporary\/environmental concepts.",
    "I definitely got a lot more insight into ways to think about environmental issues-- having that ethical foundation will be great moving forward.",
    "Do the readings. They are important for this class. I don't think I gained any new skills. I think some interesting ideas were shared, but nothing mind blowing.",
    "- I built on my knowledge of secular classical philosophies - I was exposed to more modern ethical treatises pertaining to ecological topic",
    "I really enjoyed this class with Professor Latham. I developed a wide range of knowledge about environmental ethics as well as general philosophical theories which can relate to environmental subjects. I developed skills that allowed me to write in a style of ethical discussion bringing in ideas that were brought up throughout the entire semester.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of the field of environmental ethics, as well as a rudimentary understanding of ethical theory and practice more broadly. I learned to think about environmental issues through an ethical lens, and I improved my skills in reading papers in the field.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental philosophy that I hadn't known before. And I learned a lot about my own beliefs in the process of this class"

   "comments": [
    "Very well!",
    "It aligned with my expectations.",
    "I entered this course hoping to think critically about the connections between human and societal actions and the environment, and the class fulfilled these expectations. I went in without ever having taken a philosophy course, and left feeling much more comfortable considering and presenting my arguments through an ethics framework.",
    "Very high. I was happy with the amount of concepts I learned and remembered.",
    "It about met my expectations that I'd learn environmental ethics fundamentals. I'm pleasantly surprised by how many opportunities I've already found to apply those lessons.",
    "I don't have high expectations for any FES course, so it aligned around average.",
    "They aligned well with my general expectations, and even exceeded them.",
    "My takeaways from the class very clearly aligned with what I expected and I really enjoyed talking environment during class time. I liked that the syllabus was more flexible as we went through the semester which allowed us to connect the dots and target further areas of interest to discuss.",
    "This course met or exceeded my expectations! The course requirements were very clear from the beginning, and there were no surprises. I learned as much or more than I expected to learn. I was pleasantly surprised by how deep and nuanced, as well as broad, my understanding of environmental ethics has become. The field is quite young, and as such we were able to read many of the foundational texts in one course as well as bringing the authors of the theoretical texts into conversation about particular topics in environmental ethics. This course taught me a lot and I consider the experience to have been very valuable.",
    "I don't think I really had expectations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The content is fascinating, and the way the course was set up made it a very open atmosphere to be able to present and challenge ideas. Weaknesses: Sometimes I left class wishing our discussions were more structured, or that we had read the text in more detail. Often Prof Latham would open the class by asking, \"So, what did you think?\" and then our conversations would go off on several tangents that sometimes barely related to the readings. I wished that sometimes Prof Latham would have more pointed questions that really got us to dig into the text.",
    "The themes, flow of themes throughout the semester, and the readings were all excellent. I appreciated that we had a chance to revisit the topics halfway through the semester to redirect based on student needs and interest. I do think classroom time could have benefitted from a bit more structure.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Stephen Latham; he is a gifted teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed coming to this seminar. To steal a quote from a classmate, listening to him speak is like story time; any subject and any anecdote is completely fascinating. This is a new course, and for the most part I thought the syllabus and course content was well-selected and quite interesting. We only had two reading responses, and towards the end of the semester the readings lost a bit of focus (and were posted a bit too late); these are natural growing pains for a new course, however. The exams were reasonable and quite straightforward, and the course seemed refreshingly focused not on evaluation, but on maximizing our learning experience and enabling us to develop a strong intellectual and ethical background on a compelling variety of material.",
    "Strengths: The discussions in class were always something to look forward to Weakness: Can't think of any",
    "I generally don't love exams as a tool for measuring comprehension-- in my opinion, weekly reading responses or 2-3 papers asking us to synthesize course takeaways would be better. I also really appreciated the moments we learned about more formal ethical theories, like Kantianism at the start of the semester and Catholic ethics at the end. More concrete frameworks like those throughout the class would have been great.",
    "Have less undergrads. And ask students to present every other week - I think more could emerge with presentations, or direct teach.",
    "Strengths: great in-class discussion, excellent selection of readings Weaknesses: somewhat unclear expectations regarding weekly assignments",
    "I really enjoyed the class environment and I think the Professor Latham was really engaging and interesting to listen to. I enjoyed the class material and thought that the readings were well picked. However, I would have also liked to read more up to date readings if that would be possible.",
    "Strengths: the amount of reading assigned was perfect! Enough that we got a great understanding of the subject, but little enough that it was actually possible to do all of the reading in depth, which allowed for genuine engagement with the topics. The exams were also perfect--straight down the middle, interesting questions but no tricks, and designed to fit into the amount of time. I felt like my time was being respected and I was being properly evaluated on my knowledge in a challenging, but not pointlessly stressful way. This course couldn't seem to decide if it was a lecture or a seminar. Most of the time, we had whole-class discussions, but once in a while Professor Latham would break out and give a mini-lecture to guide our discussion. That sounds like a criticism, but it is not!! Please do not change the course format. I think the course would be significantly weaker if it were changed EITHER to a fully lecture-based or discussion-based format. The hybrid format provided structure and guiding questions while still leaving lots of time to hear everyone's thoughts. Professor Latham is a great lecturer, but he's also good at guiding a discussion and making room for many voices, so this worked well. Weaknesses: Our class discussions varied day to day in quality, but I noticed that the strongest discussions occurred on days when we had all done the reading well. Sometimes, the readings were posted so late (even the day before class) that it was impossible to do them in time for class. Professor Latham was never unfair about this--he accepted responsibility for having posted the readings late, summarized the main points, and didn't hold it against students if they hadn't had a chance to do the reading in those cases. But many times I would have much preferred to be able to do the reading! I just didn't have time. The discussions would have been much better had the readings been posted in advance and the assignments for the day clearly indicated so that everyone could do the reading and do it well. My only other suggestion is that Professor Latham should decide one way or another about the reading response questions. We did a few of them early in the semester but then didn't do more. I think the course was fine without them, but I also always appreciate the chance to write these small, low-stakes assignments to test understanding of the reading without stressing about huge point values, so I think that it could be valuable to do reading response questions every week or so. Either way would be fine!",
    "We entered a lot of tangents which were sometimes very valuable, but also took us away from the readings. A wise breath of material is covered and I trust after a little more organization it will feel more fluid to work through. Also some weeks readiness were posted a little too late to reasonably complete"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take the course. The content is fascinating and Prof Latham is a brilliant professor.",
    "Doing all readings before class is instrumental for your learning and a productive discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend Ethics & Ecology! The course is fairly low-stress, the conversations are engaging and enjoyable, the material is relevant and important, and the professor is fantastic. Do the readings to ensure you actually engage with the material, but just about anyone ought to find something interesting in this course.",
    "Take it if you enjoy philosophical\/ethical ideas",
    "You could probably get by without doing the readings, but the class isn't worth your time if you only show up for discussion. Don't expect to learn much that way.",
    "I found the topics very interesting. Good for a first time ethics course. Do the readings, and you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "That the class is best-suited to students who enjoy active and lively in-class discussions.",
    "It is key to stay on top of the reading prior to class to really benefit from the discussion and also be prepared to challenge other students opinions.",
    "I would advise students to take this class! Professor Latham is wonderful, and participating in discussions with him in such a small setting, especially after having taken his much larger Bioethics class, was an incredible privilege and a real treat. The readings were great and I learned a lot. A few more practical pieces of advice: do the readings! They are totally manageable and usually very interesting, and it will make discussions so much better if you fully engage with the subject matter. Ask lots of questions and participate in class. Form a study group with a couple others in the class to review material before the exams. The exams aren't tricky, but you'll do best if you have a solid understanding of the topics and can reference particular readings, and it's easier to review if you can crowdsource that kind of thing.",
    "Genuinely I appreciated going over the topics we did and am happy I took the class but also just admit that some days were hard emotionally. I genuinely care about the environment and sometimes the United focus on issues in class just had an emotional toll. So in Essence take care of yourself."
