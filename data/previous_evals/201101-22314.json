   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are interested in the economics of healthcare. No answers will be provided in class, but you learn a lot. Not so much on the politics or demographic factors driving the demand\/supply of healthcare.",
    "Great class. You learn a lot and the instructors are very nice. Highly recommended.",
    "Take it if you want an easy course, but it's not terribly fun.",
    "This is a great class to take if you are interested in the economic forces at play in the health care industry. A strong econ background is not really required. The professor presents research very clearly. Workload is light. Great class where you don't have to do too much work outside of class and still learn lots of important and interesting material!",
    "It was a hard class in terms of memorizing material for the 2 exams. If you are not interested in the material or you don't need the class than do not take it.",
    "pretty recommended",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in health care and the current reforms the U.S. is undergoing. If you already know a lot of the issues and understand the background of the U.S. health care system, then it might not be as interesting.",
    "Gives an overview of healthcare systems and structures in the US and goes into depth on some interesting topics. A good class to take if you're interested in current healthcare reform debates.",
    "This course is an advanced version of ECON 170. While Prof. Kowalski introduced more technical aspects of health economics by incorporating many economic papers to the course, she seemed to arbitrarily make the class more difficult, especially on the final exam when she tested things she did not teach herself (e.g. econometric analysis, details within articles, etc.). The content was good though, but I just think that Prof. Kowalski needs to develop a more streamlined syllabus in terms of the order of the material covered.The course was okay but definitely not as dynamic as Prof. Forman's course. I think that she needs to focus more on just making the course challenging in terms of the material covered and not just arbitrarily making assessments more tedious or difficult.",
    "Health econ with an emphasis on economic theory. You should understand micro and a bit of econometrics before taking it.",
    "Yeah, absolutely, this topic is of critical importance to the future of the country and the general public don't understand it well. The material is worth learning no matter if you're going into law, business, healthcare, or you will just be a consumer of healthcare.",
    "This course gives a grounding in the facts and techniques necessary to understand and discuss what's wrong in our health care system, but we never ended up having that discussion. Whether or not that's a good thing depends on personal preference.",
    "Econ 405 is the course to take for students looking to learn about both the theoretical and empirical aspects of the Health Care system. Even though the class is focused on the US healthcare system, most of the theoretical knowledge seems applicable to other countries too. The course covers a broad area of health care topics, and gives a lot of information about each topic. Professor Kowalski is a great lecturer, and encourages active class discussion and participation, which makes the course even more interesting and engaging. The assignments and reading amounts are usually well spread out and reasonable. Sometimes, the expectations are a little unclear, which makes it hard to know how well you are doing in the course overall."
