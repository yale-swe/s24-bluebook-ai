    "English 130 is an amazing learning experience. It's a lot of work, but for a writing credit it isn't nearly as much writing as some other courses. The readings are all interesting, though sometimes very difficult. Still, I say take it. I wasn't sure when I was going into it, but I stuck with the class and love that I did.",
    "A fascinating insight into 'epic' literature throughout the ages in which you have the opportunity to read some of the key books from the western canon. However, do NOT take the course if you are not prepared to do the reading- and there is a lot of it.",
    "Are you interested in the epic literary tradition? Take this course. The workload will be significant, but the highly rewarding nature of the course itself and the material makes doing the reading, attending class, and writing responses a thoroughly rewarding experience.",
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend taking this class. You read arguably the five most important books ever created and one other chosen by the professor. Each book is incredible on its own, and reading them in close proximity gives you very cool insights into the trajectory of literature. For our section we had a choice of 4 out of 6 papers, which were not too burdensome and reasonably spread out. Without doubt, there is a ton of reading. I am an incredibly slow reader (on Don Quixote, my pace was about 20 pgs\/hour, which resulted in about 50 hours of reading for the whole book), but if you put in the time it's completely worth it. You can get away with not doing all the reading when you need to because you can skip two papers and the final was not incredibly difficult."
