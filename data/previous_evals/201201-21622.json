    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You'll learn about privacy laws and technology...obviously...and you'll also have an amazing time. Seriously. It's the best.",
    "The Best Class I've Taken At Yaleand also, if you are an uptight type A personality who can't deal with either a little class disorder for the sake of honest discussion or excessive cupcake consumption, take something else.",
    "2 Hour game of guess what Brad Rosen is thinking. Not sure if I learned a lot or nothing at all",
    "Apply if you're interested in privacy and technology, and you don't mind long Friday afternoon seminars. The readings aren't bad, but some of them are long, and if you don't do them you'll have a hard time participating. Other than the readings, workload is minimal. Your grade seems to be mostly determined by the quality of your participation.",
    "I would 100% recommend it! It's super fun, relevant, and unlike any other class I've taken.",
    "This is a very great course which ties together many different subjects. While that may be intimidating for some students, I think that the interdisciplinary approach and the focus on case law really makes for a grounded discussion about a subject that it too often relegated to grand abstractions.",
    "While, as the title and course description suggest, the course covers privacy implications of technology, it also gives a broader understanding of legal theory and technological workings. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Brad likes to keep a very chill, open classroom environment. I used to think this was awesome, but having taken this seminar, I think it actually backfires in practice. His outrageous, over-the-top, often facetious teaching style encourages the same kinds of responses from students in the class, which led to inane, useless class discussions that fought all the hypotheticals and encouraged everyone to make endless trolling comments. Sometimes sitting in class was actually painful, because even though we'd all be laughing and having a good time, I felt like I was wasting my time (and trying my patience) sitting there hearing people fight about the finer points of how a squirrel could come along, punch open your garbage bags, and find incriminating evidence (probably the tamest example I can put in an eval). Sure there were cupcakes at every class session which was cool, but it wasn't enough to keep me from wondering why we couldn't just, I don't know, have a reasonable class for once. I never thought I would come to this conclusion - I've always loved Brad's unorthodox teaching style, and the tone of his class, but I don't think it encourages good behavior in students in class - they will use it as a license to derp around and make coming to class kind of painful. I think I should make a note about the readings: there are a TON OF READINGS. I would have to say that I did more readings for this class than any other class I've taken at Yale, by far. Indeed, I think maybe 2 of my classes this past semester would = the reading load for this class. Although some of them will be more readable news \/ pop culture articles, the bulk of it is really really dense legal cases that will take you a LONG time to get through, even if you're used to reading legal cases. Also, in this class he requires you to do a final project instead of a final, which will take a lot of time and planning - expect to spend at least a total of 24 hours of work time to do your project (probably a modest estimate). There was a lot of potential here, but I think the end result didn't live up to the (very high) expectations of the course evals from years past. Shopper be warned.",
    "Control, Privacy, and technology is an amazing class. I whole heartedly recommend it to anyone even somewhat interested in law or technology. The lecture in the fall is a worthwhile prerequisite, both to get accustomed to the class's teaching style and material. Easily the best two classes I've taken at Yale and really really fun.",
    "Pros: Easy, very little work. Subject matter interesting (readings not as much)Cons: Everything else.",
    "This class is simply fantastic. If you take it, and you are intelligent and curious, you will never regret it. Brilliant survey of the intersection between our legal frameworks and emerging technologies. An awesome introduction to both law and tech, whether you're an expert or have never even dabbled. PLEASE, take this class.",
    "Control, Privacy and Technology is an excellent, must take course if you are at all interested in the current events in technological development and the intersection between that and law.The class is in a laidback environment to say the least, which works in the class favor by encouraging participation and questions from students who might not otherwise speak. Moreover, Brad finds a way to make every lesson memorable, managing to drill the most important concepts in permanently in our head without our even realizing it.",
    "Brad is the greatest. Take this class.",
    "Definitely take it. I honestly can\u0092t say enough good things about this class. You learn a ton of interesting and practical information and you have a great time doing it. If you took 183 and loved it, then 185 will be right up your alley. Plus it\u0092s a writing credit. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. Brad is awesome and a great professor to get to know, and the material is really interesting. Issues of privacy, especially computer\/internet privacy, are totally relevant today--especially to us internet-savvy youngsters. It's good and important stuff to know, and as stuff in this field is constantly changing, it's an exciting topic to study and discuss."
