    "This class was a good way to fulfill your senior requirement. However, writing a good paper requires self-discipline, as it is pretty tangential to the class work and there is only one deadline before the final draft is due.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! One of the best I've taken at Yale! The workload is totally manageable and if you pay attention during class you will learn a tremendous amount.",
    "This class might sound a bit silly at first glance, but it's actually really fantastic and interesting. You examine a lot of questions about emotions in social contexts that have just barely had any research done on them before, which is really cool.",
    "YES. This class is amazing. The discussions were always fun and eye opening. I would often leave class and think, \"Huh. I never thought [insert any emotion]would only happen if conditions X and Y were present, or not at all if Z was there.\" or \"Emotion X is actually a lot like Y minus the whatever.\" Very interesting stuff that I don't think you need to be a Psych major to appreciate. Also, the work is essentially all about your paper. There are weekly reading responses but they are rather short and typically fun, thought-provoking questions.",
    "PSYC 405 is a great senior seminar and Prof. Clark is a very knowledgeable professor. The material we read for class was interesting and the discussions during during were engaging. The grade for the course is based on reading responses (due each week), attendance and participation in class and a term paper.",
    "I would recommend this course to a Psychology major because it is a good way to discuss emotions freely, drawing upon information you have learned over the years from other psychology courses. It is a great opportunity to discuss emotions from a relational perspective. Since this perspective is usually underemphasized in literature, the class really gives students the opportunity to generate their own ideas\/inferences about emotions using a culmination of previous knowledge."
