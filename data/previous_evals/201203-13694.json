I think its very valuable to have such a course, both (a) to help doctoral students started on thinking about their research ideas, and (b) to have a way for the incoming doctoral class to get to know one another and be familiar with eachother's research ideas."

    "This course provided a great opportunity to adjust to the doctoral program and develop a relationship with my cohort. It provided a helpful space to develop ideas, receive helpful feedback, and voice insecurities.",
    "Getting to know fellow doctoral students and hearing one-on-one from guest speakers.",
    "1) Receiving very helpful feedback on fellowship proposals from a group of students with very diverse academic backgrounds.2) Seeing and other reviewing other fellowship proposals - helpful to see what others were working on; also, critiquing others' proposals helped me to improve my own3) Meeting with diverse FES seminar speakers, hearing about varied career paths and options for after graduation",
    "It was nice to speak with seminar presenters after their seminars. The most useful aspect of the course was the \"life experiences\" presenters shared with us.",
    "Having a forum to discuss entering issues that doctoral students have.",
    "The class is low key, and the project is both do-able and super useful."

   "comments": [
    "The open and flexible nature of the main deliverable for the class was helpful in that every student starts the program in a different place and with different goals. However, it seemed that the workload was uneven between students. Those who chose to submit proposals (while this was only to our benefit) were help to much higher deliverable standards than those who completed lit reviews, etc.Furthermore, while the format of providing feedback on proposal drafts is very helpful, some written response to capture individual thoughts would be helpful-- this would encourage all the students to actually read the drafts and lead to much more helpful feedback.",
    "I think that the very nature of this course makes it a \"light work load,\" and this is not necessarily a negative thing, considering many of the students in the course are taking other very demanding courses. However, there could be an additional component added, other than fellowship reviews and talking with seminar speakers, that could add some more continuity to each class. For example, Prof. Skelly mentioned each student presenting one environmental paper that they thought was of particular importance - this could be a good idea to follow up in future years.Also, while fellowship proposal reviews were helpful, it would have been nice for all students to have to submit written comments for each fellowship proposal submitted. During classes, often only a few students spoke up and provided comments - these were either the most vocal students, or the only students thathad actually reviewed the proposals. It would be great if all students gave both verbal and written feedback on all proposals.",
    "The assignment (writing a fellowship app, lit review, etc.) is supremely useful to organize your thoughts about your research ideas. But, the course devoted a LOT of time to discussing fellowship applications even though only half of the class wrote fellowship applications. It would be interesting to hear more regularly from the other half of the class about their projects as well."

While this course didn't necessarily equip students with \"new skills\" or \"new knowledge,\" it was a useful way to start turning vague research ideas into more concrete plans.",

As a first-year PhD student, there can be overload of info about the program, school, classes, etc. It would be great to be able to re-connect in the second semester once everyone has a better perspective of what they want to be doing and know what resources they are seeking."
