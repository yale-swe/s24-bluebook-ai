    "If you're interested in the material, you'll definitely enjoy this class! I learned a lot about the history of military conflict in society, and I see the news in a whole new way now. I'd recommend it.",
    "Take. Great class with a super interesting professor. Be warned that the reading load is pretty substantial. However, the vast majority of it is engaging and relatively quick reads. Graeme is pretty critical of writing, but a fair grader.",
    "I'd recommend this to a senior. It's not a super challenging class but is very fun.",
    "Definitely a should take for political science majors. It is very non-academic reading, but it really develops a good look at the potential issues in more academic writings like biases and gaps in available information. It definitely made me far better at reading and evaluating pieces for other classes as well and did more to develop that as a skill than any other class I have taken in the department. Wood also seems to care about everyone actually learning and making sure you challenge your own beliefs and defend all positions.",
    "Take it very worthwhile. Lots of useful knowledge.",
    "No, I don't think I'd recommend it just because the discussions are so vague. But find the syllabus and do the readings on your own if you are interested!",
    "It a class in critical analysis of journalism. Its very much worth taking."
