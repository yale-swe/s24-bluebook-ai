    "The field experience in St. Thomas -- It was well planned out and I learned so much!",
    "The homemade granola bars.",
    "The two best parts of this course were the field trip and the lab work. I also enjoyed the student presentations during the semester and on the final day.",
    "The trip to St. Thomas provided the opportunity to observe the problems and challenges discussed throughout the course. This was most certainly the best thing about the course because many times it is hard to conceptualize things (e.g., environmental issues) without seeing it firsthand and discussing with the locals who experience these things personally.",
    "The field trip and ability to relate the readings to our activities.",
    "The field trip was excellent. I got an excellent overview of St. Thomas and felt like every speaker added to the experience."

   "comments": [
    "A clear itinerary for the field trip would be helpful, and what sorts of things financially the students are responsible for. Like it was unclear if we were purchasing our own tickets or not for awhile. Just logistical stuff wasn't made as clear as it could be.",
    "I think the papers we read during the semester could have been selected more judiciously. Many of them seemed to be low quality and easy to criticize. It would be better if the selected papers were all really high quality, showing examples of really strong natural and social science research. Even if they're not from the USVI, there have to be some better papers that address similar systems and environmental problems. Also, I would have enjoyed doing some sort of service project while we were on the field trip, or at least orienting our projects from the very beginning on actually serving clients' research needs. Sandy's project on waste disposal is a great example--she spoke with several people who could use her help. If Anne Marie (TNC) had been contacted earlier, she could have provided project ideas that would have led to results she could use. I'm not sure it's feasible, but if each of us had the opportunity to arrange a meeting with someone related to our project, that would be great, too.",
    "Some of the readings are outdated. Although there may not be some scholarly material for some of the topics, especially for St. Thomas, it may benefit the students to include some more recent sources, whether they are program efforts or current policy\/economic issues. There are many program websites and efforts that exist that may help to expand the students' knowledge on these topics before they visit St. Thomas.",
    "I think that some of the readings didn't add that much to the course (or, they were valuable but we could have used more information to connect the issues to the bigger picture, ex. the shrimp shredders one)."

It is especially valuable to those of us who are seeking to gain knowledge and experience in new ecosystems, especially those where many environmental and political challenges exist.",

Also, do no wait until the last minute to come up with a presentation topic\/project. This class gives you the rare opportunity to do work abroad, whether it is talking with locals or gathering samples. By preparing some of your project work abroad beforehand, you will gain much more from this course. Additionally, you may have the opportunity build a network in St. Thomas.",
