   "comments": [
    "It was good. It wasn't life changing, but it was very enjoyable.",
    "A critical look at the different ways that science meets society, from its interactions with the media, to how science is funded on a daily basis. This was a great course for those in the sciences, the humanities, or for someone who has an interest in both. Highly highly recommended.",
    "Interface of Science&Society was great - I highly recommend it to anyone who's evena little interested in how science \"works\" today. We talked about science journalism, peer review, controversies surrounding genetically modified food and global warming: who should we believe, and where is the evidence coming from? John Goss and Hannah Chapin are a GREAT team of teachers - so friendly and fun, but also really smart and know what they're talking about. You're graded on weekly reading responses (but like cell bio, they drop the lowest 3 grades) and a final paper about any issue at the \"interface\" of science and society, plus participation. Not too much work, really interesting and a LOT of fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is basically looking at various aspects of science and how it relates to the world at large. I'm not a science guy, but I always found it interesting.",
    "The class consisted of weekly readings and writeups followed by a great discussion in class about the readings. I would reccomend it to anyone interested in science and its application in the real world",
    "Awesome",
    "This was by far the best writing credit I have ever taken at Yale. The course is not only fascinating and extremely insightful in terms of seeing society's interaction with science from completely new perspectives, it was also very low-stress while at the same time teaching us so much. It is a MUST take for any science and nonscience major alike! For science majors, you not only learn about the true natures of topics such as open access, science education, funding, and peer-review. Nonscience majors learn, in a really manageable way and with a very supportive group (you don't have to feel shy about asking questions with Hannah and John--they are amazing!), about topics such as stem-cells and global warming, essential topics to understand how to function in the modern world. Also, definitely go to as many office hours as you can. John and Hannah give extremely helpful advice and are just wonderful people to talk with and learn from! Amazing class!!!",
    "Take it! It's awesome! No work, and lots of fun.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It's great, interesting, highly relevant, extremely thought provoking, etc. etc. You'll learn about the importance of science and the current inadequacies of science (and society).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The first-time teachers of a seminar succeeded splendidly in their first attempt. The topics are fascinating, and even if you think you'll be bored by one of the topics, it'll still be fun to debate about it in the structure of the class. The opportunity for individual independent research in the final paper is also really great because it is very flexible."
