    "I learned physics lol in terms of both equations and theoretical understanding. I really understand the different ways circuit elements behave now.",
    "This course mostly covers magnetism and electricity. The course was taught well, and I feel that I obtained a solid foundation for these subjects. It was a requirement for me, as it is for many of those taking it, but it was definitely among the better required courses I've taken. The instructors are very intelligent and helpful. There are many resources that allow you to succeed in this course.",
    "I learned how to think like a physicist, how to analyze different physics problems, recognize patterns in the pathways for solving these problems, and bonded with fellow students in the class.",
    "Physics 171 is a solid continuation of the Intro Physics modules - you'll continue to apply the basic foundation from the prior semester to more topics. Learning to work well with classmates and take full advantage of office hours were important skills.",
    "I learned about an array of subjects pertaining to the intersection of physics and other life sciences and medicine. We were taught how to solve both simple and complex physical equations in systems related to biology and medicine.",
    "I did not love this course. The work was long and difficult and sometimes boring. I would not take this class unless it is required.",
    "I don't know if this class added more skills or insights to Physics, as much as it claimed to. If anything I did gain more Physics and mathematical knowledge.",
    "I think it really helped problem solving.",
    "I learned to hone my problem-solving skills, work together with my classmates, and how physics is found in all aspects of daily life.",
    "How to use principles and equations of E&M physics at a basic level",
    "I enjoyed critically thinking about topics addressed in the course with my peers.",
    "I learned how to generalize physics concepts and apply them to multiple situations.",
    "How to be a better problem solver, and how to apply physics to biological concepts.",
    "I practiced how to ask for help and build relationships with peers to complete assignments.",
    "Problem solving -- being able to apply techniques and principles to problems that I haven't seen before.",
    "In PHYS 171, I learned not only about electricity and magnetism, but I also learned how to work with my peers and ask for help when I was confused.",
    "I learned really cool applications of physics that were tuned to my interests in medicine.",
    "how to do flux problems, resistance, capacitors i love how it's made very clear how ideas relate so you have a more holistic understanding of all the physics concepts",
    "Extremely wide range of topics, obviously physics based but often bridging into biology, chemistry, and statistics. Much less so this semester than in 170, but would still prefer this life-science related course to classical E&M of PHYS 181.",
    "Physics",
    "QR courses are much better with friends to work with. I also learned that, if a professor is very excited about something that you're not super excited about, their excitement can carry over and I walked away from the class feeling like physics E&M was not awful. Most of the skills carried over from learning mechanics, but I did learn how to apply them to E&M.",
    "I developed a working knowledge of many topics in basic physics.",
    "I learned multiple fundamentals of E and M but mainly problem solving and study skills.",
    "Problem solving, critical thinking",
    "I learned how to problem solve efficiently, and to seek help when I needed it which was often.",
    "Developed math and algebra skills more than I thought.",
    "This course not only taught me a lot about physics, but more importantly taught me the importance of confidence and team working skills.",
    "You really learn to apply your knowledge to different situations, which helps to deepen your knowledge of the concept more rather than just memorizing patterns and equations to solve problems."

    "This is such an absolutely abysmal class, it's difficult to know where to begin. A brief positive note: the simulations are quite cool, it's too bad that to appreciate them you have to understand physics on a level not provided by the course. This is undoubtedly, the worst class I have taken at Yale, and probably in my entire life as well. So let's dive right into some of its deep-seated problems: 1) The use of \"modules\" instead of a textbook. There are reasons professors write their own textbooks and publish them (granted, some of those reasons may be financial). It's because one would hope that publishing a real book, instead of making a pdf on your laptop, adheres to some standards of pedagogy and instruction. The same cannot be said of the modules. They are unclear, incomplete, and riddled with errors (I cannot even count the number of emails from instructors and Canvas reminders I received instructing me of corrections to the modules). When the instructors use them as their crutch, basically repeating time and again \"I'm not going to go through the derivation or algebra of this concept because it's in the module,\" and the module is a completely crippled learning aid, the students are left to their own devices, which kind of defeats the purpose of taking a class. 2) The general approach to scientific teaching. You have to pick a side - either say \"I don't care about algebra and derivations, I just want to apply the equations I take on faith\" or \"let's derive this stuff so you can really understand it.\" This class falls squarely in the middle. In class, the former statement is the reigning law. On problem sets and exams, it is almost impossible to do anything without having adhered to the latter statement (of course on your own time and with your own ingenuity). In a nutshell, a much deeper conceptual understanding of the material is required than is provided. 3) The syllabus. Don't try to cram in modules just to cover your bases. You can't teach optics without ray diagrams. And yet for 3 lectures and one entire \"module,\" we discussed optical phenomena without ever once explaining how ray diagrams worked or learning how to complete them. If you're opposed to an established method of teaching something and you completely pass over it, the least you can do is give a cursory explanation. I don't know how is responsible for the structure and philosophy behind the course, but I hope they seriously reevaluate their thinking because of the 15-20 people I interact with in PHYS171, not one of them has a positive opinion, and these are all people who go to every lecture and do well in the course. What an incredible disappointment, that manages to do the exact opposite of its purported goal, that of inspiring students with fascinating biological applications of physics, instead frustrating them with the ridiculous pedagogy and confusing organization of the course.",
    "Replace Rona Ramos with Simon Mochrie. Rona is not a good teacher. Simon was much better.",
    "I like the TEAL teaching format and numerous study halls for help.",
    "This class did not teach me as many fundamental physics principles as I had hoped. Way too much algebra and systematic, repetitive problems like eigenvalues.",
    "The TA's were really bad this semester to be honest. Last semester in 171 I felt a lot better and went to all the reviews, study halls and met with Tas. This semester, I continued to go to reviews, but after almost every single one i felt like I wasted an entire hour of my night. Daming gave reviews that acted as if we were already masters of the content. Raphael was the only very good review TA.",
    "The course is well taught and provides a lot of resources for its students. If the difficulty of the class could be toned down several notches, that would be great. Otherwise, great class.",
    "Teaching isn't great and the topics are very difficult ot understand because of this, particularly later in the class.",
    "This course is good if you're prepared to put the work into engaging with the work. If you can sit down and grind stuff out, and go over your notes, you'll be fine and learn a good deal.",
    "The material is what it is (basic bio-inflected E and M) so that is unlikely to change, and is fine. However, I think the coordination between the lecture and lab courses could really be improved--we would often learn about concepts several weeks apart in each, and the two courses didnt seem totally complementary in course material.",
    "The course is a poor assembly of physics and biology in which the combination of the two is done haphazardly. In this course I have neither learned physics, nor have I learned biology.",
    "This was not a well-taught class. I also did not like the material. I do not think I learned as much as I would have had I taken a different physics class. The lectures and assignments were tedious and difficult.",
    "Strengths are professor engagement. However, I don't think a lot of their methods are very effective, and often explanations weren't thorough. It was challenging, not because of the material, but because of how it was presented.",
    "The course as taught by Rona was poorly structured, unorganized, unenthusiastic, and sad to be in. From the few days we were with Claudia I can tell my expereince would have been different with her, but unfortunately I took the course with an instructor who seemed to not care very much about her students and who oftentimes seemed to be seeing and learning the material for the first time right along with us.",
    "The course is pretty difficult and the psets are unnecessarily hard",
    "PHYS 171 is a very well-taught class and is very well-organized. My only suggestion would be to explain what is written in the modules more, as the modules are very dense and hard to get through on your own.",
    "The same as 170, with a stronger emphasis on the mathematics behind the principles we learned about",
    "There are many resources to learn more about the material covered in the course -- it would be great if more example problems were covered during class times (like those addressed on quizzes and exams) besides HW problems.",
    "The professors are definitely a highlight and the abundance of opportunities to seek out extra help are definitely strengths. The weekly quizzes and test correction method are weaknesses.",
    "The TEAL classroom format was definitely a strength of the class - I liked how it made the class feel less like a lecture and more like a discussion. The course was organized and there were plenty of resources and ways to find help when it was needed.",
    "I felt like grading on the problems sets was pretty harsh. Feedback was also pretty bad. The class itself was pretty great in the TEAL room and Claudia is an amazing teacher. The exams were very very fair, and were definitely doable. I was very impressed by the fact that this class was not curved. It's harder to write a test that won't be curved, but it is way more fair to the students.",
    "The strengths are all the resources available to help students. The weaknesses include the excessive work problems.",
    "The class fosters a strong community among students.",
    "PHYS 171 is a great course. It has a lot of resources TAs, peer tutors, review sessions, study halls to take advantage of. If you want to succeed, the course ensures you have the resources to do so.",
    "I think Study Hall is such a wonderful resource that must be continued for future classes. It forces students to learn the pset materials as opposed to just copying answers.",
    "great professors and learning environment, but class can be a bit hard to keep up with",
    "Requires a lot of learning outside of class. However, they do a good job of making sure you are at least fairly caught up, and the expectations are clear",
    "Amazing teaching by Claudia De Grandi. Rona Ramos was less good, so I picked Claudia's section easily. I loved how student interaction was encouraged in the TEAL classroom, and it was one of the most friendly and best STEM classes I've taken at Yale. An improvement could be less derivation of equations in class. I can see why that might be useful, but we don't need to know how to do it, we aren't tested on it, and no one remembers it past it being written on the board. A lot of time is wasted on that that could be well spent doing applicable problems and testing more concepts. Weekly quizzes are great, and I love that my grade is not solely based on a midterm and final.",
    "Moves faster than the lecture. I had no idea what was going on",
    "Very time consuming but informative. It's way too difficult to earn points back on the tests. If you're going to advertise that you can earn 30% of your points back, make it possible.",
    "The collaborative learning was definitely a strength of the course, and I'm very grateful for the group clicker questions\/quizzes\/work. Although I didn't go to very many, I thought the study halls and review sessions were wonderful options for students to get the help that they needed. I thought that, for an intro physics course, this was a very solid course. The only weakness that I can think of is that the modules are kind of unclear. It makes sense in the light of some lectures, but sometimes the lectures don't really clarify what is written in the modules.",
    "Study Hall and Review Sessions are the strength of this course. Professors, TAs, and Peer Tutors are incredibly approachable and helpful at these sessions as students work through problems to gain a more complete understand topics covered in class.",
    "Very well organized and the lectures were well complemented by the problem sets.",
    "I have nothing bad to say about this course other than the problem sets. Everything was very well organized and well-taught. The problem sets however need to be improved. Some of the questions are just too involved without being any more helpful than shorter questions.",
    "I really enjoyed the class in the TEAL classroom- the whole setup with music at the beginning, the break in the middle, the engaging slides, the clicker questions, and the weekly quizzes, which we went over immediately afterward. I felt a command of the material that I did not feel in Physics 180.",
    "The strengths are the countless opportunities to get help, and the very invested professor (Claudia)",
    "I wish we would be able to do the psets somewhat independently without the help of the TAs. I think that working with the TAs in important, but when the TA doesn't understand the answer, it is difficult to understand the learning value.",
    "This course fostered a strong community among classmates and offered a tremendous amount of support to ensure that every student understood the material to the best of his or her ability.",
    "It's a great class overall. Strengths are definitely the amount of resources you have, from study halls (GO TO STUDY HALL, IT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND YOU MAKE LOTS OF FRIENDS!), office hours, peer tutors, reviews, etc. The instructors (Rona and Claudia) are absolutely FANTASTIC and super helpful. I would say the only weakness is that the class tends to move fast, but try to keep up and pay attention in class and you'll do fine.",
    "Terrible preparation for exams. They need to do something about preparing for exams. The questions they give for the practice final\/practice midterm are so unrelated to the problems that appear on the exams."

    "Absolutely awful. Do not take this class. Suck it up and do 181, it may be harder but, from what I hear, at least the structure of the class and teaching style make sense. This is not the way to go. They try to cram way too much stuff in, so end up rarely explaining concepts and derivations fully, saying \"you can do the algebra at home from the module.\" Of course the modules make no sense and skip a bunch of steps, not to mention they're completely riddled with errors, seeing as the instructors are constantly sending out reminders to use the most updated version and announcing corrections to the module. You can see why it's not a textbook. Just take 181, ideally with Padmanabhan. If you're the typical student whose educational background is in classical teaching, and not this weird pseudo-flipped classroom shit, odds are you'll be way more comfortable with the class and at the very least understand what is expected of you and how to go about learning it, which is less than I can say for this course. The whole \"bio applications\" approach is also bullshit, totally half-assed in the last week of classes, and doesn't actually teach you anything. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "If you are premed you should take this physics class over 181 bc there are relevant biology examples but also bc you do learn real physics at the basic level you need for the MCAT\/medical school. Exams were typically easier than the kinds of problems worked through in class.",
    "THIS CLASS WAS MY FAVORITE CLASS. This class WILL prepare you for MCAT. The professors care so much about helping you. They give you every opportunity for points back, and there are multiple office hours\/study halls\/review sessions everyday. I took this class for premed reqs, but I would've taken it for fun. How fun you think it is will probably be proportional to how much you like problem-solving, logic puzzles, and maybe math.",
    "For anyone who wants to think like a physicist, I would not recommend this course but if you need to check the physics box go ahead. Not a very satisfying course.",
    "This course mostly covers magnetism and electricity. The course was taught well, and I feel that I obtained a solid foundation for these subjects. It was a requirement for me, as it is for many of those taking it, but it was definitely among the better required courses I've taken. The instructors are very intelligent and helpful. There are many resources that allow you to succeed in this course.",
    "only if you have to take it for major or premed.",
    "This class is definitely better than PHYS 180 or 181. Take the 170\/171 track. It's easier, well taught, understandable, and provides more resources for doing well in the course. This is the best class for pre-med students, and for anyone who needs to take physics and\/or likes physics (and might like or want to learn a bit of biology as well).",
    "I would - I would say shop between this and 181, but 171 is a very good experience if you connect with the lecturers. And if you have Claudia, you probably will!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students interested in the medical sciences because the instructors do a good job of integrating medical applications with physics.",
    "If you are premed, then this is a pretty useful course.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course at all because it was the worst class I have taken in my life.",
    "No I would not recommend this unless you absolutely need it for your major or pre-med requirements.",
    "Not unless it is required.",
    "Most of the time you don't have a choice when it comes to Physics. I enjoyed the instructors of this class a lot better than 181, so I'd recommend making your decision based on how well you click with the professor.",
    "Yeah, it was well taught, and the psets were not too time consuming while still teaching appropriate skills for the most part.",
    "Only take this if you absolutely must.",
    "Yes it was a fine physics course",
    "I would hesitate to recommend this course to another student. Professor Claudia De Grandi cared a lot and went over and above to help students (aka in study hall). However, the focus of the course - to learn physics concepts and problem solving skills - was limited in that the course tended to focus on a few ways of testing these concepts. Similarly, this course used some mathematically concepts that we do not understand (linear algebra) by showing us a single way of solving one specific type of linear algebra problem. In this way, we were learning concepts that could not be fully appreciated (because of a lack of mathematical backing).",
    "PHYS 171 is a really great class, especially if it's taught by Professor de Grandi. The instructors really care that you learn, and the TAs are very helpful. There are also a lot of resources to turn to if you need help--the instructors really want you to succeed!",
    "You kinda have to take it if you're premed. This is definitely the better option compared to 181, believe me.",
    "I would recommend this course to other pre-med students who have to take physics -- the professors really care about your learning but be sure to push for more practice problems.",
    "I took 180 in the fall and enjoyed 171 MUCH better. Wish I had taken 170 instead.",
    "Take it if you are pre-med. Don't take it for a general QR.",
    "If you need to take physics for your Bio\/whatever major, then this is probably the better course to take (as opposed to 181).",
    "A solid physics course, a good intro.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Electricity and magnetism are really great, and PHYS 171 does a great job with these conceptually difficult topics. The professors are great (especially Claudia), and if you want to, you can learn a lot.",
    "excellent, well organized, challenging, well-equipped class",
    "PHYS 171 was probably the best-organized course I've taken at Yale. The material is straightforward and well-taught, and the grading standards are transparent. For what it was, I found the course to be minimally stressful (and even fun) during an otherwise busy semester.",
    "yes, if you have to take intro physics",
    "No absolutely do not take this class",
    "I might be the only person who thinks this, but I actually thought this course was interesting and provided an interesting perspective on some physics concepts that weren't a part of the other sequence (took 180 in the fall). I am glad I took this.",
    "Yes, tough course but rewarding and opened my eyes to the spectrum of physics out there. I might go into that major now because I see how it can be applied to the life sciences.",
    "Absolutely not. I would rather never be a doctor than take this class again.",
    "I recommend this class for other pre-meds, especially those taking the MCAT around the time of the class. The material in this class heavily overlaps with the curriculum for the MCAT and it makes for excellent study material.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. It's too much work to take for interest.",
    "I'd recommend taking it! It's a course that's probably still being developed, but I felt that, for an intro physics course, it was relatively painless. Would strongly recommend having friends in the course, and taking the same section with your friends. It makes a difference. Going to class also isn't that bad, and really helps because I personally couldn't really understand the written modules. I took physics 180 during the fall of the previous year, so I decided to take physics 171 because I knew I'd have friends in the course, and because I'd heard better things about 171. I'm definitely glad I took 171 over 181.",
    "Yes, this course is a very well organized course with accessible assignments that are actually representative of the content taught. All the professors and TAs really offer a lot of help and review and care a lot about the students.",
    "Considering I had to take a physics course for premedical requirements, I am so thankful that Yale had this course. While the problem sets were very time consuming, the instruction and environment made it bearable.",
    "Only take it if you have to. It's a huge amount of work, probably equivalent to two science classes. if you take this class, do not take it with Rona!",
    "Yes, the material is presented in a straightforward manner, and there are plenty of opportunities to seek help.",
    "Because of the workload and time commitment, I would only recommend this course if you have to take it for your major, or for pre-med.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student,",
    "It's a great class; possibly one of the best intro-STEM classes at Yale. The resources and instructors are fantastic and the material is really interesting. As a person who took no physics in high school and is pre-med, the PHYS 170-171 sequence is incredible because you learn really interesting stuff (that's actually applicable to stuff you're interested in! i.e. medicine, etc.) and have a great environment and support network to learn in."
