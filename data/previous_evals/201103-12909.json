    "If you're interested in continuing Japanese, then yes definitely. I took first year Japanese last year and went to Japan for second year over this past summer. I was a little nervous at first that third year would be too difficult, but I was wrong - not to say that it's easy though. There is much less busy work since at this point we have covered the majority of grammar. We mainly focus on readings and expressions and vocabulary. Homework isn't bad, class is very chill, the teachers are great. Japanese at Yale can be demanding, but if you put in the effort, its an awesome class.",
    "I recommend it, since you will advance a lot in reading, thoguh progress isn't as fast as L1\/L2.",
    "YES! I would definitely recommend continuing Japanese language study with J150. The class is so much fun and the readings are interesting. There is less of the basic grammar work of L1 and more reading comprehension, which makes the coursework more challenging, but there is a fair balance so it is not overwhelming. Between the senseis, the TFs, and the language table, there are so many opportunities to practice speaking and improving your Japanese.",
    "Amazing course!",
    "I would recommend the class for people looking to further their language skills; however, it is not the same type of class as the lower levels.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class. The senseis are fantastic, and you definitely learn a lot of Japanese as long as you put the work in. I guess you could just memorize things just for quizzes and tests, but if you actually spend time practicing, etc, you'll learn a lot of Japanese. It's a lot less whirlwind of a class than the year 1 classes, so you might at first feel like you're not making much progress, but at the end of the semester, you notice that you can read a lot more quickly and pick up on more nuanced grammar."
