   "comments": [
    "I feel like this class is worth taking as long as you care about learning Chinese, and can set aside a little over an hour a day for the homework.",
    "Yes - a significant amount of work, but you learn quite a lot of Chinese. The students who enter this course vary in their level of initial skill. I could speak, but couldn't write very many characters. Having a lot of background in speaking (at home) definitely helped in getting the hang of grammatical patterns and learning material more quickly. There are 3 tests and a final, plus tutorial every week, and daily homework and quizzes, which adds up to many hours per week spending time on Chinese.",
    "If you've been placed in L3 Heritage Chinese, you will not regret taking 132 with Liu Laoshi. Personally, my favorite seminar all semester. The class is fast paced, no doubt, and will only increase in difficulty next semester in L4 (which is required if you want credit). Be prepared for daily homework and quizzes. The work is mostly just time-consuming, not difficult. As a result, grades tend to all fall in the high 90's, with no curve as far as I know. Liu Laoshi is great. Very capable yet understanding. By the end of the semester there was some significant bonding between classmates in each section - something rare in my limited, onesemester experience.",
    "Chinese 132 is a great class for gaining fluency in reading and writing, as well as speaking. I would highly recommend it to heritage speakers of any level, because it brings everyone to the same level of fluency. Liu Laoshi is also a great teacher, and the tutorial sessions, although far away, are fairly helpful.",
    "YES. Liu Laoshi is so nice. She really understands common mistakes that American-born heritage speakers make. And I met a lot of awesome people in this class. Liu Laoshi is so much fun.",
    "Take this class if you could speak chinese well, for the rest of your classmates are very proficient in the language.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to other students if they think they can handle the workload. It is a 1.5 credit class, which means there's quite a bit of homework, and the class meets every day. If you want to improve your Chinese immensely, and you're a native speaker, this is your class!",
    "There is a lot of work associated with this class, but it's necessary to learn a language like Chinese. The work isn't extremely hard, but it will take some time."
