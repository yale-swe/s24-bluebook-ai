   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to Israeli film and literature. If you are at all interested in the Middle East and want to understand Israeli culture, I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Yes - absolutely! You will watch incredible movies, read great literature, have a manageable workload and receive an original and unique perspective on the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict.",
    "Yes, take it. the teacher is very nice and i thought that topics, readings and movies were all very interesting.",
    "Yes take it! It's a really interesting and unique way to look at Israeli culture and society. Shiri is an easy grader and very sweet lady. Not too much work at all. And class felt like a really relaxing break from all your hard classes. I was surprised how much I actually did learn in the end.",
    "It was a really cool course. It allowed me to become very exposed to Israeli culture and Identity in a way that was trying really hard not to make politics a necessary part of culture. I thought it was relatively successful. Professor Goren is amazing, brilliant and the nicest person. Take it if the subject interests you! The assignments are small and manageable even if they are more numerous than other courses!",
    "You learn about Israeli culture and Identity from film, books, articles, and short stories. Shiri is an absolutely wonderful professor and is an extremely nice person. Prior to this I had never taken a course that analyzed film before and I absolutely loved the film and tv series component of the course. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. What I found most interesting about the class was also the group of people taking it. We didn't have any Palestinians (I am not sure if the course is structured in such a way or has topics on the syllabus that make Palestinian students reluctant to take the class or not, but I felt my classmates could have really gained something from talking to a Palestinian classmate), but we did have a diverse group of students taking the class, which made our discussions about immigrants, ultra-Orthodox Jews, Israeli-Palestinian authors etc fascinating. As someone who is not Jewish, I found this course to be accessible and interesting too. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Goren really cares about her students and dedicates a lot of time to them. The grading is fair. The class is different than most at Yale in terms of Israel; it is not just about the politics but about the culture and the Israeli identity (for Jews and for NonJews). You should take it because you will enjoy it. Also the movies are AMAZING."
