    "I would actually recommend this course to chem Es who don't even have to take it for requirements. It's really useful and interesting.",
    "If you are taking this, its because you have to. But Professor Khalil is a great guy and the lab is pretty interesting!",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. The experiments were really interesting, especially considering that chem e students don't get to spend a lot of time doing hands-on stuff for their courses. The boiling heat transfer experiment and the molecular beam epitaxy experiments were highlights for me. Hopefully these continue to be taught in future years. The time spent in the lab collecting data isn't difficult. There is a decent amount of work for each lab report, but nothing out of the ordinary.",
    "It is a complete lab course for chemical engineers. It is both interesting and challenging"
