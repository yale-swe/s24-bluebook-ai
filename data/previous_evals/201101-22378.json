   "comments": [
    "Portuguese 120 is a really fun class, and you learn a lot. The main problem is that Marta is slightly disorganized in general and unpredictable with the tests. If you study, you'll be fine and get a lot out of it. You also learn a lot about Lusophone culture and history, and the activities are fun. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "L2 Portuguese was much more difficult than L1. All of a sudden you're responsible for a lot of grammar - we were learning a tense a day at one point - but by the end of it you more or less have all of the tools to speak Portuguese fluently.It's probably true what previous commenters have said - you should try very hard to get on Marta's good side.Anyway we had a lot of fun in Portuguese this year. We took a Samba class in the Calhoun dance studio, saw a play put on by the intermediate students, and watched some pretty good movies. All in all I would say that Portuguese is fun, just more difficult than you might expect.",
    "Take it only if you want to learn the most basic portuguese imaginable, and you're better off taking it as a freshman or sophomore.",
    "The course is great. I think it is one of the most accelerated languages you can take at Yale. Most of the students in the class have taken Spanish or French before starting Portuguese so we were able to move along quite rapidly through vocabulary. Given that the level of productivity that is expected of the students is high. You will learn plenty of grammar that is more difficult then what you would learn in another language at comparable levels.",
    "Portuguese is a very interesting language to study and the class is not very difficult. The work is not much and you get to know not only the language but also aspects of Brazilian culture.",
    "This class is a bit disorganized, which is a good and bad thing. It's good because we have a lot of fun-the professor, Marta, is incredibly awesome. It's a bad thing, because it's hard to know when things are due. Also, the textbook kind of sucks. It's a very relaxed class, and what we learn (aside from Portuguese language) is very fascinating. Learn Portuguese-it is such an important and undervalued language. Marta is awesome. She is lenient, fun, loving, and has a great sense of humor.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student who wished to improve his or her portuguese. It was an enjoyable class and the work was manageable.",
    "learning Brazilian Portuguese. take this class. it is fun.",
    "The class was not well structured, and Marta was not clear about her expectations. I felt as though I learned quite a bit of the language, but the class would benefit from a more organized teacher. The book is very difficult to navigate as well.",
    "good focus on grammar, taught exclusively in Portuguese which is good",
    "If you don't speak Spanish fluently (I didn't speak a word until I learned Portuguese) don't expect an A, but it's a fun language and not too much work.",
    "You will learn a lot with Marta because she makes you talk a lot with your fellow classmates every class, so you practice a ton. She is great for one thing because she is Brazilian, so you can learn the accent by listening to her and imitating her, and she makes class fun, with a variety of activities. She was extremely flexible when I had conflicts (especially considering that I was a senior and missed lots of class for interviews and the like) and super nice. She was laid-back, but helped us learn effectively.",
    "YES! This is a great language course to take!"
