   "comments": [
    "The class covers how economic principles play out in a variety of different industry subsectors. Each class was useful but it could be improved by having greater content connections between classes - it sometimes felt like each class stood on its own rather than as a cohesive course.",
    "Strengths: The course really changes the way you think about health policies. It makes you think about the ramifications of each policy on the economics side. The course is very literature based and so we got to learn a lot about thew literature that was out there and what areas of research need further work. Weaknesses: The course could be a little more instructional",
    "GREAT. It was fun, engaging, and informational. I didn't think I was learning much, but writing my final paper I realized that Susan taught us SO MUCH. Very useful and practical.",
    "its fun, susan is great. it depends on the students you take it with. since it is so discussion driven I think that plays a major role. Sometimes it was more theory based and academic than i was hoping - but i think those are just my bias preferences. overall a good balance",
    "This course was an excellent application of the health economics gained through introductory health policy classes. The discussion-based format allows students to provide input and contribute actively to class discussions. The course could potentially be improved through greater emphasis on practical techniques that health economists utilize in their work.",
    "Highly recommend to student who wants to have a clear economic understanding of healthcare system.",
    "The small class size allowed discussion to flow easily. Great overview of how to interpret articles from economic journals.",
    "The duration of the class is very long. I think the discussion would be fresher and more alive if the course was broken up into two sessions. Otherwise, the content was great. Readings were relevant and discussions were interesting.",
    "A great course that expands on basic concepts of health economics and allows for students to pursue their own research interests. I found the small seminar format of the class to be quite suitable for the subject matter. Professor Busch was a fantastic instructor. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Knowledgeable and provided increased insight into familiar heealthcare topics.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Strengths: Very engaging with the class very understanding to every student's circumstances and offers great support Works hand-on with every student in preparation of their paper and makes it clear what she expects Weaknesses: None",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is an economics demigod. She's intelligent, fosters great discussion, provides feedback, and teaches in an approachable fashion. I want her to teach every class ever.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is wonderful, engaging, and very caring about our learning. I appreciate the collaborative approach to discussions, even if sometimes the nudging is required to get people to participate.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch is extremely passionate about the subject, eager to help her students out, and always curious to hear our opinions about class topics. I cannot praise her and her teaching style enough.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Responsive and helpful",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is great. She encouraged us to meet with her one-on-one several times throughout the semester to discuss our final papers, and her feedback was very constructive. Very laid back; she pushed us, but didn't create a stressful environment in the process.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0I like her approach in teaching this course, utilizing more of a discussion format than lecture. She poses great questions and gets us to think about concepts in a different way, i.e. economic lenses. Overall, she is terrific! Very down to earth and easy to converse with in a classroom setting.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0It was a pleasure to learn from Professor Busch this semester. At every moment throughout the semester, she was attentive and eager to answer student questions and concerns. In addition to reinforcing more advanced concepts in health economics, she also made a point of emphasizing gaps in the research literature and highlighting areas for students to pursue their own research."

   "comments": [
    "This class allows you dive into different economic issues in healthcare through reading of seminal articles and in-class discussion. Given the small size of the class, your classmates determine much of the experience. Class sessions were better when people actively participated and dragged when people were quiet.",
    "This course is very well-suited for anyone with an interest to know more about health economics. The course really changes the way you think about health policies. It makes you think about the ramifications of each policy on the economics side. The course is very literature based and so we got to learn a lot about thew literature that was out there and what areas of research need further work.",
    "Take it if you're very interested in a more qualitative approach to health economics and you're not afraid of class discussions.",
    "Health econ, lots of policy and theory applied to research. Both older and newer research. A small discussion based class that depends on your classmates for engagement.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in taking their health economics knowledge beyond introductory coursework. It really enables students to explore topics and think more on their own. I would advise students to come prepared to participate actively in class.",
    "REOMMENDED",
    "I would recommend it. You should have some prior econ exposure, but you certainly do not need to be an expert. Particularly great if you thrive in a small class. If anything, take it for Susan because she's awesome.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is looking to explore health economics in greater depth.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to any student who has already taken basic microeconomics and is interested in expanding on the core concepts of that class. This course enables you to think like a health economist in evaluating actual published research and will allow you to pursue your own research question at the end of the semester, should you choose to do so."
