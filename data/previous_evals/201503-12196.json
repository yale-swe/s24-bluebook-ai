    "Unique history class, very american studies esque.",
    "A null point, since Faragher is retiring. A Yale classic taught by an expert that makes you reconsider US history and remains interesting day after day. Good reading, and great lectures. Find something in the Beinicke to write your paper on, because theres so much awesome stuff there! And start writing it early. For the exams, yes, you do have to memorize many images, but a bit of applied focus makes it not too painful. Youll be fine, just stay on top of the work as best you can and study well.",
    "definitely",
    "Not sure since Professor Faragher retired. Be prepared that this class has an image component to it that I was not aware when I signed up, especially because I entered the class late in shopping period.",
    "History of the American West is a staple of the department, and has been taught for many years by a few brilliant professors. There's a reason for this. It is a quintessential class for those trying to understand America. The West is part of our national identity, and deserves to be studied. This course is probably the best place to do it in the entire country. Take this course!",
    "Great class, go to lecture, don't be a chump. Also Alice is amazing and wonderful and take the class for her if she is a TA.",
    "Yes! Great class. Eye-opening. I'd recommend taking it Credit\/D because there is a lot of information to memorize for the midterm\/final. You'll still get a ton out of the class.",
    "A really good History lecture to take. Not intimidating course material and the 50-minute lectures are a great length that keep students interested in the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend The American West to a fellow student. It is interesting and engaging and I loved going to lecture every week. The readings can be a bit much, but it its not necessary to complete them all, as the exams are written based on an exam study guide that is shared with each student before the midterm and final. These involved a lot of memorization, but I came away from each feeling that I really had learned a lot in the process of studying for them.",
    "Using a combination of primary sources and art created in various eras of the West, Professor Faragher provides both a historical overview of the American West and philosophical\/sociological analysis of the concept of \"the West.\" He pushes you to ask how similar the realities of the West are to your personal concept of the West. As someone who grew up in the West, I was really curious how much I would actually learn from this class, and the answer was a tremendous amount. So much of what I thought I knew about the West, even more progressive ideals about conservation and Native\/government interaction were completely upended by what I learned in this class. Faragher is supremely knowledgeable about the topic since he literally wrote the book on it. The Bienecke is ripe with primary resources on the West, so take advantage of those if you can. I'm not a History major and I loved this class. It was interesting and engaging, and many of the lectures hit close to home (literally for me). Definitely buy the textbook if you take this class; Faragher wrote it, so his lectures follow it pretty closely. Definitely Would recommend the class for just about anyone. One complaint was that the midterm and final were pretty rough. But otherwise, the class is pretty laidback and mostly just interesting.",
    "Take it!",
    "Interesting class, but the midterm and final required insane amounts of memorization.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any of my peers.",
    "Requires a lot of work. Didn't particularly like having to memorize the exact years of terms and images, since I don;t remember that anymore. But the course changed how I view the \"west\" and I learned lots about California that i didn't know before.",
    "Great class",
    "Really great class! I was not a huge American History fan but ended up taking this class and absolutely loving it. If you are even at a little bit interested in westward expansion in the Americas then take this class, you will not regret it.",
    "Great class, always interesting."
