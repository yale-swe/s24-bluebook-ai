    "Immersion, full immersion. I was a little shocked, but not surprised by this; it was a real wakeup call to only hear French. I would recommend taking French at Yale to anyone who is interested because I love the language and the method is so effective.",
    "Great, engaging way to further your French-speaking skills.",
    "I would recommend this class because you learn a lot of French. However, it is also disorganized, which can be very frustrating.",
    "It's a lot of work, if you don't keep up with the workbook exercises you'll be lost because that's where you learn most of the grammar."
