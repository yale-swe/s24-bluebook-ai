    "This class is an excellent, mind-expanding experience in which you'll learn a broad overview of big grand-strategy ideas but also reflect on your own personality.",
    "Learned new ways of thinking about history, leadership, and grand strategy. Also became a better writer.",
    "Professor Gaddis asks you to think about history and prediction in new and creative ways. His assignment always pushed you to find a new angle and make connections across time and space.",
    "Learned about Berlin's fox-hedgehog dichotomy and how it can be applied to world leaders in the modern age, but mostly learned about an assortment of vaguely related things that together constitute \"grand strategy.\" A confusingly disparate set of facts and ideas that were supposed to be tied together into some overarching meta-narrative but never really were.",
    "It gave me a new way of thinking about grand strategy. The course covers many different aspects of strategic thinking and balancing direction with flexibility.",
    "In this class, you learn a lot about the rise of authoritarianism and grand strategy. More importantly, however, you learn how to think and how to write. Gaddis is an incredible teacher, and really helped us write gooder. (haha)",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation for classics through Gaddis's book On Grand Strategy. The course expanded my thinking on the transferrable lessons of history. I learned that there is no bad place to look for lessons on understanding the present.",
    "I learned a lot about grand strategy. It almost feels like a condensed version of the Grand Strategy program.",
    "Critical thinking and writing",
    "I learned so much from this course about so many different time periods, regions, and thinkers. My favorite course at Yale so far."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The writing prompts are idiosyncratic and hard but successful in getting students to \"think about thinking,\" as Prof Gaddis says.",
    "Material is interesting, as are the papers, which are much more creative and idiosyncratic than most other history assignments. Gaddis is fascinating and generally excellent. Perhaps his only flaw is that he leads seminars in a way that is not always conducive to fluid discussion. He often spoke for 5-10 minutes about one thing or another and would then ask the class what one should do when faced with a particular crisis or decision, which usually prompted short answers with little substance. Overall, though, very strong class.",
    "I preferred the first half of the course slightly because we were reading Professor Gaddiss book and then discussing it. The readings in the second half were oftentimes denser and sometimes felt like too many pages for what we were supposed to get out of it.",
    "Strengths: the readings were among the most interesting I've ever done for a course at Yale. Weaknesses: everything besides the readings.",
    "The readings were fantastic. After October break it was a book a week, which was difficult to keep up with. The discussions were excellent. Gaddis kept us mostly on track and pushed us to debate as needed.",
    "The strengths of the class included the essay prompts, which force you to develop opinions on issues, and the class discussions. Gaddis offers interesting perspectives.",
    "Gaddis is a wonderful instructor and commands the room very well. He's knowledgable about everything and isn't afraid to push back on what his students are saying in class. The course was intentionally unstructured, but through the readings you could pull out the points you felt were salient.",
    "Strengths are professor Gaddis and the writing assignments. Classroom discussion was often weak and a little mechanical.",
    "Strengths - Discussion Weakness- Amount of reading towards the end",
    "Strengths: great discussion, well-curated books, really creative essay prompts Weaknesses: would have appreciated if we talked about some of the books in a bit more detail"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take this course -- and any other one Gaddis teaches -- for sure.",
    "Yes, heartily",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, even if only for the chance to interact with Professor Gaddis once a week. Be aware that the class is different from last year's. In the first half, we read his book. Some chapters are more insightful than others, but the lessons are all quite interesting. In the second half, the course gets better as we read recent work on grand strategy pertaining to China, Russia, and the US. This book list is maybe the course's biggest strength. Great course for history students to take if you can get in.",
    "This class is a positive experience. The fox\/hedgehog dichotomy is an interesting one, and as evidenced by our last assignment, an enduring one. Linking the idea to authoritarianism is interesting but we never touched on the connection too much. It's very much a case of talking about the book for 15 minutes and then you speak to Gaddis for an hour and a half. Never disappointing.",
    "At the end of the day, probably not. While the readings were super interesting, the class discussions were at best useless and at worst incredibly annoying. Download the syllabus, read the books on your own, and take a different course.",
    "If you get in, take the class.",
    "Yes - excellent class with a world famous professor. He cares about his students and is engaged with the course. A must-take if you can.",
    "Yes, I think it's a great space to think about the complexity of the world in which we are living.",
    "Absolutely yes. Professor Gaddis is amazing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are interested in history or strategy. If not, it is still worthwhile to learn from Professor Gaddis",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely!"
