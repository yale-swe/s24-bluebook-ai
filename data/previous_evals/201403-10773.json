   "comments": [
    "This class is hard, and you'd better be prepared to work. It's theory, so be ready for that. I wouldn't recommend this class for someone who doesn't have theory background.",
    "Yes. You can learn a lot and enhance your probability in this course.",
    "Randomized Algorithms is a great course. Professor Aspnes is a very engaging professor -- his drawings and his jokes in class keep the class very entertaining. Professor Aspnes is also very quick to email you back about any questions you have about the class (usually in just a few minutes). The material itself is very interesting too. In contrast to CPSC 365, in Randomized Algorithms it is often very easy to guess a valid algorithm to solve a given problem (the algorithm is usually to assign labels to items independently and uniformly at random). Much of the material in the class is showing how to prove that such a simple algorithm provides the properties that you want.",
    "Recommend. Very good course. If you want to challenge yourself, go for it.",
    "A very good course for learning randomized algorithms. Worth taking.",
    "I will recommend this course. Just be prepared for some challenging problem sets since this is a math oriented course. The grading is pretty relaxed and the final exam is much easier than the assignments."
