   "comments": [
    "if you're considering this course, it's probably a requirement for your major - if not, this is not a bad choice within the math department. for a math class, the class not hard - both the professor (feiszli) and the textbook are reliable sources of the knowledge you'll need to learn for the exams. also, some of the material we talk about actualy applies to the internet and other interesting systems.",
    "It's a really interesting course, and there's no reason to dread taking it if you have to for your major. Make sure you take it with Feiszli though.",
    "Good class, easier\/better than 120",
    "don't expect to be inspired particularly, but the math is pretty useful. it starts out very easy but picks up in the last few weeks, so make sure you don't slack off when it comes to learning the foundations",
    "This class is a great introduction to linear algebra. While it is advertised as \"with applications,\" only a few lectures were devoted to applications. Most of the class was learning the basic methods and using them with generalized examples. This was not a proof based class. I recommend the class; while there are not that many applications, you get the sense that even the basic methods we use are incredibly powerful.",
    "Unless you need it for your major, you probably aren't going to be taking this class.",
    "Linear algebra is a manageable and applicable branch of mathematics. It's definitely easier that 120 and the work load is pretty light. You need to study for the exams to do well, but the class is very low-stress. I'd recommend it to someone looking for a QR or an interesting 5th class. Take it.",
    "Very good class. We learned very interesting and important applications to the real world, which made learning the theory a lot more fun.The professor is very clear. Definitely take it with Professor Feiszli. I didn't have him last year, but from the reviews there was definitely a great improvement. He was always willing to help and is very good at making everything accessible. Very passionate about his work.",
    "Take it! Especially if you have to take Linear Algebra for something (I didn't, but I would have enjoyed the class even if it were required)...Linear algebra with applications is soooo much more relevant than proof-based, and Feiszli is a fantastic teacher. Average workload, fair tests (if you do the work) and a great instructor--best math class so far.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "This class was an interesting and helped me learn some important skills regarding matrix manipulation and application. Also, the curve was more generous than I thought. I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in the applications of linear algebra. Don't take it credit D, though, the curve is fairly generous.",
    "Necessary class for Econ and Math, Applied Math, Physics majors. It is a really competitive class but it is well taught. Material easier than 120, but the overall level of the class is higher.",
    "Take it. I took it for the math 120\/222 block that econ wants. It actually isn't that important to do it, but I have enjoyed the challenge of both classes and am happy to have explored math a bit. Take it if you want a challenging topic with fun applications.",
    "Math 222 is an enjoyable math class. It's a mixture between theoretical math, like geometry, and computational math, like calc. I would say it's easier than multivariable calc, but I did find that all of the theorems could get tricky. I enjoyed the applications most. On the last day of class, Professor Feiszli did an awesome demonstration of a computer program that used eigenvalues, a concept you will learn, to recognize faces of people in the class from their photos on classesv2. It was pretty amazing.The one reservation I have about the class is that the exams are unpredictable. I think it's because this is only Feiszli's second time teaching the course. The first midterm exam was easy, then the second was really difficult, and both were harder than the practice exams from the previous year that the professor gave us.",
    "Math 222 (in the fall, at least) is a rather good course to take if you need to take it. The professor this semester explains things very clearly and he is always willing to answer questions during lecture if you have them. I would definitely recommend taking the class with Feiszli if you have to take the course. The applications that we cover in class (this semester was stock options, customer ratings online, among other things) really demonstrate the power of linear algebra in the outside world.",
    "I would only recommend LinAlg to students who are SURE that they need to take it. Feiszli and Rishi (the TA) were skilled teachers. If you need\/REALLY WANT tolearn linear algebra, the you should absolutely take it with Feiszli. He makes it easy to take clear notes and explains concepts in the same clear organized fashion. The workload is manageable and constant-1 pset per week, 2 midterms and a final. However, I would not recommend taking LinAlg just for giggles. I realized part way through the class that I will not take any more math, and this made handling the class slightly painful. The actual material can be fun, but in a very rote, mechanical way. I would say, only take this class if you need to know the material for some other aspect of your life\/academic experiences.",
    "Would not recommend unless math major.",
    "It teaches you a lot on how about linear equations and how they relate to the real world. It is interesting only if you like math.",
    "Linear Algebra with Applications teaches the linear algebra and matrix math in a straightforward manner that may generally be understood well.",
    "I would recommend it. Its interesting and applicable to a lot of other fields.",
    "ery math and science course at Yale, the \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" trumps \"You Can Get It If You Really Want\" yet again.The thing about this pitiful extended metaphor is, if you try sometimes, you just might find...yourself disappointed with the nature of exam questions, or the lack of excitement in lectures. You take MATH222 thinking at first that it is easy, then later that it is manageable, then at last realizing it is another dose of humility and mediocre smudge on your transcript.For those students looking to get some exciting applications out of this course, fear not...if you are in economics. As a physical scientist, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of attention to physics, and even by the dearth of applications in general. While it wasn't the abstract \"prove this\" that MATH225 is rumored to be, MATH222 was still pretty theory-heavy. Which is fine, so long as it's advertised that way in the future, and so long as the homework problems reflect that so people aren't blindsided on the second midterm after doing decently before then.I took this course because my DUS told me I had to in order to graduate. So if you have to take it, take it.",
    "Take this if you like math, even if you don't need it for your major. it was really cool to see what math is like beyond calculus, and the course was not particulary difficult, though it did require some work.",
    "YES. Useful, not terribly conceptual difficult, actually kind of cool applications. TAKE THIS OVER 225!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You'll actually learn things.",
    "Definitely easier concepts than Math 120. The class isn't fantastic - Professor Fieszli is a nice guy but doesn't explain concepts particularly well. Not a great class but not bad either.",
    "Great.",
    "Unless you absolutely love math, or need it for your major, I would not recommend",
    "The material is very useful. Take it with another instructor if you can.",
    "I'm guessing that most of the people considering taking this class has to take a linear algebra class. I'd recommend taking this class with Professor Feiszli, since he's one of the better math professors at Yale. He's clear, and he is good at explaining theorems and definitions in plain English, which is impressive.",
    "This is an intro course in Linear Algebra. Though the math department is infamous for having awful instructors for all intro courses (maybe up till 222\/225) --mainly because most are graduate students who are either just learning how to teach or how to speak english--, Linear Algebra with Prof. Feiszli was very a doable course that I really enjoyed. It can get challenging cuz he makes the tests very hard, but I understand the curve is good, so you've got nothing to fear. Most people are taking that course because they have to, but it can actually be quite enjoyable.",
    "Take AMTH 222. This is your basic Yale math course (weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final exam that counts for a high proportion of your grade). The problem sets were fairly simple. There were a few slightly challenging problems and the two midterms were rather tricky as well. The final was much more straightforward in comparison. Professor Feiszli seems to adjust the tests every year, depending on the overall ability of the students in the class. You learn about matrices, invertibility, subspaces, orthogonality, eigenvalues, and what they mean geometrically. The material is interesting enough, but don\u0092t be fooled by the \u0093applications\u0094 part of the title. This is just linear algebra with less emphasis on proofs.",
    "I would recommend this course, and if you already know some linear algebra, it won't be a huge challenge. Don't expect a ton of applications though, despite the name of the class.",
    "For those for whom Math 222 is a prereq, take it with Prof Feiszli in the fall, even if grading maybe more competitive.For others, Math 222 is an interesting class anyway, without being very difficult.",
    "I had a great time learning with Professor Feiszli and Rishidev. They both helped me to understand the material so much better. As far as Math 222, the applications are very helpful and stretch into so many fields that I suggest taking it."
