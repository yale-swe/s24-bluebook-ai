   "comments": [
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class. It is a wonderful humanities course, the workload is in no way overbearing (it's actually quiet light) and it's always enjoyable. I learned a ton (especially spending a couple weeks on Aristotle) and read some works and authors I hadn't considered before that I now love (oh Jane Austen). If you are at all even slightly considering this course, take it!",
    "we got to read a lot of interesting stuff \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stuff you should have read, but might not have \u00e2\u0080\u0094and look at it from the specific but thought-provoking character formation angle. thompson is brilliant and a little terrifying. the midterm was not a good way to test our understanding or capacity for thinking about the material, and as a result, the final paper feels too heavily-weighted. i don't think thompson's dong the midterm again though. probably take it.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and highly recommend it. Professor Thompson is very smart, organized, and interested in your take on the readings (excellent reading list) as well. Definitely take it.",
    "It was an interesting class that made me reconsider the idea of human character. The syllabus has a very particular flavor, so I think if you like the sound of the syllabus you'll be down with the course.",
    "A multidimensional discussion of character and ethics that will keep you talking about the texts well after class ends. Small assignments as the semester goes along hardly feel like homework, and the essays (1 in class, 1 final) are not burdensome, they are enjoyable to write.",
    "The class was worth taking to have a class with Prof. Thompson, especially if you are a humanities major. She definitely likes to keep some distance from students, and so a seminar with her is a way to break at least some of those boundaries. The reading list is definitely good, and worth it to spend some more time with Aristotle, Smith, and Rousseau after the cursory spin many of us took through these authors in DS. That being said, the course doesn't really pack any punch; it's not really clear what the point of it all is and there's very little urgency to it all. This was the first time the course was taught, to be fair, and so hopefully Prof. Thompson would be able to change that in future iterations of the class.",
    "Yes, the course was fascinating and engaging, intellectually stimulating without being overwhelming. The entire class was actively engaged in the discussions and the readings were a pleasure to consider before and after seminar meetings. The course was an eye-opening, not intimidating immersion in ethics, and the questions are timeless.",
    "See first question. You read a range of texts both modern and classical, philosophical, fictional and psychoanalytical and explores questions of virtue, character, and how you form\/change character. Also good and evil. Two essays and class discussion.",
    "I would summarize the course as a look at character formation through literature and philosophy. If you are interested in how\/if people have the capacity to change their internal compass and how ancients and moderns consider this subject, then this is a great course for you. I would highly recommend this seminar to another student."
