    "YES! If I'm able, I will ask if I can audit it again if the same instructor teaches it. Even if we were to read the same texts.",
    "I think I would recommend it to another student, but not as an \"intro\" type class for subdisciplines who had no prior engagement with theory. This is not because the class is too difficult for \"intro\" type students, but because I think it does too little to introduce the scope of theory as its currently practiced. Again, I know that the decision to focus on three thinkers was a careful and defended pedagogical position, but I'm still not sure it's the most helpful way to engage method and theory in the study of religion."
