   "comments": [
    "Awesome class, but you have to put in a lot more than you may think. Be intelligent, don't just do the assignment, be the master of the assignment",
    "I would highly recommend Architecture 152 to anyone who is creative and enjoys doing crafts. You get to experiment with a lot of different mediums.",
    "Yes I would, the workload is not a ton unless you make it a ton, the assignments are often vague and open for interpretation, its more about the ideas behind your work rather than the physical craftsmanship of the projects.",
    "assignments change every year and are so random. you read books and try to incorporate them into your assignments even though they have no connections. I like the books anyway. Professor Bloomer is old and so talks about random stuff in class. In any assignments try to find a verbal reason and you will be good, even if your drawings and models look crappy. easy as an intro course",
    "This class is good for portfolio-building if you're applying to the major; you get what you put into this class. There are only 5 projects (which might go back down to four, one was a last-minute design problem) so you have plenty of time if you start early. If you need to know how you're doing in a class 24\/7, this is not the one for you- you won't get any sort of grades back until you submit the final portfolio.",
    "If you're considering this course, make sure that you would be REALLY interested in the material. Unlike some other classes, you actually need to do the reading for this course and are expected to talk about it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It takes about a month to \"get it\" but everything starts to make sense after the first critique.This class used to be a prerequisite for the Architecture major, but is now officially geared towards freshmen. Regardless, anyone is welcome; the majority of the people in the class were sophomores.I took this class together with Intro to Arch, and I found that the two classes complemented each other nicely. The first assignment for this class was model work, so when the time came to make a model for Intro Arch, I already had experience. Also, the large critique for the Intro to Arch final project was less scary because of the mini-critiques we had in Intro to Spacial Language. I would definitely recommend taking these two classes together.The readings were dense, but Bloomer does a good job of translating. Overall,this class is a survey of different attempts to explain beauty. You'll get as much from it as you're willing to put into it. There are 5 projects and you make a portfolio of your work at the end. I wouldn't have thought it when I began, but this was definitely my favourite course of the semester.",
    "A great way to relate space and the way we interpret space with buildings and architecture",
    "As an introductory course in spatial language I would recommend this course, it is taught by one of the most knowledgeable teachers in architecture and provides for a good foundation in the skills architects need."
