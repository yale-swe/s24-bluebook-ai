   "comments": [
    "I would really only suggest this lab course if you are a BME major or someone with a background in MATLAB or programming; it's difficult if you do not because most labs are computer-based. It can be frustrating at times because the reports are demanding but they are extremely fair, and you have two weeks to complete them.I thought this was a good course, and I love the way that it was organized so that two lab sessions were devoted to a lab that usually only took one lab sessions, so students could come back the next week to finish any last-minute tasks, or get together to work on the lab report, or just take a week off. This was a great feature for me because I've taken other lab courses in the past that were very stressful due to the time pressures to finish, and I strongly appreciated the way that time pressure didn't factor in in this course. That said, a couple of the labs were very frustrating because the equipment did not function properly, which made lab reports stressful. Many of the labs are very interesting and the professor is helpful and accessible, as are the TAs. It's a fine course for people using it for their major.",
    "Take it because it's required for BME majors. If you're an econ major, there's no reason to be in the class just because you're premed - unless you're a masochist.",
    "Much improved from previous years (from what I hear) -- the labs are interesting and all Matlab based. The reports are done in short answer form, which is nice, but they are graded pretty strictly, so attention to detail is needed. Labs are also all two-week labs, but for the most part can be finished in 1 class session. Rong is very helpful, and the TAs are somewhat familiar with the labs, but always willing to help.",
    "Only take it if you have to. The good thing about this lab is that you are given two weeks per lab and you can finish most labs in one week.Though the experiments were cool, a lot of the instructions during the lab procedure were very ambiguous. Sometimes, we would have to redo a part of the experiment because the instructions were unclear. It was frustrating to finish the labs at times.Also, I think it was expected that we knew more MatLab than we actually knew. However, we weren't expected to code too much.",
    "This lab isn't too bad, like most labs at Yale its not very well run, however the material is interesting, the lab reports aren't too long, and you only have to come to class 1 out of every 2 weeks, which provides some buffer space if something goes wrong.",
    "You will probably take this class because you are a BME major so it's not like you have an option. It is not a hard lab but some labs and some reports may take longer than others. But sometimes you don't even have to take the entire time to finish a lab which is really nice!",
    "The procedures were newly re-written this year to incorporate MatLab, and it made for some bumps along the way. It's easy to get lost in the specifications and forget how cool the topics actually are, but we did end up learning a lot about physiology.",
    "I can't make a direct comparison, but I think this lab has improved from previous years. All the software in the labs were replaced with matlab (except for one), which addresses some of the complaints from previous years. I think they also got new equipment.Also, since each lab is two weeks long, you very often get to skip every other week.",
    "Not the best lab I've taken but also not the worst. Definitely study hard for the final exam because it was like taking a physio exam, e.g. lots of information to be memorized.",
    "The lab has improved since the previous years. The experiments are pretty cool, and you usually end up having to go lab every other week. I wish the TA's and prof would review the matlab code and GUI interface needed for the labs beforehand because a lot of time we'd get stuck on just setting up the lab for an hour.",
    "This is a lab course where you learn about a variety of ways to measure physio signals. You will be required to code in matlab some, but it is not onerous. This lab is still being developed so expect things to not work or make sense immediately.",
    "This is a required lab for BME students. It is hard in terms of time. But you usually get two weeks per a rotation. This doesn't mean though you will always have enough time. For the neuromuscular lab my particular group came in for four different time, two times outside of regularly scheduled class. However, I think Professor Fan was open to suggestions and is making the neuromuscular lab more manageable. Choose your lab partners wisely as they can make all the difference between leaving an hour early or just not finishing the lab even after two weeks.",
    "Overall okay -- expect a lot of equipment malfunctions and long lab hours.",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise probably don't. The lab is not miserable or terrible, it's just not exciting either. Labs are two weeks long and can mostly be completed in the first week, which gives you weeks off, which is nice.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have to. It's a pretty good class. The lab write-ups are not too bad, but take your time with them since they make up a large part of your grade. The final is pretty tough and should not be taken lightly. Be sure to go to any review session and study.",
    "In the end, the course is a test of Matlab ability combined with some physiological understanding. All of the labs were interesting, but the way we engaged with the material in the lab was not always the best.",
    "Physiological Systems Lab is an interesting complement to the Physiological Systems lecture course, with six labs each lasting two weeks each and a lab report (question-answer format) due every other week. For the first two labs and the neuromuscular systems lab in particular, many people were confused, including the TAs, and the lab manuals were often unhelpful, but I've heard that Professor Fan's reorganization of the class made it much better than in previous years. Watch out for the MATLAB component of the class, do the lab reports carefully, and study for the final, and you should be fine.",
    "The labs themselves are fun to do. The lab reports can get long and tedious. It was hard to know what to expect for the final.",
    "It's a great lab, I heard it was terrible earlier but this time, a lot of changes were made and the new module is really fun to work on. But lab is painful enough, at least this one added some fun to it."
