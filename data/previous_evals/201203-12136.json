   "comments": [
    "It's a composition every week, and you engage largely with popular culture, movies, music, etc. I'd totally recommend it, Monica is a joy to be around and she genuinely cares about you.",
    "A great, fun class, not very demanding at all. No final.",
    "This class is good for practicing conversational skills in Italian. Monica Georgeo is great and every class would be a lot of fun. Reading books (both trashy and \"high art) in Italian was very rewarding. I'd recommend the class if you like the language.",
    "Take it!",
    "This class allows for continued exploration of Italian culture through some great (and not so great) films and novels. However, the class goals were nebulous and the discussions arbitrary at points. If you're just trying to keep your skills up, this class is for you.",
    "This class is good for keeping up your Italian but don't expect to get much else out of it. It has very little focus and barely reviews grammar.",
    "TAKE IT. It's a gem. With monica as your teacher, you'll find yourself challenged and engaged but not in a way that's too stressful.",
    "Italian 150 is really fun and will help you improve your italian! Every section is eventful and entertaining, and the writing assignments are about two pages on average, once or twice a week. They're always on light subjects that won't make you stress too hard.",
    "Will keep your language skills polished but not necessarily help you improve very much",
    "Super easy. Minimal work. If you're looking to continue Italian and don't want to work hard at it, I recommend it.",
    "A standard L5 class, although a bit too easy for anyone with serious interest in improving their Italian for study or work in Italy. You watch movies, read novels, and have discussions in class.",
    "A great way to keep up your Italian, in a relaxed setting. Most of your grade is based on weekly compositions. Definitely a low-stress class but not a waste of time either."
