    "This course is very useful for first year anthropologists! You will learn a lot from Shivi and from your own pursuits in this course!",
    "My favorite of the core courses- included a dynamic variety of ethnography and social theory that ties the history of the discipline to my own research interests. Terrific instruction and lots of opportunities to engage with the texts in the assignments."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of anthropology a lot! Shivi really knows the material and I feel like I got an excellent introduction and the chance to think through concepts and the history of my discipline on my own. I also felt like my ideas were heard and questioned in a constructive way. Shivi gave us a lot of great information as well as let us talk and think through things on our own. He also encouraged me to think through the historical parts of my discipline alongside my own research, which was encouraging and useful.",
    "Shivi's lectures were invaluable in fitting together a range of concepts in anthropology. The texts have already informed my own research and have motivated me to explore some of the course sections in more detail.",
    "This course was a fast-paced but thorough overview on a lot of literature that I will need to know moving forward in the discipline."
