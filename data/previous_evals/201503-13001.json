    "Offered great exposure and an introduction to accounting principles; solid learning environment and fair assessments",
    "Take the class credit\/D. Good but don't expect to learn a ton.",
    "yes",
    "Foundations of Accounting & Valuation is a fine course if you want to learn more about accounting and actual finance (as opposed to theoretical economics). You definitely learn how to prepare financial statements along with some conceptual understanding of valuation. That being said, you do need to put some effort into the material if you really want to understand it. The course has some problem sets that are very reasonable, and some daily homework. It also has a take-home final (that is basically like another problem set) and an in-class final on the more conceptual material.",
    "Early morning, but would recommend if you're interested in building an accounting foundation. Will help with studying for finance-industry interviews.",
    "Accounting is practical--I would recommend it because it is essential for anyone later hoping to go to business school or work in business.",
    "ACCT270 is a great course for those looking to go into finance. It allowed me to understand the basics of accounting from balance sheets, cash flow statements, income statements, and the relationships between all three. I am really glad I took this course, and took away some real, applicable skills from the course.",
    "Take if you want to work in finance or just get a better understanding of how modern companies operate.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in finance. You learn about finance for 6 weeks, and accounting for 6 weeks, though the accounting is in the middle of the term. The daily accounting homework is graded on completion and can take a while, but will help you understand accounting concepts in more detail and understand how the financial statements are connected.",
    "You'll learn a lot - don't make the mistake of taking it Cred\/D\/Fail like I did..",
    "Good course to take credit d. You learn a lot of the basics and don't have to take the final.",
    "I would recommend the course. Professor Antle is great, and while lectures can be hard to follow at times, Professor Antle keeps class interesting and amusing. It is a good amount of work - assignments each night and long problem sets, but I think you can get a lot out of it.",
    "If they want the basic tools of accounting. Otherwise, for general knowledge, no.",
    "Take this class Credit D and it is a low-stress, low-workload class where you can gain some financial literacy.",
    "Take it, but only if youre willing to put in the time to learn the material. This is not a gut, and if you dont stay on the top of the class you will become very lost. The material is not terribly exciting, but it is useful and Prof. Antle teaches it well. Consider Cr\/D.",
    "Take it credit\/d even though it's easy.",
    "Take it Cr\/D",
    "I would not recommend this course for other students simply because it didn't feel like it was anything that couldn't be learned quickly by just reading the textbook.",
    "Good credit d and basic skills class",
    "Yes, would recommend - good for becoming familiar with the vocabulary of finance and basic tools",
    "Good course.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you're interested in learning the basics of accounting and valuation. Plus, Rick Antle is great."
