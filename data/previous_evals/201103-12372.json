    "What a class!First, be aware that you will spend a LOT of time for this class.The labs will take you hours beyond the scheduled times and the field trips are additional time, plus write-ups.The is no homework otherwise, but the exams are quite difficult.Prof. Hickey is quite knowledgeable, but expects a lot from his students.Some of the material can get quite dry, while other material can be quite interesting.Take this if you have to, and be ready for the ride, but otherwise, I would say this isn't a class for someone just looking for a science credit.",
    "Stratigraphy begins with basic principles of fluid transport of individual sediment grains and ends with interpretation of large-scale features and the signatures of depositional environments. This was perhaps the most demanding and most rewarding geology class I have taken so far at Yale. The field trips are a fantastic extension of class. Lab, however, can be tedious. Just do yourself a favor, and make sure you have the time to devote to this class. It really is more of a 1.5 - 2 course credit time requirement.",
    "I think it'll be great if you've taken a intro geology class, especially one that teaches you rock identification and other basic stuff. It was hard going into the class and the facies models were very difficult to understand. I would say if you're not a relevant major, don't go into this class. It really should be labeled as an advanced level course and should have that lab as half a credit. But I would absolutely absolutely recommend this class to anyone who's interested. Actually at the end you don't really care about whether the material is interesting or no (well of course it is!), you just want to learn everything that Professor Hickey asks you to learn.",
    "This class is definitely worth it for a geology major. You will come out knowing a ton of sedimentology\/stratigraphy and feeling very legit about geology. It is definitely a ton of work and not all of the work really feels worthwhile but like I said, you learn a lot.",
    "When you tell people you\u0092re taking stratigraphy, be prepared to get a lot of blank looks or a polite \u0093what\u0092s that?\u0094 You should tell them: it\u0092s one of the best classes at Yale!! Stratigraphy was definitely the most challenging geology class I\u0092ve taken (from the standpoint of sheer workload and time required outside of lecture), but probably the best. However, due to the parenthetical aspects (weekly 2+ hours of lab built into 1 credit, plus two weekend field trips, and assignments for all of the above), definitely approach this class as being worth 1.5 if not 2 credits (if you really want to do it right, ie read the textbook). Nevertheless, as I studied for my final, I realized that although I had barely touched the textbook in the last few months, I still learned an incredible amount from lecture, lab, and seeing the concepts at work in the field. We started with how a grain of sediment forms, gets transported, and becomesrock, deposited as one layer in a complex sequence of rocks. We saw how the same processes have been at work throughout Earth history (weekend field trip to the Devonian Catskills), and continue today (at the beach, marsh, and river around New Haven). This class requires weekly lab assignments, reading the textbook, two midterms, a few extra assignments, and a final and lab final. So a lot, but worth it, especially because Leo Hickey and Amelinda are very knowledgeable and approachable instructors. Don\u0092t be afraid to ask questions (with their Socratic method, they will certainly be asking you a lot of questions) \u0096 they will do whatever it takes to help you understand the material! Definitely take this class \u0096 I went into it thinking rocks are boring, and came out wanting Stratigraphy to be a part of my research career.",
    "Learn about stratigraphy from the sediment to the major groupings",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who ever looked at a rock outcrop and wondered how it came to be and is willing to put in a lot of work. Expect to learn a new language, as stratigraphy has its own set of vocabulary. Overall, the course was very rewarding!"
