   "comments": [
    "I didn't do AP courses in high school, but I'm told this class is comparable to an advanced AP Calc BC class. As someone with limited background in calculus, I was often frustrated by the fact that most people in my class had actually taken Calc BC in high school and so they were much more prepared for the course and as a result the pace of the class was very fast. Nonetheless, still manageable. Just means that if you are in a similar situation to me then you have to work a bit harder than others may have to.",
    "If you are on the fence between 115 or 120 (or equivalent course) go for the 120 class (it taught better and not as difficult). The class has an interesting structure but the grading is fair. The practice tests are extremely helpful for the tests, the problems are very similar (just be careful because the old test do not cover exactly the same material)",
    "A calculus class that requires some good amount of work. But as long as you watch the assigned videos, keep up with the homework and pay good attention in class, there is not much extra work to be done in order to do well in exams.",
    "Only take it if you need it 4 your major.",
    "Math 115 is a great course and is a good way to fulfill some requirements.",
    "Math 115 was actually pretty fun. Yeah, you'll have to study pretty hard for exams, and even if you do study hard, the questions are tricky and may trip you up. I learned a lot from Math 115 and really loved Rolf. He's kind and really cares about his students. If you're interested in infinity, this class will teach you a lot about infinity.",
    "This class is certainly doable, but is not necessarily the best QR for someone not headed in a math heavy direction. I did find it to be a good introduction to math at Yale, however. The problem sets are challenging and should be started ahead of time, but are not impossible. The tests are quite difficult, and require the application of several concepts for each problem. I would recommend this course for those who are thinking about taking more math at Yale, but not for those who are simply looking to fulfill a QR. The instruction is definitely good and the video lectures force you to come to class prepared to engage with the material. This class is a challenge that is worth it for many students, but not all.",
    "I would recommend this course if you got Jim because depending on your teacher the class can be very difficult to follow and do well in.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to students who really enjoy math.",
    "Math 115 is hard but worthwhile. There is a lot of homework (problem sets and online quizzes) but all of it is necessary for completely understanding the material. Exams were very hard so make sure you study not just the material, but also ways of manipulating the material you do know. They will try and trick you! Classtime is fun - mostly spent collaborating with peers.",
    "AARDVARK This is a really difficult question to answer. Because there were people in math 115 who were like \"pssssh, ain't a thang\" and there were people (like me) who were lost and confused and in tears and then there were all sorts of people in between. And I have no idea where you, dear reader, will fall on that spectrum. I wouldn't personally recommend this course. If I gauge the success of a course on the quantity and quality of what I learned, and how useful that information will be to me going forward, I was extremely unimpressed with Math 115. I was most frustrated because my input was not yielding output: I worked so hard for this course, did the videos and prep problems and psets, went to office hours and peer tutoring, organized countless study sessions with my classmates... but I still felt clueless and dumb, my failing grades were still abominable, and I don't feel as if I have learned anything I can realistically use in the future. But take all of this with a large chunk of salt. Some more notes: Be wary of this course if you new to or are not good with flipped classroom (new concepts introduced in video prelectures, homework problems graded, then you cover topic with prof, then do pset). I was new and learned this the hard way. Be wary of this course if you're not good at learning very quickly. I think the course material wouldn't have been nearly as difficult if given adequate time to learn it. Jim Rolf's section might be better for the more advanced students, because while other profs can provide a fresh perspective\/critique on the video lectures, Jim Rolf can't. (because he made the videos) I wouldn't take this course 'just because.' I would take this course if you have to or need it for your major or are genuinely just fascinated by series. And if you do take it, punch it in the face! I believe in you.",
    "Basically a AP Calc BC course. Doesn't move too too quickly but definitely helps to stay on top of the videos and problem sets. Weekly psets plus two midterms and a final. I would definitely recommend it to another student, and definitely suggest that they take it with Rolf.",
    "Quite challenging and a lot of work, since it implies not only a problem set per week but also several online videos and quizzes. But it is a good course.",
    "I would say that while it is not the most interesting stuff at times, it is worth taking, especially because it fulfills the prerequisite for many major programs.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 115. The way the class is taught (watching videos outside of class and doing group practice problems in class) is difficult to adjust to at first, because it is so different from the normal class structure. However, it is beneficial at times, especially when reviewing the new material at the beginning of the year. Professor Rolf is great and very engaging, but I did not feel like I learned the material at a very deep level."
