   "comments": [
    "Pretty standard French course, with an emphasis on reading and seeing some (actually very interesting) French books and films. Take it with Professor Burton, she is a wonderful, wonderful teacher who makes what could be a boring course always interesting.",
    "This course is very challenging if you haven't gotten your French to a rather proficient level. That said, I still feel as if it helped me strengthen my language skills a good deal.",
    "Yes,definitely.",
    "The French department at Yale is very well organized, you will get better at French.",
    "Pretty basic grammar lessons- subjunctive, conditional phrases, etc. Homework is pretty easy but time consuming. Also, the films are pretty good.",
    "It\u0092s L3. You most likely either need or want to take it, and in either case this review will not matter to you. That said, Mme. Burton is awesome, and I cannot imagine a better professor to take French with at Yale. The books are also really morbid."
