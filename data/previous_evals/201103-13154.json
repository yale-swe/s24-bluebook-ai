   "comments": [
    "Pretty good class, though it's a seminar so you get out of it what you put in. Some of the readings are dull, but the class discussion was very engaging.",
    "This was a highly enjoyable class that I would recommend to anyone even vaguely interested in the history of medicine. The readings were diverse and Dr. Romano really cared about the feedback we gave her on the readings. All of the content of the course was interesting and we had some great class discussions. The 20-page final paper in addition to a 2 page reading response each week was a little much, but otherwise it was a great course.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is a psychology major or interested in pharmaceuticals and their place in American history.",
    "Really good introduction to the history beyond psychopharmacology. Nice mix of science and humanities in my opinion. Take it if you're remotely interested in it.",
    "Interesting material. Prof. Romano was very helpful and engaging",
    "GREAT! a lot of reading but the reading is balanced. a more difficult, dense read will be followed by something with more of a story-line. cohesive. attend every seminar because they are very rewarding. professor is unbelievable. seminar will be what you make of it.",
    "Yes. Great junior seminar for HSHM, weekly response papers were actually helpful in understanding course material, take it if you are interested",
    "It is one of the most amazing classes I've ever taken at Yale! It covers the history of pharmacology and psychiatry and the intersections between the two in the USA, while also considering the impact that these two have had in the personal lives of many Americans and how it affects them today. It is a history class that brings many subjects home. There is also the chance to lead discussions."
