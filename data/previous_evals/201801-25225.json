    "More interesting guest speakers!",
    "I think the course should have fewer lectures (although it already does not have many) and be almost entirely discussion and project based.",
    "very good but need to be more organized",
    "There should be more representation among the professors. If not, they should approach the class from more of a listening and learning perspective. I didnt learn much in the class, but we began to have some important conversations about race, gender, sexuality, ability, and socioeconomic status."
