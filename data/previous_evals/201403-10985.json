   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent class in which students learn to think simultaneously about history, gender, and sexuality. The readings are dense and long, and you are expected to write a 20-page research paper on a topic of your choice.",
    "Amazing class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "An introduction to the history of sexuality, as the title suggests. Throughout the course, Professor Dean makes a convincing case for why the history of sexuality is an important and often overlooked approach to questions of sex and gender. I would strongly recommend the course to a fellow student interested in sex and gender."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline by showing me how scholars have used very different methodologies to approach historical problems, and by showing me how using gender and sexuality can be critical to understanding history.",
    "As I am interesting in gender questions, this class was a marvelous introduction to the topic.",
    "A clear synthetic picture of the history of sexuality emerged over the duration of the course, which will be helpful to my research in terms of addressing questions of sex and gender with more precision."
