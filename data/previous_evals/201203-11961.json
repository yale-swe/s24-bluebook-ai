   "comments": [
    "It's a demanding but not super-accelerated French class. Take it. You'll learn a ton if you actually put the effort in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about French grammar, vocabulary, and culture. Additionally, I found the class engaging and informative.",
    "French 130 is so much better than L1 and L2, not only are you done with French in Action but get to engage with more literature and use the acquired vocabulary in greater context.",
    "French 130 is a great, but time consuming, way to improve your French. I have learned so much from this course, and although I complained throughout the semester about the workload, especially compared to the equivalent Spanish course, I am very pleased with my French improvement.",
    "The work is a lot, expect to do at least one listening section a night. However, if your interested in becoming better French, this is the coursefor you! Although you definitely have to do a little studying everyday, it was more than worth it! I would take this course again in a heartbeat!",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Mme Koizim is excellent. It is clear that she knows the material thoroughly herself and knows how to communicate that understanding to others. I would also recommend taking advantage of the French tables to improve your speaking skills.",
    "Students are exposed to several examples of french literature and cinema and the French worldview in general. In many ways this level solidifies a foundation of grammar and structure that has been studied in previous courses. This class is not for the faint of heart. French 130 is a fairly intensive program that requires daily commitment. That being said, it is well worth the time you put into it.",
    "Take, because you have to.",
    "If you want to learn French at Yale, take it with Mme Koizim. If you are not sure about learning French, take it with Mme Koizim. She will make you love it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It is a great way to learn French while also coming to appreciate the language."
