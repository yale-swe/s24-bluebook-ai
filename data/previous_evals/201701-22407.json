    "Further econometrics from last semester",
    "Econometrics in both theoretical sense and in application work.",
    "I learnt more about econometrics.",
    "I learned the value, benefits, and shortcomings of a variety of econometric methods. I also learned to constantly keep at the forefront of my mind the question \"What exactly am I estimating?\" The tools learned in this class have helped me analyze, critique, and better understand econometric studies and analyses.",
    "I learnt a lot about the econometric techniques that are commonly used in empirical studies and when they should be applied.",
    "I liked that this course was a continuation of Econometrics in the fall, but more applied to development. It put the development context into the overall IDE program. Sometimes felt a bit lost about the macro applicability of what we were talking about, but otherwise appreciated the course (especially when I did follow).",
    "Devo metrics is a fantastic course to understand the econometric techniques used in economic research. It is a good way to evaluate these techniques and understand their applicability.",
    "Practical skills needed in writing a full economics academic paper",
    "How to use econometric techniques to solve certain issues of bias and obtain consistent estimates of program effect.",
    "I learned a lot about different models and approaches to analyze situations, like Instrumental Variables, Regression Discontinuities, Discrete Outcome Models etc. Also: data presentation, learn how to read research papers and critique them",
    "Learnt econometric tools with regards to RCTs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The paper requirement could have been brought up slightly earlier to allow more time to think of a good topic to write on.",
    "Content this semester is catered to help us apply in real life analysis. Very useful.",
    "It built upon materials learnt in fall term. Some of the materials could be gone over more slowly.",
    "I really wish that this course had continued to have problem sets and exams as it did last semester. Without the problem sets, I don't actively engage with the material and therefore don't actually learn econometrics.",
    "There could be more homework assignments to practice what we have learned.",
    "No weaknesses to report. Strengths were that a variety of topics were covered in depth, and we reviewed real examples of these methods and how they have been used in order to evaluate studies.",
    "I think the course is great in its current form. More problem sets could be helpful for students to better understand the concepts.",
    "Strength: continuation of past material, more applied to development Weakness: Sometimes unclear about what was going on - would have liked more TA teaching",
    "Some more time allotted to applying the econometric techniques to real-world experiments and policies could be helpful. Continuous problem sets would be a great asset to facilitate learning.",
    "Strengths - Class is very well-organized and structured Weaknesses - Difficult to see the applicability of these formulations unless tied to more applied classes",
    "It will help students understands the various troubles faced in econometric analysis and randomized evaluations. This course helped me prepare for many academic interviews as well. There should have been more problem sets and less notes so that students would have been more engaged with the course.",
    "I think we should have had more problem sets on the different topics covered. Since we were all so focused on our papers, we could only gain (partial) expertise over one or two topics. Instead, if the idea of the term paper could be introduced during 558, the spring semester needn't be focused only on the paper and we can do more problem sets or reading assignments from papers. One other thing I would have loved to do was to have problem sets based off papers - that would certainly encourage us to read more papers."

    "Yes",
