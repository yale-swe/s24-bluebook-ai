    "A comprehensive introduction to Islamic political philosophy, Islamic legal theory, and general theories of constitutionalism and democracy. These were wholly new fields to me, so I learned a lot in this course.",
    "I gained a good overview of the question of Islam and Democracy in the Modern Middle East, and feel comfortable discussing the topic with others and conducting more advanced research on the topic. I gained a good deal of knowledge about the literature\/topic.",
    "Understanding of many fundamental Islamic concepts and how they morphed and changed over centuries, and manifest themselves today.",
    "An incredibly in-depth exposure to islamic history and exposure to the many islamist jurists that have shaped the religion in places like Iran and Pakistan."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The assigned readings were way too long most of the time, and I found it really hard to contextualize them before Prof. March introduced them in class. Also, the majority of the seminar discussions did not directly revolve around the readings, so the amount of pages assigned was not really justified, either.",
    "Good course, I wish the readings were a little shorter and more focused (I didn't mind the time for reading, but wasn't always sure what I was supposed to take away from the readings). I learned a lot and the paper topics were excellent for synthesizing and gaining deeper insight into the course. Overall an excellent course.",
    "Strengths- extremely thought provoking, pushes you to think and challenge yourself. Weakness - somewhat scattered at times."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! A great introduction to Islamic political philosophy, Islamic legal theory, and general theories of constitutionalism and democracy. Take it if any of these interests you. There isn't much of a discussion in class, and Prof. March lectures most of the time, but this is quite understandable and useful, considering that the material is really dense and requires extensive annotation\/elucidation on the part of the instructor. And Prof. March is a true expert on these topics!",
    "Yes, this is a good introduction to the topic. It is important to know what to expect: this course deals with the theological\/theoretical underpinnings of the topic, and is essentially a political philosophy course. I loved this and was expecting it, but if you were looking for a very empirical course on the topic you might be disappointed.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to push him or herself to think and learn in a challenging environment instead of being simply lectured. Also fascinating material that is very relevant to anyone interested in either Islam or democracy, as both themes shed light on one another.",
    "Yes. It was an incredible course and Professor March is a one-of-a-kind teacher."
