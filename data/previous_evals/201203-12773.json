   "comments": [
    "This class looks at countries that either just came out of a conflict or are still going through a conflict. It analyzes the development of the countries after the conflict (civil war, political violence, etc.).",
    "I strongly recommend this course to students interested in international relations and negotiation process. The lectures are varied and interesting because the professor knows a lot about the subject.",
    "An interesting course to take if you are interested in the ideas of Post-Conflict reconstruction. Make sure to look through the syllabus to check that all of the sub-themes interest you. There is no section for the course, and you can get by with doing a few of the readings for each theme to get a solid background (read more if you have time, because they are interesting and definitely useful for papers).",
    "It's a good class that you can really get a solid base of knowledge from if you do all the reading. Lectures aren't riveting, but there aren't that bad. I'd recommend it if you're interested.",
    "I would recommend this class if the material immediately sounds interesting to you. Otherwise, you will probably be bored.",
    "detailed insight into post conflict solutions and steps to a sustainable peace. I would recommend the course.",
    "Definitely worth taking. It covers a lot of great material, but the courseload is more than reasonable (just some reading for every class that you don't even really have to do and 3 papers). This stuff is important to know, and the theory also gets contextualized by the case studies we cover individually.",
    "I would. I think you learn a great deal about conflicts in the world today or in very recent history, conflicts that often have very little currency in the public consciousness.",
    "I would summarize Post-Conflict Politics as a lecture class covering the issues countries face as they recover from civil wars, especially in the modern era. I would recommend it to a student looking to either understand the aftermath of civil war in a particular country, or to a student looking to simply learn a lot about something applicable to many places in the world. As the world becomes more interconnected, it seems as though learning about these processes will become more important. This class honestly wasn't too much work, while being very interesting and engaging, which makes it a no-brainer to take.",
    "If you're interested in conflict situations you should definitely take this class. I feel like I now have a good background to discuss issues relating to what happens after a conflict is over.",
    "I recommend it if the subject is something that really interests you. The reading is long but interesting.",
    "I recommend this to someone who is passionate about post-conflict countries and who is willing to put in the individual effort required to actually get something out of this class.",
    "Take it. not too much work and you learn a lot.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, the material is interesting and lectures are pretty good. On the other hand, I thought the class was sort of episodic. Each lecture or group of lectures would discuss certain topics important to post-conflict countries (such as elections) but I felt more could have been done to tie everything together towards the end of the course. Additionally, I felt the papers required for the class were handled poorly. You pick a post-conflict country to specialize in and write all your papers on that country, which is actually an interesting way to do things as it allows you to become a sort of expert on a place in the world. However, assignments such as \"describe the post-conflict economic situation country in 800 words\" are really vague; how are you supposed to tackle such a broad question in 800 words? This was, unfortunately, never explained. Conversely, the final paper is a 4000 word affair on the question of \"is peace sustainable in your country?.\" Not necessarily a bad topic, but it is a bit ambitious, and I don't really feel like I was better prepared to offer a comprehensive answer to the question at the end of the course than I was at the beginning of it. All in all, a good course with on okay work load, but it does have its faults.",
    "I do recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. You'll learn a lot about how to tie political theoriesto current affairs, and you'll gain a particular expertise in the country you follow and write papers about.",
    "A good class, if somewhat disorganized. Professor Simon simply knows so much that he often goes on tangents. If you know enough about African politics and can follow him coherently, a course well worth it. Otherwise, it can be a bit confusing and often drowsy.",
    "It was an okay class. Not spectacular, but does its job of introducing students to post-conflict politics. Pretty theoretical, doesn't grant much depth to any particular cases, but that's kind of a limitation of this type of intro class. However, it's cool that you get to pick a country to focus on and write your papers about, because that gives you depth while the class lectures give you the theory with which to understand and analyze the events of that country. I'd say it's a good class and you can get a lot out of it if you do the readings and try, but it's definitely possible to get by without them, just less rewarding. It's not spectacular and Simon has this rhythmic way of talking that's easy to tune out right after lunch, but he's really nice, knows his stuff, and is interesting to talk to if you go to his office hours. Shop it. Take it if the subject really appeals to you. I don't regret it and the grading's not terribly harsh. Slides are informative enough, just take notes too and at least read the abstracts of every reading because they appear on the midterm.",
    "This was a good course to build basic knowledge of the post-conflict peace process. Also, the fact that each student had their own conflict that they researched throughout the course was an interesting aspect of the course from which I think everyone learns a lot. The workload is definitely manageable and you will come away from the course knowing more about how countries try to move past a period of war.",
    "No. This class was structureless, frustrating and poorly taught. This was a lecture with no sections (there was one \"TA\" whose sole purpose was to grade things so David Simon can fly off to foreign countries at regular intervals) and lectures were basically strings of Simon's poor and painful attempts at humor over what was supposed to be serious subject matter. The class is way too broad and non-cohesive. The readings were rarely helpful in understanding concepts mentioned in class, often irrelevant to the point where Simon does not even mention assigned readings in class. Towards the end of the semester, it was painfully obvious that those who bothered to go to class did not bother to do the readings. Each student picked a country of responsibility for research (which was a good part of the course in my opinion), but David Simon cared even less than the students. We were supposed to do \"presentations\" on our selected countries, but this ended up literally just being him asking 1-2 random throwaway questions in the last 2 minutes of class. Overall, a disappointment.",
    "This is a really interesting course -- you'll walk away with deep background on a number of post-conflict issues, including peacekeeping and transitional justice, and a great deal of knowledge about the post-conflict situation in your particular \"country of responsibility.\" I'd recommend the course, but with reservations: the workload can be quite heavy, readings can be very dense (and there's no section to help you process them), and lectures (especially toward the end of the term) can feel dry and desultory. The parameters of the writing assignments are poorly defined, and grading is meticulous, so be sure to talk to Prof. Simon or your grader to make sure you're on the right track. The material is sufficiently fascinating -- and sufficiently important -- that these little flaws in course design and administration barely registered for me, but anyone looking to take the class should shop it critically and think hard about whether these issues are likely to be problems for them."
