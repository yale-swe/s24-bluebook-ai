   "comments": [
    "In general, I enjoyed the course. I struggled to understand the coding aspects of python and wished we had a little more instruction in how code was written to understand how to write and troubleshoot code better.",
    "Too much homework composing only 40% of the grade. The homework is difficult. Wish more explanations on homework.",
    "I think this course is really helpful and informational.",
    "Great course for Python",
    "Overall, I think this is a great class with very important topics being addressed. Since the class switched to Python this year, I had some problems learning how to code in that language. I think more time should have been spent on learning how the Python code works before jumping into the meat of the course.",
    "there should have been a better anticipation of the potential needs for technical support with Python. TA did the best that she could, but was highly overburdened.",
    "I think students can benefit from having the class twice a week for an hour and half instead of just one day for two hours. The amount of material to cover is substantial and I felt the pace should be slowed down at many parts of the course.",
    "Excellent class, students enrolled are interested in the subject and skills. My only suggestion for improvement is to figure out how to ramp up the learning curve for object oriented programming in Python.",
    "SO HARD and python is THE WORST. Should be offered to do it in R or Excel or something else that is more useful than Python.",
    "Good class to learn simulation model to deal with policy related problems",
    "The course was very challenging because it was the professor's first year teaching it in python. Some students were overwhelmed and may have needed more support and resources to help them. I think having a lab session with more TAs and support, like in SAS classes, could be very helpful.",
    "This course is great and really valuable, probably the only course I actually enjoyed taking at all of YSPH.",
    "This is an amazing class. Must take. I wish I were able to take this class in the first year (couldn't fit into the schedule) before I went on to my internship and before I started my thesis. This course has helped clarify so many concepts I learned in other modeling concentration classes. Having been able to pick up coding with Python was another plus from taking this class. Highly recommended.",
    "Strength: Only course in School of Public Health (that I am aware of) to use Python (which should be more widely taught due to its widespread use in industry and the languages flexibility). Provides adequate overview of cost-effectiveness methods. Weaknesses: Course does not fully flesh out either topic. Course would be better served being broken into two weekly sessions: one for Python, one for cost-effectiveness theory",
    "This course requires a lot of independent study. Be sure to watch the MIT online courses before the semester gets going and rewatch all lectures before attempting the homework. It was worthwhile to gain a better understanding of modeling concepts and theory but I do not feel confident in my ability to actually create a model independently after this course. I think that if the course had been taught in Excel as in previous years it would have been more intuitive to complete the homework instead of the hours of agonizing over Python code that I didn't quite comprehend.",
    "we don't have enough time for the report presentation it is hard to focus on people's presentation (which is extremely infomative) and answer 8 questions in 5 min",
    "Weekly labs would be really helpful, particularly for those without any experiences in python.",
    "The programming and stats part was pretty fundamental",
    "generally, it is a very useful class. Using python to solve policy-related questions are very interesting. However, the TA is not helpful and there should be more supportive help such as weekly lab or a more responsible TA",
    "teaching python, which is interesting.",
    "Strengths: Help us learn the basic concepts of health-care decision and introduction of python programming. Weakness: I think lecture+lab\/per week is more appropriate for this course. Instructor can focus more on knowledge on health-care decision or theory of simulation model in the lecture. How to code and programming can be taught by TA in the lab session.",
    "I thought the course was a good combination of concept and practice, and that it provided me with extremely useful skills for my public health education.",
    "The homework assignments were not based on material covered in classes.",
    "I can hardly catch what the instructor says during the course. I have to use the time outside the class to review the slides and watch the recorded video. I feel like I cannot utilize the time during the course because the weakness of instructor in conveying information to us clearly. Also, the course should give more percentage of grades to homework. Every week I have to spend like 10 hours, but the total grades only account for 40%.",
    "I think knowing the language before taking this course would help. It was difficult to troubleshoot. Also people need repetition, so doing something more than once could help us remember. This course seems to need to be VERY applied so perhaps instead of labs with conceptual responses only we could have short bits of labs to practice syntax and you can only move on if you get the syntax right. Not sure exactly how this would work but it would be helpful to practice in small bits so you know whats wrong or have a code book instead of a whole piece of code to extract from, especially at first.",
    "Great course overall, but I think the class could have benefited from more instruction for using python (like bug fixing, etc.).",
    "I think this course was way too hard for non-comp sci experts. In order to make this class more effective, we should have more assignments on similar techniques so that we can fully grasp them. It was sometimes almost impossible to go from the class to the hw and succeed. We should really have two lectures a week and therefore two examples on the subject. Additionally, the class should either go slower and cover less or count for 2 credits and be more intense- i'm not sure I learned enough other than how to read studies better. I don't think I could do a real one on my own yet. I wish we could have learned to do more that would be relevant to hospital administration questions and not only policy questions. While python is cool, I don't know if people will know it at the hospital I am going to. VBA might have been better in that respect."

    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Overall, I liked Reza's teaching. However, sometimes it felt like he forgot that most of the students did not have any familiarity with python.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0I think Reza is very patient with us and very helpful whenever we had questions.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Great professor, reply promptly for questions on Piazza and try his best to make this course easier for Python beginner",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0I think previously using excel to teach this class affected the way python was taught. Could be more structural than the way it is taught now.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0One of the best teachers I've had that has led a coding course.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is great at being available to students and answering questions",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza did his best. I do like his teaching style. Should take more time to make sure he can clearly get across his lessons to students.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Sometimes rushes through the material, but generally receptive to student concerns",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is fantastic. He is sharp, thoughtful, and approachable. Importantly, he is always responsive to questions and available to help.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0The nicest and super understanding even though python is impossible.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0He is kind and understanding, and very clear. It was helpful that the lectures were videotaped so we could watch them again if we were confused.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Great instructor",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is a truly supportive and knowledgeable instructor. He is very responsive to my questions and comments ( in person, through emails, on Piazza).",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. Highly approachable.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is super friendly and approachable during office hours, which I wish I had known earlier in the semester- I was originally too intimidated to ask him any questions. His lectures can be confusing if you do the reading ahead of time and rewatch the lectures while working on homework it can help clarify things. I wish that he would explain the code a little more instead of just doing it on the screen while we follow along. I also wish that he had spent more time teaching us how to de-bug our code in Python.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0he is great",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0The instructor is helpful for going over all the codes and class content. BUT one 2-hour class is not sufficient and it would be great if we could have 2 classes per week",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0he is patient and nice.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Very responsive.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Good. Very kind.",

   "comments": [
    "It is very tough and you will rely on your TA a great deal, much like any BIS course",
    "The course was challenging, but in overall, I feel like I learned a new skill and have a better understanding of modeling. I would recommend the course, but know that it does take a lot of time and work.",
    "Good course to learn Python and health economic tools, but should be prepared to spend at least 6 hours\/week",
    "Wouldn't recommend if you don't have previous programming experience, or it would be hard to comprehend this class. Or there should be a course sole for the python programming learning.",
    "Python course to understand modeling really enjoyed the final project. Thought it was a great application of the knowledge. Most coding courses do larger projects instead of weekly homeworks, this may have been better for teaching.",
    "Good course to take after having some exposure to modelling; the pace picks up quite dramatically in the second half",
    "Probabilistic model + object oriented programming in Python",
    "Really hard but good!",
    "Really good if you are interested modeling work",
    "This course is very challenging and I would not recommend it unless you are willing to put in a lot of time per week. I'm not sure how much I got out of it because we relied so much on the support library rather than understanding how to build these codes ourselves. The professor and TA tried really hard to make it a good experience, and I did learn a lot more about how good models are set up. Overall I probably learned a lot, but I wish I had taken an introductory programming course first because it was hard to pick the Python up quickly enough.",
    "Its great",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Recommend with caution. While you aren't required to have any major background knowledge in programming\/Python or cost-effective analysis to take the course, have a grasp on one of these things will make the course go smoother and maximize what you can get out of it.",
    "I found this course very challenging and often frustrating but overall it was a rewarding experience. If you don't have experience with coding, especially in Python, the learning curve is STEEP but I am really proud to have made it through with a better understanding of modeling concepts & theory. I would recommend it if you don't care about your grade and want to challenge yourself\/ learn something useful.",
    "recommended to python beginners",
    "Recommend if interested in CEA. Prepare for python coding",
    "the course is good and useful",
    "Great.",
    "No. Too time consuming and inappropriate grades percentage distribution.",
    "Yes but one who has he bandwidth to really dive into the code.",
    "The material is quite advanced, but then again, that's in the name of the course. I would recommend it to people willing to step outside their comfort zone."
