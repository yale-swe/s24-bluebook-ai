    "If you enjoyed organic chemistry, you will definitely enjoy this course.",
    "Thought the course was interesting and well taught. Kind of like a continuation of Spiegel's sophomore organic. The material was managable, the only downside was that it had 3 3-hour tests over the course of the semester in addition to a final exam (although you are allowed to drop one of any of the 4 grades).",
    "To summarize CHEM 423, I would say try it if you really really love organic chemistry (as another 423 alum had told me at the start of the semester), but justknow that you might lose your love of orgo somewhere along the way. I know I definitely have seriously questioned my future academic plans after taking this course, so I am now starting work in an inorganic lab, since it seems organic synthesis may not be my calling after this class. You definitely learn some pretty neat reactions and reagents throughout this course. I am certainly glad I took the class, but I am also thoroughly happy that I am finished with it!",
    "Great class. The class demands a lot more than sophomore organic, so come prepared. The class is oriented towards graduate students, and Dr. Spiegel does not make any effort to make the class easier for undergraduates. However, the subject is very interesting and worth taking!",
    "I would not recommend this class, unless you have taken an advanced synthesis class before. Otherwise, you will find this class extremely frustrating, as it frequently requires knowledge that you could not possibly obtain from the lectures alone. If you love chemicalsynthesis, and would prefer that your love not be wrenched from your grasp, you will do well to refrain from enrolling in this course.",
    "Difficult course, but rewarding if you are interested in organic chemistry. You basically get a broad overview of the most important reactions used to accomplish different categories of transformations (oxidations, olefination reactions, etc.)The problem sets are usually difficult, so it is good to work in groups. However, they aren't graded (you just have to do the problems and show up at section to get the credit), so that takes some stress off.Exams are VERY tough, and it is really hard to prepare for them. Mostly they consist of just trying to think hard and be creative about rationalizing different reactions. A lot of questions involve things that really aren't covered specifically in lectures, so sometimes it is just luck whether you have a light-bulb moment during the test or not.Definitely recommended for the organic-minded people. I learned a ton."
