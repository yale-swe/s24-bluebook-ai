   "comments": [
    "strengths: chance to interact with peers through discussionweaknesses: poor instructor, useless lectures. instructor was of low caliber and should not be teaching a graduate level course.",
    "The course was very disjointed. I thought the class discussions were largely unproductive. Since it's an introductory course, I think it should be much more lecture based and focused on helping us to master the basics of how the US political system relates to health policy. I thought the strongest classes, the ones I benefited from the most, were the ones where we discussed the streams of policymaking and interest groups, as opposed to the ones where we had unfocused discussions about health reform.",
    "Could be better organized. We should have more time between the last paper (legislation analysis) and the take home final",
    "I think the workload for this class was rather high. I learned a lot from this class and would encourage non-health policy students to take it because Dr. Mattocks is good at making the topics understandable. I was not a huge fan of the debate because some people did not participate. It seemed like the first paper accomplished the goal of learning about the health care reform and the debate was a bit extra. Also, even though the blogs were good personal experiences, no one really commented on each others blogs...perhaps if we were required to comment on at least one other blog per week, it would help boost morale and keep us motivated to write.",
    "Did not like blog assignments! Liked the policy paper, and the final seems alright. I liked the health policy debate, but wish we were forced to write more about it.",
    "There was very little class time, I do not feel like I learned very much from lecture. The writing assignments were too much like book reports where you just research and regurgitate information. However, I think I learned the most from the course researching them. There was also not adequate time to complete assignments (usually less than 2 weeks for a 10 page paper, and a little over a week for the 12 page final). I did like the blog assignment though, I just wish we did more with them and that it was a larger part of our grade for how much work we were expected to put into them.",
    "The course had no direction or organization. The course felt as if we were talking about random things in isolation, and never as a cohesive part of the whole. The debate portion of the class took up too much time, with very little output.",
    "The course was okay. It was a little unorganized, and I walked away not feeling like I learned very much. You have some flexibility in your paper topics, so I picked topics that I wanted to learn about, and those are the only times that I really learned anything.",
    "Strengths: The papers are very informative. I learned the most this semester from writing the three assigned papers. Being able to pick your topics each time was also great. The blog was a great way to keep people involved with what is going on with health care reform - and again, a good way to allow people to engage with what interests them.Weaknesses: We met too few times - fewer classes should be canceled for a once a week course. The debate was not extremely useful. May be better to just have a class discussion about the reform.",
    "Strengths: 1) covered a wide range of current health care policy topics 2) interesting guest lecturersWeaknesses: 1) assignments\/projects were often not relevant to class readings or lectures 2) feedback on assignments were often not constructive 3) classroom lectures often lacked structure",
    "I was surprised at the lack of practical policy topics. I also felt that the material was covered in other classes, it was redundant.",
    "The course was interesting, but you could tell that it was still in development. We really didn't cover much of the material that we intended to cover at the end of the course, at least what was planned according to the syllabus. I also felt that the course was geared heavily toward the HC reform, and while that is a good thing, there is more going on outside of the reform debate.",
    "This course is designed to teach students about the fundamental structures and political issues that affect health policy. Many of the class meetings covered this material.However, our class spent 4 weeks focusing only on the differences between the House and Senate health reform bills which was not very instructive. Our time would've been better spent covering new material rather than revisiting the same material for 4 weeks.",
    "This course was excellent, except for writing the blogs.",
    "This class was pretty bad. Yes I feel bad having to say it, but it was pretty much a waste of time. I learned more from the papers I wrote, which, I guess, makes it not a total loss.Another problem I had was that for a once-a-week class, cancelling TWO classes is too much. (One class was cancelled with a lot of notice--why not get a good guest speaker?!) Kind of makes me feel like I should get a refund for this class!",
    "Strengths: Kristin is pretty clear with her expectations. The course was laid out well. The readings were good. Kristin was a fun teacher overall. The class discussions were great.Weaknesses: A more structured debate on health reform would have been better. Sometimes I wondered if she had more to say on a subject because we got out of class early quite often, which is abnormal compared with most courses.",
    "strengths: nice selection of readings. Readings were published within 3 years. Readings represented a variety of topics and sources (web, journal, opinion).weaknesses: lacking in class debate\/discussion. The class would benefit from class discussion if students were asked to defend their policy opinion, or at minimium, provide evidence to their opinion that would hold them accountable. Policy students in particular were looking for more debate since our class has widely different political views and social values.",
    "This course's strengths are in the depth to which you will learn to analyze specific moments in\/aspects of health policy. I wish more time would be spent acquiring analytical tools like the \"three streams theory,\" etc. You will gain a lot of knowledge about the legislative process and the way decisionmakers in these fields do business.I wish less time were spent on the in-class debates. While awesome, I think they took up a few too many really valuable class periods that could have been spent learning other things.",
    "Good overview of major topics, but needed more organization",
    "The professor was very disorganized and unclear about assingments, creating unnecessary stress for the students",
    "I do not think the course taught me much that was relevant. We spent much of the semester analyzing the outdated health care bill and the debate on the bill was worthless. I did not learn anything useful from the task and it was a waste of everyone's time. Overall, this was a very disappointing course.",
    "I think that the course suffered from a lack of overall guidance on what the appropriate material that should be covered. I am not sure that this is entirely the instructor's fault because it was my impression that the faculty was fairly disengaged in terms of giving Dr. Mattocks the appropriate guidance on what should comprise the course. The fact that the division faculty should have been better engaged should have been obvious from the start since they knew that they had a non-faculty members substituting in for another faculty member on maternity leave. That should have provided enough forewarning to appropriately construct or rebuild a curriculum.",
    "I appreciated having a wide range of assignment-types. Blogging was great. However, the debate was not entirely realistic...",
    "This was sadly the worst course that I have ever taken in my undergraduate and graduate experience. The course material was interesting and the course could have taken a different route, but this was far from the case. It was so poorly, haphazardly put together that it just became draining of energy and a waste of time.",
    "This course was well taught and incorporated a nice balance between discussion and lecture-based instruction. I think it was appropriate that we spent a good deal of time discussing health reform, but I would have also appreciate spending more time on the fundamentals and theory behind the policy-making process. I wasn't too excited to have to blog each week but in retrospect the process pushed me to explore topics that I was interested in but did know too much about."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0While Dr. Mattocks certainly made an effort towards the end to become a more thoughtful professor, her lack of organization in the beginning really shone through. Particularly because she kept deviating from the syllabus in terms of deadlines and assignments, I felt that she was only planning the course two days in advance of the actual class taking place. I did not appreciate the massive amount of emails she sent to the class loaded with so many readings, which should have been listed in the syllabus, had she thoroughly thought out these assignments in the first place. Bottom line: she should never be offered a full-time position as a professor here. If so, the future first-yearsshould be warned of her ineptitude.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Weaknesses -- needed to do a better job of guiding class discussions, poor design of the debate project, unable to respond appropriately to constructive criticism. I really think the debate project was a disaster and very unfair for those of us who worked hard on it, while others slacked off with no consequences for their grade. Assigning half the class to one group and asking them to figure out among themselves who would participate in what debate and write one paper was a bad move. The groups should have been much smaller (like 4 people), and each group should have worked on the same topic for both the debate and the paper. It was unfair to expect part of the group to prepare for the big, overall debate and require that others only work on a small piece of reform (like abortion). It was a lot of work, logistical organizing trying to get everyone to meet, and very little learning.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0She is very engaging, excited about the subject matter, and provides thorough, helpful feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Could be better organized",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Dr. Mattocks is very approachable and has a good sense of humor. Her slides are organized and she has a good grasp of timing so we have a structured class and know what to expect.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0I think she only lectured 4 times and she didn't stick to most of the syllabus. I like her on a personal level but I did not like her teaching method.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0The instructor really had no direction or vision of the class.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0She is nice, but unorganized. I found it hard to sit in class and listen to lectures. At time the material was seemed to be dumbed dumb. We even had a lecture on the basic structure of the government, and I felt that must students should already have this knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Strengths: She is down to earth and the real deal. She won't try and wow you with her vitae or her accomplishments, but instead tries to learn from all students as we learn from her.Weaknesses: She is very clearly a liberal democrat and voiced it in class - in addition for her contempt for more conservative view points. I happen to side with her politically, but can imagine the class would have been a very uncomfortable atmosphere if I did not.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Strengths: 1) knowledgeable 2) clearly well-connected to other HPA facultyWeaknesses: 1) feedback is frequently observational rather than constructive 2) assignments\/projects are not always explained clearly (especially in terms of how they relate to class readings\/lectures) 3) grades feel arbitrary (no available rubrics + grades received consistently vary appreciably from grades expected -->in both directions)",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0While I appreciated her candor, it was a little too disorganized. We did not follow the syllabus, the assimgments changed frequently and they were given out later than promised.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0She was a good debate moderator, and took time to look at multiple perspectives.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Kristin is extremely nice and approachable. Her grading is fairly straightforward. She provides excellent feedback on papers and provided the entire class with a handout of feedback\/suggestions so that students could improve future papers which was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0I thought Kristin was an excellent instructor.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Kristin seems like a great person and very smart and politically engaged, but all that being said, it didn't really translate into a good course.The course was pretty disorganized, and it often seemed that Kristin was making up the class as she went along. There were only a couple good lectures with powerpoint, Otherwise the class consisted of: one awful (state sentate candidate?) guest speaker, two cancelled classes, a guest speaker on how to use the library (Okay), time-wasting group debates, and one good speaker from the Rudd Center.This class should have been an important foundation for the HPAconcentration, but instead was kind of a disaster.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Kristin was a fun instructor. She is very approachable and it was nice to get to know her a bit better through the class. Her expectations were reasonable and she was flexible when necessary. She was clear about her expectations and assignments.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Mattocks was enthusiastic and engaged during class time. It was cool that she shared\/introduced work of people in her network. However, she was noticably distracted by something outside of class. Students felt their blog assignments were ignored. When class was cancelled (non-policy)students reported feeling \"out-of-it\" because it had been 2 weeks since our last meeting.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Professor Mattocks knows a ton about her field, and is really passionate about her work. In fact, I wish she would work more of her own research into the course, since I think it'd be fun to hear about.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Strengths:-Dynamic, funny speaker-Interested in current events\/able to integrate the class with real world policyWeaknesses:-Unclear about assingments-The planning\/execution of the major assingment (the debate) was truly terrible-The integration with real world events sometimes was really intrusive (i.e. the professor would ask us to write a weekly assignment blog post the day before class, etc)",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0One of the worst instructors I have had at Yale. Constantly changed the assignments, due dates, etc. The assignments were not useful learning tools or applications of the course materials. I am still unsure of what the objectives of the course were supposed to be. I was extremely disappointed with how she ran the course.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0I think this was an understandably difficult first-time teaching course for Dr. Mattocks. I am certain that she put a lot of effort into the course and deserves recognition for that. But, to have to build a course from 0 when performing another full time job and on short notice is a gargantuan task. She should have received much more support from the faculty in building the curriculum. This could have come in a number of forms. My impression is that despite that this support may have been promised when she agreed to take on the course, it was never followed through. I think that some of the assignments later on in the course improved the overall quality of the course. Again, I think once Dr. Mattocks had appropriate footing and support, then the assignments were meaningful and could engage in skills building. When the subject matter was lacking (I think due to lack of guidance from above), accomplishing that goal was more difficult. So, I think that Dr. Mattocks did the best she could given difficult circumstances... i fault the permanent faculty more for the end result and taking such a laissez faire attitude with the course which is core to HPA.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0Powerpoints helpful.Enthusiastic.Perhaps small-group discussions could be useful.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0I'm sure that my classmates have already said enough so I will not add more.",
    "Instructor: Kristin Michelle Mattocks \u00a0I think Dr. Mattocks did a great job of engaging the class and enjoyed the guest speakers she invited to speak. I think a little more clarity around the assignments would be helpful."

    "The class is disorganized, and I can't say I learned very much all semester, but it's required, so what can you do?",
    "an introductory course on American health policy and politics (focus on public insurance programs, legislative process, health care reform)",
    "I would recommend this to other non-health policy students with one caveat, that you need to devote a lot of time to this class and will be surrounded by first year students who have a different schedule and a slightly enhanced knowledge of health policy. I think at the end of the day, you learn a lot from this class and are challenged in ways that are different than other classes.",
    "I would not recommend this course. This was not one of the more valuable courses I've taken here, it's unfortunate that it is required.",
    "No, I would not recommend the class unless you are required to take it. If so, go in knowing this you will get very little out of the class.",
    "The course was okay. It was a little unorganized, and I walked away not feeling like I learned very much. You have some flexibility in your paper topics, so I picked topics that I wanted to learn about, and those are the only times that I really learned anything.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's open-ended assignments allow you to spend a good deal of time researching and writing about the things in health policy that really interest you.If you want an overview of the politics of Washington, this is a good intro. That said, if you've worked in DC, this class will be very elementary.",
    "This course will expose you to many of the most relevant health care policy issues in today's news. However the weak content structure of the lecture schedule and the weak relevance of class work to class readings may prove frustrating.",
    "If you are looking to understand the political games behind healthcare this is for you.",
    "With a few improvements in the lecutre content, this course does a great job of teaching students the underlying political framework that shapes\/defines health policy in the US.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "If it's a requirement, get it out of the way and keep your expectations low.If you think it would be an interesting elective, please don't waste your time!",
    "Would recommend it - provides background on American healthcare system. Sometimes it was repetitive for someone who knows a lot about the U.S. health system already, but as an HPA student I had to take it... I liked Kristin as a professor.",
    "This course is really important in the current political climate. Absolutely take it if you want to not sound dumb talking about these things. You will have a great professor and meet some truly interesting classmates who are doing\/have done real work in health politics and public health.",
    "I would say that this class is a general introduction to health care political issues (policy-specific learning is limited to the certain areas you get assigned). I would tell the student to expect some basic bio-ethical (moral and environmental) material, some economic material, political material, but will have an opportunity to go in deeper to the parts of healthcare you care about.It's required, but I would not reccommend it with this professor.",
    "Horrible, useless course. Learned little. Waste of time and tuition money.",
    "Recommend this course to another student?NO!I wouldn't want someone else to waste their time and really develop a sour taste for health policy classes at Yale.",
    "This class is definitely a \"must\" for health policy students. I think it's especially useful for those relatively new to health policy. We scratched the surface of a lot of interesting topics - I just would have appreciated spending more time exploring the nuances and theory important to health policy."
