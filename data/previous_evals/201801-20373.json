    "I gained SO much taking Basic Drawing an understanding of how to \"see\", an overhaul of my previous understanding of how to create meaningful art, a general curiosity about the world around me, and, of course, invaluable, fundamental drawing skills.",
    "Opened up a new form of thinking about the world and how to describe it",
    "I definitely feel like I improved as an artist by taking this course. I improved with figure drawing, faces, shading, and proportion.",
    "I certainly learn how to use different painting tools to create lines, shades."

   "comments": [
    "I think it is a strong course for practicing technique. I would like to see at least one or two large scale projects rather than exclusively exercises. Maybe more drawing where we could invest long amounts of time. A lot of the in class work was very fast.",
    "The strengths of this course include the very skilled professor and teaching assistant that were able to provide clear and detailed instructions to promote learning.",
    "I think I would have benefitted from doing more \"long\" drawings in class. Sometimes it felt like I was rushing from short drawing to short drawing without having the chance to invest myself fully in each one, and missing things I could have learned with more time spent on each one. That being said, Mark's instruction was incredible and hugely beneficial to me and I loved the set-up and progression of each class, and the semester as a whole.",
    "Great intro course, especially liked that our class was a good mix of skill levels so we could learn from each other",
    "There are no weaknesses to this coarse. Work load was not bad. It was very fun and I looked forward to every class.",
    "I feel strongly engaged not only with the composition I did in the class but also with other students."

    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student since I had the opportunity to learn something that I would have never seen before.",
    "This course is fantastic and refreshing, and if you take it with Mark, you will definitely come away having learned plenty. Cant speak for the other sections, but Marks was a great mix of fun\/humor and taking drawing seriously as the art form that it is.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you like art and drawing. Even a person that doesn't have much experience with art but is interested would benefit from this course. Everyone improves by the end of the semester.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students because I feel it can help open our insights."
