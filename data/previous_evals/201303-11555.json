    "The class is what it says it is, an introduction to US Public Opinion and theories about Representation. It's a good way to get introduced to reading quantitative political science papers as well as start doing research in that vein. Bullock's brain is great to pick about just about anything, up to and including the discipline of political science itself.",
    "I would recommend it. Professor Bullock obviously knows his stuff, and it's really great to learn from him. Discussion was also pretty interesting. I enjoyed the majority of the readings we had to do, and the workload is not too bad. Only take it if you enjoy this aspect of political science, however. A lot of it can get pretty redundant if you do not enjoy it.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction to the motivations behind many of the behaviors of everyday voters and politicians. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Like I said, the subject matter was interesting and the workload was more than fair. My biggest complaint\/suggestion would be more guidelines for assignments. No one had basically any idea how Bullock wanted us to handle the in-class presentations or the final paper based on the syllabus. That said, he was very accessible with office hours and email,so this flaw was certainly not debilitating.",
    "A very interesting seminar that covers a wide range of topics in American politics. Bullock is an incredibly clear presenter of information and does a nice job moving the discussion through the key points from each reading. Friendly guy too. Workload consists of 3 reading responses (done the week of your choice), an in-class presentation, and a final paper. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested in public opinion and American politics. There's a decent amount of reading but almost all of it is really interesting. Professor Bullock is great, too.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. Among the most fascinating and best taught I have taken at Yale. The course covers a breadth of topics but broadly seeks to uncover what the public thinks, why, and how representatives respond (or should respond) to these views. The course's material is stellar. We examine how education, income, and partisanship affect opinion and voting, we question the idea of a \"polarized\" electorate, we learn how to use a statistical programming language to analyze public opinion data ourselves, and we consider several big questions in representation--who should be represented, how representatives should and do behave, and how well American legislators actually represent their constituents. This knowledge is indispensable for anyone interested in democratic governance, American public policy, or even political philosophy. Professor Bullock himself is outstanding. He is absolutely brilliant, astonishingly eloquent, and easily the clearest speaker I have ever had. His comments were always insightful and he kept every class new and engaging. Professor Bullock's knowledge of the material was exceptional, and he is also friendly, genuine, funny, and overall a pleasure to learn from. Beyond the core material, the course is most valuable as an introduction to serious political science. Professor Bullock teaches how to keenly read research papers, as well as the methods, tools, conventions, and style of serious scholarly work. After taking this course, you will be quite comfortable reading political science literature, and even writing it yourself. The class's workload is very reasonable, and though some weeks require a good deal of reading, there is never an unreasonable amount. The assignments, too, were reasonable and quite fun to write. Perhaps my sole reservation about the course is that the reading too often shied away from answering normative questions--whether particular observed effects and trends are \"good\" or \"bad\"--and sometimes seemed cold and detached. But normative questions often came up in discussion, and this aspect of the reading did not substantially detract from the class. In sum, if you are interested in public opinion, voting, representation, or learning how to do serious political science, take this class. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
