    "Deb?! Offering a comedy class?! You must sign up now.",
    "A class about what it means to laugh that has you laughing the whole way through. LOVED IT. would definitely recommend. for anyone! whether you think you're funny or not.",
    "Man, if you wanna think about why stuff is funny and think about the architecture of a joke or of a comic scene, man, maybe this class is for you, man.",
    "Take this class if you want to explore the rudiments of comedy, how live comedic performance works\/feels, or if you love Deborah Margolin.",
    "It totally depends on the class size. If there aren't too many people, take it!!",
    "So fun! You will write a 2 page paper every week about comedy, but it is an amazing way to track your progress in the course and to explore different comedic ideas. Awesome blend of theory and practice. Deb is amazing, as always.",
    "Take literally any class that Deb teaches ever. ESPECIALLY if it has anything to do with comedy. It's the best class I've ever taken, period.",
    "Take it. With the knowledge that there are very strong quotations around the word \"structures\" in the title of this course.",
    "Take this course. Do yourself a favor and just take this. It helped me as a performer, and if you don't perform, then it will help you as a person. Deborah Margolin is the best person you will ever meet and the course will teach you in such an enjoyable way that it won't feel like school. If you want to laugh and learn how to make others laugh, take this course. You will not regret it."
