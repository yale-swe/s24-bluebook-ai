   "comments": [
    "Contextualizes interesting physical concepts, though is not as well run as PHYS 205L.",
    "The \"easy\" kinematics labs actually require the most time to complete with all the data reduction they ask you to do, so be careful filling out your schedule with these when you pick experiments. The nuclear reactions lab has a terribly instructed lab report, don't take it unless you want to suffer as it is much more work than other labs on the course (even though the actual experiment is really fun), wait until the lab handout is re-written. Digital logic labs are also too long.",
    "If you can get to the point where you begin to understand the underlying physics, this class is great.",
    "If you're willing to put in a lot of work, this lab can be pretty rewarding. You get to pick what experiments you do, and a lot of it is pretty independent. It is a lot of work though, be prepared to write 5-12 pages a week for lab reports.",
    "This was a good course to just explore concepts in physics that you want to learn more about. This is much better than 205L because you could tailor your lab experience to focus on things you would be interested in, rather than the mandatory experiments of 205 that you generally wouldn't be interested in. Don't do the Millikan oil drop experiment, though. It's not worth the headache.",
    "Phys 206L offers a chance to apply ones knowledge of physics while working through enjoyable experiments. The freedom to choose ones own experiments made the course very attractive. The workload is challenging yet rewarding. In addition, if a student wishes to pursue a physics field, this course is an essential, as it will teach important concepts with multiple real-world applications. However, at the same time, it is a very enjoyable course for all STEM majors, because it definitely strengthens ones scientific writing skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student due to its usefulness and excellent teaching style.",
    "It is not as stressful as PHYS 205, as you are allowed to choose your own lab and work at your own pace. The fact that we are writing a report for each lab (instead of submitting notebooks) means that we are allowed more freedom in recording and processing data, while actually improving our proficiency in scientific writing. If you picked the right labs to do, you'll enjoy this.",
    "This lab is made or broken by the labs you select. This was my personal experience: F1 C1 H5 H4 - J3 D4 D1 - F3 C1: Digital Logic: A-\/B+ Good lab. You build some cool circuits using a bread board and some integrated circuit chips. Not too hard, we didn't finish but you're not really expected to. D1: Transistors: C+ Poorly written, but interesting. Transistors are real important and this is a decent lab to learn how to use them. However, the lab write-up (as of spring 2016) had mistakes, poor diagrams, and hints that were just wrong. We finished 2 of 5 parts of the lab and were stumped most of the time due to the poor writing. D4: Power Supply: FFFFFF STAY AWAY. Particularly poorly written lab report, impossible to take understandable data, really, really, really confusing. Our professor and TA helped us the whole time, the professor took 120v to the hand and burned out an outlet... F1: X-ray diffraction: A. You use an X-ray beam to find the spacing between atoms in some different crystalline structures (Bragg scattering). Very straightforward lab. Easy write up. Learned a bit about science. F3: Fraunhofer: A. Single, double, many, and circular slit diffraction. Very well written lab handout. Straightforward analysis. Actually learned quite a bit. H4: Superconductivity: A- . You use liquid nitrogen to cool some superconducting materials and do a quick analysis on what the current as a function of temperature looks like for superconducting materials. Relatively annoying analysis though. Very science. H5: Planck's Constant: B+ . Photoelectric effect, light diffraction and such. Straightforward, but somewhat boring and tedious at times. Write-up is easy J3: Particle Collisions: A for the cool. B- for the write-up. This is a 2-week lab and you use the particle accelerator to look at Rutherford scattering as well as nuclear reactions. But let me tell you, friend; beware the write-up. You will have peaks where you shouldn't. you will have nothing where you expect peaks. You will spend hours and hours working with your excel spreadsheet. Hope this helps",
    "Avoid this class at all costs unless you are a masochist or a committed Physics major. It is better than 205L, but I would recommend PHYS 166L instead. The pleasure of doing more authentic experiments including using a Van der Graff particle accelerator is not worth the amount of work and time required both inside and outside of class (a total of 15-20 hours\/week). I did more writing for this class than any WR course. If you do decide to take the course, consider that you should treat it as you would a full credit class.",
    "Heavy work load for a half credit. Somewhat interesting. Mostly calculating uncertainties and practicing lab writing.",
    "A lot of work, not a lot of guidance. Be prepared to spend a lot of time doing the lab reports, though the lab experiments themselves are shorter and more interesting than in 205.",
    "If you can afford the bit of extra work, take this over 166. It's more rewarding.",
    "206L is much more rewarding than 205L. Just be warned that it takes a fair bit of time. If I started the lab report at 3 pm in the afternoon I would be finished with everything at around midnight.",
    "The course is actually pretty great - the labs are interesting, and you get to pick which ones you do! In addition, you stick with the same partner throughout - working on analyzing the lab data in pairs is so much easier. BE WARNED THOUGH: the lab reports are \"supposed to be 4 pages\", according to the syllabus. This is a joke. Mine were easily 14 pages each by the end of the course, and I only started getting A's on the reports once I had then at 12+ pages in length. However, I've learned so much physics from this course, and would recommend it to anyone choosing physics labs! You're treated like a responsible adult, the professor and TA are incredibly helpful and understanding, and there is no lab practical at the end NOR do they grade your lab notes!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to physics majors and non-physics majors that are interested in gaining experience in various modern physics and electronics labs. However, it must be kept in mind that it takes a significant amount of time to produce lab reports and (not always) prepare for labs. It gives students the freedom to choose from a wide variety of labs and allows you to explore concepts that you are interested in.",
    "Excellent course - much better than 205L. The ability to choose what labs and what lab partner makes this course far more interesting. The labs are also (in general) more interesting than 205L. Definitely recommend doing many of the modern physics labs, but the applications of it are everywhere. However, not all labs are created equally. Some are much easier, while others are much harder than others. A special word of warning on the superconductivity lab - rather difficult to make theoretical calculations, and on the Operational Amplifier lab - particularly tricky and long lab! Otherwise, most of the labs are easily finishable within the time. I especially enjoyed the X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, charge over mass, and nuclear reaction labs :)",
    "I despised the write-ups for 206L. They were long and tedious and did not seem worth the effort. 206L is at least better than 205L, however, because the labs are very interesting. 206L gives you the opportunity to conduct many experiments that you may not have had the chance to conduct otherwise."
