    "A challenging but rewarding course. As a history major, I found it really refreshing to take a class about the implications of things that are happening right now, and Professor Hersh covered a variety of topics about new technology, data, and the way the government uses it, which ensured that there was \"something for everyone,\" so to speak. There were three 5-page papers, which were challenging in that the assignments lent themselves to 10 page papers, so pruning them down was hard. Professor Hersh is great: tough but not mean, and a leader in his field. Highly recommended.",
    "A good look at technology and how it has affected power relationships in politics. A lot of stuff in here that I would have never considered.",
    "Interesting topics covered if you're interested in the intersection of technology and politics. Not necessarily organized around a consistent theme, though.",
    "Yes, I would take it, but be prepared to meet the high expectations Professor Hersh has for the three papers. There is also a weekly reading response for the rather long readings each week.",
    "If you have any interest in the syllabus, take the class. It's a great experience.",
    "Great topic, awesome and energetic professor, and diverse group of students taking it. What more could you want?",
    "A must take. Very relevant themes to anyone, and professor Hersh is outstanding.",
    "Take this class! Professor Hersh is great and an instructor that any political science major would benefit from having. He's definitely particular in his grading - he really likes a certain style of writing (clear, concise, no-frills). But he's up front about that. The topics are super interesting - from WikiLeaks to censorship on the internet in China to gerrymandering. There's also a fair dose of more theoretical stuff toward the beginning of the term. The workload is pretty even - three papers, an oral presentation, and short weekly reading comments on classesv2. The last assignment is due on the class day of class, so that's one less thing to worry about during reading period\/finals.",
    "Take the class if you are remotely interested in any of the words in the course title. It is relevant, interesting and will open you up to some new areas of study.",
    "I loved this course. Eitan is tough, but always fair and always makes time for his students. I found him to go above and beyond, making the class very enjoyable. I think that especially if you have a good group, this is a great seminar to give a comprehensive insight into the way that technology is changing our ideas of surveillance, privacy, and convenience. Great interdisciplinary class that is both challenging and rewarding.",
    "Overall, a pretty interesting course in the intersection of political science and technology. Some of the readings are very dense and hard to get through; some you just wish you had more time to actually finish. Pretty straightforward course: three essays, weekly blog posts, and a presentation. Not the worst workload. Note to CPSC students: Eitan is very supportive in making your last essay a data science project (which is a great opportunity we don't normally get in the major).",
    "Incredibly interesting discussions. A great seminar leader in Professor Hersh. Not *too* much work, with three papers, an oral presentation, and weekly discussion points. What's not to like? This seminar really is worth your while, and having a connection with Professor Hersh is outstanding as well.",
    "A phenomenal course. Prof. Hersh is able to level relevant experience and genuine interest in the field, and has crafted a highly interesting course. Readings take time to fully process, but nothing unexpected.",
    "232 provides students with the tools to critically assess the impact of technology on our society. Prof. Hersh does a great job leading discussion, but be prepared to do (or not do) a lot of reading."
