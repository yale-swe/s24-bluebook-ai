    "An amazing class - really exposes the student to aspects of Yale one might normally experience.",
    "If you're interested in the history of science and books of secrets, then you'll enjoy this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a fascinating subject that is very well taught.",
    "Prof. Bertucci is marvelous - genuinely interested in what her students have to say and utterly passionate about the history of science. Take anything she offers - but, be warned, she will hold you to the highest standards of intellectual rigor. If you're willing to put in the work and the though, she will more than match it with her enthusiasm and her support for your particular passions.The course itself is utterly enlightening - it will compel you to confront the flipside of knowledge, and the ways control and dispersal of knowledge shapes history.",
    "It is an incredibly interesting seminar that covers topics you won't believe you haven't read about before!! TAKE IT",
    "Take this class! You will gain a love for historic books (especially books of secrets), and you will learn to think about knowledge in new ways. You will also get a vivid picture of different times and places, and you will learn (at least a little) to think like the people living then and there. An inspiring class.",
    "YES, IT WAS AWESOME.HOWEVER, YOU WON'T GET ALOT OUT OF THE COURSE IF YOU DON'T PUT IN THE WORK.",
    "Based on the synopsis of the course, I thought that it was going to be much more interesting than it actually was. The books were read and covered sometimes were covered during class because we met at Beinecke and the Cushing center to look at old books. It was really interesting doing that to see the history of old books on magic and alchemy etc at Yale but I often wasn't sure what we were supposed to be getting out of looking at them.",
    "THE best history class I've taken at Yale thus far (as a junior History major). It explores a very fascinating topic - the history of secrecy, delves into primary sources way more than any other history class I've been in, and is athoroughly enjoyable hands-on experience, with countless opportunities to look through rare texts at the Beinecke\/Cushing. Those of us in the Fall 2013 iteration of the course had a chance to curate an exhibit at the Medical School as our mid-term assignment, and while I believe that won't be the case anymore, Prof. Bertucci definitely has very exciting alternatives lined up. Prof. Bertucci was absolutely brilliant. She's smart, funny, caring and one of the most passionate professors I've had at Yale. Her love for what she does is unquestionable, and that enthusiasm definitely rubbed off on the class. Discussions with her are very free-form and less structured than what I've come to expect from Yale courses, but that's precisely what made them so rewarding. She loves hearing her students' thoughts in their rawest form, and that freedom to express yourself is the liberating intellectual experience I came to Yale for in the first place.",
    "I would recommend it. Looks into a wide variety of texts ranging from books of alchemical secrets to looks into the practices of government espionage. Fairly large amount of reading material and the midterm and final assignments require a fairly large time commitment. Overall, the ability to look at some of the rarest and most secretive texts makes up for the workload."
