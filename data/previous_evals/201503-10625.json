   "comments": [
    "Wonderful introduction to the field of American Studies.",
    "Necessary course.",
    "I would describe the class as a pro-seminar in American Studies that introduces students to topics, methodologies, and approaches of different scholars in the field. Each week, a faculty member affiliated with the American Studies department assigns a number of readings and discusses the readings, as well as other topics, during the class period. I would recommend to the class to others, because it is a great way to learn about the field and to become acquainted with the work that is being produced within it.",
    "American Scholars is a wonderful opportunity to begin thinking about what you want to get out of graduate work (and scholarly work, more broadly) in AMST. Getting to know the work of AMST professors is very useful for understanding the people who make up the program, and some of the different approaches to the field. More than that, the course provides a space to develop community with your cohort and to begin thinking about your work in the context of the larger questions and concerns of the field. I think that this course is highly dependent on what you bring to it. If you commit to engaging critically with the readings and with each other, it is a great space of discussion and learning.",
    "American Scholars is a great course for getting to know a field that can at times feel nebulous you are exposed to a wide variety of faculty's work and there are no risks to fear. It's a great opportunity to think about the possible directions of your scholarship at large I would not be shy about bringing questions beyond the class materials into the classroom."

   "comments": [
    "This course was key in deepening my knowledge of American Studies. I'll be thinking about the subject matter we discussed for years to come.",
    "We had an overview of the field of American Studies. It was crucial.",
    "This course introduced me to the history of American Studies as a discipline and gave me the chance to read a wide variety of work produced within the field. By reading a number of American Studies texts, I began to form an idea about the way I want to approach my own research and writing. While most of what we read and discussed was not directly related to my potential dissertation topic, I learned how to approach the archive\/ research, writing scholarship in various formats, and engaging with other scholarship. This was a wonderful course to begin my graduate school career with.",
    "This course prepared me to engage in AMST with a sense of purpose and a set of ideas about what is at stake in the work I want to do. While the course did not give me a content background that will specifically influence my dissertation\/research, it gave me a strong sense of commitment to my work and a grounding within my fields.",
    "I've responded to this in question 3 somewhat. The course exposed me to a wide variety of angles through which one can \"do\" American Studies and I feel like I left with a good understanding of the state of the field.",
    "This course provided a great foundation for the field of American Studies as I began my time as a PhD student.",
    "This course helped give me a clearer sense of how to define interdisciplinary work, as well as how some professors in the department conceive of it for themselves."
