    "I would recommend it to other Divinity School students (and have to friends).I think it was a terrific survey of contemporary issues in Bioethics, following nicely upon the Intro to Bioethics which I took in the fall.I really, really enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students in the divinity School if they are interested in engaging in current issues of bioethics. The course is not primarily a theological course, but it is relevant to those who want to see how religious thinking is important in bioethical issues.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class--There are very few bioethics classes at Yale and taking them with Prof. Smith is a rareopportunity.--Exposure to leading writers\/thinkers\/critics in the field -- incl. Prof. Smith",
    "this course was a large lecture designed to allow students to delve deeply into a range of issues in bioethics. Students prepared short papers for the week and brought in questions for discussion.I would recommend this course to another student. The professor was excellent, the topics were very interesting, and the class itself was engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student."

   "comments": [
    "As a YDS student, I do not have a dissertation. However, it certainly helped round out my M.A.R. coursework and gave me a foundation in Bioethics which will shape my future studies.",
    "This course introduced me to some current thinkers in bioethics. The course is relevant to my preparation for pastoral isues around death and dying.",
    "The way in which this course deepened my knowledge was probably not how it was intended to. What I found compelling was the absence of a medical anthropological and sociological slant. I am not convinced that bioethics can advance without including cultural milieu(s) of which there are many. I respect the work that has been done to advance bioethics as a serious academic study\/field but not to the exclusion of other disciplines. I am worried that bioethics may pigeonhole itself by its focus on \"rights\" and lawsNot every culture fits the \"nuclear family protocol\" and this is one of the questions I raise and which is NOW part of my current research: beliefs, rituals, traditions as they relate to family values and especially care of the terminally ill and elderly. I think we have to be careful -- not every one fits our Western paradigm and may in fact, be harmed by it. I think bioethicists and classes in bioethics must open itself\/themselves to broader cultural spectrum. The class has most certainly encouraged me to study in more depth the impact of bioethics on medicine and culture and vice versa.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the field by allowing me to delve deeply into subjects that are often presented in broad strokes. I learned what topics in bioethics intrigued me, what topics were less interesting, and what topics I want to know more about.",
    "I am much more interested in bioethics than I was before."
