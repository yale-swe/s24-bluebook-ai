   "comments": [
    "Really good foundation on the Dirac formalism! Other than that, this was fairly similar to my undergraduate quantum course.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.",
    "I built up a solid foundation in the math used in quantum mechanics; grasped a view of the relationship between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics and four postulates of quantum mechanics.",
    "Foundations of quantum mechanics, beginning with the math and ending with the angular momentum operator. We covered all the stuff that we did do very deeply, which unfortunately meant that we did not cover all that much (e.g., didn't do the hydrogen atom). But this is probably good because it means a very solid foundation for future courses.",
    "I gained a much more solid grasp of Quantum Mechanics concepts that I had been exposed to before, but perhaps not understood properly the first time round.",
    "I took a quantum mechanics class in undergrad that covered the same material, and I thought I had a good understanding of the subject going in. After taking this class I feel like I have a much better understanding of quantum mechanics than I did before, even though I could already do most of the problems. I really like Shankar's approach to teaching quantum mechanics - particularly the dedication to teaching linear algebra, bra-ket notation, not giving the x-basis overly preferential treatment, and focusing on symmetries - and feel like I 'got it' a lot more than when I took quantum using Griffith's book in undergrad.",
    "Grounding principles of Quantum Mechanics. Symmetries.",
    "My understanding of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics greatly improved, as well as my appreciation for the harmonic oscillator.",
    "Math skills",
    "Learned the basics of Quantum mechanics, gain deep insight into the mathematical formalism of quantum to reinforce the conceptual understanding I had previously",
    "The quantum mechanics portion of this course was excellent review for me. I now have a much firmer grasp and command of Dirac notation. The most indispensable part of this course, though, was probably the overview of classical mechanics. Understanding how to construct a Hamiltonian from a Lagrangian is not something I knew how to do before this class. This was also the first class I've had which required extensive manipulation of Poisson brackets, which I found to be a useful, even if tedious, experience. Also, beginning the course with the mathematics was an excellent choice. Clarifying notation and distinguishing mathematical versus physical results was developmentally important.",
    "some insight into foundations of quantum mechanics",
    "Not too much, had a slight revision of basic concepts",
    "New understanding and appreciation for math formalisms used in quantum mechanics.",
    "- clarified the mathematical underpinnings of quantum mechanics - Bra-ket notation - Normalization in continuous vector spaces - Solutions to various quantum mechanical problems"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was too slow. The section on linear algebra was too long. I am worried that I won't be fully prepared for Quantum II.",
    "The only thing I am really worried about for this course is that we will not be prepared for Quantum II. I am worried that it will be assumed that we covered the hydrogen atom and other material that we were not able to get to in this course.",
    "It's a well-taught, reasonably paced class. Overall very solid.",
    "Very strong introduction to fundamental elements and notation used throughout the course, some crucial topics are left at the end but there is not enough time to explore them",
    "It's a great course! There is really no weaknesses I can think of. Shankar taught this subject using his own book in a very systematic way. One can come to this course with no or few quantum or math background and still find it clear and reasonable. Shankar has minimized the assumption of what we know and give proof to almost everything. Shankar encourages everyone to ask questions and we can definitely tell that he really cares about whether students truly understand the contents.",
    "Shankar is great at going over things and making sure everyone is on the same page.",
    "The course was very clearly structured and lectured well. I particularly enjoyed the link between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. Was perhaps a bit straightforward for a graduate level course, but the pace did allow me to fully understand everything before moving on.",
    "How the course is designed is its biggest strength, which I talked about at length in the previous reply. The biggest weakness was that Shankar would sometimes get lost in the details of a derivation, and not have notes to fall back on. I feel like for a class where I got a better understanding of the math behind quantum mechanics, I would have appreciated being sure that the derivations in my notes were right.",
    "Strengths: not difficult to follow, eloquent teacher, helpful problem sets. Weakness: the first half of the course is a little slowly-paced.",
    "The beginning (math) part of this course was very well laid out, but things became more scattered past that point. The intended audience of this course (graduate or undergraduate) was also unclear.",
    "None",
    "The course could have covered a bit more information and not gone as deep into some things.",
    "The fact that the course follows the textbook very closely is very helpful to me on such a fundamental topic. Emphasis on 'what is a postulate' versus 'what is emergent from a postulate' was also useful. I can't think of how to improve the course. No complaints.",
    "Covered too little material for first semester quantum mechanics. Very insightful for the material we did cover, however.",
    "I believe the course was taught at too basic a level to be a graduate course. While it was a welcome revision, it did not even cover all the topics that were addressed in the pass-out exam. This meant that if I took the pass-out exam right after the course was completed, I would still probably not pass, which I believe is a failure of the academic system.",
    "It was well planned in terms of the content covered. I would have appreciated more calculation problems and less proofs.",
    "Strengths - Did a good job of teaching mathematical background (Chapter 1) at beginning to prepare for rest of course - Great textbook - Helpful problem sets Weaknesses - Hard to follow along in lecture"

    "Yeah! Good for an introduction to quantum.",
    "Yes.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to other students. Shankar is a wonderful teacher! The whole subject has been taught in a very thorough and systematic way.",
    "Yes. I think it provides a very good good foundation in a very important area of physics.",
    "Yes, particularly other new graduate students who aren't sure if they need to take Quantum 1. It's not that hard of a class, and I gained a significant amount for not having to put in that much work (given that I already covered the material).",
    "yes. This course by Shankar is very well-organized and engaging. As a graduate-level Quantum Mechanics, students learn the principles as well as the computations.",
    "Yes, its a fundamental course",
    "Of course, any student in physics, or dealing with matter at the quantum level should have a basic understanding of quantum mechanics",
    "Yes, and probably even if they've taken Quantum I before. I took a course in quantum mechanics taught out of David Griffiths Intro to Quantum Mechanics. That book prepared me for this course and I felt I was able to absorb every minute detail from this course in order to build a strong foundation for the courses I will encounter in the future.",
    "Yes, Shankar has a lot of interesting things to say.",
    "Not unless you haven't encountered Quantum Mechanics before or really want a revision of the basics from a good teacher",
    "Yes, I really appreciated how mathematical and classical mechanical concepts relevant to classical mechanics were emphasized at the beginning of the course. It filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge from prior quantum courses."
