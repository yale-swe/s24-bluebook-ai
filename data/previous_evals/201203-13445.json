   "comments": [
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in a career in the film music, and it covers a lot of topics ranging from music history to copyright law to case studies of landmark scores. I feel like I learned a little bit about every aspect of film music, and I really enjoyed doing a free-choice final project. There isn't always enough time for discussion since there is so much material to cover, but it was all in all a chill class.",
    "Fun course and a good overview to both the music and film industries. A little dry at times, but mostly interesting (I mean, you do get to watch and analyze film clips in class). Recommended for composers and non-composers, but if you don't know much about music or films you'll struggle a bit with names and dates.",
    "This class should have been called \"Composing for Films\/TV,\" because it was ENTIRELY geared towards the world of composing that Steve knew--what to think about artistically, logistically, technologically, legally, etc. That was interesting, but it wasn't what I had expected (for instance, I was REALLY pumped to finally get to the weeks of analyzing film scores, and we barely talked in those classes between clips). I think people felt a little at a loss with the final composing project--not because of the composing, but because of the technology you're expected to know how to use to do it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone interested in music or visual media. One can easily tailor the class to one's own interests, whether they lie in composition, popular music, film, television, copyright law, music technology, etc.",
    "We watched a lot of film clips of scores, which is cool, because (if you're me at least) you don't often pay attention to the music in films. I found it incredibly interesting to see what composers do to support the narrative of the film. We had great discussions. It was a fun and rewarding class to take. If I ever pursue a career in the arts, I will remember the lessons from this course about collaboration (between directors and composers) and the interplay between different artistic media.",
    "Music in Film and Television explores the role of the music industry - composers, producers, and musicians - on the big and small screens. The course contextualizes film scores over the course of the twentieth century, while also examining current music in film and television, and composers are given the chance to score a short film clip at the end of the course. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in composing or working in the music and\/or film\/television industries, because it's one of a kind and introduces certain professions currently unaddressed in the Yale curriculum.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it wholeheartedly. It is not too technical, so anyone with an interest can take it. I urge everyone who is interested to apply!",
    "In this course, you will analyze what makes film music work, how film composers write. You will learn about the process of a film score from start to finish, and all of the people involved in making a score come to life. The course also covers the business side of film music, with readings on copyright law, and typical music contracts for film, tv, and commercial music. Final projects include an analysis paper and a short original film score."
