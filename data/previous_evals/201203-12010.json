    "French existentialism, structuralism, and deconstructionalism. If you don't have the faintest idea what these words mean, the course is probably not for you. However, if you have read Nietzsche or are just interested in where modern philosophy has brought us, the class is for you. Again, my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Take this course if you're interested at all in contemporary philosophy, critical theory, French intellectuals, or postmodernism. You may not understand everything you read \u00e2\u0080\u0094 actually, you very likely will not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but by the end of the course you will have a sense of what issues were the most important to French intellectuals during the 20th century.",
    "Excellent texts, poor class. The French theorists are intellectually challenging in all of the best ways and provide, in many respects, the foundation of the modern-day Left. It was the perfect course to take coming off of DS. But the professor was uninspiring and not good at running a discussion.",
    "Pretty good course if you want to do the readings--but don't be fooled by the short papers, writing responses on classesv2 every other week can be a pain.",
    "I wish there were a better way to get introduced to these thinkers at Yale, because this class just isn't good. Professor Zhuo means well, but really isn't able to explain highly dense, complicated French intellectual prose to English-speaking novices. We read excerpts which were too small to get a good grasp on these thinkers, and the discussion level is too superficial (\"what is the summary of this text?\") and confused (\"what do these words mean?\") for anyone to leave the seminar room with a better idea of what's going on than when they entered (you can say goodbye to any prospect of deeper discussion or debate).",
    "I will recommend this course to those who like theories, find them useful, or fascinated about more recent \"philosophical\" thinkings. With Prof. Zhuo's explanation, French theories will be easier and much more \"transparent\", and it is a springboard for your own understandings.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Many people from previous years who took it told me not to take it (As you may notice, many of the evaluations from previous years are positive -- I can't really explain why this should be, given that I talked to a number of students who took the course and told me, rather emphatically, not to take it. I did not listen, and regretted the decision).Here is my evaluation, reprinted from another question, of the course:This course was below average. The better days of the course were often days when Professor Zhuo spent the beginning of the course laying out a basic summary of the material. The worse parts of the course were during discussion and for two main reasons. 1) There was often a fundamental lack of understanding between students and Professor -- questions were rarely answered adequately. Often a student would ask a question which almost every other student in the class understood. Professor Zhuo, however, would not seem to understand the question and, to the frustration of myself and others, not answer it adequately, directly, or, often, at all. 2) Discussions rarely felt rigorously grounded in the intricacies of the texts. Professor Zhuo was great at giving basic summaries of the texts, but rarely seemed to be intimately acquainted with their details and complexities. Often, she would make clear that she had forgotten about small, and sometimes significant passages in the texts. On the third day of the course, for example, when someone asked about a central concept in Bad Faith (a concept which Sartre discussed for many pages of the short article) Professor Zhuo said she had to look back at the text because she could not remember the concept. Incidents like this happened a few times. Of course, Professor Zhuo has a far superior understanding of the entire oeuvres of the authors we read than we do. But it often seemed as if she had not reread the texts that we were actually reading the nights before the classes -- or, at least, not reread them carefully enough. I don't know if the problem of miscommunication between student and Professor can necessarily be fixed. It might just be the case that this seminar should be more lecture heavy.",
    "Literature 339 is a crash course on french theorists from the 20th century. It is a very enjoyable class and I would highly recommend it to any student interested in philosophy and literature for it greatly improves one's understanding of modern philosophy.",
    "yep. take it for the sake of understanding really fantastic ideas; make understanding those ideas your main goal and to that end talk as much as possible to Yue in office hours and outside of class to break them down, rip them apart, and otherwise generally play with them."
