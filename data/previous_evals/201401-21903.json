    "If you can take this course, take this course. However, take it credit d. Professor Cleaver is wonderful and lenient, but I personally did not find her to be an easy grader. She has a lot of great life experience though, and I think if you have the opportunity to learn from someone like her, you should. The readings are also pretty great, but I think not having to stress about my grades would have made this class an even better experience.",
    "Good course if your interested in civil rights, feminism, or African-American history. I strongly recommend. We had good discussions in class and most of the readings I genuinely enjoyed!"
