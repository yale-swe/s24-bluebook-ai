    "Its' strength was that via discussions with the grad students, you were able to incorporate extensive background knowledge related to the material.",
    "The course is very interesting, although the majority of the readings relate to depressed individuals traveling their respective parts of the globe.",
    "The strength of the course lies in the readings and the professor. Professor Wetters is very knowledgeable and leads the class well, and it's been marvelous to learn from him. And most of the readings are very captivating. If I had to point to a weakness, I would say it was the absence of some theory near the beginning of the course that would guide the students in their readings though Professor Wetters provided some near the end, which I found helpful."

    "Professor Wetters truly cares about his students and does a great job meeting one-on-one with students to improve their writing ability. He is clear about the expectations throughout the course, and the workload is manageable. I would definitely recommend this course to any student with an interest in travel and travel writing.",
    "Yes. Great course! Take it."
