   "comments": [
    "Want to write screenplays? Take it if you can get in. You definitely won't regret it.",
    "Take this class! You will learn a new skill in a fun environment. Marc is an incredible instructor who will teach you a lot. Everyone interested in movies\/creative writing\/story telling\/fun should take this class at some point in their Yale career.",
    "Great class. Important to all types of film studies majors.",
    "Take it if you want to go into entertainment. It's also just a fun course, so if you want to branch out, try it! (Although you'll have a hard time getting in if you're not a Film Studies major)",
    "If you're interested in screenwriting and reader to undertake a boatload of work, do it. It's a great experience and Professor Lapadula really takes student work seriously, but it's not a gut. He'll call you out if you're not pulling your weight.",
    "Fun class, pretty straightforward--can feel a little remedial for anyone who already knows how to write and has even an inkling about how to do plot and character development. That said, if you don't have a screenwriting background, it's an interesting way to learn the format and crank out a script or two.",
    "Do it if you want to write screenplays. It's a teach-yourself kind of class, but you definitely learn a ton.",
    "Take it if you can get in, which is tough as a non film studies major. Screenwriting is fun, and I looked forward to the class every week. Don't expect to learn much from Lapadula, though. He facilitates the process without actually teaching you much of anything.",
    "Take it. Lapadula can get really overblown but it's your only chance here to workshop a script with other students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in screenwriting or fiction writing in general. It does not call for an excessive amount of work but you will definitely be challenged to grow as a writer.",
    "Definitely.",
    "The class is a lot of fun and a great first exposure to screenwriting and screenplays. The course was my first encounter with screenwriting and after the course I felt like I left with a solid basic understanding and foundation in screenwriting. Aside from the midterm folder (which is a lot of work, especially if you save it all for the last minute) most of the work for the class is self-motivated."
