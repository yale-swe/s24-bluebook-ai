   "comments": [
    "ENGL 477 was an extremely fun course. The readings were interesting and fun to read, and the films we watched were entertaining. I also enjoyed the creative writing aspect (which is not strenuous for those unfamiliar with it). Occasionally class felt more like a conversation between Professor Crowley and Professor Grimstad rather than a full class discussion, but the things they were saying were interesting, so I still felt as if I was learning more about the literature surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the class is so new, it may take a year or two for the structure and dynamic of the class to be ironed out. I hope to see it continue.",
    "This class was about science fiction written by and talked about by white men. There were definitely some interesting things, and the open-ended assignments allowed a lot of interesting freedom. Take it if you can put up with overconfident professors stroking their egos and geeking out. Maybe don't take it if you are easily frustrated by that kind of interaction. Or if casual ableism and offhand misogyny bothers you.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in sci-fi and writing. I believe that even though this class was centered around AI in fiction, it gave me a great deal of insight into how general thoughts and concepts evolve during writing, both in history and in the writing process itself. My only remark is that the course could have included a little more about writing than it did, but I was pleasantly surprised and it passed my already-high expectations nonetheless.",
    "Come to class to get caught in the crossfire between Professor Grimstad and Professor Crowley--two brilliant literary minds, unapologetic, curious, and bold. With audacity, contribute to the conversation, with whatever you know: linguistics, gender studies, computer science, physics, neuroscience. The prescribed two hours a week is never enough. This is the best of the creative writing program at Yale, where we're treated like real writers--not students. Read critically, read widely, write creatively.",
    "I would recommend this course, but think that the second half of the semestre the class discussions felt a little repetetive."
