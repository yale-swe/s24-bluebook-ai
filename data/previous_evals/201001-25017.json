    "221 is essentially like taking lessons for credit with a chamber group. If this is what you enjoy, then most certainly take it; however, if you are not willing to be committed to your group rehearsals, perhaps an extracurricular ensemble would be a better choice.",
    "MUSI 221 gives undergraduates the opportunity to earn credit for a music performance course. It's fantastic! Participants meet with a TF or Professor on alternating weeks, and the entire class meets every 3-4 weeks. It is a great opportunity to explore repertoire ignored by many performing groups on campus, develop as an instrumentalist, bond with a small group of peers, and learn to analyze performances of other students. Overall, it's a great course and I wish that I had been aware of the opportunity earlier in my Yale career!",
    "Music 221 is a great class. I definitely recommend it for other students! The class environment is welcoming, and you get to meet and play with other wonderful musicians. What more could you ask for?",
    "If you love classical chamber music you must take this course",
    "The course is fun -- the time commitment isn't too onerous and the music (provided you choose well) is enjoyable. Make sure that you're on the same page as the rest of your group as far as scheduling and seriousness go. You don't want to end up with one or two flaky people who ruin it for the rest of you.",
    "Great class. Great musicians, great coaches, and great, great pieces. What's not to like?",
    "Chamber Music is a performance-based chamber music class. You audition with and or get placed into a chamber group of 2-6 people, then select a piece to work on for the semester. You get coached once a week, by a professor and by a member of the Jasper String Quartet, and then your group practices by itself. About every month, there are masterclasses where you get to perform and get critiqued by the other members of the class, then there is a final concert at the end of the semester. It's fun, low-stress, and a great way to play chamber music at a high level at Yale!",
    "It's a wonderful opportunity to keep up your instrument or just play in a chamber group. You get to listen to a lot of other pieces as well from your peers.",
    "This is a class where you get credit for paying chamber music! How can you do better than that? It is the awesomest!You do have to make sure that you can be at all (or at least most) of the studio classes (which are a lot of fun anywyas, it's like going to a concert\/masterclass and hearing other awesome people play!) and besides that chamber music is the best!",
    "Great class! Lots of fun. Masterclasses are a wonderful opportunity for student participation. Also a great way to meet friends.",
    "221 is a good course because you get credit for doing something so endlessly enjoyable\u0097playing chamber music. That said, the groups and the pieces you get to play are very variable.",
    "recommended highly. Especially if you bring your own group and know which piece you want to play.",
    "If you are a dedicated musician and want to continue growing as a performer, you need to take this class! All the time! Every year!"
