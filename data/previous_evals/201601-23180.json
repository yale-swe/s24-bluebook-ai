   "comments": [
    "This course is a really interesting introduction to the history of the politics behind environmental issues. You get to examine the subject from the lens of politics, regulations, business interests, scientists, and both domestically and internationally. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in environmental advocacy. The course introduces plenty of perspectives on what moves the needle on environmental policy-making and the short paper format forces you to grapple with the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments in an interesting way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are prepared to do the readings the bulk of the class is not Professor Swenson lecturing about politics of the environment but rather students presenting on the week's topic and discussing the readings. That being said, I learned SO much about timely and relevant subjects in this class. I knew I was interested in environmental work in the future, and this class taught me so much about the different aspects of the field and reaffirmed my desire to focus on environmental issues. The class is not a ton of work (2 presentations, 4 short responses, and a final paper) and has a very relaxed atmosphere in the classroom.",
    "This course is an overview of the major themes in current environmental politics. Students had the opportunity to hear from interesting guest speakers, and each student does 2 presentations on a topic of their choice, which I learned a lot from. The seminar felt unstructured at times. If you want to dive deeply into a particular environmental issue, you won't get the deeper discussion during class but you can explore on your own in your papers or presentation. The professor is very supportive if you reach out for help on a paper or thesis.",
    "This course covers a critical topic and fills a gap in Yale's curriculum for EVST and EPE\/Polisci students studying the environment. I enjoyed going to this class every week because we had great discussions on interesting topics, and Professor Swenson did a good job ensuring that seminar discussions were productive. That said, this is not Professor Swenson's area of expertise, so he offers insight from his own research on how capitalism and corporations interact with politics that applies to environmental politics, but he is new to this topic. Also, this course if focused primarily on climate change, and doesn't cover a lot of other important environmental issues. Overall, I recommend for anyone interested in environmental politics as it is a fairly easy course with great seminar discussions and interesting readings.",
    "This class had a mix of majors and it added a nice diversity of perspectives in the student presentations. Thus, if anyone has an interest in either the environment, U.S. policymaking process, political science, etc. it is a great course to learn about how U.S. history and politics have played a role in what we are seeing today within the environmental sector."
