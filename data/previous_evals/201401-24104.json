    "It's an interesting class, and does involve a field trip to NYC to look at some Gothic Revival churches (an added bonus) but probably most interesting for those who already have a nascent interest in architecture or history of church and cathedral-building. The course aims to answer the fundamental question of why we as Yale students live and work in Gothic-style buildings, a question explored through the study of earlier Gothic buildings.",
    "I would recommend Medieval Cathedrals to another student but I might not give it the highest praise. It is very interesting, and very different from a lot of other courses but it requires bringing a lot of your own underlying interest in with you.",
    "I would highly recommend it. It is an awesome course. Not only do you get a lot out of it in terms of knowledge and cultural nuance, but you also have fun while doing so."
