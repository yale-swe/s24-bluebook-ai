   "comments": [
    "I am very glad I took this class. It is a wonderful class and you should take it too! But be aware that you are not just reading children's books the whole time. The class ends up being about half children's lit, half philosophy\/theoretical readings. At first I wasn't to excited about the theoretical readings, but looking back on the class, all of the readings were well-chosen and helped me see children's literature in a new way. Also Natalia Cecire is a great teacher.",
    "Definitely my favorite class this semester. Very challenging but the material was so interesting that the work was incredibly fun to do. Loved it, even in spite of the fact that I know I won't do incredibly well in the course. But I grew and learned so much from it. The topics are very memorable and very applicable to things outside of the class.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Especially if you're in the social sciences, English, or psychology, I think you should definitely take this course. Not only is it wildly interesting, but it also makes you grow a lot as a student and as a thinker. Don't be intimidated by the first two weeks! It's all worth it.",
    "Take this class!!! It is so incredible. Some classes that combine two subjects really suck and kind of bounce between the two with no real reason why they're combined, but Cecire combining modernism and childhood is sort of the best thing that's ever happened. We discuss canonical modernist work, but it never gets too stuffy, and there's also a lot of theory that deals with meaning and language, innocence and perception, developmental timelines, your classic Freud, etc. And when we do read children's literature, there's this totally trippy moment when you realize there's all this sadistic colonialism going on. Cecire has this magical ability to take a wide range of readings, make them work together, make them justify each other (in a weird way, like if you had a class just on Freud there might be a point where you'd think \"who cares?\" but this would never happen) and also be able to draw you into a dozen different tangents that you could possibly research next.",
    "If you enjoy English or want to read children's books, you should take this course. As a nonmajor, this course was sometimes intimidating for me, but Professor Cecire was extremely helpful. The workload for this course is slightly more than an average English class -- there's a lot of reading for each class, two significant papers, blog responses, and a final exam. However, the readings are extremely interesting. The discussions that we had in class were really great, especially since the class was small. If you don't know much about Modernism or you don't have experience reading literary theory, the class will be challenging, but definitely rewarding. Take it!!"
