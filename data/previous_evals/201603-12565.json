   "comments": [
    "reception history, close reading, taking on secondary sources",
    "I came into this class not knowing very much about Spenser beyond a few short readings for a freshman introductory survey course, and I came away with a library copy of the Shepheard's Calendar under my arm to read over break. Prof. Nicholson does a great job drawing out what's most interesting about Spenser's style and approach, and I felt that I came away with both a greater appreciation of the critical problems that the poet's work raises and a greater appreciation for Spenser's writings themselves.",
    "The course did a great job of teaching a specific author through a broad range of tools and techniques. Cathy's cross-historical work was exemplary and edifying about how such a project might work.",
    "I became a better reader, writer, thinker, and communicator. Through an intimate relationship with Spenser and his readers during this course, I gained a new appreciation for the writer and his impact on literature and the culture of his time. I found his words to capture social issues from 400 years ago that we are still facing today which provided a new framework to consider these issues within. The seminar class format also allowed me to grow immensely from the dialogue with my peers in a small, intimate setting. Professor Nicholson greatly assisted me in strengthening and improving my academic writing voice.",
    "I had never read Spenser before -- now I have! I also gained a tremendous amount from the discussions in class. I particularly enjoyed the weeks we focused primarily on modes of reading and representation within the text. Those discussions helped me think about the project of reading more generally than just within Spenser's works, and the secondary readings showed us how other readers have engaged with the Faerie Queene as well. I also feel much more confident going into the Beinecke and working with sources there after the week we spent there.",
    "This course allowed me to look at the Faerie Queene in detail, when I had previously only been familiar with parts of the text. By focusing on modes of reading the course also provided me with a sound understanding of the journey of the poem since it was written, and highlighted the way in which it has had variable meanings and values to different readers over time."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "FABULOUS course, no weaknesses.",
    "The breadth of coverage on the syllabus, which was quite ambitious, bringing together critics from the Romantic tradition to the present, was handled in a really smart way. The self-reflexive dimensions of the \"History of Reading\" theme were also just great, as we make our way from the curiosity and uncertainty of the naive child reader, often just experiencing the text much for the first time, to that of the self-conscious \"critical reader\" (capable of regarding in critical terms even the term \"critical reading\" itself). The dialogue that the syllabus establishes between Spenser-on-reading and readings of Spenser worked very well.",
    "Discussion was consistently good, well-paced and directed. The readings were also very well-chosen. I have no complaints.",
    "Strengths: Professor Nicholson is a significant strength of this class--she brought Spenser alive for all of us. She engaged the text in a fresh and interesting manner each class and allowed each of our voices to have a place and purpose. Another strength of this course is the engagement with Spenser AND his readers. This was a unique angle to approach the work of the writer and his readers and provided a great depth to the course work. All of the reading assignments were well positioned within the development of our understanding of the material and our class discussion. I sincerely enjoyed preparing for seminar each week because the assignment were so well planned. Weaknesses: This is not so much a weakness of the class itself but the seminar class format. I think it would be helpful to extend the length of the seminar by about 30 min to 1 hour which would allow for a short break in the middle of the class and would allow for more discussion. I often times felt like we were just approaching the heart of the discussion and then the class would be up. I also think it would be interesting and helpful to do some small group collaborative work. Learning to work together with one's peers in an academic setting does not appear to be a focus of the department but I think it is extremely important to build teamwork skills with peers and the seminar environment would be conducive to this effort.",
    "This course really made me think deeply about not just the text of the Faerie Queene, but my own experience reading it. I appreciated the focus on readers' engagement with the text -- whether those other readers are Spenser's contemporaries, later critics, or fellow students. I can't say that I've ever taken a course that was structured quite this way or that made me so genuinely interested in my peers' reactions to the readings. There were a few weeks where I couldn't quite handle all the secondary readings. I wouldn't have objected to those being pruned down a bit. It takes a looong time just to get through the Faerie Queene for the first time!",
    "Cathy's choice of readings for each week allowed us to approach the section of the text we were discussing in ways that differed from the approach we'd taken the week before; this allowed students to not only become familiar with the text but to achieve that familiarity via different avenues. Cathy also ensured we balanced our general readings with several close readings, drawing attention to particular parts of the text or allowing students to do the same. A format in which a student was responsible for a short presentation every week might allow that student to take more of a leadership role each week, but this is a suggestion rather than a recommendation. Cathy's facilitation of discussion was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Yes-- absolutely. I think that this is a great class for anyone with an interest in Spenser's poetry.",
    "Spenser's Readers is a beautifully-designed course--it works both as an introduction to The Faerie Queene for those who are new to the poem, and as a space for thinking about the history of reading and reception studies in a wide-ranging way that extends far beyond Spenser studies. So this isn't just a course for early modernists! Cathy has very much brought her research into the classroom in this course, so a future version of the class might look different after she's finished her book project. But in this incarnation, I really valued her openness in sharing her own preoccupations and developing research interests, her inventiveness in bringing together a really heterogeneous array of critical and \"uncritical\" responses to the poem, and the remarkable intellectual generosity with which she always leads discussions. I cannot recommend highly enough; I wished every class was two hours longer!",
    "I strongly recommend the course and hope it continues to be taught.",
    "Yes, I have recommended this course to all of my peers. It was an excellent environment for learning and growth and did not isolate students with different time period focuses. Each student was encouraged to bring their own expertise and background to the course and class discussion to enhance the growth born of different experience and interests. There was value found in each voice versus value only be assigned to those with expertise in Spenser studies.",
    "Absolutely -- the Faerie Queene is an incredibly rich text that takes on a huge range of issues that would speak to a variety of interests. In the way that the course is organzed, it also lends itself to reading across time periods, as Spenser engages with a number of (both ancient and contemporaneous) source texts and is frequently invoked and analyzed by later readers.",
    "I would recommend this course not only to students who are already interested in Spenser but also to students who may not feel that Spenser is approachable (or interesting to approach). By departing from the idea that the poem has historically produced both enthusiasm and dread in readers, Cathy created an environment in which students could come to the poem in their own way.",
    "Yes. Professor Nicholson is an extraordinary professor, and she did a wonderful job of teaching this course."
