    "Taking introductory German was one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. Class was always fun and relaxed, and if you try hard enough you should be good enough to speak 6- to 8-word sentences comfortably by the end of L2 (it doesn't seem like a lot...but it is). The language itself is not easy, mainly because of the grammar, but its similarities with English help a lot. I thought the syllabus was really well designed, with a nice mix of hard skills\u0097grammar and vocabulary drills, (short, 5-sentence) essays\u0097and soft ones, like films, presentations and role plays, which are always hilarious. It's not intense like introductory French where you have tests every week. And the 'final' is just a skit which you perform in front of the other classes. I guess a lot depends on your instructor too: Julia was AMAZING and she always made things easy to understand (easier than if you just read the book, anyway). She's really sensitive to what the class is good or not so good at and tailors her lessons accordingly. If you're ambivalent about what to take for your language requirement, pick German!!",
    "German 120 is harder than German 110, but still very manageable and not a lot of work. The tests get a bit harder, but they are usually pretty reasonable, and not having a final is really nice (although the skits and role-plays can get tiring after a while). If Julia is still teaching it, definitely try to get her - she is a really nice, great teacher who cares about her students. She makes the class engaging (since meeting every day can be tedious), and overall it is a low-stress environment.",
    "Yes--not very much work. It was actually a concern of mine that we didn't go intense enough through the material, but you still learn a lot and will be surprised by how well you know German at the end. And fun, of course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who are willing to do the work and really want to learn German.",
    "Obviously, take it if you want to learn German and it's the right level for you. Shop around for an instructor you like, and the class should be a breeze. Grammar was a bit more painful than L1 but otherwise it wasn't much more work.",
    "We spent most of our class time talking, so get used to that early if you don't love speaking in class (like me). The workload isn't bad, but you need to make sure you are learning what you need to know more or less on your own time."
