    "This is a survey of major artists and movements from the 1300s to the present. You have to take this class before you leave Yale.",
    "take it, it's nemerov! he's the best and me makes art history so important",
    "YES!",
    "Take it.",
    "An amazing course for anyone with even a passing interest in art. The lectures are incredible, and section in the museum is really fun. The readings are also mostly unnecessary (just read them during reading period) The only dangerous part of the course is that your experience very much depends on which TA you get. Maria, for example, was wonderful in section and was extremely dedicated and available, but graded absurdly difficultly.",
    "An awesome course that everyone should take. Nemerov is inspiring. Take it even if you don't think you like art--you will change your opinion!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it because the workload is very low (plus everyone takes it credit\/d) and it's really quite interesting. Also, it's hard to study art history on one's own, and the class provides some structure into anyone's future attempts to look at and appreciate art.",
    "Just do it.",
    "So overrated it's not even funny. It's kind of worth taking it if you're Credit\/D-ing, if only for the exposure, but never, never take this class for a grade.Nemerov is not cool. I don't know why people like him -- I found his lectures asinine and pretentious.",
    "Take it. You won't get a better introduction to the styles and major artists of the Western tradition from the 1300s to the 1980s. And it's cool to be walking somewhere random and go \"Oh! I know that painting!\" and be able to remember something important about it. If you go to class, the midterm and final should be really easy.",
    "It is an amazing class that is well worth taking. Paying attention is lecture is important, but the lectures are so stimulating that it is hard to not pay attention. I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "It is a survey course of art history from the Renaissance to the present. Lectures are always delivered with enthusiasm and emotion. Take it if you want to spend a few hours every week looking at and thinking about art.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It is a survey of Western Art from the Renaissance to present, but in the process it is also a class about how to view and appreciate art in general. I found this class very rewarding. Lectures were fascinating, the reading isn't totally necessary, and looking at works in the gallery in section was a pleasurable way to put the classes' teachings into action.",
    "Great course - I very much recommend it.",
    "Good survey. Good book. I enjoyed wandering around the gallery with my section.",
    "This is a great class. The lectures are interesting, it is not a lot of work, and you never get bored!",
    "Fantastic class. You learn a lot about Western art's greatest paintings, and feel like you've learned about much more than art in the process.",
    "YES. TAKE IT.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. So far the best course I've taken at Yale. Nemerov is one of the most poetic and eloquent speakers I've ever heard, and his analysis of art is new and intriguing, while still staying true to historical context. If you have any interest in art, take this class. This class provides fantastic cocktail party knowledge, but is also very meaningful and affecting if you want it to be. Also, section is in the ArtGallery and it's a really good excuse to visit one of Yale's most incredible resources once a week for a semester.",
    "The lectures are enriching and I think it is a good course to take sometime while at Yale. It is not too much work and quite rewarding.",
    "Absolutely. It really is one of those Yale courses that one should take.",
    "This course was a great survey for people who enjoy viewing art but have not thought about it critically or in a historical context. Professor Nemerov is as powerful lecturer who is adept at communicating his interpretation of paintings and relating them to others. The sections are held in the Yale University Art Gallery, so students have the chance to interact with works of art in person. There is a midterm, final exam, a 5-page draft of a final paper (on a painting in the art gallery), and a 10-page final paper. It doesn't require much work beyond studying for the tests and working on the papers.",
    "Do not graduate without taking this.",
    "great course",
    "Four words: Alex Nemerov runs wild.",
    "Take it if you're interested at all in art, as it's a subject you'll probably not have the chance to study again once you leave college. It was definitely an enjoyable and educational experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. I knew nothing about painting before the class and I learned a lot throughout it.",
    "I would say that it's a good class, the exams require some lengthy studying,but the reading is very doable. I would recommend it to another student because I found it interesting and stimulating, yet at the same time it wasn't overbearing.",
    "IT was great. highly recommend",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even if it's not a subject you would usually take. Workload can pile up before midterm\/final and around the paper if you don't study continuously.",
    "I took the class credit\/d, and it was a really nice break from the type of thinking that I do in other classes. Definitely take it if you want something fun or different, or a good general overview of art through the centuries. Be aware, though, that sometimes the material, and especially Nemerov's interpretations, seem a bit like bs, which may get annoying at times.",
    "I thought it was a great class. I knew nothing about art coming into the class and learned a lot of interesting and useful information. I might even want to take an art history class again in the future. Sometimes Nemerov can get a little too carried away and talk about irrelevant fluff, but for the most part he is extremely insightful. A good 5th class-- don't have to do the reading, section is easy and fun (don't have to know what you talk about in section for the exam). the only hard part of the class isjust putting in a good chunk of time to memorize all the slides before the midterm\/final. the paper is doable also...",
    "Absolutely--a great taste of art history whether you intend to pursue more classes or not. I ended up discovering I didn't love the field as much as I thought I might, but that wasn't for any fault of the class. Nemerov is totally engaging, you end up hitting some really important artists and art, and the work is very doable (the research paper is a little touch if you haven't had experience analyzing art but it's also really rewarding). Even section is a lot of fun: you basically just go to the gallery and look at and talk about the art. ANd from what I've heard, all the TAs are very solid...",
    "My goal was to become more educated about art, and I think this course will do that for you. If you expect a rigorous historical analysis of the works, though, you are in the wrong place. Nemerov can be a good lecturer but he can also be full of it, and many of his lectures boil down to the twin themes of \"how the painting represents the act of painting\" or \"what the painting says about the nature of art and the role of the painter.\" This sort of interpretation might be valid occasionally, but this was the analysis applied to virtually EVERY SINGLE PAINTING. The textbook was pretty good and that's how I was able to set the paintings in a historical context, but don't expect Nemerov to do this in lecture.Also, pick your sections carefully. I had an architecture student as my TA who pretty much had no clue what he was doing. The upside was that he was a really easy grader and very laidback, but the downside was that I definitely didn't learn as much as some of my friends in sections with TAs who really knew their stuff.",
    "Yes. I took it Credit\/D, and I think it's a perfect class for this if you want to see and enjoy great works of art without having to memorize every detail - which you will if you take it for a grade.",
    "You'll learn a lot whether you dig nemerov's lecturing style or not.",
    "A survey of art over 700 years. This is not a great class to learn about the whole of art history - it focuses only on the paintings presented in lecture as individual artwork, not tying them together in the art historical tradition.",
    "The lectures are amazing and inspiring. Section is really cool as it is done in the galleries right next to paintings. The class is more about learning to interact with and interpret art than it is about memorizing which artist corresponds with which movement. I feel that it has really taught me the life skill of art appreciation and criticism. You don't have to do the readings.",
    "Wonderful lectures. Not too hard, even memorizing all the works",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting class. Tough to get a flat A, but not that difficult to get B+\/A-.",
    "I wasn't a huge fan, it's a lot of memorizing and only surface analysis; lectures are good, but I've certainly not been converted into becoming a Nemerovian follower... as many people do.",
    "Nemerov is legitimately crazy, but if you can put up with the fact that nothing he says has any connection to reality, its super interesting and he's a decent lecturer.",
    "Take this class. It will give you valuable information that you will use in life, and it's a very interesting. There aren't too many slides to memorize, and you can little regurgitate what Nemerov says in class on the tests.",
    "Excellent course \u0097\u00a0I learned A LOT. I took it Credit\/D and didn't do any of the reading and didn't really try on my paper...but after the Final, I kind of regret that decision. If your courseload isn't too bad, take it for a grade and just pay a lot of attention in class. Take good notes!",
    "Take this course to complete your Yale and life experience! You don't need any background in art whatsoever to appreciate it and contribute meaningfully in sections.",
    "Great course. Not too hard. Take it while you are at Yale- you will not regret it.",
    "If you want an overview of Western art, this is a good way to do it and is not a lot of work. You might occasionally get tired of Nemerov's lectures, which sometimes seem to say exactly the same things about all the paintings, but usually it's worth it.",
    "A rich class that will make you appreciate the aesthetics of art and the language used to describe it. Probably my favorite class at Yale so far. (It's not for everyone though -- some people can't stand the subjective language of art history, and need something less descriptive, more concrete.) The sections in the Yale University Art Gallery were great... you get to sit three feet from original works themselves and really examine what was taught in lecture. Lots of slides to study (don't do what I did and not think the final would be cumulative... it is) for the midterm and final, and a 10 page paper, but the workload is really kind of light. (Don't need to do reading - seriously, don't even buy the book, you'll be wasting $130.) I kind of wish we had covered some certain material over the course, like Impressionism... but other than that no qualms at all. Nemerov's lectures flow like poetry -- I often write them down elsewhere just because I like reading them again in my freetime. Must-take, for sure.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a must-take at Yale.",
    "Take it if you can. Its incredibly interesting, practically no work of you're pressed for time, and Nemerov always makes it worth your while. Take before you graduate.",
    "Good class, gives a good overview of Western Art from Renaissance to modern. Its a great Credit\/D. Lots of memorization otherwise.",
    "A very good, enjoyable class. The material is interesting and engaging and its not a pain to study for. Taking a class with Nemerov is a really good experience.",
    "Yes.",
    ">>Disclaimer<<: This class only covers the paintings. Not any other medium of art or architecture,This class is okay. It gives no historical context to the artwork and leaves it up to the textbook. It treats painting like an isolated action that happens in an art world which is a bit annoying. It is primarily a course on Alexander Nemerov's opinions about paintings from the Renaissance to the present.That being said, the section is fun because you get to walk around the galleries and talk about art and you don't need to do that much work for a good grade.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Nemerov is an unceasingly wonderful lecturer, I'm fairly certain that students clapped upon the conclusion of every class. Any student with an interest in art history, whether they have a background knowledge in the subject or not, should certainly consider this class.",
    "Everyone must take this. If you don't need it for any type of credit, take it Credit D and just enjoy class!",
    "I really wouldn't. It's harder than you might think. Sure, art history sounds like a great fun (maybe gut) class, but art history is not to \"interpretive\" as you might think. There is data and information and history that you need to master to understand each work of art, and the TAs (or at least mine) are very tough graders. Section is also really annoying because, rather than going over information discussed in lecture (so that we can get a better grasp of it), we instead discussed new pieces each time. There was just too much art work, all at once. And so many people take it Credit\/D, that if you're not taking it C\/D you feel a lot of pressure because the class really is quite difficult to get a good grade in.I do think I got better at art historical writing, though, and I finally understand what exactly it is that art history entails.",
    "It was a great class! I learned a lot and would recommend it to a fellow student! I learned to appreciate all kinds of art!",
    "Beautiful, beautiful class. Take it.",
    "This survey course is one of Yale's gems. Professor Nemerov is one of the strongest professors I have had here. His lectures are fantastic and intellectually stimulating; he does not just describe what is going on in the artwork, but he takes it a step further, making you discover your own connections to the paintings. Section was great as well, since it showcases what Yale has to offer\u0097in places on campus you probably haven't been to yet. You meet in the Art Gallery or the British Art Gallery every week and have the chance to engage with Yale's works. I enjoyed the essay very much, since I was able to write about one of my favorite paintings. One suggestion: don't buy the textbook. Not needed! Overall, though as I am writing this I am still exhausted from memorizing all 140+ works for the final exam, I highly recommend taking this class to further your knowledge of art as a citizen and of \"the otherness\" the world has to offer.",
    "I was skeptical going in because I hate modern art and BS. But this class is FANTASTIC and I'm much more of a believer now.I looked forward to this class EVERY DAY.",
    "take it- credit d if you just want to enjoy the paintings, for a grade if you really love art",
    "Definitely take it. You never look at art the same way again. Don't expect lectures to change your life but they at least change your outlook on the role of art in society and the expressive power of art itself. Great to just go in to the classroom, relax, and soak in the material. Good class to do Credit\/D.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, no matter what your interest or major. Nemerov's lectures are really more like performances than lectures. You will gain a solid background in not only art history and European history, but also the biblical stories and Greek mythology depicted in many of the paintings. You should definitely take this class if you have a chance.",
    "Take it as a senior credit\/D. Really interesting lectures, not a crippling work load.",
    "This is a very interesting class to take- knowing about the basics of art history and how to look at a painting are very valuable life skills, and you will feel much more at home at art museums. Also, sections take place in the Yale Art Gallery, so you really get to see its great collection (e.g. Monet, Van Gogh, Pollack, Warhol, etc.). The workload is ok- two exams (it's a bit tough when you have 100+ paintings to memorize along with the year in which they were painted), paper (rough and final drafts). Professor Nemerov is very engaging and passionate. But, TAKE THE CLASS CREDIT\/D.",
    "In terms of content, this class does what the title says. However, Nemerov's lectures make this class unmissable. He is the best lecturer I've encountered at Yale, constantly engaging and surprising (if occasionally depressing). There's a pretty easy paper to write, and the midterm and final were fair, but that's really not the point. Do the reading if you feel like it, but lectures are really what matter most here. You really should take this while you're at Yale, just for the experience.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Art History. But since it is such a large lecture, there is little personal attention unless you really seek out your TA.",
    "TAKE IT. Nemerov is great, it's not too much work, it's really interesting, you will never walk though a museum the same way again.",
    "An incredible amount of memorization before the final and midterm. Paper is rather difficult to write. This was one class where I actually wanted to go class -- so it wasn't difficult recalling the focuses of lectures, etc.",
    "This is the best class! Great intro to art history, history, how to look at, interpret, and place art in its historical context. Moreover, it's worth taking just to hear Prof. Nemerov speak.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "History of Art 115 will give you a very broad understanding of art from the renaissance to the present. If you are looking for a course with more of a specific focus in one time period, do not take this course.",
    "Everyone should take this class. Even if you do not like art history, Prof Nemerov might change that. And even if he doesn't, he views about academics and learning are definitely worth being exposed to.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are looking for an interesting class without much work. If you're genuinely interested in Art History, you probably won't get that much from this class and might be better served taking the fall survey instead.",
    "This course is a must take. Professor Nemerov is one of the finest lecturers at Yale. You learn a bunch of information about the history of western art. I'm by no means an art history guy. I took the course because of its reputation and desire to become more well-rounded. The course fulfilled my expectations and yet shattered them because it was so well done. It made you think about art, sure. But it also made you think about how you see art and why, how people act and why, and how you think and why. MUST TAKE!",
    "This class is superb. You will be overwhelmed by brilliance every day.",
    "Possibly. Its not too hard but I suggest that you actually be interested in art",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I'm a science major and never thought I would be able to appreciate art in the ways that I do now. It's also a great way to tie in all the aspects of historical, social, and political moments that were significant enough to gain the interest of the world's most renowned artists.",
    "Yes, if you want to be able to walk into any art museum in the world and have a general understanding this a great class to take.",
    "Yes. Art history major or not, everyone should take this course before they graduate.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Nemerov tends to make some sweeping claims, but if you allow yourself to submit to his way of thinking, the class is really interesting and wonderful. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are very fondof 18th century art or impressionism, you should know that there is next to no time spent talking about either in lecture.",
    "This is a fantastic course that pairs excellent pictorial analysis with textbook reading that further illuminates the progression of major themes in art history. Having section in the Yale Art Gallery is awesome. The only weakness is that some major movements in art are barely covered--impressionism and surrealism, for example. I highly recommend this class.",
    "this was a great class! professor nemerov is an amazing teacher, if you like art history you will love this class! the only work is a midterm, final and final paper so you need to do a significant amount of work on those to do well but that only requires you to do work for like 5 days out of the semester. do not buy the textbook its not required!",
    "History of Art 115 was an excellent introduction to western art from the 14th century to present day. I would highly recommend this class for its excellent lectures and well designed sections.",
    "I know it may sound like a cliche, but you must take this class before you graduate. Each lecture is eye-opening, whether you are looking at Michelangelo, van Gogh, Vermeer, Warhol, etc. Please, whatever you do, resist the urge to look at Facebook during the lectures--the lectures require attention if you want to get everything out of it.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Seriously, it is not difficult at all, you will look forward to going to lecture every time, and you will come away with a few nice ideas about art that you can talk about forever (though not to Yalies, they'll know you're cribbing Nemerov). In conclusion and in summary, TAKE IT.",
    "Credit d is the way to go",
    "Definitely recommended. Besides memorizing slides, a lot of the work you do will be original analysis, so you don't necessarily have to go to all the lectures or do much of the reading. But nemerov's lectures are the reason to take the course.",
    "I would recommend History of Art 115 01 to another student. I am well versed in art history now.",
    "Expect: a brilliant mini-thesis each lecture according to Nemerov's unique teaching style (especially tune in to the lecture on Manet and the final lecture--ingenious.) Do not expect: a grounding in art history terminology or the arc of art historical movements (surrealism, dadaism, etc; impressionism is not even discussed.)If you like the teaching style in the first few lectures, you will like the class. If you don't, it doesn't change. Don't be afraid not to like Nemerov's style...though I came around to it immensely while studying for the final, when I realized how very smart the man is. Even if you take it credit\/d, you would probably still have to memorize pretty much every slide for the final.",
    "Yes. You really learn a lot studying for this class even if you don't attend.",
    "If you're interested at all in art, at least shop this course. However, if you're just thinking about taking this course because your friends recommended it, make sure to have a backup. I enjoyed the course because I liked the topic, but I didn't like the professor that much, and that was what my friends gushed about all the time.It's not too much work, but you do learn a lot.",
    "I recommend this to someone who is interested in art history but has no background in it. It's a nice introduction to the various approaches to studying art, and it certainly sheds light on the work of certain artists really well. However, there is much missing from this course, and many important artists only get a brief mention, so I would encourage people interested inart history to try a more narrowly focused class, maybe at the 200 level, because it might be more fulfilling as far as profundity of understanding.For the art history majors who have to take a 100 level course as a major requirement, this class can be frustrating at times and sometimes even repetitive; but it has its lectures and its moments of interest.",
    "I would definitely recommend Art History. It is a course that everybody at Yale should take at one point or another because of Professor Nemerov as well as the way that it forces you to go into the Yale Art Gallery and learn about the works there-a rare opportunity.",
    "Absolutely! It's such an amazing class and even better than my high expectation!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students who have not taken any history of art courses at Yale. The course is an introductory course, so there are many students from other majors and no previous knowledge of art history is required. There are two exams and one term paper. The TAs provide a lot of help for the term paper as it is expected that most students have not taken history of art classes before. Overall it was a really fun course that everyone should take at Yale.",
    "I loved this class. In my opinion it's pretty hard to not know what you're getting into in with an Intro Art History course -- basically each class is a lecture in which Nemerov goes over one to three artists, using a slide format to present their paintings, and usually he had some sort of thesis to present about the works. Honestly, most of the class is just looking at some really fantastic art and sitting there soaking in Nemerov's opinions about it (a lot of which sounds kinda like bullshit but in an awesome, scholarly, artistic way). What more could you want? You only really have to do work a few times a semester, for the paper, midterm and final, and those are pretty easy and even fun. The section is at the art gallery which is kind far to get to depending on where you're coming from, but it's pretty awesome to stand around and discuss art. Definitely a must-take class!",
    "Great class to take credit\/D\/fail. You will still learn a LOT. Fun to attend classes.",
    "There's not much more to be said about this class, I'm sure. Got to the first few lectures - if you fall in love and become join the Nemerov Groupies, stick around. If it doesn't do much for you, then take an Art History seminar. Beware of the mind-numbing memorization. If you're out side of the major looking for a \"just for fun\" art class, this could be your ticket - although I actually recommend trying an Art History seminar. They're more rewarding and often less work, as well.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn how to analyze art, NOT if you want to learn about art history (movements, evolution of specific techniques, etc.)--this is a class in visual analysis only.",
    "Take this if you have to for the major, but don't believe the hype about the professor. The lecturer's arguments and interpretations are frequently outlandish and invariably poorly defended by connections to the art itself.",
    "Great class to take Cr\/D\/Fail, because the lectures are brilliant and you don't want to miss them.",
    "Most of this course was wonderful. Nemerov keeps the main focus narrow, but he touches on so many other works and theories that I felt I had a terrific foundation in the art from the Renaissance to the present.",
    "I'd definitely recommend HSAR 115 as a great way to start learning about art. It has a great professor, an interesting subject, and a manageable workload. I took it credit\/D and would recommend the same for someone with a busy schedule.",
    "Absolutely. Best. Idea. Ever.",
    "I would recommend this class, because of the nature of what is taught; not necessarily the way in which it is taught.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Nemerov is an amazing lecturer. You will learn a lot about how to go about looking at and interpreting different paintings based on their time period. If you have no background in art however, the basic concepts and genres are not explained in class and it really helps to read the book. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Some of the lectures are good, some are mediocre, some are a little incomprehensible. This is a pretty good class, but it doesn't deserve the reputation is has gotten. You won't be any worse off in life if you don't take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Lecture was very entertaining, there is barely any work-only one paper and two tests, and it's nice to have a broad understanding of Western art.",
    "Take it. Who doesn't want to sit and look at pretty pictures while listening to a dynamic lecturer?",
    "A fine intro to art history. Nemerov offers up some interesting nuggets though I often had a hard time extrapolating his comments to anything that I could apply to art in general. I learned about some classic paintings but don't feel I am terribly knowledgeable about art history in general.",
    "This class is great for those interested in learning about art. I would recommend it to many fellow students but warn them about the amount of studying for the tests. The IDs can be tedious if one is uninterested in the subject matter.",
    "Take it. The course opened my mind to visual arts in a big way.",
    "Yes - however, there is a lot of material to memorize for the midterm and final, so I'd recommend taking it credit\/d. This course was fascinating and opened my mind up to seeing art in a completely different way. I would recommend enjoying it for its content rather than focusing too much on getting a good grade in it (thus, take it credit\/d).",
    "The best Cr\/D class at Yale. Sit in Nemerov's lectures and enjoy.",
    "I absolutely loved HSAR 115. If this is a subject you are even remotely interested in, I highly recommend taking this class. Although the lectures aren't particularly fascinating, learning the artists, paintings and titles for the midterm and final really give you a basis of understanding of artwork from the last few centuries. This would be a great class to take Cr\/D. There is a midterm, 10-page paper and a final.",
    "This is a great course, regardless of your background in art. Worth taking for either a credit or a grade.",
    "THis class at first seems wishy washy and heavy in opinion with little factual information. However, toward the end of the class you realize what a masterful lecturer and art historian Nemerov really is, because the lectures come together so seamlessly. It is evident that Nemerov's lectures are meticulously prepared. Even though I took AP Art History in high school, this class was an amazing complement to that--not too repetitive at all. While AP is all about rote memorization, in this class you'll actually learn how to look at and understand art, not just memorize the title, artist, and movement. It is a really fulfilling class that you won't regret taking.",
    "Truly enjoyable and not too much work for Credit\/D. If this is your last semester at Yale take it. You need something to talk about in the cocktail parties you will be attending in your future careers.",
    "Yes. This course is never boring, I knew nothing about art when I came to this class and left felling like I could find my way around any art museum, and put whatever I saw into some (perhaps crude) art-historical context. Totally worth it.",
    "Section takes place in the Yale art gallery, which is a great way to get to know the place if you haven't spent much time there. Reading is very light, lectures extremely interesting, and there's not too much studying for the midterm and final.",
    "It's good. I would recommend it. Not too much work and not all that hard.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. I was frustrated every class session with the lectures and dissatisfied with the general layout of the course.",
    "A necessary part of a Yale education. This course will not only offer you a solid understanding of Western art, but will also instill in you a greater appreciation for art itself. Wonderful.",
    "Amazing course. Take it no matter what major you are. It covers the main survey art history course from about 1300-on, but the real treat is Nemerov. If you can take a class with him before you graduate, do so.",
    "This is the greatest course. You basically get to learn about amazing art, while hearing Nemerov talk in a way that is truly breathtaking. He is the expert and you will leave feeling that you are prepared to go into any art museum and know just as much, if not more, than those around you. The class was just fun. This is one of those Yale gems. I wouldn't take it Credit\/D unless you have a really heavy course load because it's so great knowing all the dates and artists. For the assessments be prepared to talk about the greater significance of the work, whether historical, social or artistic, as this is what most people found to be difficult.",
    "It is a lot of information but if you are interested in art than it's great! Even if you are not, the professor is entertaining with his own blend of dry understated (emphasis on this!) humor and his genuine interest\/passion for his field. Plus you get to have section in the Yale Art Gallery which is pretty darn cool!",
    "Exciting new area, great as a political science major to take senior year Cr\/D. It's not easy, but with enough effort you can learn about an important subject in the humanities. Nemerov is cool, and there are some great TA's like Betsy Athens.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting introductory art history course.",
    "No, do not take this class. Even if you are slightly interested and think this class might be useful, you should probably avoid this class. It is hard to pay attention in lectures and it is hard to do well in. Take it credit\/D if anything, but don't take it just because everyone says it is so good or because all of your friends are in it. Shop it and if you don't like it, don't take it.",
    "This is a good intro course, especially if you don't know that much about art. It's really neat to get the whole survey of art from the renaissance to present in one semester...and studying art overlaps with studying intellectual\/religious\/etc history as well.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Sit and listen, take notes if you are taking it for a grade. It gives you an appreciation for art, and even if you have taken survey courses before (AP Art History in high school etc), you've never had someone analyze a work like Nemerov.",
    "TAKE IT! It's a wonderful class, and you will learn a tremendous amount about some of the most amazing works of art from the Western canon.",
    "Yes, take this class if you want to learn how to appreciate art museums",
    "yes",
    "Nemerov is the new Scully. This is one of the few must-take courses at Yale. Do not treat this class as cocktail-party material; instead, it is filled with lessons about life.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "It's a good course to take credit\/d. Just enjoy the lectures and don't stress about memorizing dates.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would not recommend History of Art 115 01 to another student. Do not take this class if you want a challenging or thought-provoking view of art history. Do not take this class if you are at all interested in thinking critically.",
    "The lectures are great, and the work isn't tough. If you want to learn about art history, you'll get a solid foundation from this course. Having a good TA makes a difference \u0097\u00a0try to shop around.",
    "Great course to take if you don't know anything about art.",
    "TAKE IT. Everyone needs to take this class to understand the importance of art in the world, of close looking, and of visual experience. Every lecture was so beautifully woven, from the moment the first slide arrived on the screen to Nemerov's concluding statements. The course is so cohesive that I found studying for it to be one of the most enjoyable things, because successfully distilling information from such poetic lectures proved I actually absorbed the content; I wasn\u0092t just listening to pretty words. Learning to see art historically was emphasized in comparisons, etc., but I loved that Nemerov always tiedthe lectures back to the importance of our relationship to art, what it means to have an experience with art, and what the work tells us about the act of creation itself. Please take this class \u0096 I was a history major and later fell in love with art through work at YUAG, and I can confidently say that this is the perfect combination of academic and aesthetic experiences. Writing the papers was so, so enjoyable because I was able to spend much time exploring deeply the many aspects of a work of art. My TA was incredibly helpful thinking through ideas, and art historical writing is just so demanding that it greatly improves your argumentative skills and precision of words -- because everything MUST be believably tied to what you see, you can't BS it. Take this class -- you will love it.",
    "The lectures are really great, and having section in the galleries is nice. Section can sometimes be frustrating if you already have a little bit of a background in art.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Before this semester, I didn't \"get\" art. I'd walk through museums as if in a semi-bored trance. A painting to me was, at best, \"pretty.\" Nemerov (along with section,which is really helpful& actually quite fun) taught me how to now only look at art, but to SEE art. I know it sounds cheesy, but my perception of the world as a whole has actually changed drastically as a result of this class. It blew my mind. Take it.",
    "If you've never taken art history before, take Nemerov's class. If you have taken art history before and want to hear more in-depth about specific works, take Nemerov's class. Nemerov tends to be emotional and verbose in lecture, but that can be a good thing; and even when his conclusions seem far-fetched, he at least challenges his students to consider the ways in which art effects our perceptions. The only drawback is that he leaves out the more general art historical movements in order to focus on individual works.",
    "Take it!! You learn so much!!",
    "The lectures are very engaging and worth attending. I'm glad I took this class."
