    "ENG 608 is very useful course specially for the graduate students having English literature major. This course is a very very helpful to understand the Shakespearian plays and theatrical events etc. This course also introduces the modern adaptation of Shakespearian plays in many languages of the world. It provides deep understanding of Shakespeare and his works.",
    "ENGL 608 was a fascinating introduction to early modern theater history and performance studies through the lens of Shakespeare's plays, and it's opened up so many new avenues of scholarly interest for me. Brian Walsh is a wonderful seminar leader--he provides enough guidance to give structure to the seminar, but he also knows when to step back and let the discussion go in unanticipated directions. I did notice that in some classes we didn't spend much time discussing the secondary readings and just focused on the play we had read that week--which was great, but I sometimes felt that I wanted to get a greater sense of the critical conversation. But that's a small critique; overall, I highly recommend the class!",
    "This course is excellent for both early-modernists and theater-studies students, as well as for students of other periods and genres. The secondary readings provide an excellent introduction to early-modern (and contemporary) performance theory. I would highly recommend this course to interested students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The focus on theatrical experience has given me a new perspective on Shakespeare, which I have largely been taught through close readings. This class has focussed on details of language, but also on details of performance, and it has been the blend of the two which has made this class particularly useful and informative."

    "My area is English language and literature and I think world of the english literature is incomplete without shakespeare. I had great interest about Shakespeare from the beginning and read many things about Shakespeare but this course broaden the horizon of my knowledge about Shakespeare. I am able to understand Shakespeare on the deeper level.",
    "This class has highlighted a side of my discipline that I have not focussed on heavily for some time, and has rekindled my interest in staging as well as language. I think the approach taken by this class has now influenced my own approach to reading drama and reimagining performance. The essay that I have written for this class has been an early example of the kind of work I might hope to concentrate on in the future."
