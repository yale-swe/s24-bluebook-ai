    "This was an incredible class and I am so glad I got the opportunity to take it. Julian is a great teacher and the assignments were really interesting and worth spending time on. You should note that the assignments are almost all based done by hand instead of on the computer (you aren't given Adobe Creative Suite by the way), but this ended up being a great way to learn design basics. If you can get in, definitely take it!!",
    "Great class, definitely take it! Know that most of the work you do in this class will involve cutting and gluing. We did use Photoshop and InDesign during the last month of the class but really only used them as tools for completing our projects-you totally could have finished the class still not knowing how to use either application very well. Also most of the assignments are just explorations of composition\/design, so don't take this class if you're just hoping to build up your portfolio. All of the work is done outside of class; actual class time almost always consists of a critique. Personally I actually really liked critiquing the work but I know some people found it boring. The class definitely has a heavier workload than most Yale classes but it's not as much as most people reviewing the course say. It totally depends on the assignment but I would say I spent like 7-10 hours a week doing work for this class.",
    "It was a challenging Art course and Professor Bittner is not an easy grader. It will be tougher if you've taken less art courses in the past. However, at the end of the semester, when you compare your work at the start and the end, you will feel very good about yourself. I just wish I had taken art courses like visual thinking before this. It is a LOT of work so do not take it with multiple time-consuming courses."
