    "For those who have some interest in innovation, this would be a great class to take.",
    "I have already recommended this course to my classmates. It is a great opportunity to work with students from other professional schools, to work on a substantive topic, and to do so in a manner that explores process-based planning that will be widely applicable.",
    "Yes. I would highly recommend the course to any and all students. I would also suggest expanding the membership beyond SOM, Law, and Jackson to possibly include 5 students from \"wildcard\" schools.",
    "I would definitely recommend. The class makes students touch the frontier of initiatives involving innovations in government and opens our minds to think how government should operate."
