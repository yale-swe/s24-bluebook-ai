   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "- Analytical skills of fMRI data, very useful in the neuroscience research field - Machine learning principles and computational methods in the human neuroscience context - Coding skills necessary for implementing high level analysis with brilliant methods - Applying neuroscience, statistics and computer science skills for analytical methods - Evolving methods of fMRI analysis for more accurate studies",
    "Machine learning methods (decoding), rsa, searchlight, functional connectivity, real time neurofeedback. Basically the cutting edge of computational neuroscience of the last decade. You'll become very adept at fmri analysis.",
    "A lot -- you have two different theaters of learning in this class. The first is the lectures given by Professor Turk Browne which provide introductions to the statistical methods that you end up using in the class but also give background to the neuropsychological events that we measure using statistics. The second is the homework, which is started in class. The homework gives a look into the cutting-edge of neuroscience through problem sets in Python generally centered around learning a new statistical technique. You learn about neuroscience, you learn about statistics and machine learning, and you learn about programming.",
    "I learned how to apply fundamental statistical analysis tools to analyze fMRI data. All of the concepts were effectively taught in great detail.",
    "I learned how to apply my programming knowledge to Python, work with Jupyter notebooks, and how machine learning can be used to analyze neuroimaging data.",
    "I learned A LOT in this course. How to set up classification pipelines, manipulate subject data, set up SRM (shout out to the final project), and even a little bit about real-time fMRI research. I also would say I genuinely improved my Python skills.",
    "This course taught me how to analyze fMRI data using computationally powerful techniques such as SRM, ISC, classifiers, and more.",
    "A lot of them. I think I learned more applicable and amazing skills in this class than in any class I have yet taken and probably will take at Yale. The class started with a crash course of brain imaging techniques, specifically fMRIs, as well as the data handling and Python skills needed to succeed in the class. The class then moved into Machine Learning and Classification techniques. The in class lectures offered a solid theoretical discussion of these techniques, and the weekly assignments were a great way to actually implement them on real life data. After learning the basics of classification, we learned about optimizing classifier performance, and learned other methods of dimensionality reduction of data (all very important and widely applicable machine learning problems). Some of the other widely applicable skills we learned were parallel processing and computation, how to submit and work with batch jobs, as well as a very solid grasp of how to use Github and how to navigate UNIX. The latter parts of the course delved into techniques more specific to Neuroscience, including Representational Similarity Analysis, Searchlight Analysis, Functional Connectivity Analysis, and Real Time Analysis. There were times in the course where we were learning techniques developed by Nick's own lab and known to only a handful of people outside of the class. Additionally, everything we learned throughout the lectures in class was made concrete not only through the problem sets that followed, but also through weekly readings of studies in the field that had used the same techniques we were. All in all a really really amazing class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "- Teaching staff that is helpful, patient and engaged in the course as well as checks up on students allowing students to know more about the course - Weekly research reading that apply such methods in researches of human neuroscience - Well balanced theoretical and experimental (code writing) sessions - Covers a lot of topics with interesting details that allows students to study more on and perfect - Cooperative classroom setting for students to help each other and learn together Not sure if a strength or weakness but problem sets completed in two days allows students to focus on them for 2 days and not worry about them after",
    "Very well organised. TAs are very efficient.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were always well-prepared and informative. Through the access you have to the computer cluster and the knowledge of Professor Turk-Browne, Cameron, and Jacob, you have the opportunity to do cutting-edge analyses with the guidance of great teachers. You learn as much about statistics as you would in an actual statistics course. Weaknesses: Steep learning curve if you don't have prior experience with Python. Having homework due 36 hours after it being assigned can be challenging.",
    "The concepts are taught extremely well. Every method of analysis that was taught is fundamental to how analysis is done in all statistical analysis. The assignments provided a lot of structure which was both a positive and negative. Too much structured code sometimes makes it too easy to read past the details but not enough code would be too much of a struggle to learn properly.",
    "This course is strong in that it provides the essential components of both neuroimaging and computational skills to allow students from either background to learn and apply what they know. Assignments were challenging but the necessary help was provided in the form of office hours.",
    "Strengths: Overall, the standard of teaching is of very high quality. Nick Turk-Browne is one EXTREMELY accomplished man and does nothing but continually drop knowledge on you in lecture. Cameron Ellis is also a fantastic TA and is essentially the heart of the class, creating and distributing the assignments, grading them and hosting office hours. Jacob Prince, the peer tutor, was also my saviour throughout the class. You are also learning some genuinely cutting-edge stuff here - you will become one of the few people on the planet who can carry out some of the analyses present on the problem sets when you've completed them. Office Hours were immensely helpful for the few of us who went every week without fail! Weaknesses: I have mixed feelings about the \"Class Tuesday, Workbook due Wednesday night\" structure of the class - on one hand it allows you to focus on the (generally quite difficult but rewarding) workbooks\/psets and get them done close to class time, but at the same time it is a fairly inflexible structure that doesn't take into account other big mid-week commitments\/exams you might have. More flexibility on this would have been helpful. Also the final project was a bit of a let-down: In my opinion, it was much too difficult and stressful and didn't have the structure or support that the rest of the class' projects had. Seriously, the final project almost ruined my opinion of the class (but thankfully didn't quite do so).",
    "This was one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. The psets are really great and teach you so much. Having office hours and Slack were great too. I eventually appreciated that psets were due midnight the night after they were assigned because I would have spent way too much time on them otherwise. But Id recommend that something similar is done with the final project, since that was a total time sink during finals. Perhaps hosting 1-3 hackathons during reading period so everyone works on it about the same amount of time and that amount of time isnt exorbitant would be a better approach.",
    "The greatest strength of the course were the instructors. Nick, Cam, and Jacob put so much effort and time into the class, and it really made a big impact on how good the class was. The material and skills being taught were fascinating and cutting edge, and despite the fact that they were very advanced and perhaps difficult to implement, the support provided by the instructors made everything very very approachable. The weekly problem sets were well thought out and really tied very directly to what we had been learning in class, and made all of the concepts very tangible. The only weakness of the course in my opinion was the quick turnaround of the problem sets (class met weekly on Tuesdays from 12:30 - 3:30, and problem sets were due the next night at midnight). Although I understand the reason for doing it this way, on hectic weeks it could be a bit tough to fully get everything I wanted out of the problem sets within the allotted time. Regardless, this was a very minor negative, and the rest of the course more than made up for it.",
    "The course covers a wide range of topics in computational neuroscience. As a result of its breadth, it fails to go deep into the mathematical foundations of the techniques that it teaches. Thus, the problem sets were more about organising code (and troubleshooting bugs) than solving deeper theoretical problems. One of the few exceptions that left a deep impression was the last question of the first problem set, which showed students the importance of normalization. If the problem sets could be made shorter, but with more theoretical questions like the one I mentioned, this could be an amazing class."

   "comments": [
    "If interested in quantitative core of neuroscience, then this course is a must as it takes interdisciplinary approach of neuroscience, statistics and computer science for analysis and learning. Also, for students interested in machine learning or data analysis applied in the biological context, it is a very interesting class to take. It may get hard sometimes but the excellent teaching staff is ready to help you always.",
    "Yes, it's very well structured for learning fmri analysis.",
    "Definitely if you want to learn about neuroscience, Python, or machine learning. It is hard but it is well-worth it, and as the course goes on you come to appreciate the fact that you and your classmates had a challenging and one-of-a-kind experience together.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The material in this class was highly engaging and interesting. While the context may be neuroscience, the statistical methods can be applied anywhere and a very well taught in this class.",
    "If you want to learn cutting edge neuroimaging techniques and have some programming background, take this course!",
    "I absolutely would, but with a bit of a warning. Despite fantastic teaching and a good, clean class structure, this class required a much higher level of pre-requisite knowledge than I had anticipated. I had the minimum requirements mentioned on the website (CS50 and The Human Brain), but I was continually struggling with even the basics at the beginning and I was very discouraged early on in the course. Thankfully with a lot of office hours support and grit, I was able to do decently well in the class and complete the problem sets. If you're not 1) a very competent programmer (especially in Python) and\/or 2) a data scientist or good at linear, be prepared to struggle in the class. It is rewarding to power through, but understand that this class will likely be the main focus of your attention and stress for the semester (for at least two days every week).",
    "TAKE THIS. If youre interested in neuroscience research or if you want to improve your Python coding ability or you want to understand how to analyze data computationally, this is the class for you. This is the type of course where everyone whos taking it is taking it because they truly want to, so its a much more enthusiastic learning environment. And because of that, the grading tends to not be too bad, letting you focus on just learning as much as possible from the lectures and psets. Cant recommend enough.",
    "Without a doubt. This is the most amazing class I have taken at Yale; and I think if you have any interest in either neuroscience, machine learning and data analysis (or both) you should without a doubt take this class. It really gives you a great sense of everything that is possible in these fields, and unlike most other classes that are teaching material from 20-30 years ago, this class gives you skills which you could immediately implement in any field you are interested in. Taking this class was the best decision of my semester, and if you put the effort into it, you will get so so much out of this class. Take it!!!!"
