    "Interesting and heavy workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students broadly interested in systems, security, protocols, and the way that decentralized systems work.",

    "I learned a great deal about a variety of topics and considerations involved in designing decentralized systems.",
    "I feel like this decentralized systems course exposed me to clever and unknown (to me) algorithms. This is a very special kind of algorithms, they are really hard to grasp in a whole because they only make sense when interacting; and that is what makes them exciting. Being aware of them and able to implement them makes me feel like I really got something out of this course.I will probably complete my formation with a more theoretical course on decentralized systems since I feel like proof on these programs will involve clever and enlightening invariants."
