   "comments": [
    "I really liked this course. The readings were interesting, and Professor Samuels has a really great knowledge of all 19th century French Lit. The class could be a little slow at times if people hadn't done the reading, but for the most part discussions were engaging and meaningful. A good overview of art, literature, and history of 19th century France. There is quite a bit of reading each week, but it is worthwhile to do all of it.",
    "Very good class, I'd strongly recommend it. I originally thought I'd probably only take one French class to fulfill my language requirement, but this has me interested in taking more. There's a lot of reading, and you should try to do the majority of it; it won't kill you to miss some of it, but not having anything discuss during class will definitely make the time drag on.",
    "if youve never read a heavy load in french before, you might want to hold off. but otherwise take it.",
    "This course attempts to answer three questions: (1) How did Paris change through the XIX century (ie: architecture, urbanism, history) (2) How did artists, poets, writers and journalists understand the new city, and what is the link between the new city and new artistic forms (3) What are the effects of these changes on modern subjectivity and the conciousness of the people? It is argued that our modernity is, to a degree, a product of changes in Paris during this period.",
    "The best thing you can say about a course is thatyou feel sort of like an expert in the topic when you're done - it's definitely true here. The course is a lot of work but if you trust professor Samuels you'll learn all about the time period, which is one of the coolest in history in terms of the art it produced, literary and visual. Unlike some other lit or art courses, though, you learn about the historical background of each work in some depth, so you can write about them comfortably. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone comfortable speaking in French.",
    "Yes! This course is simply fantastic. The holistic approach, blending literature, art, architecture, film, and historical readings, truly creates a living, breathing 19th century Paris for students to explore. Professor Samuels' command of the literature and ability to guide a class conversation made the class enjoyable throughout the term.",
    "French 381 looks at the history of Paris in the 19th century and the themes during this time that were specific to the City of Light.I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it was my favorite class by far this semester. Professor Samuels is a terrific lecturer, very entertaining and intriguing, and I found the ideas that we spoke about extremely fascinating. Imagining Paris during such an interesting time and seeing this city through the eyes of these brilliant authors was so fabulous and really enjoyable.",
    "this is a great class! the readings are pretty long, but usually they are really interesting, and professor samuels is great. if you are at all interested in french lit or paris or the nineteenth century, go for it - a great mix of literature and history and even some art history. however, if you haven't taken a conversational french class yet at yale though, I'd suggest taking that first...",
    "Paris: Capital of the 19th Century was by far the most interesting French course I have taken at Yale. It covers an important time and place in intellectual history that you may not necessarily learn about otherwise. If you are willing to do a lot of reading, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "If you're interested in learning about the shape of Paris that was radically different from the one we know today, this is the course. The reading is great and the look at pictures at the end was also excellent. Worth the time!",
    "French 381 is a very interesting class, but it is definitely a lot of reading and a lot of work.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have the chance and the inclination. While the workload can be intense at times -- mostly a lot of meaty readings, with a few not-too-grueling written assignments thrown in -- the subject matter and the unique approach to the material make it totally worth it. Professor Samuels is great -- really friendly, and extremely knowledgeable on and fascinated by the stuff he's teaching -- which makes class discussions that much more enjoyable. If you are remotely interested in the cultural history of 19th-century Paris -- literature, historical context, art history, social commentary -- then I cannot recommend this seminar strongly enough.",
    "I would most definitely, for all the reasons stated above.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a very sound understanding of the French language AND a sound understanding of French literature and interpretation. Be prepared to read a lot (and by a lot, I mean more than you would expect) and be prepared to discuss everything you read in class in a relatively small setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in French\/Parisian culture. A nice way to keep up your French ability as well."
