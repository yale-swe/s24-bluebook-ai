    "ENAS 641 was a solid introduction to environmental engineering for graduate students who perhaps do not yet have experience in the field of environmental engineering. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it covers a lot of ground and provides a solid background for courses that we will take in future semesters.",
    "highly recommend the class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ENAS 641 to another student. It is very good graduate level course to acquire knowledge of biological processes and some of its applications. The work load is just perfect and the exams are equally manageable!",
    "Very informative, Jordan's a great prof., would recommend!",
    "A useful overview for anyone interested in environmental engineering or environmental microbiology.",
    "Good class, a lot of work, but provides an excellent overview of how biology is relevant to environmental engineering. Be prepared for long homework sets each week.",
    "A good course and it teaches you concepts and calculations regarding several common biological processes",
    "A good overall introduction to biological processes in the environment and treatment plants. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Interesting and useful class but can get complicated and stressful at times.",
    "I definitely will recommend this class. The class includes necessary fundamentals for an environmental engineer and scientist. Jordan does a great job in imparting the concepts.",
    "It is a great way to understand the biology behind water treatment. I would definitely recommend the course if someone is looking to work or study in water treatment facilities because it will help teach them the biological processes going on behind the engineering design.",
    "Good class if your interested in the math behind the biology. Some prior knowledge of Chemical engineering reactor design will make this course much more accessible",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone interested in biological processes as they specifically apply to environmental engineering. This was an useful and informative class."

   "comments": [
    "-Deepened my understanding of biological processes in engineering, particularly in emerging research with biofuels and genetic engineering -No impact to research\/dissertation",
    "This course gave me a good introduction to environmental engineering. I am coming to environmental engineering from another field, and this course helped me take knowledge from previous courses and apply them to this new area of study. The course didn't really contribute to my research, but helped me develop background knowledge for common questions and problems that environmental engineers face.",
    "I really liked the subject. It is a perfect graduate course to get the knowledge of the biological processes. I learnt few new basics like basics of genomics, etc. which I had never studied before which were very helpful.",
    "Significantly. Did not contribute much to dissertation or research. (Not particularly relevant, but required for department standards.)",
    "I definitely have a better understanding of environmental microbiology. I think the overview of biology techniques will be useful for my future research.",
    "This course was not super relevant for my research bet definitely helped me understand a broader scope of environmental engineering.",
    "This course provided me with a good background in microbial phenomena as they relate to engineering applications which will possibly be very important to my further work.",
    "I think this course will be quite relevant to my research. Gave a nice broad overview of many useful topics.",
    "I will probably not end up using this course specifically, but I still think it is valuable as an overall picture of what it going on in water treatment. So it may not contribute directly to my research, but I still think it is very important to have because I'm sure aspects of what I am doing will relate to the topic of this class.",
    "This course was actually extremely helpful my research! Biology was a piece of the engineering puzzle that I didn't know I was missing.",
    "This course contributed significantly to my knowledge of biological processes in engineered systems. The course did not contribute to my research."
