   "comments": [
    "Basic probability and statistics; the application of these statistical methods to inference testing and regression. Not a bad course, necessary for the econ major. Probably wouldn't take it otherwise though.",
    "Good class to take",
    "Yes- It's a good intro to the statistics used in economic research.",
    "take it if you're an econ major. if its possible, take it with a different professor.",
    "yes, i think the class helped me merge econ and math.",
    "Rough. The material is great and taught in conjunction with real life studies which provides a great introduction to the field. But, Yuichi is not skilled as a professor. The classes are deathly boring and his lectures incomprehensible. Unfortunately there are few other options for econ majors...",
    "Only take econ 131 if you're an econ major. Otherwise, take stat 100.",
    "Good class, not a gut, lectures are boring but the professor and TAs are good.",
    "Shop the other level 1 econometrics class, but this one isn't bad at all. Most people think it's easy. Be sure to use correct notation on the problem sets. I'd recommend it.",
    "Take it. Read the lecture notes!",
    "If you work hard, you'll do well. The tests are more conceptual than plug and chug, and are all about the lectures. You don't need to read the book. Professor Kitamura does his best to make the class fair, so it's not a class to stress out about.",
    "Take this course if you have to. It's actually fairly interesting once you take some time to learn the material, which is very very dry.The problem sets are not overly hard, and the exams (1 midterm 1 final) are really quite easy. Plus there is the typical generous econ curve of almost all As and Bs. Professor Kitamura is overall a nice guy, who will definitely make you laugh every once in a while. I don't know if there's a better class\/professor to take, but this one is definitely not that bad.",
    "Take it if you have to. Material is interesting, but lectures tend to be kind of dull. Hard to follow.",
    "Pretty interesting course with good incorporation of examples from famous economics studies. May feel a little fast-paced if you don't have a background in probability or statistics. The first half of the course is probability and basic statistics, and the second half is dedicated to regressions. The focus is on concepts, not proofs, so you will immediately see the material you learn in effect. Problem sets are quick, and notesheets are allowed for exams.",
    "Overall, I have mixed feelings about this class. I found the lectures unhelpful and often confusing, but after reading the textbook and going through the notes for the final exam I really appreciated all that I had learned. Yuichi is not a great lecturer, but he posts all of his slideshows on classesv2 and these turn out to be extremely helpful in understanding concepts. The material in this class is not difficult, so if you can find time to keep up with the work by reading the lecture slides and the textbook you will be more than okay for the midterm\/final. This class was also one of the most useful I have taken at Yale - you come away with a solid understanding of regression analysis, and I feel like I've developed a skill that will definitely be useful in future classes\/endeavors. I am really happy to have taken econometrics, although I am not sure how useful attending the lectures proved to be.",
    "If you're an econ major then there's no way around it. If you're really interested in econometrics then take it, otherwise I don't see why you would.",
    "only take it if you have to",
    "You have to take this class if you're an econ major. There is no reason to take this course, otherwise.",
    "Take it if you absolutely need to, but I would try to find a professor other than Kitamura. The material itself is not that difficult but he jumps around during lecture and makes it hard. Lecture is really boring and confusing. And I actually like econometrics as a subject.",
    "This is a very dry course. If you're looking at taking this course, I'm assuming that it's because you have to. There was a language barrier between the professor and the students, which made it quite difficult to understand the material. However, Professor Kitamura did his best to entertain and keep the class focused. In addition, the curve was extremely generous (something like 50% of the class gets A-'s and A's). If you take this class, you'll probably do well, but don't expect to understand the material all that well.",
    "Yuichi used a ridiculously generous curve for the class, which pretty much made it a cakewalk. Take the class with him if possible!",
    "A requirement if you're an econ major, which is probably most of the people taking the class. I wouldn't take it with Yuichi if you can avoid it \u0097 going to class was kind of painful. The textbook was pretty unclear too. But the material is straightforward once you actually review it on your own, and it's important stuff to know for future study in economics (how to use STATA to analyze large data sets, etc.).",
    "Oh my lord...the first half of this course is a crime against humanity. It takes a rare gift to make simple material more complicated, but this class accomplishes it. Problem sets and the final were not hard, and some of the TAs were great, but the lecture serves as worse then useless in understanding the textbook concepts. Unfortunately, you have to attend lecture to pick up some ideas that will be tested, but for everything else just work through the text. The student choice model needs to get a life.",
    "If you're an econ major, take it. Otherwise, some other statistics class would be more engaging and interesting.",
    "Don't take it with Kitamura. He's boring as fuck and uses sexually and racially charged case studies all semester to demonstrate the econometric methods. The only thing worthwhile about him are his lecture notes, otherwise the class is not even worth attending. The psets don't help you learn- rather they make you tinker a little with stata and be done. Wait it out, take it with someone that is at least conscious of the effects he has on his class.",
    "Take this class only if you need it for your major. Otherwise, it is not well taught. You will get much more from reading the textbooks and lecture notes posted online than from actually attending lecture.",
    "Exams have nothing to do with the problem sets, for the most part, so be careful if you don't go to class. The class isn't very hard once you get the foundations down. Work hard at the beginning and the end will be easy. The midterm tries to make you lose points based on whether you were listening in class; the final is easy.",
    "Very important and interesting stuff to know, I highly recommend taking this course if you're into econ or poli sci - it just helps you understand all the statistics you read! That said, it was an exercise in teaching myself - it was very hard to concentrate in lecture, and most TA's weren't too helpful. I'm glad I took it, but could be taught a LOT better.",
    "Yep it's useful and you need it for the major. Also, it's important because you learn to use a bit of STATA.",
    "Prof Kitamura was a dull and disorganized lecturer; the saving grace was that he was occasionally humorous and tried his best to keep classes light. Also the curve was more generous than the already generous Econ curve. I would not recommend this class if you have done any statistics before. Lectures were unfortunately hard to follow because he kept switching back and forth between theory and the case studies which motivated his discussion of the theory. You could also tell by the exams from past years that he had seriously dumbeddown the content covered in this class, and by now he was scraping the bottom of the barrel. If you are serious about economics at all, don't waste a term with Econ 131 - do yourself a favor and do 135 instead. And if you aren't serious about economics, why even bother with this class? Of course, if you're an econ major and need an easy 5th credit, this is the class for you.",
    "lovely",
    "DO NOT TAKE unless you absolutely have to",
    "you learn some practical skills and work with cool datasets but its not a fun course",
    "Worst class ever. The material is boring and the lectures are terrible. The only plus side about this course is that the material is actually pretty easy so despite learning nothing from lecture you can still do well.",
    "An awful experience. Yuichi is the worst teacher imaginable. The coursework was not too difficult, but it was boring, tedious, and frustrating from start to finish. I learned hardly anything. I would recommend, if you are an econ major, to take it with someone else or skip to metrics II",
    "mandatory for the econ major - very poorly structured",
    "Yes. The lectures are really slow-paced and hard to sit through, but lecture notes are very clear. The approach to the subject not rigorous at all.",
    "It's a required course for econ majors, but beyond that, the material contained in the class is important for anyone who is interested in economics, especially for reading economic papers. The course is really poorly taught, and as a rule out of principle I learn best by going to class and I could never imagine skipping even one class, but this is the first course where it was so poorly taught that it was really a waste of my time to go to lecture. The way the psets were set up did not help, since the first half of them are from the book and often were exactly like the examples, just with different figures. The second half is based on lecture notes, so just by looking at the slides that he posts online, it isn't too difficult to figure out how to do them. Please don't take it unless you're actually interested in the material!",
    "For an Econ major, you have to take this class. Professor Kitamura makes the exams much easier but as a result the curve is not forgiving. One bad exam and you can kiss goodbye to an A. You do a lot of topics and the problem sets don't really help when it comes to the exams. Exams are very conceptual and theoretical. A lot of people dropped after the midterm, because with the curve, even an 80 was bad. Thankfully, the Professor realized that the drops should be counted in the final curve as is the practice.",
    "This class is really awful. I'm not one to complain much (especially about the Econ core courses), but this is the worst class I've taken at Yale. Lectures are tedious and disorganized. But if you're considering this class, you most likely have to take it, so here's my advice: go to class, even though it sucks (many exam questions will come from material he only talked about in class and that isn't in the lecture slides), and look over the handwritten lecture slides after class (often you'll see that the overly complicated things he was talking about in class really aren't so bad...it'll make problem sets much better). The good news is that the tests really aren't that bad.",
    "Only take it if you have to with this professor. Otherwise avoid it at all costs.",
    "I would recommend only if you are an economics major.",
    "Honestly, I only recommend the course if you are an Econ major. You'll have to take it and if you do, try to have some statistics background before. The first midterm is basically a statistics test.",
    "yes, by all means",
    "It is helpful to know all these statistical techniques that we learn, however, it is a very boring, dry course that all economics majors must learn.",
    "Pretty boring, but also a requirement for the economics major. If you can put up with this, the econ major may be your thing.",
    "Econometrics I is not a bad class, at least not as bad as everyone seems to make it out to be. If you have any background in statistics, the first 8 weeks will seem like a lot of review, although it may actually move a bit quickly for people who haven't taken any statistics classes. After the midterm, however, things pick up, and I actually enjoyed the topics covered in class and saw how they could be applicable to real-life situations. Professor Kitamura is not bad and apparently better than some other professors who teach this class, though he can be disorganized and hard to understand at times. I thought he got better as the class went on. Problem sets and exams are fair and not too difficult (you get to make a formula sheet for the exams). There is really not too much work for this class, and learning STATA is a helpful bonus. Rich is a great TF if he's around.",
    "Only if you're an Econ major",
    "Take it ONLY if you're an econ major.",
    "A very badly taught intro to econometrics class. Very useful for further econ\/stat studies, the material was quite easy, but just not the best taught.",
    "If you already know statistics, this class is relatively easy but if not you might have a hard time because the class doesn't teach you the basics very well."
