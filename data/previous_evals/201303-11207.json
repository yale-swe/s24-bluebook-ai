    "If you are interested in aerospace and propulsion, take this class. It will definitely help if you took aerodynamics beforehand.",
    "This class is a good one if you want to understand basic concepts in propulsion. We spent most of the first half working with jet engines (like turbojet, and lots of turbofan) and then the second half of the class dealing with rockets and space trajectories. De la Mora does a decent job of presenting the material but it is still frequently difficult to understand the topics presented. The exams are not the easiest and problem sets are usually difficult to solve.",
    "It was a difficult class, but if you are interested in the material, it is worth taking it. The problem sets take a long amount of time, but are do-able. If you are willing to put in the time and effort for this class, it is worth taking it."
