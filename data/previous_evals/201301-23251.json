    "I highly recommend this course if you're interested in strengthening your writing while enjoying some room for creativity\/diversity of topics.",
    "Absolutely fantastic! If you like reading and\/or writing even a little bit, you will love this class. I learned so many things about how to read an essay more critically and about how to improve my writing. The teacher was great and the class discussions were always interesting!",
    "I would definitely recommend, especially if you need a writing credit and want a fun course.",
    "If you enjoy writing at all in general, take the class. The readings are interesting, and the class will help you establish good habits in your writing.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's a lot of work, but it will make you a better writer.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have a lot of time to dedicate to it. If you are taking too many other demanding classes, you will not get much out of it because you won't be able to put in the work on the writing.",
    "A great source of interesting readings and a great way to make yourself write."
