    "Generally yes, but we all really need at least two computer monitors if we are going to be making digital drawings as our primary means of production. I wrote this on my studio evaluation, but having one computer monitor to make digital drawings is like having a monitor-sized drawing board to make hand drawings.",
    "This class is set up in a strange way, where the building chosen (and often the original designer of that building) hold a lot of sway over how difficult the course is going to be. My suggestion would be to chose buildings that will be interesting but notimpossible to build in Revit, as the teams that I noticed having the most trouble succeeding in the course and with creating a positive group dynamic were the teams who had buildings with a lot of angled surfaces that made building them in Revit nearly impossible. I recognize that the instructors do not like ot think of this as a class on Revit, but it is in part, and that can't be ignored. Some people had twice the work of my team simply because we had a relatively straightforward building, this does not seam reasonable.",
    "The resources were adequate."
