    "No, No, No, No, No. Did I say no yet, No! Listen to this, this post-doc is worthless. Read his review on rate my professor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a complete academic disappointment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I should have read this before taking the class, but I only read it during reading period. I suffered. If you think you are in for an easy class, think again. He is a hard grader and does not even justify why you get poor grades. Run away from his classes. Do not take his Bollywood class or his theatre class, you will learn nothing. If you believe in God take a class with him, because it truly takes a miracle to get through. He is disrespectful to the work of students. The class matter itself is not bad, but the professor is so bad that I am not even interested in Indian theatre now. He is patronizing and immature. I can't believe I wasted a semester. Please heed this advice; there is no reason to take a class with Kedar Kulkarni. Please don't.The readings are somewhat good, but you have no historical background. And he never explains the readings. The midterm is easy but he grades them with merciless brutality. The final paper is also a headache because he offers little advice. The reading responses are a failure because you don't even know what you are writing. The discussions are bland. Honestly, by the end, no one even cared for the class and no one even did the readings. This because Kedar Kulkarni puts little effort in his class, he is busy with his girl friend and pottery. There was one class that was fun and the whole class was taught by guest speakers. I do not know what anyone will get out from his class.After reading all of this you might be that student who says \"oh, the topic is interesting, I will get through.\" No, you will not get through, you will hate the topic for the rest of your life.The Professor is a complete disappointment and the class is a complete disaster. Save yourself from trouble and take a better humanities class with a more reputed professor. It's Yale don't waste your time with this immature post-doc.",
    "NO! A BIG NO!Do you want to sit through class wondering what is going on or checking your facebook out of sheer boredom? Do you want to make random comments and just not care about a class? Do you want to come out a class feeling you have completely wasted a credit that could have been productive in so many ways? Do you want to suffer under the worst kind of Yale post doc ever? DO you want to be treated to a class that is nothing but an academic disappointment??? Do you really want to do this to yourself??Run from this guy, as far as you can. To whoever is thinking about taking his Bollywood class, beware! No matter how genial he sounds in Shopping Period, he stops caring after about three weeks in the class. At least, theater is his own subject, and even then he was this bad. I cant even imagine how it would be if he was talking about Bollywood here.No feedback, a random midterm and absolutely no attempt at fruitful class discussion. Worst class I have ever taken in my life!I still cannot believe a professor could be as nonchalant as that."
