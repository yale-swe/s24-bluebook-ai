    "The quality of each class really varied. The foundational readings (rose, harvey, etc.) were great but some of the later readings were duds, mostly the very specific, heavily detailed country-specific papers regarding places or industries many of us had no interest in.Also, it is unfair to expect students to lead 3 hrs of discussion. Very often students did an excellent job leading class. But equally often they did a crummy job, leading to three hours of lifeless or rambling discussion. The professor should be lecture more often and guide discussion much more thoroughly. When a student describes the material and leads class, how are we to know that we aren't getting the ideas totally wrong? I came here to learn from my professors first and my classmates second.Also it would be great to vary the style of content more. Maybe a short, narrative-based book to start the class off (e.g., Leopold's ghost). Maybe a short movie at the end. Just something to mix up the routine.",
    "The weekly journal responses definitely made for a heavier workload than other classes, but it also forced me to read more thoroughly and attentively than I did for my other courses."

    "The best things about this course were the readings and the final paper, which really allowed me to synthesize a lot of the ideas. Class discussions were also good, but not always as helpful.",
    "The readings, for the most part, were awesome. With the exception of a couple weeks, I really enjoyed all of them, and they greatly expanded my knowledge of and appreciation for the subject matter. Definitely some of the best readings I've had for any course -- well-chosen. And the subject itself was quite interesting too, of course."

    "Though it is a seminar, some lecturing would much improve the class. 3 hours of self-led discussion can be agonizing if the particular topic is not engaging, the readings were dull, or the discussion leaders are not on top of it. Even if the instructor gave the discussions a little more structure and was able to jump in when the students were running out of steam, to help keep the discussion afloat, we could have had a more productive class. Help directing the discussions, even though there are designated student leaders, might keep the conversation on more productive ground.More case studies would be nice, more incorporation of diverse readings (not only social science, perhaps some more popular media to compliment the academic readings). More incorporation of domestic issues would help bring some people more into the discussion.",
    "I think the class needs to be more structured. The student-run format worked some weeks, but during other weeks, when the topic at hand didn't capture people's interest or the readings were not particularly strong, the class kind of dragged. The format of simply saying what we thought of the readings definitely got monotonous. During the latter sessions, when students started being more creative and devising debates and mock negotiations, the class picked up a little; the instructor should do more to encourage that sort of creativity from the beginning. The class would also really benefit from more frequent lectures by the instructor. If every class was just introduced by, say, 20 minutes of lecture, and *then* we launched into discussion, we'd probably have more interesting conversations. As it happened, we were just a bunch of not-very-knowledgeable people talking about things we only sort of understood."

I expected to learn about how property rights could be used to effectively manage resources, but instead, the class was largely about all the ways in which property rights fail to secure (and at times even harm) the livelihoods of resource users. Since I want to be an equitable, effective practitioner of environmental management, being aware of the pitfalls of property rights is an important thing to know."
