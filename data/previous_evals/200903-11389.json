   "comments": [
    "You will learn the general principles of biology. There is a lot of work that must be done to do well on the tests because they are hard.",
    "Yes, most people who take this class have to take it. It's a hard intro course if you're not familiar with much biology. Take a lot of time going through your notes ad referencing the text. If you memorize concepts and details well you should do well in the class.",
    "Lots of memorization. Difficult because none of the tests are structured the same and because there are three different lecturers",
    "Take it if you have to for your major, but there are more interesting and better taught courses at Yale.",
    "The concepts you learn are not very difficult,but watch out for those tests!",
    "Decent class. Covers a lot of material. Carlson was an incredible lecturer, while the Slacks were just mediocre. Tests are sort of arbitrary - lots of random application questions and the T.A. grading is incredibly literal - hardly any \"partial credit\" points. Not fully recommended.",
    "I would not recommend this class.. it was boring.",
    "I would not take this class if you have taken AP Bio. The powerpoints make the class easy to study for but lectures can be tedious. The tests are long and unsatisfying.",
    "Don't take it unless you're premed and have to.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, if you are prepared to work hard and if you know a lot about Bio already. Otherwise it might deter you from taking Bio again.",
    "This class was well organized, but very fast paced. Oftentimes it was difficult to keep up with the readings on top of all your other classes because there readings for every lecture. But with enough work, this class is manageable and you do learn a lot. The three professors are all different and they give a nice change in the lecture style over the course of the semester.",
    "MCDB 120 is a great intro to biology. You should definitely take it if interested in the material or considering medical school. It can never hurt to go over the fundamentals again and some topics (especially in development and recombinant technologies) probably wouldn't have been covered in high school (even most AP classes).3 fair midterms, 1 long but fair cumulative final exam. Sections are thankfully optional.",
    "great intro to bio. take it. study hard. even though they say u dont have to read the book and that the tests focus on the lectures, read the book anyway. just study a lot. don't get overconfident. AND GO TO SECTION. This give out practice questions and some of them show up on the exam.",
    "It's not terribly hard and is a fine intro bio class. I would recommend it if you don't have an extensive background in biology and want to gain basic knowledge or just need a biology for pre-med",
    "MCDB 120 proved to me that I enjoy science and I definitely recommend it to other students. You get a good feel for several aspects of Biology and Prof. Carlson, the second lecturer, is really fantastic! It isn't necessarily an intro to bio class because it's flooded with pre-med students and kids who have either already taken biology in high school or even took the AP Bio exam and passed with flying colors, but were still in this class for some reason or other. They did mess up the curve unfortunately. But that said, as a student who had never really taken bio beforehand, it is possible to stay within or above the curve if you study hard enough. And the material became really interesting to me towards the second&third part of the curve so learning it was more enjoyable. Also, there are no problem sets and the exams are all lecture-based, so as long as you attend lecture, you should be fine. The exams and final were pretty fair (just be careful with Carol Slack's exam because it can be pretty long so keep track of time carefully!) and the book was a nice supplement to read after lectures to brush up on what was mentioned in class and go over anything you may not have understood. That said, attend section and the review sessions! I went to section weekly and it really helped. My TA was Justin Fendos and he was really great! He tried his best to get us through the exams and the course as painlessly as possible and really helped make sense of processes that got complicated or weren't explain coherently in lecture. Review sessions before exams were also extremely beneficial so go to those! Overall, I really enjoyed the class and what I learned and I think you should take it if you think you enjoy biology. The first part of the course might not be the best, but if you stick around long enough, you'll get to learn about some fascinating biological processes :)",
    "I would recommend this course. The part with professor Carlson was very fun and interesting. The other two sections of this course were interesting, but the first part was too basic and the final part repeated itself. The textbook was not very important, but I would definitely recommend going to section if possible.",
    "I would recommend someone take it if they took AP bio and didn't really learn alot. I had taken the AP for bio and got a 5 on it but didn't really learn as much bio as I felt I needed for upper level classes so I took this class and it was difficult but not extremely so. I would recommend someone take it only if they feel they want to get a deeper understanding of bio.",
    "It's a good introductory course in biology if you don't have much experience or need some refreshing. There is a lot of material but it is manageable if you stay on top of the lectures. John Carlson is by far the best professor and most engaging lecturer I've had.",
    "having taken ap bio before, this was a very easy course. out of the three lecturers, only frank carlson's section of the course is worth attending, he is awesome. otherwise, i would just use the time to looking at their lecture powerpoint online and reading the book. no hw, only three tests that werent hard so take it if you need science credit.",
    "A great science credit even if you aren't looking to be pre-med or a biology major. You will actually learn relevant information about the human body, disease, and the environment.",
    "It's basic bio. You spend a lot of time on organic molecules, organelles, the usual. If you already learned these things in high school, those parts of the class are pretty boring. However, you also spend a lot of time on things like viruses and actual development processes that I know I didn't learn much about in high school. If you want to learn high level bio, don't take it, but if you don't want to forget the stuff you may have encountered before, it's a good class for that.",
    "This is overall a good class. If you need to take an intro bio course, then this is probably where you would start if you don't have AP Bio. A large amount of students are upperclassmen and it makes me wonder if this is why there are so many mixed thoughts on the class. I was worried about this class when I first started taking it because a lot of my friends who had taken it as freshmen had found the curve to be hard and the material to be too extensive. The material really isn't too hard, and their experiences might just have been due to their freshman status. If you are a freshman taking this class, I think the best thing to do would just be to manage your time.Going to lecture is pretty good enough to learn most of the material. It doesn't hurt to read the book to cement the material and to put together the links that you might have missed in class. The book also has really great diagrams and illustrations...the text is almost worthless in comparison.I found section to be very helpful, but this depends on your TA and how much you've been following class and the lecture.There is very little work other than studying for the exams. Be careful, Prof. Bascom-Slack's tests tend to be very long. Prof. Carlson and Prof. Slack keep their tests to a more do-able length. However, they're long because there's a LOT of material. Memorization is not the way to go as you'll see in the tests when you run into fictional proteins that induce the growth of fire producing organs in firebreathing dragons.",
    "This was a great introduction to biology. Such a wide variety of biological subjects are covered, I really feel like I learned a lot. I liked the tri-semester teaching changes, too. Each professor had something new to bring to the table. Definitely take this class if you are wondering if you're in love with biology or not; you willknow for sure at the end of the semester.",
    "Difficult, interesting but develops one's ability to think logically and using scientific method.",
    "For most of you, you will have to take this class for the bio major\/pre-med, but I think this would even be an interesting class for a non-science major. It covers a surprising amount of breadth and depth for a semester course, including interesting topics like viruses, cancers, and DNA processes. Grading and tests are mostly fair, and I feel like I learned a lot. The only harm is that many AP\/IB Bio students took the course and killed the curve (IF THIS IS YOU DON'T DO THIS, YOU WILL KNOW EVERYTHING AND IT IS A JERKY THING TO DO). The 3 teacher approach is interesting, I personally liked all of them.",
    "I recommend this course to people interested in biology. It's not the greatest course in the world, but it's not too bad for a large intro bio lecture. If you've already taken AP Bio, I don't think you should waste your time with this course because the tests don't necessarily reflect your knowledge of biology and you can get unlucky and do poorly on the exams, so don't think you'll get an A just because you've taken AP bio before (although I guess it can help a lot; I've never actually taken AP bio before so I may be wrong).",
    "The class covers a ton of general biology. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot, and to cram a ton of information into your head before tests. Picking a good TA makes all the difference.",
    "This class teaches you the basics of the molecular, cellular and developmental biology and the tests are reasonable. The lecturers are decent with Carlson being the best but a love for biology really helps in being able to pay attention. It's not the best course I've taken but it's worth it if you want a review in Bio or need to learn the basics.Yes because since its an introduction course you probably don't have much other choice.",
    "MCBD 120 is not as bad as you think it is. I know that's not exactly a stellar recommendation, but, really, I walked into this class expecting to hate it and ended up really getting into some of the topics. The lectures are highly varied (but Professor Carlson's great!), but the textbook's interesting, and the workload is very light (no problem sets, but the tests are legit, so be prepared for a lot of studying).",
    "I would recommend this class if you need it for premed requirements or bio requirements. There is a lot of material but it is not too much work. By the end of the semester you will have learned a lot.",
    "It's not the best biology class I've ever taken, but you do learn material and it's required for the upper level courses.",
    "As an intro level bio course, this does not disappoint. However, if you consider yourself a bio person, spare yourself, and see if you can opt out and move up to take way more interesting higher level courses. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
    "The class is overall largely disorganized, and frustrating.The first third by Carol was a whirlwind of what I learned in high school, so that was okay. The second third taught by Carlson was together and well-taught. But studying for the test is frustrating because it was entirely dependent on your notes from the class. Having a bad day and not taking good notes is irreparable, because even friends' notes aren't completely clear to understand.The third part of the class taught by Frank was frustrating because he only emphasised the big picture, and would avoid having us learn any details. This was hard to study for too, because even understanding the concepts, you have to be able to write about them, and not miss any of the expected details.Most of the points I lost on exams in this class were thingsI absolutely knew, but just didn't think to write down for the questions on exams. This is the most frustrating part, because I feel like whatever grade I get will not reflect how much I learned. D:",
    "This is an interesting course with a not-to-difficult course load. The three teachers have different teaching methods and very different testing methods, which can prove trying at times. Still a good course overall.",
    "It's a pre-req for a lot, so most people don't have a choice. I wouldn't recommend it unless you had already taken AP Bio - too much material to cover in not enough time. Tests are hard.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone who has not 100% decided that they're pre-med. I really liked Bio walking into the class, and I was considering being pre-med, but after taking this class, I've lost a lot of interest in Bio. Most people in the class had already taken AP Bio, which put me at a major disadvantage.",
    "MCDB 120 is like AP Bio, but with less emphasis on memorization, and viewed from a perspective much less removed from the actual research. I would definitely recommend MCDB 120 to anyone interested in how people work at a microscopic level. I feel like this class has given me a solid footing that will help me to understand a wide range of fields within the life sciences.",
    "To fulfill the major and you do learn a lot about bio.",
    "Great introductory biology class. Interesting to take even if you don't have to for a distributional requirement or major requirement - gives a good overview of basic biology and goes into pretty interesting detail sometimes. It's taught by three professors over the course of the semester. Some are better than others, but they average out okay.",
    "MCDB 120 is the standard introductory biology course that introduces in three parts molecular, cellular and developmental biology. This course is neither the most demanding nor the most educational and stimulating of courses at Yale but it represents an enjoyable, straightforward easing in to biology classes. I recommend it for anyone who does not possess a stellar biology background. You can skip this class, particularly if you have taken AP, but you risk getting burned by bad curves and more experienced classmates later.",
    "This is a very interesting and straight-forward course. Specially if you have taken some kind of bio before, you\u00b4ll enjoy this course a lot without finding it too difficult. But don\u00b4t be too confident with your previous knowledge, and do the readings and, mostly, go to section. They really help to clarify.",
    "it's okay for an intro level bio course, if that's what youre looking for.",
    "Standard bio class. Try to place out of it with your AP\/IB test scores.",
    "Take it- it's a good class and a good overview of biology",
    "This intro bio class was great. You learn a ton of very interesting material over a very short amount of time. Carlson is a fantastic professor, as is Frank Slack. Carol's lectures are difficult if you haven't taken chemistry, though, so if you don't have to take it freshman year, perhaps you should wait until you're a sophomore.",
    "Good intro to bio for those who have not had AP bio in high school. The curve is very tough. Don't anything amazing from this intro class.",
    "It is a decent class, but you get a variety of teaching styles, which is sometimes frustrating. There is obviously a logical thread that goes between all three topics, but the class was presented in a way that made it seem like three distinct topics. Justin is a great TA, so look for him if he TA's again. Carlson is the best lecturer of the three.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need to do it for premed.None of the professors are particularly good, it's pretty boring, and the 3 midterm tests\/final are not easy.",
    "Tests can be kind of difficult. Overall, not a terribly difficult science course though.",
    "This is a good intro to cellular level biology. It's really not too bad; if you have an interest in biology and how the body works, it's a great one to take. We cover cell division, DNA replication, gene regulation, ATP synthesis, development, and a few other similar topics. Tests aren't terribly hard. If you're sufficiently interested in bio and looking for an Sc credit, it's not a bad choice.",
    "Don't take it. Avoid it like the plague.",
    "If you are considering taking this class, chances are that you are pre-med. I would not recommend this class for someone who is not a science person, but if you are, this course is great. This course provides a solid introduction to the basic concepts of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. This class is a little fragmented because it is taught by three professors with three distinct teaching styles, but if you have a good TA, you will always be able to understand the concepts.",
    "MCDB 120 is a very comprehensive overview. Expect a lot of breath, but not much depth. I thought the course was interesting; I'd recommend it. The text book is good, and not just supplementary, but necessary in order to do well in the class. Be prepared to work hard, and still have a lackluster outcome.",
    "Take it if you need to. Some of the material is interesting but the way it's taught is pretty boring...",
    "Take this course if you must complete a Biology requirement otherwise it's quite difficult and not worth your time.",
    "If you haven't taken bio before or haven't taken it for a while, it's a good class and will provide a good basis for other bio courses.",
    "Take this classs becaue you have to. Not particularly engaging, except for Carlson's section. The professors are a little bit nebulous about whether one should do the readings or not, but I think it is a must if you want to do well in this class.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 120 for a student who needs it for a requirement, or for someone who is interested in bio and wants a good introductory survey course.",
    "Big, broad class. Good introduction to biology if you didn't take it in high school. Prof. Carlson's section is very good; the other two are about average for these types of large science lectures.",
    "I would recocmend it for a pre-med requirement or if you need it for a pre-req for higher biologies, otherwise, you could probably find an easier, and more interesting science class in another department.",
    "It is a general introductory biology class. Nothing was studied overly in depth, but many topics were covered adequately.",
    "MCDB is a brief overview of some of the key concepts touched upon in AP Biology. I would recommend this course to those who are seeking a career in the sciences or express a general interest in the sciences. This course served as an excellent refresher of AP Biology for someone who is hoping to pursue either a pre-med \/ biomedical engineering track. If a student has a very firm grasp of biology, I would perhaps recommend him or her to place him or herself into a higher level biology course.",
    "This course is recommended to students who enjoy Biology and can handle understanding a lot of information in a short amount of time.",
    "It is a good introduction to MCDB. I would not take it if I were not premed or majoring in a science. The class is competitive. Make sure you shop TAs because there are several good ones who are very dedicated to their students. Be prepared to set aside a ton of time to memorize the concepts and details.",
    "Yes it's a great introductory course the subject matter isn't too complicated and it's interesting material",
    "If you haven't taken biology in a long time, the material is very interesting. However, the lectures are dull and unorganized, so if you can sit through them and pay attention, then you'll be golden.",
    "Do not take this class. Take a higher level biology class where you have a better chance of getting a higher grade. One TA explained that this course \"seeks to fail students\". There is no curve and while the tests are easy, the TAs take off points for absurd reasons. The only way to get some points back is to write an explanation for why you deserve more points for each question you got wrong. This class is a waste of time and successfully convinces people they may not be good at science even if they actually are.",
    "Its a good introduction, you often need it for other classes, and it's really not that hard. Treat it as a more difficult course than it really is, and you'll be fine.",
    "MCDB 120 is a very good, very thorough introductory biology course. If you've taken AP Bio and can place out of it, then DO SO, because the course will be very repetitive and waste your time; just take Molecular Biology or Cell Biology. But if you haven't taken AP Bio, then this is a great course--pretty easy, but a very thorough intro course.",
    "This is an interesting course. Even if you have some background in bio from high school, you will learn a lot. It's a lot of memorization, but the tests are fair overall. The section, although optional, was very helpful. There are no problem sets, just tests, so it wasnt too much work. The only shortcoming is that it felt a little fractured because it was taught by 3 different professors. Sometimes, notions that would have been useful for the first part of the course were not taught until the second or third parts.",
    "This was a very good class, but definitely take it if you are really interested in learning biology. This is not a class one should take if they are only interested in getting their science requirement out of the way. There are three professors that teach the class. The first one is not the best, but the other two professors are really good (especially the second one). The TA's and the sections are not incredably necessary, but they are very helpful if you do have any questions.",
    "yes, it's a great course to satisfy pre med recs",
    "I would not recommend this course, but I know that people have to take it, so this doesn't really matter. Overall, it is pretty disorganized and the lecturers were not engaging. I am not inspired to take more science classes, and that is too bad, because I came to Yale hoping to be a bio major.",
    "This class is very boring. The test quesitons often ask for miniscule details of the book that one rarely studies",
    "I would recommend this class, just be ready to do a lot of reading.",
    "Good course to take if you are new to bio. I barely remembered anything at all about bio, and hadn't taken any in 5 years, and I did okay. The biggest warning, though, is that this course is a pre-med magnet. Ugh. So even though the instructors do not make it difficult, they do.2 of the3 instructors go off powerpoints, so it is easy to follow along.NO HOMEWORK, and I didn't do any of the reading (the instructors only test on things from lecture, so the book\/reading is only meant to help clear up anything you get confused about. If you go to lectures and sections, and keep up with the course, you can probably avoid most reading)I would recommend it if you are new to bio, or at least interested in it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but it IS basic information that most MCDB majors need. If you've taken AP Bio, skip this waste.",
    "Since it is a pre-requisite for many other courses, get it out of the way as soon as possible. It is an okay course, Prof. Carlson is amazing so enjoy his section of the course.",
    "i think the problem is just that your grades are only made up of 3 midterms and a final. not ideal. there are no problem sets either which is nicebut at the same time those would be potential grade boosters...i personally didnt buy the textbook because it was expensive and people had said you dont really need it, since tests are based mostly on lecture. but i feel like for someone like me who didnt take AP bio in highschool, i was at a disadvantage. so as an afterthought i think reading the textbook wouldve been a great idea lol.carol is sometimes a confusing lecturer, she mixes up her words, and when someone asks a question she usually doesnt really answer it. she uses slide hand outs, and talks a little softly.john does not give handouts, doesnt really use slides, but he is an awesome lecturer. you just have to take good notes. sometimes his tone of voice doesnt change so you cant tell whats actually important. but other than that, not a big deal.frank is a strong lecturer but has an accent so sometimes you have to think twice about what he's saying, and then you miss the next thing he says. he also uses slide hand outs.i had jamie as a TA, she goes over the 50 min time limit every time! she's really nice, but tends to spend a lot of time just answering peoples questions that are irrelevant, or are things we dont actually have to know. her section handout sheets are VERY useful though! :)",
    "I would say, the testsare difficult because the professors write them differently. I would recommend it if your are going into a biology field or for pre-med.",
    "It is a fun class if you really enjoy biology. The information taught in the class was very interesting, I would just suggest reading the book before lecture in order to better understand the material, it will help alot when encountered with the specifics covered in the tests. Yes, I would recommend this class to other students because the information taught in this class is needed for higher level biology courses.",
    "This course was very interesting and useful for premed students.",
    "MCDB 120 is a fine introduction to biology, good if you're a bit rusty or didn't take college-level bio before. All three professors are great, and make lecture well worth going to. Be warned, however, that you do need to go to lecture (and read the related areas when there's something extra or unclear from lecture) because there is a _lot_ of ground to cover (and no 'warmup' quizzes or assignments to keep you involved\/prepared--just the three midterms and the final, unless you're doing the lab too).Finally, it's well worth taking just on scientific-literacy grounds: given the importance of biotech, even politically, it's useful or even required for a good citizen to know what stem cells are, how genetic engineering works, etc.",
    "MCDB 120 is a solid intro to biology. Look forward to Carlson's lectures!",
    "It seems to be a pretty standard intro course. Having three professors can either be nice or fragmented. Carlson was definitely the best lecturer. He can get kind of geeky sometimes, but it's so funny. Also, I thought it was nice how he switched his office hours every week to be more accommodating to students.To be honest, the assigned readings aren't even necessary to do well on the tests, so really think about whether you want to spend the money for the textbooks or not. For the same reason, the workload then is not too bad, either. You just need to study for the tests. The curve can be a tad tough, but it's all right. I would not recommend it, though, to someone who's just looking for a Sc credit since there are probably easier and more generally enjoyable ones out there."
