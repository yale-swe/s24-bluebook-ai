   "comments": [
    "It's a good course if you want to begin learning French. The workload is very manageable, but must be done on a very regular basis (be prepared for weekly tests, quizzes, and compositions)!",
    "If you need to fulfill your language distribution requirements, take Spanish instead. It's easier and more practical, and without the weekly tests.If you do have your hearts set on taking L1 French for God knows why, take it with Professor Fox, who at least made the entire ordeal bearable.",
    "Excellent course. You truly feel capable of speaking and writing basic French, which is very empowering after one semester. It requires a moderate amount of work [DO THE WORKBOOK], but it pays off.",
    "Not an easy course, but a wortwhile one. Very organized and rigorous. If you do the work, you WILL learn french.",
    "Really great class, good way to learn French in a short time. You'll work a lot but learn a lot too.",
    "French 110 is worth taking if you want to learn French and you are OK with devoting some time to doing so (and if you've taken a romance language before). It's different from the Spanish you learned in high school; instead of learning things bit by bit, you watch videos each week and have an \"experiential\" learning experience, which is definitely a weird adjustment to make. At the end of the semester you are relatively conversant in French, but not necessarily in all subjects. The weekly evening tests are annoying but, on the bright side, no single test or quiz ends up determining your grade because there are so many of them."
