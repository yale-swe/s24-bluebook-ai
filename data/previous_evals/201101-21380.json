The course is particularly valuable because it shows how statistics may be useful for those not necessarily \"quant\" minded. Vida's a great teacher, and the material great for all.",

    "helped me learn useful statistical models.",
    "This course really opened my eyes to some of the possibilities in statistical modeling. Specifically it forced me to really value statistics as a tool in our discipline, and also stir my imagination for possible projects in the future.",
    "I enjoyed working through the published papers in the final semester but felt like the first semester was not helpful or relevant to the complex work being done in the field. I do not plan on pursuing statistical methods, though I see the value in learning the methodology. In fact, I think the second semester is the more important material to learn for all first year students. But having a full-year course can be overwhelming and disengaging for burnt out students who would otherwise be engaged with the material."
