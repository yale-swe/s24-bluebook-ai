   "comments": [
    "Interesting survey of Spanish culture. Professor Estrella presides over a very chill classroom. If you've reached L5 and want a low-stress but satisfying way of getting a language class out of the way, this is for you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Cultures of Spain is interesting in the sense that it is semi-philosophical and historical at the same time. In a way you learn of the country's history through it's people, artists, writers and politicians, rather than through a traditional linear manner.",
    "Good, easygoing class. You'll probably get more out of it if you do all the readings, even the articles, though these don't number very many. It's minimal work and very little structure. It's kind of intimidating to speak in class if you're non-native and kind of shy, but go for it! I wish I had. Not that much work except when we had to read a long novel over Spring Break. Don't leave readings to very late at night, or you'll just not do it.",
    "Interesting topics, great teacher, fun class! I definitely recommend!",
    "Spanish 246 is an interesting course; I would recommend it to students looking for class discussion on Spanish culture and politics, but students who need structure and a clear, defined syllabus should probably not take this course.",
    "Take this class only if you are desperate for a fifth class. There are far better Spanish classes out there, where you will actually be able to keep up your Spanish speaking skills. I had finished my language requirement but I wanted to continue with Spanish just to hone my speaking skills, even beyond Advanced Conversational. This is NOT the class to practice your Spanish. Expect lectures without discussion and completely irrelevant reading assignments--if the class structure remains the way it is, you could easily get by without ever opening the course packet, or even the two novels. DON'T expect to be given any feedback whatsoever throughout the entire course. My grade right now is an absolute mystery, and it feels totally subjective. Professor Estrella is an interesting lecturer, and I had previously heard great things about him, but I truly felt like he didn't care this semester. Maybe it was an off semester for him? All I know is that, save for a few interesting tidbits I learned about Spanish history, this class was just not worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for someone who is looking to retain their Spanish. Especially comprehension abilities (i.e. reading and listening). Unless you raise your hand all the time and speak in class your speaking abilities won't improve all that much. Grammar is not emphasized very much in the class either. But overall, it definitely helped to retain my Spanish abilities overall.",
    "If you're looking for a class that debunks the myths of a perfect Spain, take Professor Estrella's class. I learned so much--all the way from literature to politics to pop culture!"
