   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to agent-based modeling, and a fun coding class if you don't have much background. The content is not very similar to other Psychology classes you will have taken. Some of the problem sets are very easy, and others are quite time consuming. Overall, a fun and informative class.",
    "Yes definitely recommended for anyone interested in society, economics, medicine, news, etc. It will definitely open up a new way to approach thinking about societal issues and how to solve them.",
    "Yes! Definitely a really interesting class and one unlike any that I've ever taken before. If you have any interest in social psychology and have some programming background, I very much recommend it. Ours was the first year of the course, so there were some kinks to work out, but Dave is a great professor and was very willing to take our feedback into account, so I'm sure that it will be even better next year! That being said, I would not take this class unless you have at least taken Intro Programming or have some experience programming in Matlab. While the programming isn't too difficult, having no background in coding would be a huge disadvantage.",
    "PSYC 320 is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale - it stands at a fascinating intersection of psychology and programming, taking complex questions of social interaction and evolutionary dynamics, and turning them into illustrative models. These models allow you to test your intuitions, which often turn out to be false. This reveals interesting insights on these topics that you would not have discovered without the models. Dave does an incredible job teaching the course and explaining the models. I could not more highly recomend the class.",
    "This class was a very interactive seminar, using MATLAB to create formal models investigating various social dynamics. There is a coding problem set each week (quite manageable, but I had previous MATLAB going into the class). In lecture, Dave reviews the previous week's pset and teaches on a new topic. There is a creative final project in which you design a model of your own. Overall, a cool opportunity to learn a research technique that you wouldn't really encounter anywhere else!"
