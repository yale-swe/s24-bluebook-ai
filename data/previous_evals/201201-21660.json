   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any student that is interested in Foreign Affairs and wants to draw from classical texts. The texts read in this class apply to much more than IR but the syllabus is designed to follow IR thought over time.",
    "There is a lot of reading, and the wok you have to do for the in-class presentations is extensive, but if you are interested in international relations it will give you an excellent background.",
    "Great class, especially the second half. Prof. Russett knows so much; it's super cool just to hear him talk about things.",
    "PLSC 169 is a fun class. We had a total of 5 students in the class, so naturally it was very easy to get into discussion. There were also awkward silences during which everyone just stared at each other, but that's okay, if you're okay with that. This class covers international relations theory, which is very interesting and important for understanding how we are to view other nations, although at times the relevance of IR theory might not make itself too evident. Some of the earlier people you read (e.g. Hobbes, Machiavelli) were political philosophers so at times it feels like kind of a stretch to figure out what they would have said about IR. Class discussions and exams (which aren't that difficult) can be rather vague, but I do think you get as much of it as you put it. Also Prof Russett is really nice and adorable and super cool - he leans back in his chair all the time and I think he rides a bike to work. Take it, you'll have fun and it'll really grow on you."
