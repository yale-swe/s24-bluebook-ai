    "A really good continuation to Italian 110. It was well taught and the language is really fun to learn. There was more of an emphasis on culture this semester (film, food) which made the class enjoyable. Definitely take this if you're looking to continue your italian language studies.",
    "Italian is a good language to learn, especially if you plan on applying to the Sienna program. Make sure you get a good teacher because sometimes they are hit and miss. Also, if you are like me and don't like waking up in the morning then taking a 9:25 class is just about the worst idea there is. My second semester 10:30 class was heaven compared to my first semester 9:20 class",
    "Really fun. Anna is awesome, the sweetest teacher ever so definitely take it with her if you can! My Italian improved a ton since L1",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian 120 03 for another student. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and is extremely interesting and rewarding.",
    "It is a great class that will make you fall in love with italian language and culture. I would recommend this class to anyone who needs to take a language."
