   "comments": [
    "ENGL 114 is a great foundation writing class. It will force you to be more intentional about how you start, revise, and polish essays. I would definitely recommend the class as a means to get your writing to a college level (even if you already think it's there). It's one of the only classes in which a professor will review a draft and offer advice, which is incredibly helpful because it allows you to see what you tend to do wrong in your writing.",
    "Power, Persuasion, and Paranoia is an excellent class. The subject matter is excellent, and as a whole I greatly improved as a writer. Take it!",
    "If you are at all unsure about your english writing skills, take this course!",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student who is looking to improve his or her writing. If you had a fairly good foundation of high school English courses and writing experience, some of the skills emphasized, like removing the passive voice and stream-lining prose, may be review. However, I found that even though I was fairly careful to avoid passive voice and wordiness in my first drafts, there was always room to improve for the final drafts. I appreciated the constant reminders to revise and read my drafts out loud, something I had never done in high school. As the semester went on, I noticed that I had an easier time writing high-quality essays for my other classes. I think this course is one that will serve me well for the rest of my college career, so I highly recommend it to another student who wants to do intensive work getting his or her writing to a level that will help them succeed at Yale.",
    "ENGL 114 12 is a wonderful class that teaches students how to write in a very interesting way. The readings are a very interesting and historical look into paranoia throughout history. I would definitely recommend this class to students who are looking for an intro writing class because the subject material is very interesting. Professor Silverman is great and you will learn skills that will help you throughout your college career."
