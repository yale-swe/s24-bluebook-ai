   "comments": [
    "Proper engagement with book reviews and Op-eds, along with deep analysis of human rights and feminist theories.",
    "learned a ton more about the theory and major thoughts that drive sexuality, gender, health and human rights issues learned more about the structure and organization of the UN and other bodies involved with human rights charges",
    "Hadn't been exposed to the complexity of the UN human rights system before this course and learned a great deal. Also improved writing skills due to the range of writing assignments -- enjoyed the narrow focus of the small writing assignments and being able to explore a topic of interest for the final paper.",
    "I learned to ask larger questions about sexual and reproductive health. I had never examined sexual and reproductive health outside of the clinical context and this class was extremely enlightening in that way."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the hybrid approach of the professor: half lecture\/half group discussion (seminar)",
    "Good size, Ali is an incredible professor, all the readings are incredibly well-curated i wish class discussions had included more voices",
    "Strengths: Loved that people from so many different disciplines were able to contribute their thoughts to the discussion; thought the small break out groups, especially when discussing the assignments, was particularly helpful to see how everyone's disciplines translated to the seminar. Weaknesses: Sometimes there were just so many readings that we only were able to discuss a few elements\/documents each class.",
    "Overall, this course was extremely interesting and the readings incited several fascinating discussions. I do think, however, that the number of readings could have been narrowed down so that class discussions focused more on a few specific readings we could delve into, rather than a broad strokes overview of several readings. I also think that while the class discussions were interesting, they often went off topic to the point where the theme or lesson from each class discussion often got lost."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - thorough insight to human rights as it pertains to gender, sexuality, and health.",
    "Yes! It was a great class!",
    "This is a verrrry reading heavy course - the readings are very interesting but can be dense and hard to manage with other the workload of other classes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Taking it as one of the few undergrads, I really gained a much deeper understanding of sexuality and human rights system compared to other Yale College courses that I've taken. Would definitely recommend having some sense of background in any of the class concepts to contribute to discussion.",
    "If you're interested in sexuality and gender from the humanities\/legal perspective, this is absolutely the course to take. Ali Miller is extremely knowledgeable and brings an enormous amount of passion, insight, and experience to global discussions of sexual and reproductive health. Overall, LOTS of reading, but a very interesting, worthwhile, and unique class."
