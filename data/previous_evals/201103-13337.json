    "It had some good readings and the one big research paper wasn't too bad.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning about how food is produced in our country. Be ready to end up with a very specific take on food policy (though probably correct). It is an English class but I definitely learned more about food policy than I did English. Three 4-5 pg papers and one 8-10 pg research paper sounds like a lot, but it's really not difficult to finish the research paper because it's broken into lots of stages and the other papers have rough drafts. Speak to her about your essays before they are due! She is very helpful.",
    "Very great course to help with your writing. However, the course works even better when you are interested in food advocacy and environmental awareness. You learn how to write a research paper as well as accurately analyze data of multiple types of sources without plagiarizing.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Stuart is marvellous - highly approachable, very engaged and up to date on food policy and well informed.The work load is what you choose to make it. I became deeply involved in my research paper, and chose to spend significant amounts of time on it. There is also great flexibility to chose what you want to study. Food Policy is such a wide ranging topic, anyone from economists, to activists to environmentalists can find their niche in this class.Be prepared to learn a lot about research methods and about how Yale's incredible library system works.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone who truly wants to improve their writing - you should take at least one intro English class in your Yale career and this is not a bad choice.",
    "Solid introduction course to research at Yale. While some readings are dense, most are actually very interesting. Grading seems a bit arbitrary at times. Professor Stuart does however offer extensions for essays and assignments. Take it if you are genuinely interested in food policy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in improving their writing, especially if you are interested in Food Policy.",
    "English 114 18 is a great introductory academic writing course. The topic is very interesting and Professor Stuart does a great job leading her students through the research process. The class blog is a great way for students to discuss the reading; however, much class time revolves around this which can be tedious.",
    "I highly recommend this course, even if you don't know anything about food policy.",
    "Food Policy is, without a doubt, extremely relevant to current Food Policy legislation. The class in itself is replete with interesting (and polarizing) discussion. Since the playing field is so large, the research paper-one of the highlights of English 114-allows you to tap into your own curiosities to tailor the class to what you want it to be. If I could take it again, I would, knowing fully well that the class would be almost entirely different, yet more relevant to such changing times.",
    "If you're choosing an English seminar, Food Policy is a pretty interesting one to take, and Prof. Stuart is a great prof.The English seminar felt as though we were learning about the topic (food policy) in order to have something to write about, which made writing about it less interesting. Food policy was a relatively good topic, though, since it was conducive to writing about both concrete topics (such as policy and pragmatics) and philosophical topics (such as discussions about rights). The research process was too structured for me; I have written research papers before that turned out well, but I felt too constrained since, for example, I had to find 4 books, 3 magazine articles, etc., even if I didn't need more sources. Having deadlines for the first 2 pgs, 5 pgs, etc. of the research paper was helpful. The class discussions were interesting (the class always went by quickly, even when I was really tired), and they aided me in developing my ideas for the essays (I never really had trouble figuring out what to write about). Overall a good course, but not the best I've taken (or plan to take) at Yale.Prof. Stuart is great! She really knows her stuff and presents it very well. She's comfortable in front of the class, she can really connect with students, and she acknowledges the challenges faced by those undergoing their first semester at Yale. She gave time to really evaluate my writing to give my specific recommendations to improve my research, writing, revising, and idea-formulating. She fosters a great class atmosphere that made the class overall very enjoyable. She also doesn't grade too harshly, and she gives you the breakdown of the rationale for the grades she gives. Only problem i had was that she gave me a lower grade than I had hoped on one paper because she said I needed to cite a simple, well-known economics model, yet she admitted that she doesn't know much about economics.",
    "If you were writing academic papers in high school, this class is a review, and I would say only take it if you need a refresher or want to be absolutely sure of your writing skills. If you weren't writing similar papers in high school, absolutely take this class.",
    "It's a fun class on an interesting subject."
