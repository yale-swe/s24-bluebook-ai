   "comments": [
    "I think that I gained a lot from the course, especially in terms of reading academic papers and finding key information.",
    "I learned more about developing countries and the things they struggle with in developing political institutions.",
    "I learned about certain challenges in forming and consolidating young democracies and the literature around that challenge. I became familiar with different types of political science studies and theories.",
    "This course was a great way to learn more about the challenges that young democracies face in the world. It fits the description and provides a detailed and nuanced view of these challenges from a variety of contexts!",
    "I learned so much about the problems young democracies face and potential ways to resolve them. I love this class!",
    "Taking this course gave me an insight into the unique obstacles that young democracies routinely face in their developments. This class helped me learn to understand how survey and study data can allow scholars to paint a picture of trends within democracies, such as corruption and voter turnout. The information in this class was relevant not only to understanding young democracies, but the political process in general.",
    "I learned to understand political issues and major barriers that prevent democracies from stabilizing in many countries around the world. Through reading and in-class discussion, you really understand the nature of politics in a diverse array of countries. The class also employs a lot of discussion of statistical studies and field experiments, which teaches you to qualitatively interpret quantitative data.",
    "We learned about the challenges countries face as they consolidate into young democracies.",
    "I learned about the various challenges that young democracies face through multiple case studies, mostly focused in Africa and Latin America.",
    "This class taught me to read large bodies of text and extract something from them. I learned about the challenges facing young democracies, mostly in Latin American and in Africa, from a variety of academic papers. We also got some experience with policy design\/thinking about solutions.",
    "Reading various types of graphs and tables, understanding how development research actually works and learning how to think critically about political challenges.",
    "I learned a lot about the complicated challenges of democracies emerging from autocracies and sustaining themselves.",
    "This course taught me how to consume social science research, and how to evaluate it. I, of course, learned about the many challenges facing young democracies, and the various things that are needed to consolidate them. I enhanced my presentation skills, and learned how to contribute to group discussions.",
    "Challenges of Young Democracies was a wonderful course in that it teaches you how to think through many different models and papers, applying them to real-world themes that make up Democracies. In other words, you apply what you learn from papers\/experimental models to combat some of the pitfalls that democracies face.",
    "I learned a lot about political science and how to approach its research papers and questions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes it was a bit monotonous as all we would do in class is go over the papers. I did however think the group projects were great.",
    "There were too many readings, it needs to be more geared to teaching the students what needs to be covered rather than an insane amount of readings.",
    "The readings were long and included complicated statistical analysis that many of the students were unfamiliar with. But the exams were very fair and did not require a knowledge of those statistics.",
    "I really enjoyed how the course was centered around the readings. In many other classes it feels that readings are often swept to the side so it was great that readings were central to class discussions.",
    "This class had a perfect structure. We were expected to read all the readings, and all of the readings were discussed during class in a small lecture that felt almost lie a seminar since participation was so important. The class was very fair, with participation counting and actually being assessed accurately, a group presentation, and midterm and final that had very fair questions. I honestly can't think of any changes I'd want to make.",
    "I believe the strength of this course lies in the in-class discussions, as these allowed us to reinforce knowledge gained from the readings and make connections between different topics we covered over the course. One possible area of improvement could've been the nature of the readings. They were almost always studies based on some sort of experiment; while helpful, I feel that other sources of information could also have been of use.",
    "The strengths of this class are the in-class discussion and Ana De La O's lecturing, which is fantastic (she explains concepts really really well). A weakness of this course, however, is organization -- she'll designate 4 50+ page readings for a week, but not tell us which one she is going through on which day of the class, making it incredibly difficult to have all of them done for the right day. I also think the grading of the participation grades and attendance are somewhat problematic, as the TF and professor don't know all the students names and therefore do not grade correctly sometimes.",
    "Lecture is really interesting and engaging. However, the professor doest really tell you which reading are due which day so students re often confused on what studies they should be reading and find themselves confused in class because they did the wrong one.",
    "Strengths: You get a comprehensive understanding of young democracies, since the course often requires you to compare and contrast different democratic systems. Weaknesses: The lectures were almost exclusively devoted to going over and explaining the readings, which were often long papers containing high-level econometrics and statistics. Instead of taking a tally on each students class participation and attendance, I wish that the course had encouraged student participation by using class time for genuine discussion and debate.",
    "I liked this course because it was my first political science course, so it opened me up to issues that I was not aware of and the discussions let me listen to upperclassmen that are better read in the subject. It bothered me that the actual classes were so based on analyzing graphs and charts because they flew over my head and I probably could have gotten more out of the class had I understood them.",
    "It was a bit repetitive in terms of the overall structure of the class, which can be good because you know what to expect.",
    "I really enjoyed the low stress and low workload of the class. The \"leminar\" style (lecture with a seminar feel) was great because I felt actively a part of the class, but did not feel too much pressure to speak up if I didn't want to. The readings are very interesting, but you need to do all of them to do well. Participation is big in this class, and the exams are based on the readings. But the readings are very manageable! Professor De La O is a great speaker and always engages her audience. You do learn a lot, you have an opportunity to work on a group project, and the hour and fifteen minutes go by quickly.",
    "Strengths: This course requires you to engage with the readings, which is nice because often courses assign reading without leaving you with a sense of purpose as to why you are reading them. Professor De La O is a very engaging teacher and wants to give everyone the opportunity to share their thoughts. Weaknesses: The exams in this course were frustrating at times, because I felt like I was being tested on ultra-minute knowledge from the readings, rather than my broader understandings of the main ideas.",
    "The course was very interesting and the texts supplemented the class nicely. A strength was the class participation, which contributed a lot of interesting comments. However, its strength was sometimes the weakness. Sometimes comments were not really insightful and some classes felt like an extensive, unproductive discussion section rather than lecture."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I think it's definitely interesting as a course and I would recommend it to other global affairs majors on the development track.",
    "Yes, it is an easy class about great subject material, very interesting. The professor is fantastic and knows how to cover the material well, allowing debate in class over the topics.",
    "Yes, I recommend the course for anyone who wants to read more political science studies and empirical research. A background in statistics is helpful though.",
    "Take this class! Professor De La O is amazing! Class discussions are shaped around the readings. It's more of a seminar than a lecture so be prepared to participate but overall a pleasure to take the course!",
    "Amazing class! Learned so much and it gives you a lot of perspective on how politics works in young democracies. Prof. De La O is very fair and as long as you do the readings and participate (actually talk at least once or twice per class because they really keep track of it and participation is worth 20%) you are going to do well.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in politics or global affairs. I feel like prior knowledge of these topics would be helpful, but that should not deter anyone from taking the course. This class was an excellent way to get acquainted with the problems facing the developing world. The lessons from this class are applicable and not the sort of knowledge that becomes irrelevant outside of a classroom environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are comfortable with heavy reading assignments or interested in becoming more comfortable with heavy reading assignments, given the reading-oriented nature of the course. If you are able to deal with this (or comfortable with trying to find study guides or work with others to overcome not completing the readings), you will learn a lot about understanding the political nature of democracy and its many iterations.",
    "Yes, I learned so much in this class and the workload is really low. You just have to do the readings, participate in class, put a small presentation together and you're gucci.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you enjoy a more statistical approach to analyzing and learning about political systems. If not, you may not find the readings or the lectures enjoyable.",
    "Yes, especially for Global Affairs people. It was more reading than I thought it would be, but a lot of it is experiment design which is technical and you can skip over. However, I never understood what Professor De La O was asking for on the tests, and I don't know how consistently they were graded between students.",
    "Overall this was an engaging lecture where students were able to participate. Each week we read long case studies\/reports of research and experimental designs that had been carried out. In each lecture the professor spoke about these issues. One midterm, a final, and a group presentation. I found it hard to study for her type of tests and wasn't really sure what she wanted from us in terms of a complete answer (each test had 4 essay questions).",
    "Yes, take the class! The workload is light and you learn so many interesting facts and dimensions about democracies around the world.",
    "Interesting at times but many flaws. The class is structured around challenges of young democracies and uses research papers to illuminate these challenges. However, the research papers are rarely connected to one another. Worst of all there's a major participation grade for a very large class, and so students are constantly raising their hands just for the sake of their grade (and not contributing much to a discussion). The final was very, very specific and basically tested whether or not you read 4 research papers (out of thirty or so) rather than larger themes.",
    "Yes! It looks at Global Affairs from a research-oriented perspective, but allows you to think outside of the box in class discussions. It was interesting and I enjoyed each lecture.",
    "I would recommend Challenges of Young Democracies to those looking for a thought-provoking, applicable political science and global class. It really helps in not only understanding political institutions of young democracies but also, how to evaluate and fix non-democracies as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a background in political science. Otherwise, the start can be a little difficult o adjust to."
