    "It is a class that covers two very different areas: political theories of international relations and details of weapons development. It ties the two together, using the examples to highlight problems with international relations theories. The class isn't too difficult, and can be interesting, but reading is often not worth the effort.",
    "Great class that covers a lot of historic\/theoretical topics related to American Foreign Policy. Take the class for DeCanio though, his commentary is beautiful.",
    "The course is a really interesting look into American foreign policy and the theories of international relations (realism, neorealism, etc.) that can explain how and why states act the way they do towards\/with other nations. You talk a lot about past military events and current events, which allows you to discuss what should have been done and what could be done. The seminars on tanks and the evolution of weaponry were particularly fun. Also, Professor DeCanio is one of the best professors at Yale, and he seems to love the material, so that's a major plus. I would definitely recommend this class."
