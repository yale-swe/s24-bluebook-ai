   "comments": [
    "I would take it as a language requirement if you can, it is nice to finally be able to read real Latin text. Makes L1 and L2 worth it.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who has a fairly solid grasp of Latin grammar and vocabulary and wants to get experience with some \"real\" Latin. everyone taking Latin should at least take it through this level.",
    "I would recommend the class if you have any interest in Ancient Rome and in Latin.",
    "This course was an easy introduction to classical prose from the works of Caesar, one of the easiest-to-read Latin authors. I would recommend this course to a student looking to improve their Latin reading skills without taking on a big workload.",
    "Nice to actually read latin text",
    "Jay Fisher is a total boss who reads 17 languages (not an exaggeration, actually seventeen) and isn't afraid to stray from the course material to teach his students a real life lesson or interesting story beyond Latin. He's tough on the outside, but is really a big softie who cares about his students and grades them nicely. Taking a class with Jay Fisher is an absolute treat, and you should be sure to do it if you're interested in doing any classics at Yale.In terms of the class itself, it's intermediate Latin. Basically what it says on the tin. Less attention to grammatical detail than L1-L2, more emphasis on comprehending the general idea of passages from a single real classical text.",
    "Definitely take this course if you need it or just want to learn Latin.",
    "Like most intermediate Latin prose courses:1. Just reading, no speaking or listening or composition2. No new grammar, only reviews of grammar occasioned by the text3. Relatedly, just reading sequentially through a single text, not jumping from excerpt to excerpt, nor reading from a grammar textbook.",
    "Great to take if you didn't make it to L5 in high school. Caesar is not hard but is still good practice for grammar and gives some new vocabulary. Also, regular as he is, there are four-line sentences here and there; so it doesn't get boring.",
    "Great class. Exactly what you need for your first attempt at reading large amounts of Latin prose."
