    "This was a great course. I learned about a breadth of different topics that I greatly enjoyed learning about. I didn't think that I would have ever understood the housing crisis had it not been for the fact that I took this course.",
    "The Seminar is an interesting lesson in real estate investment and the history of property rights. The guest speakers also provided some unique perspectives of the politics, economics, and social implications of property.",
    "I'm interested in real estate, and I loved this class. It's a great mix of history, property rights theory, and commercial real estate application.",
    "First third is a history of private property and study of the philosophy behind it. The rest is practical applications of finance, with a special emphasis on the recent housing meltdown. I would recommend it highly if Yale is lucky enough to have Mr. Powers teach again. Great course! I learned more practical information than I have in any other course at Yale. I definitely will think twice before I take out a mortgage.",
    "CSBR 260 covers many different and often unrelated topics in the field of real estate. It starts off in philosophy and readings of the sort and later evolves into a more business oriented approach containing some law as well. Mr. Powers is very knowledgeable and involved in the course but he is also very demanding. What I really appreciated about this class was how Mr. Powers managed to get so many people with different roles in real estate come to our class and talk about a past residential project, an eminent domain lawsuit or how to revive a city's downtown with concrete examples. It was great to get to speak to so many professionals in the filed.This is Mr. Power's first experience teaching so there are some things that could have been better. The two hour seminar can be long as the material is sometimes dry and often the class lacked energy. Mr. Power's isn't always the most engaging class leader although this didn't really matter for half of the classes because we had guest speakers who took over.I would recommend this class only if you have a real interest in real estate.",
    "Great class"
