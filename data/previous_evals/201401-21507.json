   "comments": [
    "Mostly history, contemporary topics are mostly covered in section. I would recommend as a general introduction to Chinese political history, although I will say that nothing is very in-depth in this course aside from examinations through simulations in section.",
    "Interesting material, very little work. A great class to take credit D.",
    "Pretty poor class to be honest. Not sure how much I learned",
    "Very basic, worth it if you need an easy credit or have no prior knowledge of Chinese history and politics",
    "This class was pretty good, but I would only recommend it to someone interested in getting a broad overview of Chinese politics.",
    "Yes! Because you'll learn so much modern Chinese history as it relates to current politics.",
    "This class is a good introduction to China in an IR context.",
    "Great class. Thing is, most intro-China classes all cover the same stuff. Not too work-intensive, but it was enjoyable, especially as a second semester senior.",
    "If you are interested in China's modern political history and the current political issues the class would be worth taking. If you aren't interested its not worth it. Lectures were pretty dry and less than half of the class typically attended. The conflict simulations in section were fun. And overall the workload and difficulty of the class was not a lot.",
    "Recommend this course",
    "I would recommend it because the information is key in understanding current events and why China acts the way it does on the international stage. If you have any interest in international relations, this will be very useful.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in getting a survey on all things China, certainly take this course. It is reasonable amount of work and very informative.",
    "I learned a lot in this class. I thought the material was well-presented and made it easy to cover a lot of material and still understand how it all related to current events. My only problem with the class was section. Section was often incredibly boring. Additionally, the TA did not seem able to explain what was expected in the policy memos. I think the course overall was great but the assignments and grading criteria should be made more clear.",
    "I would recommend this course. The course is very accessible to a wide variety of people, both with and without a China background. Professor Weiss's lectures are engaging and interesting and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Very good grasp of why China behaves the way it does on the international scene",
    "Good intro to Chinese politics\/foreign policy, would recommend if you're interested in China, political science, or current events.",
    "I don't really recommend it if you're actually into China. It's a really broad overview of a lot of issues, but it largely fails to achieve depth in any one of them. The simulations are fun and interesting - and it's almost no work except for the response papers. Not the worst class I've taken here, but not very good either.",
    "A broad yet informative overview of Chinese history, foreign relations, and domestic politics. It is a great course for someone who wants to get a basic understanding of the country and its recent past. Lectures are consistently good. The material allows students to really engage in contemporary policy debates.",
    "A class with amazing lectures but bad assignments. If you are into writing policy memos, take this class. If you are not, I'd recommend a Chinese anthropology class instead.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in China or politics.",
    "Don't take it if you already know a significant amount about China. It is a good intro course to the country.",
    "PLSC 179 is a good survey intro course to China's politics and gives you a good background.",
    "Not sure. The course was oddly organized in terms of assignments (role-playing memos) and debates. Moderately interesting material. If you're well-read on Chinese foreign affairs and SE Asia, most of the course will be redundant. On the other hand, the readings were good.",
    "This is a good introduction course, but it does not go into extremely great depth into any subject in lectures. The greatest depth is achieved through the simulations, which are fun, but also somewhat difficult to prepare for due to less clear instructions. I would recommend this to anyone interested in foreign policy and international relations, as China is one of the most important subjects currently. If you are looking for an easy social science credit, this is not a bad option, as it does not require a lot of work, and it is a useful subject.",
    "PLSC is a good class to take if you're interested in Chinese history and world politics, but don't take this class unless you are. The professor is not the most stimulating of lecturers, so you cannot rely on her to make the class engaging--it must the be material that keeps you coming to lectures.",
    "It's a good intro class to China, though for someone with any amount of prior knowledge or understanding, there are more advanced and in-depth classes that would probably be more interesting.",
    "This is a great survey course if you want an introduction to Chinese history and contemporary politics.",
    "Yes, but only if you know little about China and would like to learn more!",
    "I would recommend it to a wide variety of people, as it appeals both to students without much knowledge about China or East Asia, and to more knowledgeable students with a strong interest.",
    "Great survey course about China's foreign relations. We spent a couple of weeks on some of China's history, which was very helpful for noobs like me. Prof. Weiss really knows her stuff, but lectures could get a little dry. Negotiation simulations in section were a hit-or-miss for me.",
    "PLSC 179 was a very interesting and useful course. I would strongly recommend this class to anyone thinking of making national and foreign policy decisions in the future. The topics are covered fairly without bias and cover China from the country's ancient history to present day. The Professor and Teaching Fellows are all highly qualified to teach the course and this is translated to a very informative and enjoyable semester. I highly recommend this course to anyone with even a remote interest in China, the East China Sea and the South China Sea.",
    "What you see is what you get - a fairly easy lecture that involves memorizing names, stories, ID's etc. If you have a basic understanding of Chinese history this isn't a huge addition. But if you don't this is a solid introduction to most themes.",
    "It's just an okay class, but good for an easy 5th class. It is basically a history class on modern China, with a bit of politics mixed in. It isn't exactly fascinating but I guess it's a good intro to Chinese history if that's what you're looking for. Not very demanding, and you don't really need to go to lecture. The work is just three 2-3 page papers and the final, so not bad at all!",
    "Okay overview course. Good if looking for easy IR class. Interesting but a bit dull.",
    "Manageable class on the topic; helps if you're interested in it.",
    "China in World Politics is an information loaded course that gives you a cursory overview of U.S.-China relations, Chinese history since the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and Chinese relations with Southeast Asian nations. While I did learn quite a bit from class lectures and readings, it was often difficult to process the material given the accelerated speed at which the class was taught. I would recommend the class with the caveat that it challenges students to bite off more than they can chew."
