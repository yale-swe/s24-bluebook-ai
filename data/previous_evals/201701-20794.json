    "I learned how to parse a complex critical essay and how to apply its insights to different texts. I essentially learned how to write a critical literary essay, which I had never written before, and I learned much about (of course) Jewish American poetry but also about the modes of modern scholarship surrounding the issue.",
    "This is a course for the soul. It enables you to break away from your daily Yale hassle, and focus on something beautiful, intricate, and fascinating: poetry.",
    "I learned a lot about not just Jewish poetry but American poetry, different styles and genres of poetry, how to read and analyze poetry as well as a lot of stuff about Jewish text, knowledge and culture in general."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is extremely strong -- I really enjoyed the portions that were more discussion-like and those that were more lecture-like. I only wish I could have taken it all year.",
    "The small seminar setting is ideal to discuss poetry. The strength of the course is the professor, who is extremely engaging and caring.",
    "This course was really engaging, Professor Cole gave great feedback, the reading was very interesting and we learned a lot. Professor Cole balances giving his own thoughts and having the class talk really well--he talked a decent amount but so did we, and when he talked it was really helpful and we learned a lot. The only real weaknesses were that often there was too much to talk about so we skimmed over stuff, or got stuck on something and never reached a whole author we read at home, or people prepared presentations and never really got to give them because we ran out of time or Professor Cole talked instead. But this didn't have too much of an effect, still an amazing course.",
    "Professor Cole, the readings, and the discussion were all superb. He stretches your mind each class and creates a curriculum which pretty seamlessly weaves together Judaic Studies and Literature. One suggestion--we often had class meetings in which students would prepare presentations of the poems and lead discussion. I found those classes a little less rewarding, and conversation seemed to flow better when Professor Cole was leading discussion but allowing students to chime in often."

    "Absolutely. Probably the best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "If you are interested in one (or two, or three) of these things: poetry, Judaism, and America - TAKE IT ! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and I am so glad I took it. I will remember my whole life what I read and what I learned in this class.",
    "Definitely take this class! You will learn a lot about Jewish American poetry and poetry in general and Professor Cole is great.",
    "Fantastic hidden gem of a course. Prof is so knowledgeable (cannot emphasize enough) as well as kind and passionate.",
    "Yes! Incredible class with a kind and brilliant professor, a great and odd list of poets, and the perfect amount of writing."
