    "It depends. If you liked Directed Studies-type courses in the past, then you'll probably enjoy the first semester. The second semester is a crap shoot- it depends on your group. Mine was great and I enjoyed my brief. That was not the case for everyone.",
    "I would not recommend GS. It is far too conservative.",
    "Absolutely. A unique approach to learning that really needs to be replicated in other parts of the university. In the fall semester, the focus was policy and practice, a very appropriate follow-up to the reading-heavy spring.",
    "I recommend it",
    "Amazing course - take it!!",
    "Absolutely -- the course emphasizes a type of big picture thinking no longer taught at modern universities. The challenges of leadership -- at any level -- require an effective alignment of means and ends. Grand Strategy provides a strong foundation for thinking seriously about these concepts.",
    "This course teaches you about the fundamentals of strategy. I recommend it for someone who (1) wants to learn about the texts\/authors in the course, (2) is interested in public speaking and debate or wants to improve their abilities in these areas, and (3) wants to hear many points of view from professors with a variety of beliefs and teaching styles.",
    "You're going to take it because you got in. It will be below expectations. Hopefully the profs will fix this"

    "It's forced me to think of things on a macro level which I wasn't used to before.",
    "It gave me some vague sense of what life in DC might be like but it contributed little academically.",
    "The strategic methods and principles taught in this course are applicable in any profession.",
    "I learned about the key principles of strategy. I also learned presentation skills.",
    "Unclear at this point. I suppose I have Sun Tzu and Clausewitz quotes on hand for any situation"
