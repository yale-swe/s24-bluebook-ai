    "Absolutely take this class. Summary: Mixture of analysis and creative writing. Study some of the best contemporary poets, and actually get to meet them. Be prepared to have deep discussions regarding poetics. Workload: Read a book of poetry a week. Weekly short assignment. Write a page or so of questions in reaction to once reading. Write a short essay in reaction to one reading. Midterm paper. Final paper or creative project. The professor: Deming has a knack for bringing attracting some of the most intellectually curious and engaging students at Yale. He is good at facilitating discussion and challenging students without making people feel intimidated. If you have any interest in poetry, improving your writing, or broadening and finessing your framework for approaching creative works: Take. This. Class.",
    "This course searches for contemporary understandings of poetics, offering students not only the opportunity to read incredible contemporary poetry, but also to analytically engage with what it means to be a poet these days. Such analysis happens both in and outside the classroom, as Professor Deming was able to organize various poets we read during the course to visit Yale and discuss their poetics with us. If you care about modern and contemporary poetry, do not miss your chance to take this course - and know that Professor Deming invites a range of students with all different types of creative and analytical backgrounds to take the class.",
    "This is a fantastic course, and Prof. Deming is a phenomenal instructor. It's an exhilarating blend of creative and critical practices, and you get to develop and smash together both in your own writing. I wish more courses like this were offered by the English department--it opens up new avenues of thought that you didn't know existed before. The course is formally an introduction to the landscape of contemporary American poetics and poetry, that is informed by its history. You attend at least one poetry reading during the year, and, as the course maps onto the Poetics Working Group, some of the poets you read actually come and visit as well! You breathe the same air-space as them!! You learn about the production of poetic knowledge; you don't just consume it. In a word, mind-blow.",
    "Half of the poets on the syllabus visit Yale during the semester. The success of the class is almost entirely dependent on the students that compose the class. Professor Deming is masterful, generous, and a careful curator of dialogue and ideas. This is the class for the eager, the literary, the experimental, the brave. Not often does Yale give you a chance to read critically and write creatively. Beyond academia, this is what writers--those tasked to create the beautiful--do.",
    "A rigorous survey of contemporary poetics, by close analysis of a deftly selected handful of contemporary poets. The semester begins with Emerson, Dickinson, and Whitman, and proceeds through Olson, Bernstein, and onward, with the question \"What is poetry?\" throughout. Discussion was enhanced by in-class visits with many of the poets (Ann Lauterbach, Forrest Gander, Susan Howe, Frank Bidart) -- great opportunities to struggle together with these authors through the vagaries of the written word, its evolving difficulties and our evolving methods of art-making. Close analysis of poems is balanced well with discussions of themes, subject matter. For most assignments, you have the option to submit creative work. Richard Deming's deft hand throughout. Highly recommended.",
    "I think I should have taken one or two more poetry classes before this one, but I still managed to enjoy it and learn a lot. I wasn't as comfortable with contemporary poetry at first, but I came a long way over the semester.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Contemporary Poetry and Poetics will challenge the way you conceptualize poetry, what you think poetry \"should\" be, what it \"is\" and where it's moving in today's day and age. The study of each poet's poetics are on equal footing with his or her poetry, and the time spent dissecting and discussing the motor, the philosophy behind the work and the stylistic choice in expression (\"form is never more than an extension of content,\" and don't you forget it!) is positively illuminating. This course has opened my mind in unexpected ways, and the questions and provocations I'm left with will carry over into other forms of artistic expression for me. A final thought for non-English majors considering the course: I wasn't an English major and though the material was difficult (for all, I might add, not just us non-English majors), Deming made all of us feel like we were on equal footing. I guess that's to say that he didn't favor one person or one commentator over another but really wanted all to take part. And talking to him about the material over office hours was a real help -- he's so generous and non-judgmental that you'll want to take advantage of any time to spend talking to him one-on-one.",
    "One of the best English classes I have taken at Yale. The reading list was incredible, and the workload was not too bad. Each assignment, in fact, was a real joy to complete. Professor Deming is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. A phenomenal guide of discussion, prudent in his comments and feedback, and with a great sense of humor, Deming made ENGL 476 a class that, despite its non-traditional reading list, should be required for all interested in poetry.",
    "ENGL 476 is a breathtaking course. Even if you don't think you like poetry, take it. It will show you how wrong you are.",
    "A seminar discussing poetry with a view towards how contemporary poetics shape the way poetry is written. If you write poetry it is a good (and maybe unique) opportunity to develop and scrutinize your own poetics and the ways in which you write. Deming is a marvelous profesor and class discussion was lively and enging. The opportunity to meet with contemporary poets and hear them talk about their work is an integral part of the course. Definitely would recommend."
