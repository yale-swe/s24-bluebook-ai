    "Prof. Hagens is an amazing professor and he really makes this class an enjoyable one to take. This is not a traditional literature class. You will be asked to write weekly reading responses, give two speeches, have an oral midterm and group oral final, lead discussions, read primary and secondary sources, and also write a final paper. This may sound like a lot, but it will help stretch you as a student and learner. Prof. Hagens will give you all the support you need - so just reach out and ask him!",
    "An intimate experience that is great for anyone interested in literature and close literary analysis. The course may be more geared towards those with experience in comparative literature or the humanities, but could be enriching for anyone interested in the specific texts.",
    "This course looks at the big works (mostly German) in the Faust tradition. The theme is very interesting and widely applicable, and Professor Hagens is excellent, too."
