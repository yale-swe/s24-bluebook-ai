    "Great class. Gandhi will be completely different coming out of this class than when you came in, and you'll respect him just as much. The course materials are based on Gandhi's original writings, and the professor will lead you through how to critically read them. I absolutely loved this class and found everything the professor had to say extremely interesting; however, if you are not interested in Gandhi, do not take this class. As a Gandhi enthusiast, I loved it!",
    "Would definitely recommend, and I hope more people take it. Was sad to see only 6 students this year. In a world increasingly dominated with revolutions and violence, it is good to study a man who overthrew an empire using non-violence."
