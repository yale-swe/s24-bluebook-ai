    "The seminars were very interesting and covered a large range of topics. I wish the lunch that was a part of the seminar was more diverse. Pizza was served extremely often, and I would have really liked if the meal was different week-to-week and not always pizza.",
    "strengths: great intro to current research and the movers\/shakers weaknesses: never enough food (consistently ran out-- i missed lunch 4 times); sign in sheet system was not efficient-- missed signing in twice (as did most people). essentially, all improvements are logistical. content was great.",
    "Great review of current issues in microbial diseases and public health.",
    "The guest lecturers were always interesting, but I felt that we could have seen more variety in topics. Lots of HIV and malaria lectures.",
    "Very interesting, this supplemented my courses well.",
    "I enjoyed the seminar series this semester - there were a variety of topics and research approaches. I thought it presented a diverse picture of research and research potential in the department.",
    "The seminar was a good introduction to a wide range of research being done at Yale and outside of the university. The food situation could have been executed much more effectively; there was consistently not enough food for seminar participants. Also, I was shocked by the amount of waste generated at each seminar. As a school of public health, I think that our actions should reflect our area of study. Public health cannot be separated from environmental health. If we are to call ourselves promoters of public health, we cannot reasonably offer bottled water, paper plates, and plastic silverware without hypocrisy. I may be considered extreme in this opinion, but I think that the changes necessary to eliminate an enormous amount of waste are minor inconveniences in comparison to the environmental impact of our actions. With a water fountain steps from the seminar room, bottled water is completely unnecessary. Further, individuals should be responsible for bringing their own silverware to the seminar.",
    "I liked the talks that were less immunology\/basic science and more behavior\/public healthish. Please get enough food. We are required to go to this and there is never enough food for us students because professors take it all. Also, we would prefer HOT pizza rather than luke warm pizza or even better would be less pizza.",
    "Great speakers, diversity of talks, but it is too bad that we cannot go to any of the seminars from the other departments: could we have the choice for 2 thursdays during the year ?",
    "The course is really interesting because of the range of topics that we talk about.",
    "Overall, the seminar course was fine. There were interesting seminars and seminars that were not as interesting. I have no real constructive feedback.",
    "For the most part, engaging speakers about relevant and interesting topics.",
    "I enjoyed most of the seminars. I think that some had parts that were very technical and that made it difficult to understand. I personally found the best seminars were those by Dr. Rick Malley and Lisa Eaton (CIRA), but I thought all the speakers had something interesting and relevant to gain from their talk. Sometimes we ran out of food and\/or space to sit. This is difficult for the first years that are required to be there since some talks were much more attended by additional people than others.",
    "Pretty interesting speakers\/topics, with a nice mix of material (although a bit heavy on the vector-borne, no surprise). We often seemed to have way too many people for the room, resulting in long lines and sometimes food shortages. It's great that these seminars are popular but also frustrating for those of us lowly first-years who are required to be there and end up hungry or without a seat. It became a little ridiculous having to show up 20 minutes early just to get a seat."

    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0did not really interact with professor since was a seminar class, but seemed to do a good job of introducing speakers",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0The sign-in sheet could have been easier to locate. Presentations were great.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Dr. Parikh organizes the course well. We always have interesting speakers and are reminded of the seminars each week.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Dr. Parikh is very approachable and responsive to questions and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0I guess he picked good speakers? No real teaching from Dr. Parikh though."

    "fun required course; just need to listen while you have lunch (if there is even food for everyone)",
    "Great course, and very interesting",
    "Great survey of what is going on in the field of EMD, I would recommend strongly!",
    "A great way to gain greater insight into the field.",
    "Make sure there is enough food!",
    "Series of talk on everything related to infectious diseases. It is a requirement but I would still recommend it if it was not.",
    "The seminar series is interesting and diverse. It's a great place to hear and participate in discussions and to learn about what other research is happening both at Yale and in other institutions.",
    "Considering it is a requirement, I would say the course can be interesting and a useful means of learning more about the research being done in infectious disease epidemiology.",
    "This is required for first years in EMD, but I would recommend it regardless because most of the speakers are interesting and while people have different interests in EMD there is a chance to maybe hear from someone who does work in your field of interest or reinforce something you may learn in a class.",
    "It's required, usually pretty interesting. Show up early if you can."
