   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Most of my insights were from instructor paper feedback that challenged me to push my writing and conceptual development. The class content allowed us to explore many different disciplined and drew my interest to philosophy and biochemistry beyond the literary foundation we have built.",
    "After learning about many theories of pain through this course, I became aware of how pain\/suffering is portrayed in just about everything - books, movies, songs. We read Elaine Scarry, Susan Sontag, and many interesting papers. I learned how to write a clear, contestable claim for my papers.",
    "Through this course, I was able to expand my perspective on pain. Usually seen through a medical perspective, my point of view has widened to take in pain from a social, political, and cultural perspective as well. This course taught me to become more creative in the way I viewed things. In terms of writing, writing in different styles helped me to expand my skills as a writer as well.",
    "I have grown so very much as a writer.",
    "I thin that pain--especially physical pain--is not usually a topic that is deeply considered in academia, let alone in such an intersectional way. Pain has always been a big part of my life, and so to be able to deeply think and consider pain in an academic setting was extremely inspiring, comforting, and challenging for me. I grew so much from this class both personally and academically and am so grateful this class is offered at Yale.",
    "A good base of college writing skills, literary analysis skills.",
    "I gained insight on the way that humans view pain and different ways that pain can be interpreted. We discussed the unique attributes of pain and the reason for its difficulty in communicating it. Overall, we looked at pain in four different categories: pain in ourselves, pain in others, pain in public (such as politics), and pain in religion. We discussed the similarities between these disciplines and made connections to our own lives.",
    "I gained more practice in writing, especially around the topic of pain, but from a more researched perspective that was based on other scholars and sources.",
    "I learned a great deal about pain and different interpretations of pain and how it is communicated. I also learned better argumentation and improved my writing by making it more focused and organized."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course themes and readings are fascinating and generally engaging, if challenging, to read and dissect. However, because the subject matter is relatively narrow, many of the discussions on each reading can seem repetitive. I find the real strength of the course is the flexibility of our writing assignments and the ability to pursue multidisciplinary studies while still improving our fundamental storytelling and research skills.",
    "The professor assigned a lot of interesting readings, but I feel that I never really got the most out of them during our class discussion because there wasn't really one thing I could \"focus\" on as I read, and that the readings were often dense. The course can be improved if we received more guidance on how to analyze our readings and go through them content-wise before engaging in discussion. This would also generate more class discussion if everyone felt that they at least understood the reading. The paper assignments (with the exception of the first paper) allowed me to explore the topic of pain in relation to what ideas were important to me. However, getting to the heart of the prompt itself was my main problem for all the papers. It would help me as a student if there were more examples of papers that addressed the prompt.",
    "The course material was somewhat broad and boring.",
    "I thought that the choice of readings was excellent in that it covered such a range of authors with different perspectives on and experiences with pain. I also thought that the extensive conversation among students that this class allowed was spectacular, and I really appreciated that everyone's voices were always heard. I also really appreciated the level of support Professor Wang consistently offered.",
    "Strength: Many of the readings were extremely engaging and interesting.",
    "One of the strengths of the course was that it was very structured. The whole course was mapped out since the first day of class, which allowed students to plan ahead in the work that they needed to get done. Another strength was the size of the class- the small class size made it easier for us to go in depth with ideas and writing workshops. A weakness of the class was that some of the readings were very long and time consuming. I especially had difficulty with finishing the reading of Parable of the Sower because there was a lot of text to read over the span of two days. If this reading were spread out over a little more time, I would've been able to really focus on the reading and think about the topics of pain that it discussed.",
    "I liked the community and size of the class, particularly for the topic at hand. I don't really have a weakness, but some readings were difficult, and this goes for most classes out there-- when readings are hard, there is not much done about it, how does one learn how to read (a difficult text)?",
    "Strengths: Super interesting topic. Awesome how we were able to learn about pain from such a variety of different academic disciplines. I also liked that we read literature in addition to more science-based articles. Also, I liked the discussion format of the class and the P2, P3, and P4 assignments. Also, Professor Wang was extremely passionate about the topic and also extremely willing to help improve writing or just learn more about literature. Weaknesses: P1. I am not sure if it was the assignment itself or that we had to write the assignment about the Elizabeth Scarry article, but I found this assignment to be very confusing and difficult to understand what we were supposed to write.",
    "This course was really interesting, as it approached the topics from a variety of mediums, including art, philosophy, and other written and visual texts."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in the question of pain -- but if either philosophy and multidisciplinary reading are not of interest, the class would likely not be of use because it requires a higher level of individual engagement in order to make the class worthwhile.",
    "Yes, this is a great course to learn how to write papers, since you get to tackle an 8-10 page research paper for Paper 3, and there is a lot of guidance for gathering sources, drafting, and revision. The topic of the course itself is also very sensitive and thus important to discuss in today's society when we seem to be numb to pain and trauma of the news. The theories of pain we read in this class keep us aware that pain is truly felt by others, and I think we learn to be more empathetic of other's pain after taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student wishing to establish a good foundation on their writing skills and to build upon and expand them. It is a good introductory seminar class as well, and facilitates lots of conversation among other peers.",
    "Absolutely; in addition to challenging me academically, I think that this class allow students to gain empathy and awareness about those around them, which I think is helpful at Yale and life beyond Yale, too.",
    "Absolutely. If they are interested in this specific 114 course, they should definitely make an effort to get into this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students because of its small class size and organized structured. I also thought that the discussions we had in the class revolving around different readings, thoughts on the readings, and our writing really opened up our minds to think on a deeper level and allowed us to grow as students and writers. I would also recommend this class because pain effects everybody's lives, so discussions on pain are relatable and necessary to understand other perspectives and learn how other people are affected by pain.",
    "I think this is a unique class, so sure.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend this class to other students because it is such a fascinating topic and such a variety of different ideas are discussed. In addition, it greatly improves writing skills and teaches better argumentation."
