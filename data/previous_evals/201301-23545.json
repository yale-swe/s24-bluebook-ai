    "Question 12: This course is very similar in some ways to FES 800 (though in no way as comprehensive) and is therefore somewhat redundant.",
    "The one member of my group who has a lot of excel experience did all of the modeling. I picked up a few tricks from her, but I wish we hadlearned how to do this modeling in the lectures. The lectures were very duplicative of other energy course offerings at FES. The hotelling and energy efficiency\/discounting lectures in particular, and many of the readings, were repetitive. The energy strategy game is what sets the class apart, so I wish this were more of a formal focus during class time.",
    "12 - The electricity strategy game was valuable. It was also somewhat valuable to hear a lot of the policy issues discussed in other FES courses from a different perspective.",
    "I realized a little too late in the class that more Econ knowledge than what I had was necessary. The electricity strategy game, for example, would have been extremely difficult for me without the help of those in my group. People with a better concept of trading in markets will definitely do better. That being said, it's an interesting topic and Professor Campbell was great."

I'd keep that in there next year.",
