    "Learned a lot about phenomena in decision making.",
    "I gained a fairly broad understanding of the field of judgement and decision making, which I did not have at the start of the course. It was interesting to learn about the development of the field, and to study the topics from a different perspective than I was used to.",
    "This class does a great job of providing captivating research that helps in discussions of how to conduct research in JDM.",
    "I learned a lot about the irrationality of humans.",
    "Learned about the field of decision making from a psychological perspective. Improved my ability to read academic papers.",
    "I learned about many of the seminal concepts and areas of research in the field of decision-making theory, which provided a unique perspective gravely overlooked by the yale economics program.",
    "Evaluating different decision methods.",
    "A whole host of knowledge regarding the odd ways in which people operate , as well as a thorough examination of the methodology behind how these results can be brought into question\/examined.",
    "I gained more insight into how the research for JDM\/BDM is done.",
    "I have learned many research methods used in marketing and encountered a lot of research papers that demonstrate how to design a good experiment in this field."

   "comments": [
    "More of a road map before the last class.",
    "One strength of the course was that it gave a comprehensive overview of the field, and the order of syllabus\/readings was intuitive; we started with the basics and built upon those topics as the course went on. The structure of the class was one weakness. There was less discussion than some other classes, which meant the students did not get to interact with each other as much as I would have liked. I did, however, think it was useful to have different students summarize the papers each week - the summaries were very useful, and it was a good way to engage in the course, especially since there was less unstructured discussion.",
    "Strengths - academic introduction to research in decision making, liked the approach weaknesses - found it lacking discussion in that the pedagogical format did not help me engage with the course. Students only brought up comments that were answered by professors but there was no discussion among students.",
    "Strength: high engagement with material, professors who were highly knowledgeable about subject Weaknesses: sometimes professors were not open",
    "This class had interesting discussions, but three hours is a long time period for the structure of the course as it is currently. The readings were relevant and the presentations helpful to understanding the material.",
    "The main weakness of the course is the in-class discussion. I felt that I did not get much added value from the discussion after doing the readings.",
    "I think the two instructors work well off each other and the discussion section online helps draw out some questions. The student summaries seemed a bit pointless and could perhaps be refined to be more individual's ideas or analysis of the Canvas discussion group.",
    "I think the course being 3 hour long is very tiring for everyone, even the professors who are oftentimes leading the discussion.",
    "Strengths: Professors give very useful feedback on reading materials and on the final proposal paper Weakness: The course covered a variety of topics in marketing. It will be more helpful if we can try to build a connection across these topics. Sometimes, I felt a little lost and was not sure how one topic is linked to another."

   "comments": [
    "yes, high level course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students that are interested in the topic of Judgement & Decision Making, but not necessarily to someone who is not interested\/has a surface level interest or understanding, because it was a fairly niche course.",
    "Yes. This class is amazing and both professors know their stuff.",
    "Yes! This was incredibly interesting with very understanding professors. They were very knowledgeable about the material and treated us very respectfully.",
    "Yes if interested but ideally with background in reading psych studies",
    "Yes! If youre interested in-depth reading academic papers and literature on the subject.",
    "Yes! This material is extremely important for understanding economics, and most undergraduate courses do not cover it.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students if they are interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, it's an outstanding method to become immersed in the psychology behind behavioural econs. The level of discussion in the class is also well-worth the three hour investment.",
    "It's a really good course to help you figure out if you want to do research. However, I think that the professors could have done a better job of providing feedback throughout the course and as we were writing our final papers.",
    "Yes if a student is interested in marketing topics as the course focuses on consumer behaviors."
