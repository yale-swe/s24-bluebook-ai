    "If you are a history major, you will probably be more interested in attending lectures for this class than chemistry majors. Important topics pertinent to exams are barely touched upon during class, meaning you will probably have to learn everything yourself. This is quite annoying, because I feel like I went to every single lecture for no reason whatsoever. I probably spent twice as much time on this course (including lecture) than I would have if I were actually taught things in class. I would not recommend this class if you have an option to not take it. It is disappointing if you actually want to learn the material.",
    "don't take it if you don't have to",
    "This course is engaging and introduces you to basic topics of and significant problems being tackled in inorganic chemistry. The material, however, was not covered well in class. Extra reading and attending section were necessary to understand the details of the material covered on exams.",
    "The worst mistake of my academic life thus far was choosing to take this class with Prof. Crabtree, instead of waiting to take it with Prof. Hazari. If you have the same choice (which you may never face, as I don't know how much longer Prof. Crabtree will be teaching), DO NOT make my mistake. The class is boring to the extreme. Crabtree only ever reads from his powerpoints, which are 5% relevant and 95% extraneous information. He claims to only test you on slides that he has marked with a chili pepper, which is a lie. Most of my learning in this class came from the internet, Crabtree's book, or section, but never class. There are simply not enough combinations of words that I can use to persuade you to not take this class.",
    "Inorganic Chemistry is not a labor intensive class. However, studying and doing the problem sets takes way longer than it should because the subject material is presented in such a confusing manner that I never really felt like I knew what was going on.",
    "Yes! It's a great course with a really cool and important teacher, although you have to be prepared to learn a lot of things on your own.",
    "Chemistry majors have to take this course, but it is a pain to take it with Prof. Crabtree. Even though he is a world-class researcher, he clearly no longer has any real interest in teaching. He simply lectures off poorly made slides that make no sense; the problem sets are easy but most are often made out of random questions which do not facilitate the understanding of the material. The exam questions were relatively easy, but painfully random at times.",
    "I would summarize this class as a class that is harder than it looks, especially in the amount of material covered. The setup by Professor Crabtree makes it hard to follow and study, but the material was entertaining enough, and not too hard if there hadn't been so much. The grading is kinda harsh, but there is some leniency in the exams, and the homework problem sets aren't too bad. I would not recommend taking this class unless using it towards your major.",
    "If you liked organic chemistry you will probably like this class a lot. Even if you didn't, you might still enjoy the material. Metals can do some really cool stuff and if you are taking this class you are probably a chemistry major, so you probably think reactions and mechanisms are cool. The teaching is not great in this class; Professor Crabtree goes through slides extremely quickly and it can be difficult to follow lectures. There are two midterms, a final, and some psets. If you want to do well in this class go to your TA to get help on anything you don't understand right away, and start studying for the tests pretty far in advance. There is a surprising amount of material and you will sometimes be asked to remember some fact directly from a single slide, so you really need to know everything.",
    "This course is called Inorganic Chemistry but you end up learning so much more than that. Bob Crabtree (who is a giant in the field of organometallic chemistry but incredibly sweet and humble) brings in tons of history and literature and all sorts of random things into his lectures (that are still relevant) and so you learn lots of cool facts as well. That being said, the content of the course is a little weird - it starts out basically as a recap of gen chem but then he jumps way too deep into transition metal and organometallic chemistry so if you don't keep up it's very easy to get left behind, especially since organometallic chemistry is totally different from anything you've seen before. Workload is very chill - weekly psets that don't take more than an hour and 2 midterms and a final. First midterm was (honestly) easier than gen chem but the other 2 exams were very odd.",
    "The material of this class is cool, but it is at times disorganized and hard to follow. A bunch will be self taught. The exams are hard to prepare for, and the weekly psets require help from your TAs. Beware, it's cool\/not difficult in workload but difficult in exams in a surprise way.",
    "I would summarize it as a waste of time. Avoid if possible.",
    "It is a introduction to inorganic chemistry and its applications. The teaching can be a little disorganized but it is well taught overall.",
    "It was fine, take it if you have to but otherwise you could definitely find a more interesting course.",
    "Prof Crabtree is a great lecturer, but this class overall is bad and unnecessarily stressful. He puts pictures of chili peppers on slides that he says are testable material, and states at the beginning of the course that we are only responsible for those slides, but then asks exam questions on completely different things. The PSets are full of errors and sometimes based on Crabtree's personal research opinions than established concepts (ask anyone about the time we spent learning about the Gif Reaction). I wanted to like the class, but it was a bit too infuriating for me to speak positively of it. If you aren't a chem major, don't take it. If you are, either take it when someone else is teaching it or audit it (without a grade so you still get to experience his lectures) as a prereq then take a grad level inorganic\/organometallic\/coordination chem class for the major requirement.",
    "The course had potential but the teaching and structure were horrible. Strengths: -Most Chemistry majors didnt appreciate this but it was great to hear about so many real-world applications of the material, references to history and cool trivia. The defining class elements were Napoleons hair, Prussian blue and climate change -The Sections were always a delightful (and useful) change from the actual lecture and the TA (Brian) was one of the best I have had at Yale. He would come very very prepared and would prepare us quite well. Brians dedication to teaching, intelligence, accessibility and organization were the saving grace of the class. Weaknesses: -The lectures were unhelpful and distracting. Professor Crabtree has a good sense of humor and is very cultured and informed, which is a breath of fresh air compared to other STEM professors. But he cant teach the difficult material, cannot prioritize when there are 100+ slides to finish in 50 minutes and doesnt engage the class at all (even though it has 30 people) -The class is very disorganized. Most problem sets had no academic value and were just written up quickly and haphazardly. There were weeks when the professor just forgot about posting a problem set. The midterm exams were also made without any effort (although the final was suddenly and unexpectedly challenging). We also had our 2nd midterm shifted from April 12 or something to April 29 (the last day of classes), which was unhelpful and made the 2nd midterm a final -There is too much material. He would go through 60-70 slides in some lectures and I understood less than 50% of them and didnt know which material was more important to understand. About 20% of the material is tested. A lot of the extra material is too complicated and takes away from the material which is actually supposed to be learned. Professor Crabtree created a system whereby a chilli pepper on a slide means we need to know that slide. However, he never stuck to that limitation and there were too few chilli peppers overall -The presentation slides are chaos -The class is taught as a bunch of content rather than intrinsic chemistry principles. This is a problem with all STEM classes at Yale. Organic Chemistry II was the first time I saw chemistry taught through pure concepts and scientific intuition. Even then, I figured it out myself by meeting up with TAs and internet research. But inorganic study materials are less easily available and learning (often memorizing) material became a pain. How to improve: -I think it is time to give the class a new professor and a fresh approach -Reduce the material but increase the teaching of principles and concepts -Have more practice questions and past exam papers -Be more organized with exam scheduling, problem sets and emails"
