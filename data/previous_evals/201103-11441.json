   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to those interested in the topic. I don't think the workload was particularly heavy (reading responses every week and three papers overall). The professor is also great, and she encourages students to come to her office hours. It's a good introduction to the history department at Yale. However, you will not enjoy the course if you don't enjoy learning about Indian wars and colonial wars.",
    "This course focused on a number of different rebellions and wars that I had previously known little to nothing about. Each week we explored a different war or rebellion in American history, with some being more compelling than others, but all enhancing my understanding of the relationship between war\/rebellion and the shaping of early America. Additionally, we started working on our final research papers from an early point in the course, and they became an overarching theme for the entire course.I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in early American history or to anybody who is interested in history in general because while completing the final research paper is a daunting task, it definitely advanced my ability to analyze primary sources and put together a story in the context of a historical time period.",
    "If anyone has an interest in colonial history (especially through the eyes of the native Indians of the time) they should take this course without second thought. The homework was reasonable (two short essays and a final paper with weekly readings that ranged from articles to books) and discussions were interesting and engaging. Well done class with an engaging professor who genuinely cares about the students.",
    "A very enjoyable class. I would recommend the class to any student interested in either early AMerican history (particularly Native American and colonialist interactions), but the class also helps one to understand more broadly the implications and the nature of conflict in history.",
    "I would recommend History 023 to another student. We had to read one book per week. One class was a lecture and one was a group discussion. We had to write three essays, including one ten-page final paper about a topic of our choice. Professor Dubcovsky was great! She exposed us to the many resources available at Yale and truly wanted to make sure we had the ability to succeed.",
    "The readings were never too bad, and the class discussions were usually good. Professor Dubcovsky was very helpful and easy to talk to; although, sometimes her expectations were vague. I enjoyed the class and felt that I learned a lot.",
    "This is a good class if you are interested in the topic; you read a fair amount of books and discuss them with other students. If you keep up with the readings, it's not very difficult. The 10 page research paper can be a pain, but you are introduced to Beinecke and other libraries so it is certainly doable.",
    "I would recommend it. I feel that I learned a great deal during the course, and it provided a very different way of looking at history in comparison to high school history courses. The course explored a lot of very interesting course material, the seminar format was very effective, and each student got the opportunity to research topics that interested them in depth."
