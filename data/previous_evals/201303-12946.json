   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended.Much fun and helpful if you are interested in quantitative research. This one is a first step.",
    "GLBL802 provides a focused introduction to the fundamental tools (i.e. STATA) and methodologies employed in statistical social science analysis today.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone planning to go into anything policy related. The skills taught in this class are absolutely necessary.",
    "The course makes mathaphobes comfortable with the material. There is a clear step-by-step process for why we learn what we learned.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who wants a strong introduction to quantitative methods of analysis AND would benefit from a calculus refresher.",
    "An excellent foundational course for social science students looking to understand statistics or advance further.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to other students.",
    "The course teaches the bases of functions and derivatives at first then moves on to statistical analysis with the Stata software, allowing us to analyze a lot of data in a social science perspective. If the fellow student is interested in quantitative analyses, I definitely recommend the class.",
    "A very good intro to statistical analysis course with a great teacher. It's very slow-moving at the beginning, which means that the last couple weeks of the course felt a little rushed. Although I wished it had moved a little faster, I always enjoyed coming to this class.",
    "I would recommend.It's very helpful to get an introduction of statistics.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to fellow students with little or no background knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and econometrics.My summary: It is a great introductory course to important mathematical and statistical concepts in the policy world as well as in the social sciences, more generally.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in building up the necessary calculus base to do higher-level stat work, and also wish to gain some competency with STATA.",
    "Quickly come up to speed on calculus concepts that will serve you well in economics and statistics, among other disciplines. If one wants to do anything remotely quantitative and has little background, this is a perfect first course.",
    "Essential math and statistical skills for a global affairs professional.",
    "Perfect course for those who want to learn statistics.",
    "Yes. It was a great course."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Very helpful to my future research.",
    "I went from knowing very little about statistics to feeling that I could comfortably discuss the standard statistical concepts and critique statistical methodology to a reasonable extent. That journey was worth the very hard work that the course demanded.",
    "The course equipped me with further skills that will allow me to a more discriminating consumer of quantitatively derived social science analysis.",
    "I can now better understand statistical studies and academic papers.",
    "Good grounding in important STATA and general statistical analysis.",
    "The course definitely prepared me for statistical and quantitative analysis in social sciences, which could be something that will be asked of me later in the work environment.",
    "I wouldn't say that I deepened my knowledge much during this course, but it was a good review of things I had learned in the distant and not-so-distant past. I did really enjoy the final exam because I felt it gave me a sense of the way statistics might be applied in a work setting, which was something new for me. I would have liked more practice in explaining statistics in plain English the way we did on exam.",
    "For me the course was a good refresher of material I had studied before and a good preparation for later quantitative work. To be more useful, the course would have had to cover the material at a higher level, though.",
    "While I do not intend to write a dissertation, the skill set I have developed in this course will certainly be helpful in future research.",
    "I could learn the basics of statistics.",
    "So far it hasn't deepened my knowledge of my key interests but it has given me the ability in the future to work in areas of work related with a extremely valuable set of skills."
