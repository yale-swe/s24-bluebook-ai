    "definitely take this class!!!",
    "For anyone interested in Latin America's leftist movements, this class provides a good taste of events over the last century. It invites comparison between the socialist and communist initiatives that arose after the Cuban Revolution, and it includes some decent movies and primary source readings to make the material more engaging. I didn't love it, in part because I felt like the course would have been far more successful with more historical continuity in fewer countries, instead of having a bunch of articles about the time of the revolution; it's hard to get a sense of a place from reading just about one uprising, and then what came before and after, rather than tracing the political development of a country. That said, with the enormous task he has given himself, Gil Joseph does a very good job. He's a wonderful man, and a very caring teacher, so treat him kindly, whether or not you decide to take the course. The people who take this class are very eager -- sometimes too eager -- to make their voices heard, which is both good and bad.",
    "A series of case studies about socialist revolutions and fascist counterrevolutions in Cuba, Nicaragua, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia. An excellent course, well taught and interesting.",
    "A really impressive class. You'll learn a ton and enjoy every minute of it. Definitely take it if you can!",
    "Take it but beware that it is a lot of work. The work you put in will be well-worth it, however.",
    "Amazing course! The embodiment of why someone comes to Yale, why they study the liberal arts. You learn SO much and discuss so much and prof. Joseph is incredible. Take it!!!",
    "AMAZING class! take it take it take it!! I wish I could take it again. Professor Joseph is an incredible professor and cares so much about his students.",
    "A FANTASTIC class. If you have even the smallest interest in Latin America or the Cold War, I cannot recommend this class enough. The reading-load is sometimes on the heavy side, but always interesting and worthwhile. All opinions are welcome and Professor Joseph really encourages you to explore all sides of history as well as your own reactions to it. This class made me a better student, thinker, and Latino. Professor Joseph is brilliant and led the class very well. This was my favorite class at Yale by far. Do yourself a favor and take this class.",
    "I loved this class, take it if you get in. The journal is a refreshing, personal kind of assignment, that is most effective if you actually do it regularly in the weeks leading up to the midterm. Professor Joseph is very knowledgeable, sweet, and accessible. It was a pleasure taking a class with him.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Definitely my favorite of the semester. Professor Joseph is awesome, his enthusiasm and experience makes the material that much more interesting. There is a lot of reading but it's all current history and some of the sources are really interesting like Playboy articles and ESPN 30 for 30 films. Rest of the grade comes from a 15-20 pg paper, journal for first half of the class and class participation.",
    "This course is a perfect history seminar. I would definitely recommend it any history student interested in latin american history. It is a great review of the revolutionary trends running through the modern era."
