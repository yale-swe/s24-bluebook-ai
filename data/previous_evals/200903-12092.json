   "comments": [
    "This class is sort of a mess, and Gilmore is pretty self-centered. It's a lot of listening to him talk about his own opinions, which gets tiring, and each class is kind of disorganized. It's neither philosophy nor science, and it doesn't do a great job of connecting the two.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are an enthusiast for the material. The way that Professor Gilmore leads discussion can be frustrating and while at times it proved very fruitful there were other days that, for me, proved only frustrating. Also, the material is very science heavy and there is very little actual philosophy in the reading and discussion.",
    "This is an absolutely wonderful class for anyone who's ever wondered about the implications of the theory of evolution for philosophy. An extremely relaxed class, it's basically a forum for people to discuss scientific papers about sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and evolutionary theory in light of deeper philosophical questions. Professor Gilmore is extremely intelligent and leads the class well, though he is definitely helped out by the quality of the students. Make sure you're ready to do a lot of reading if you take it, but the written assignments aren't too bad. If you are a biological determinist (like I was), this class will make you doubt yourself severely. If you deny all influence of science on the humanities, this class will (hopefully) make you see that you are wrong.",
    "The readings are interesting, but at least in Fall 2009, the class discussion was lackluster. Professor Gilmore\u00b4s interventionist style did not help matters at all.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if you're prepared to do the work, which is significant. There is a LOT of reading, and only about half of it is actually discussed every week. You definitely want to have done the reading that is discussed (if you want to understand the discussion), though, so you have to do it all.That said, the articles are quite varied and generally excellent, and Dr. Gilmore has very interesting insights about them. If you take the course, I recommend going to office hours as well-- it's a way to get a more focused perspective on the aspects of the material that most interest you.My other caveat about the course is that it was filled with intellectually aggressive students who like to hear themselves talk. The material has so much to be explored that it sometimes seemed like discussion didn't really build off of what others had said, but consisted of the beginnings of each student's own (somewhat garbled) philosophical treatise on the material.",
    "At the beginning of the year, people fight their way into this class. It seems like the type of class that will change your life forever...I think that because of the hype that surrounded getting into the class, I had unduly high expectations of what it would be, and what I would get out of it. Most of the readings are from evolutionary psychology, and it's less of philosophy class than I had expected. It's hard to figure out what went wrong for me with this class. Sometimes the class would be really great, but sometimes I would be really bored and couldn't get invested in the discussions. I think a major problem is that there are so many readings for most ofthe weeks that the class discussion really lags, as no one finishes the readings. As the semester went on, the amount of reading definitely reduced, and the class discussions got a lot better. I think this class has the potential to be amazing, but what everyone gets out of it depends on the dynamic of the class and what everyone is willing to put in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. We covered a wide variety of topics in evolutionary psychology and looked at them through a critical lens. I felt I was really able to hone my opinions on each of these topics and on social science in general.",
    "An exploration of evolutionary psychology and its applications to love, morality, art, and much more. I hadn't taken a course like this before.",
    "Interesting class. I would recommend it if you can articulate a reason for taking it. Unless you have a question that you're hoping to answer, you probably won't pick that much up except perhaps an \"evolutionary perspective.\" There's a lot of reading, which makes presenting difficult. Discussions take a while to get going. Readings don't clearly respond to one another, and it's difficult to sort out the interactions that are there because there's so much. Professor Gilmore is very sharp, but is prone to filling empty discussion space if the class is quiet.",
    "The course material is really interesting, but Professor Gilmore just isn't a good discussion leader - seminar rarely seemed to go anywhere and he would aggressively interject much too frequently, sometimes ending up in 20 minute tangents with one or two students, which made me not enjoy the course very much. Also, the choice of reading assignments was a bit odd, and we were almost always assigned several articles beyond what we could possibly discuss in class. Take it if you're really into the material, but otherwise there are probably better seminars out there."
