    "This is a great introductory class for people with no previous exposure to African prehistory. Just some reading and two papers (due whenever you want!) makes for a light course load; however, lectures can occasionally drag on a bit. So weigh that into your decision to take this course. If you're interested in the material, take it--without a doubt. You'll just have to face some uncertainty as to what your grade is by the semester's end!",
    "I wasn't interested at all in archaeology at the beginning of the course, and barely understood what it actually was. By the end of this term I have a solid grasp on archaeology, and the culture of archaeologists throughout Africa. I would recommend this to anyone.",
    "This is a class that follows the development of African societies over history. If you are interested in archaeology and want to learn about what sites in Africa can tell us about the past then I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I recommend Anthropology 272 01 for fellow student who are interested in the Prehistory of Africa.",
    "A good course if you want a relatively low workload. There are two papers, one 5 pg and one 15 pg. There are no deadlines, so make sure you start them early!"
