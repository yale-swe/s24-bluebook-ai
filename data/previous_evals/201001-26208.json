   "comments": [
    "Very repetitive.",
    "didn't teach me anything. the course content needs complete renovation. the whole premise that it is not about teaching me stats, but rather how to use SAS, is preposterous. TEACH ME STATS! this school is too expensive and the program too short for a single moment to be wasted. i appreciate the sentiment of trying to ease my work load, but we'd much rather learn something. i didn't learn anything.",
    "i thought this course was subpar. I felt like the professor taught us at a much lower level than we are at. i felt like he was talking down to us and going way too slowly. we are in graduate school at YALE. this could be a challenging program. we could have covered twice as much information as we did. p",
    "Too much repetition in lecture of same concepts. For content, lectures could have been a half hour long and still provided same information. Midterm was not a good reflection of ability or understanding of course material, despite the open-book, open-note format. Questions need to be re-formatted to gauge ability and understanding rather than being able to mind-read what the teacher wants you to say.",
    "Overall math isn't normally my thing, but I liked Biostats II SO MUCH BETTER than Biostats I. I think Dr. Zelterman is SO MUCH CLEARER about what is important in biostats than Dr. Claus was. I came into Biostats II DREADING it and I was happily relieved. The labs and exams were fair. I would recommend having 11 labs or something and students have to do 9 or 10... or take the 9 or 10 best grades or something...? I just know I was frustrated sometimes by getting 2 labs back at once and getting marked off on the same types of stuff on both of them. This didn't really allow me to improve from one week to the next necessarily because of the timeframe when labs are due and when you get them back.",
    "Srengths: statistics is necessaryWeaknesses: the Professor did not clearly explain the course content",
    "the class was enjoyable overall. excellent textbook.",
    "This course was incredibly redundant with health services research methods so I stopped coming to class after a certain point. Material was taught in a slow fashion and we would cover the same issues maybe 3 lectures in a row. This course could have moved at a much faster rate, covered more material and really improved my understanding of biostatistics. It did not do any of this.",
    "im not sure why there is still SAS required for this class. If we are not in Biostats division, there is no need for the SAS stuff. Just give us the outputs and graphs and focus on the analysis instead. I wasnt able to focus as much time as i wanted on analyzing info because i was hung up on the computer programming.",
    "It doesn't really add much to Statistics I. Data Management was infinitely more helpful, and really added to what we learned first semester...plus, it actually taught us how to use SAS. The lectures were verbatim out of his course packet, so there was no need to go to class. And for lab, he gave the SAS code on V2 so there was no incentive to actually have to learn how to write the code. The labs took an hour at most to complete, and attendance in the lab period was not required. Since the exam is open book, basically no incentive to put much work in. I'd suggest Data Mgmt being the required follow up course to Stats I. Absolutely necessary in my view. This? not so much.",
    "Labs were very annoying and not very helpful.",
    "Strength: Great teacher- he applies the concepts to a wide variety of topics outside of the health field.Weakness: Fails to focus more on public health.",
    "It moves a little slow. For policy students, the Methods class is usually weeks ahead of Stats, which makes it a little redundant. I really liked Zelterman's book, it definitely helped clarify some things from Methods that I had trouble understanding. There should be a way to combine the two courses though.",
    "good",
    "it's not a well taught class. it needs improvement and also 8:30 in the morning is a horrible time for students to go to a class",
    "This course is an ok overview but very scattered and hard to follow.",
    "I do not care for Biostats and this course was not that bad. If you pay attention and go to class, you will do fine. The worst part is that the class is early in the morning.",
    "This course moves very slowly, and everything is repeated multiple times. This is good if you don't want to pay attention, but the result is that you don't learn as much as you could in a semester-long course. The beginning of the class has a lot of repetition from Biostat I. This is also a biostatistics course with very little math. Again, great if you are not a numbers person, but the material is not explored to its full potential.",
    "It is amazing course and It was really interesting. The only problem was it is too early in the morning",
    "the lecture is really good. But too early in the moring",
    "Strengths: Basic review of principals learned in other classes (methods for policy folks, data management for others).Weaknesses: Same - it's essentially a review of other material.",
    "Prof Zelterman made the course great.",
    "Better labs, and not teaching the material the same week as we have the lab on it. I was never sure how to apply concepts from class to the lab assignments.",
    "This course was very duplicative with Research Methods.",
    "It moved too slowly, felt too dumbed down. The fact that everything the instructor said was in his book made it less motivating to go to class.",
    "Very helpful course, integrated \"real-life\" statistics every class by starting off with a graph from current news stories. Really taught me what sort of method I should be thinking of using for any situation I'm presented with.Taught from the book...but used only those examples. Might be helpful to have additional examples explained in the book so that we can try applying a bit more. As it exists, the book gives thought questions but no explanations to the additional questions.",
    "The only issue I had was sometimes class time and examples from the book were redundant. This lessened the necessity to attend class.",
    "The textbook was clearlyw written and thoughtful; however, the professor would benefit by dedicating more classtime to material not covered in the book, and moving more quickly through topics that are awkwardly reiterated.",
    "Strengths are that is it gives good instruction as to how to be literate in statistics. I think thought it would have been better had it been a little more technical and really gone into the math.",
    "It is very different from first semester biostats. The course is much more abstract, which can be a negative if you prefer more calculations and concrete math. I think the course is very slow placed, and it seems that a lot of the material could be covered quicker. Because it is more abstract, the exams consist more of trying to figure out the correct wording that the graders are looking for.",
    "Overall good review of materials learned in first semester. While the analysis portion focuses too much on SAS during the lecture period. This is better done in the lab period where hands on experience can be had.",
    "This course was more of an abstract take on biostatistics - relative to BIS505a (Dr. Claus's course). So I thought the two courses complemented each other well, particularly when taken in succession. A major strength of the course is Professor Zelterman, whose amiability, intelligence, and passion for statistics really shows in his teaching methods. Furthermore, his ability to integrate current events (e.g., NYT articles, graphs, charts, etc.) into his lectures was a good way to engage students. A major weakness (at least for me) was the extremely liberal nature of the labs. Although I appreciated the leeway with which we could complete the labs, I felt a little more structure was necessary so the major points of interest of the lecture could be reinforced.",
    "Strength: The instructor is very passionate about statistics, and seemingly is very enthusiastic about it. He has a unique teaching style.Weakness: An assessment should probably be done in terms of what we do and do not know in the beginning. I felt the first half of the course pretended that biostat 1 during the fall did not exist. I wished we could have use that time to better understand what we did in second half of the course, or even study the second half more in depth.I am not sure the math background of students in the class, but for me it was frustrating at times not going through formulas or trying to understand the math derivations in conjunction with the statistics. He should have something supplementary for the people who are interested?",
    "The course grading structure is very fair. However, the course moves very slowly and the tests are structured in an odd way.",
    "Our professor was very nice, but he really just repeated what was in the book (and repeated himself within class a bunch). The material was relevant and I really liked that the course was focused on interpreting SAS, as opposed to writing code. He wanted us to be able to make sense of SAS output and to be able to pick a method for dealing with a certain situation. I thought that these two topics were very useful. I also liked the book - it was useful during lab write-ups and made the concepts very easy to understand.One year of BIS505 is too much, especially if you take Methods. Maybe I and II could each be a quarter long - we are in grad school and should be expected to move at a faster pace. The material is spread too thin by going for a full year.",
    "The labs were a good way to apply the information learned in the book\/lecture.",
    "As a required course, it was not too bad. The class was very poorly attended (<25% of the class was there on any given day) because the lectures followed the book practically to the word. That being said--the lectures were good if you hadn't looked at the book or wanted a review. The labs were good, and the tests were not impossible.",
    "The course taught a lot of concepts in interpreting statistical data. While this was interesting, the instructor could have gone through a few examples in detail in class because the information can be overwhelming at times. Although the textbook is a good guide, there are more questions than answers in it, and therefore it doesn't make for good self-study. More thorough examples of statistical interpretation might be more helpful.",
    "Strengths: Repetition. Zelterman did a wonderful job at reviewing class material, and explaining the same thing many times, in many ways so the class would understand and retain the lesson. By the end of lecture, abstract concepts like Survival Analysis and Poisson seemed rote, which I think is a success.Weaknesses: Lack of Public Health Examples. It would have liked Zelterman to teach Logisitic, Poisson, Linear and other regressions using health outcomes (y) and health risk factors (x). Lottery, and temperature examples are great for model clarity but do not translate into public health models easily. For example, risk factor multicollinearity (e.g. age and length of illness) prohibits us from selecting the correct risk factors for our model easily. It would be nice to see two sessions (1 week) dedicated to risk factor selection in public health models. For example, NEJM\/Health Affairs studies that have gained\/lost statistical power based on the model selection and risk factors used.",
    "The class material was organized well, but the lectures were not that helpful, so I pretty much didn't go to class for the latter half of the semester.",
    "This was a good course, but not my favorite. I liked the in-depth focus on a few important statistical tools. It seemed like the lectures were rather unfocused, and the labs not entirely necessary (as we already had the SAS code). The lab reports grew a bit monotonous as the semester went by.",
    "Strengths: straightforward textbook and lectures; very fair examsWeaknesses: often repetitive",
    "What I appreciated most about this course was the introduction and hands-on application for multiple types of statistical analysis tools. The strength of this course is its practical application to future careers in public health.",
    "The lectures progressed very slowly and they were repetitive. The labs were also much more difficult than lecture prepared us for.",
    "I felt like this course was very repetitive and it wasn't neccessary to attend class each week because the same material was covered over and over again. We also looked at a lot of examples that had nothing to do with public health, which seemed liked a waste of time since this was a BIOstatistics class and not a STATISTICS class.",
    "This was a good course. By the end, I felt that I had a good grasp of what I need to know in order to approach analyzing data, no matter its form.",
    "Dr. Zelterman obviously loves biostatistics and has a brilliant mind. Unfortunately, many times his explanations and examples were a little bit too abstract for me. Additionally, I did not feel the midterm and the final really reflected what I had learned in biostatistics.",
    "The book is fantastic; lectures are extremely redundant and not worth going to, given that the textbook covers all of the information. The labs are instructive and not too tedious.",
    "This is a very good course which helps understand the basic concepts",
    "The class moves a little slow, and the handwriting is really difficult to comprehend on the overhead projector.",
    "I found the course to replicate Methods, but at a much slower pace. I feel that the course should be amped up and be more challenging. The book is a bit unclear at times. I am not sure how it could be improved.",
    "Overall I thought this was a great course. The review stuff in the beginning was a little long; and the last section was rushed. Maybe less review; and more hazard. I liked the book and the a lab question. Definitely a strength. The data set were interesting and generally had at least one unexpected outcome.",
    "it's a very useful tool and way of thinking, but some of the materials are redundant.",
    "The class could use some more structure. Chapter summaries at the end of each class unit would be helpful.",
    "The book is amazing. So good though, you dont really need to go to class. He is a great book writer. The class moved a little slow for my taste, but I feel like I learned all the information.There should be higher standards for the TAs.",
    "Statistics, I don't know. It is what it is.",
    "I found that this class was built upon BIS 505A well, but sometimes things in the class were too repetitive.",
    "The pace of the class was very slow. I believe the course could be better developed to include more material. The \"lab\" assignments were meaningless because we received NO feedback on them, so I still don't know if anything I wrote was correct or incorrect. Since I received no feedback, the assignments were useless and didn't help me learn anything or correct my errors or misconceptions.",
    "I really liked what material was taught and what was given to us (i.e. we were given the code, but were expected to learn how to interpret results).",
    "The course provided a satisfactory exploration of Biostatistics beyond what was covered in the fall semester class. I sometimes found it difficult to follow the instructional style, but I learned a lot from the labs.",
    "Attendance should be a part of the overall class grade. Most students do not attend."

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Zelterman was a nice guy and knew the material but taught it to us as if we had no understanding of biostatistics going in: at one point he wrote the definition of \"median\" on the overhead. Material was covered multiple times over, which made it very clear but also very frustrating if you already had a grasp on the material.The exams were not difficult - I finished the midterm in 20 minutes and got 3 points marked off, which did not pressure me to actually learn any material. I basically indexed my notes and brought the text with me and looked up the subject matter for each question to respond.

He is a bit quirky and spends some of his lecture time on things I would not choose to, but he gets his point across.

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0As I said before, he is very enthusiastic. Strengths and weaknesses were also assessed in the overall assessment--strength: he has a unique teachings style and genuinely is passionate about statistics. Weakness: he should do some type of survey in the beginning about student's math\/stat background or at the bear minimum assume that we can comprehend what we learned in biostat 1.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Daniel Zelterman is a nice man. He explains things well and uses examples to make it easier to undertand real-world applications of course material. However, his lectures are extremely repetitive. He goes over the same material at least twice in the same exact way, so going to lecture once a week is completely sufficient.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great professor. Dr. Zelterman did a wonderful job of using examples from all subject areas (even those outside of public health and medicine) to apply the biostatistics that we were learning in class. He was fair and accessible to students.",

He talks about the formulas and tests as if they are old friends, and explains things using items from the news and other real life examples.It's obvious he's taught this class many times--not only in the ease with which he lectures, but in the stop-me-if-you've-heard-this-one way he tends to repeat stories or examples. But in the end, I learned what I needed to, and it wasn't bad.",

Open book exams actually improved students' preparation, commitment and enjoyment of the material - good idea!Weaknesses: Answering questions in class. Zelterman taught from the book. This was great for content consistency, but left advanced students wanting more. I noticed that these students stopped coming to class.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I felt like he knew the subject very well, but didn't always explain it in the best way. His constant repetition made it feel like he didn't think we grasped the concepts very well and he sometime responded to questions in a way that it discouraged participation - for example, if a student asked for clarification on something because they forgot how to caculate a certain test, he kind of embarassed the student for not remembering how to do something for the previous semester.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is very nice and enthusiastic.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0His lecturing style is charming, but extremely boring if you have any statistics background or if you read the textbook.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Excellent instructor",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Really positive and nice sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I only attended perhaps 3 classes for the entire year, but I believe the professor has quite a bit of spunk, which is nice. I just found that I could learn everything I needed through the book.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very Good. I really like his lecture style. Starting the class off with the graphs from the news was a good learning experience. I liked that.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr Zelterman is very passionate and experieced in teaching the course.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very nice guy.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor was very understanding, easy to talk to and great at making links to everyday examples of the material at hand.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The book is amazing. So good though, you dont really need to go to class. He is a great book writer.He is very clear and explained things very well. He is also very receptive to questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Wonderful professor. His approach was certainly unique, but very effective.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was always energetic in the morning and was always willing to answer questions students may have.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He explains concepts very clearly and thoroughly, but as I said above, the pace of the class was very slow. He could move through the material quicker.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He made the material interesting and fun. The class was much more enjoyable with him as the instructor than I think it would be with anyone else.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Good instructor and very available for additional help with the concepts."

    "Brian Merry was an excellent TA; very understanding of the purpose of the course and emphasizing understanding rather than rote memorization and regurgitation of facts. Extremely accessible, even going so far as to give feedback on labs to all students, even those outside his lab. Very good explaining content and keep presentations short so as to provide maximum help to students.",

    "Brian Merry was a great TA, extremely helpful.",
    "Brian was amazing and very infomative",
    "The TAs for this course were just ok. The major issue was that they cancelled the final exam review session at 3pm on the Friday that it was to be held. The review was supposed to be Friday at 5pm when the exam was Monday at 8am. For those students who saved up their questions - like myself - to ask during the review session, there was no opportunity to ask any questions since the 5pm Friday session was cancelled and the exam was Monday morning at 8am. Therefore, many students were unable to ask questions of the TAs prior to the exam. The TA's cancelling the review was lazy on their part.",
    "really nice and considerate of the students",
    "My TA was Paula Chatterjee. She was a fantastic TA. Paula handled her lab sections skillfully, was able to explain what we needed to know, and answered questions patiently and knowledgeably.",
    "The TA did a great job",
    "Paula Chatterjee: Wow. She is a smart woman and a great teacher. She'll go far.",
    "Paula.She knows her stuff but always seems to be rushing through tutorials.",

    "Paula was an excellent TA, her lab sessions served as a great review",
    "Ashley was great.",
    "I had Paula Chatterjee who was great.",
    "Brian was very helpful in lab and beyond with any other questions.",
    "Brian Merry is a great TA. He has incredible patience and knowledge. However, I would have liked some more structure to the lab. Perhaps incorporating 2-3 necessary objectives to complete in the lab would be helpful. In addition, reviewing more in depth how to interpret SAS output would have been helpful.",
    "Paula was really good and understanding :). She is also a good speaker.",
    "Varnee was a good TA. She was approachable and kind, but didn't always explain things very well.",
    "Paula Chatterjee was great! Great at teaching the lab material and very approachable for questions.",
    "I cannot say enough good things about Paula Chatterjee and the job that she did as a TA. She was remarkably competent and prepared to answer any and all questions that came up in labs or about the course material in general. She was also very quick to respond to emails.",
    "Brian Merry - he was great. He was accessible (even allowing us to email a draft of our lab report in before final submission) and was always pleasant during class.",
    "Varnee was good but she was a tough grader. There is no reason to take of a third of the grade for something trivial.",
    "Ashley Jaksa (sp?) was a great TA. She helped us in a step-by-step way that made sense. Because I had a bad experience in lab last semester, I wasn't looking forward to lab, but with Ashley it was fine, and I actually got better at using SAS. Who knew that was possible?!",
    "Ashley is a great TA, learned a lot from her and she is good at taking complex problems, breaking them down and feeding us the salient points to remember.",
    "Varnee was great, but Ashley and other TAs were known to provide more to their students in terms of study aid materials and time.",
    "Brian was an excellent TA, and was always available if we had questions about our labs or about topics from lecture.",
    "Paula Chatterjee. Paula was great - very helpful, available for questions, and knowledgeable.",
    "Helpful, available TAs; provided useful, timely feedback on assignments.",
    "Paula Chatterjee was an excellent TA. She always provided a mini lecture during lab, putting a new spin on the material from class. She was also always available and willing to answer questions.",
    "Ashley JaksaShe did her best to help the class and answer questions, but she was not a good instructor. Her explanations were rushed and unclear.",
    "TA: Varnee Murugan - She was nice and explained the labs fairly well. I felt like she didn't know the concepts well enough to answer questions that were asked about them in a clear and concise way.",
    "My TA was Ashley. She was very helpful, knowledgeable, and prepared for lab. I have no critical comments on her performance. However, the TAs cancelled the final review session before the exam for what appears to be no reason. It was definitely not helpful for them to cancel, even if they offer e-mail as an alternative.",
    "Varnee was really helpful and provided a lot of constructive feedback.",
    "Paula Chatterjee was a phenomenal TA! She explained concepts and SAS programs very clearly, was available for advice, and made coming to lab an enjoyable experience.",
    "My TA Bryan Merry was great at explaining if we had questions.",
    "B. Merry was great. He was informative and very willing to help.",
    "The TA's were probably the biggest weakness of the class. Though this might just be because I really like the rest of the class. While the TA knew everything they should've know and conveyed that clearly. I didn't think in general that they knew the math in a super detailed manner. You could trip them up with advanced but still relevant mathy questions. In short, they didn't go above and beyond which I thought the other components of the class did.",
    "Varnee is very helpful clarifying my questions and concerns.",
    "Paula Chatterjee--Great!",
    "Ashley was great she conducted lab sections very professionally and helped answer any questions. She also conducted great review sections.",
    "My TA was very good. Ashley had a good understanding of the material and was very helpful.",
    "Paula was my TA, she was excellent! She explained the lab thoroughly and was always able to answer questions.",

   "comments": [
    "I am not a \"math person\" and I felt that I could handle this course and more importantly, I learned a lot.",
    "A COMPLETE AND UTTER WASTE OF OUR TIME. i'm not on principle against taking a second semester stats course or one at 8:30. lord knows my quant skills need work and there is plenty to learn. but don't waste my damn time and money on meaningless course content. and don't say that it's important to make sure everyone is on the same level of stats understanding b\/c we all come from different backgrounds. by doing this, you dilute the value of my experience and yours. if people need that much catch-up, why were they admitted into an MPH?plus, the very premise of pigeon-holing us into learning everything about SAS is absurd. not everyone uses it, most people use SPSS, so don't structure a course about teaching us SAS. give us depth.",
    "easy, basic statistical class. if you want real statistical, dont take this class.",
    "Content was useful to some degree. Classes not mandatory because teacher wrote book as well and just repeats what is in book in the class almost verbatim. If you have to take it, take it, but if you can waive out of it, waive the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who needs to take a biostats course. Dr. Zelterman should teach Biostats I also! I would recommend his book to anyone taking a biostats course as well. It is so clear and helpful. I'm glad I was taking Methods at the same time as Biostats II as well because I think that helped too. Perhaps Methods should be taught earlier so I would have understood Biostats I better as well?",
    "The course is necessary, so just get through it.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone wanting to develop their statistics knowledge beyond the elementary level introduced in BIS I.",
    "I would recommend that other students not take this course if at all possible. It was redundant, poorly organized and not a valuable use of time or money.",
    "You have to take it.",
    "It's required, but if it weren't I would recommend that students take methods instead.",
    "its a required course - this class teaches you to use how to decide which statistical test to use when presented with a problem.",
    "It's a requirement I had to take it. It's relatively easy but gets really boring really fast.",
    "not necessary, but required",
    "This course is a mandatory requirement. Therefore, what I say does not matter as students are required to take it.",
    "Biostat II is required for most MPH students, and a useful follow on to Biostat I. However, it is very slow. You will not have to put in much work outside of class, except for sometimes finishing up labs. If you go to lecture, reading the book is really supplemental. Looking over the old midterms and finals is crucial, as Dr. Zelterman has a unique style for writing test questions.",
    "It's required...but if you have ANY past classes involving regression analysis, try to opt out. You'll learn everything you're going to learn in this class from Methods or Data Management.",
    "This course was wonderful because of the prof.",
    "This course was very duplicative with Research Methods.",
    "It's a required course. But, the school should not ask students to take both BiostatII and Methods, since both classes are essentially teaching the same things!",
    "\"Yes, it's required. But it's also extremely helpful. You'll actually end up enjoying statistics.\"",
    "The textbook is wonderful and Dr. Zelterman is quite knowledgeable, but the class is too redundant.",
    "general overview of basic methods used in statisitics.",
    "Broad based review of methods covered in first semester, only slightly more indepth. Course can be a little slow moving at times. Overall would recommend the course.",
    "BIS505b is a more abstract version of the first semester's biostatistics course. It is an important course prior to engaging in summer research and internship because it provides you with a foundational knowledge of how you could manipulate your data. This course coupled with Data Management is a great duo.",
    "This is a requirement for most students, so I'm not exactly sure what the point of a recommendation would be. I would tell the student for the first half, brace yourself for recap of biostat 1. Beware come 2nd part though, it actually got surprisingly challenging.",
    "Good introduction to regression and modeling. Tests are mostly fair although a few questions come out of left field. Zelterman wrote the textbook and teaches pretty much directly from the book so if you do the reading, you probably don't need to go to class (or vice versa). Labs are good practice with using SAS.",
    "I would recommend the course even though it is required. This course provides the student with a much deeper understanding of how to go about selecting the appropriate statistical method to use in any given situation, which arguablyis of equal or greater importance to being able to in turn execute the calculations themselves.",
    "This course builds on BIS505 I, but if you take it concurrently with Methods, it goes at a slow pace. That's not to say it's not important, but just that you may feel Methods goes much more quickly. I would recommend buying the book, because most of the in-class notes are already in the book - this way, you can just make extra comments next to what he's already stated. It focuses on reading SAS output (not writing it) and being able to choose the correct statistical test for a given problem with data - these are both very useful skills.I would recommend it for a quarter class (BIS I and BIS II should each just be a quarter in the first semester).",
    "if you read the book and do the practice tests then you are good to go. he is a humorous lecturer but the lectures aren't really worth going to.",
    "Well... you have to take it so you might as well!",
    "Yes. It's compulsory for my division but even if it was not, I will take it. This class complements the \"hard\" stats you learned in Biostats 101 and enhances your understanding of concepts and analytical skills further.",
    "This is an excellent foundation class that is a must before graduation, however if you already have strong epidemiology OR biostat experience, this will be a review. If incoming students can transfer-in credit, or otherwise prove their competency, collect your 2 credits and move on to your specialized interests!",
    "The class takes a more in depth approach to the various types of regression analysis. I would recommend this class to another student because it is required for the MPH degree.",
    "This class continues thefirst semester of statistics required in Public Health. For those familiar with Dr. Clause's fall class, this class is slower paced and slightly more ambiguous. It focuses mainly on linear and logistic regressions, poisson distributions, survival curves, etc but goes into greater detail and spends more time on them. The overall workload is more consistent (not centered around large assignments) and the learning curve less steep as SAS fundamentals should already be known. The exams are also shorter and largely in essay format.",
    "This course is helpful in obtaining an introductory knowledge of multiple types of statistical analysis tools. It is very much a springboard into more complex biostatistics classes, for those who are quantitatively-inclined.",
    "This is a required course, so unless you have had a course similar enough to get out of it, you just have to get through it. Honestly, if you had a choice, I would not recommend this course. The first semester, Biostatistics was one of my favorite classes and just with the structure of the class and the teaching style, this semester, Biostatistics was one of my least favorite classes.",
    "Overall, this is a good course. By the end, you will feel that you know how to approach analyzing data given to you, what methods to use, and what potential problems can arrise with the methods you have chosen.",
    "Great course, easy to follow in class or from the book",
    "Yes! Interesting class with a great focus on interpreting data.",
    "I have recommended it. I'm an engineering phd student (BME). While we generally have a foundation in probability and stochastic modeling, we haven't usually taken a big picture course of this quality. This is a good course for anyone dealing with biomedical problems.",
    "it's a very practical course.",
    "Required. Bring coffee.",
    "This course is a helpful extension of the first semester biostatistics class. The material reviewed in this class had useful applications in data analysis of real public health research.",
    "Yeah, if you have to take it. I learned a lot.",
    "For future students, make sure you understand the previous exams, since the concepts are generally the same every year.",
    "slow paced. if you read the textbook, there is little point in going to lecture. The labs were useless because I didn't learn anything from them.",
    "The material is dry and uninteresting, but it is presented in a way that makes it easy to learn and you will get a better understanding of biostats having taken this course."
