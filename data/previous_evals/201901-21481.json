   "comments": [
    "This course taught me the vocabulary and methodology to exploring the intersections of national identity and ethnicity. It also exposed me to a variety of literature on the subject which I intend to use for my senior research.",
    "I developed knowledge of identity formation and the political consequences of those identities (e.g nationalism, secession, voting patterns). We studied identity through the lens of a variety of disciplines, including social psychology, history, behavioral economics, and political science. The class focuses largely on utilizing theoretical frameworks to think about identity and its consequences.",
    "Learned about individual identity (ethnic and otherwise), social identity, nations & nationhood, as well as the relevance of these themes re: politics and political theory. International scope. Good class if you want to better understand how social identity shapes the world and its political structure, from micro to macro level.",
    "So much. Haha. Knowledge: Conceptualization and formal definitions of ethnicity, nationality, identity, and a score of other concepts to begin with; then moving into how they applied to general concepts of ethnic conflicts, governments, democracies, and voting; then case studies into countries with stateness problems into surprisingly great detail. And much more. Skills: Reading, thinking critically (comprehensively, formally, rigorously) about identities and categories. Insights: How powerful and meaningful identities can be, how much more rigorous the subject matter is than I thought it would, how abstract definition are so easily applied to our real world.",
    "A thorough and well-rounded understanding of the politics of ethnicity and race!",
    "Knowledge about identity and race around the world",
    "I learned a lot on national and ethnic identity, a subject on which I really had no prior knowledge.",
    "I learned a lot about national and ethnic identity as well as the academic theories that lie beneath this area of study.",
    "I learned about the variability of identity and the differences between ethnic and national identity, as well as how these identities play into interpersonal relationships, and larger inter group relationships.",
    "I gained an incredible amount of insight into the nuances of identity, politics, and relations.",
    "the fundamentals of ethnicity and nationality, how they are defined, how they affect personal and social identity, and the concrete applications of these impacts",
    "I learned a lot of about the nuances of identity and the construction of nation and ethnicity.",
    "How to think about ideology and its consequence in political reality from different approaches (social psychology, political economics, conflict studies, history)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course was taught really well, but it could benefit from assignments that allow students to be creative in applying the coursework. It was very strong in that the assignments were clearly written and it was really clear what was expected of the students.",
    "The strengths of the course include its international scope and effective structuring. While the class does incorporate cases related to the US, a significant portion of class time is spent discussing cases of identity formation outside the United States. The class content is also structured in a way that allows for each class session to be logically related to the next. Professor Hierro divides the class in two halves, where the first half is related to identity formation and the second half is related to the consequences of those identities.",
    "Strengths: discussion & debates were prevalent, made the class feel more interactive. The assignments help you to better conceptualize and understand the material, they force you to explain the studied concepts in your own words. Material is super relevant. Comparative approach. Professor is really dedicated to her students. Cons: Dealt mostly with the Western world. Our class questioned the theoretical backing for the class, unsure if it had helpful, real-world applications.",
    "Strengths: Maria Jose is very passionate about the material and it shows! I liked the moments of group collaboration. Weakness: The readings can be a bit dense and the material can get to be a bit try.",
    "The course is perfectly structured to go through academic\/technical concepts and real-life\/application-based case studies.",
    "Strengths: encourages participation Weaknesses: assignments on syllabus should be clearer",
    "Strengths - Professor Hierro is amazing and so kind! Classes are interesting and engaging Weaknesses - occasionally the readings can be too long and sometimes lecture slides had too dense of information to write everything down in notes",
    "The largest strength of this class is the ability to think critically of all definitions of identity because we are introduced to so many. This allows us to more thoughtfully understand identity and what it includes.",
    "This course was based on a balance of discussion and lecture which made it very engaging and effective - Professor Hierro is absolutely the best part of the course.",
    "Professor Hierro is such a sweet and genuine educator! Sometimes the literature\/theory was rather dense\/dry, but Professor Hierro is really invested and intentional about making sure students understand the concepts.",
    "Strengths: well-organized and covered a wide range of material Weaknesses: maybe too little review",
    "Today's political societies is full of what is called \"identity politics\" but it is not always clear what is meant by \"identity,\" why identity is important, what consequence identity brings, how we can measure \"identity\" and its consequence (sometimes identity is too vague and subjective) etc. This class allows us to question the deep issues involved in the umbrella term \"identity politics\" and critically think about these issues. Although this class is focused mainly upon quantitative, sensus-focused, approach (therefore, there was less qualitative, phylosophical or conceptual, discussion about the significance of identity), it was great to know how identity is deeply connceted to the formation of political\/economic\/social reality of our modern society."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's really chill and the professor is great!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in the topic. While this course can be very engaging at times, it can also be very theoretical. The workload is not too overwhelming. Grading is also extremely fair. 40% of your grade comes from homework assignments, while 50% comes from two exams and 10% comes from participation. The exams are written and are extremely doable. The class size is also optimal. While the class is larger than a seminar, it is small enough to allow for individual participation.",
    "Yes, the class is well-structured, the professor is wonderful, and the course stays true to the syllabus.",
    "Yes, hands-down. I've only just finished my first year, but this was definitely the best course I've taken at Yale so far. Although the teacher was disorganized sometimes, her passion during office hours and how much she cares about her students and their opinions completely made up for it. And I've never been in a class that was so hybridly theoretical and applicable. I'm very thankful to her and the other students for this class, and I wish I could have put even more time and effort into it.",
    "Yes, definitely! Everyone should take an ER&M course at Yale.",
    "Yes, it gives you greater insight into the relationship between politics and race\/ethnicity in a global context",
    "Yes! Class is very interesting and you learn a lot about all sorts of theories of ethnic and national identity. Professor Hierro is so kind, caring, and very knowledgeable.",
    "Absolutely. You will learn so much without feeling overwhelmed and the information is useful in other classes as well as everyday interactions.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professor Hierro is meticulously organized and a great lecturer, and the assignments were varied to cater to different learning strengths",
    "If you are interested in political science, esp. quantitative one, I'd definitely recoommend it. If you are more interested in qualitative approach, you may be at first confused how to deal with the data\/survey\/statistics that you have to deal with in the class, but you can get habituated soon and it's good to get a basic understanding about how to quantitise the often subjective concepts like identity or identification (so, think of this course as an \"introduction\" to the quantitative study of identity)."
