   "comments": [
    "This class forced me to think very critically about how one goes about gaining insights from data. I did not really come to many positive conclusions, mostly negative ones, which was a little unsatisfying. So many lectures had these stunning insights\/ moments which was pretty cool. I imagine I'll be a far more critical scientist for it won't take papers' claims so seriously unless I myself analyze it very carefully.",
    "Great introduction to philosophy of science",
    "How to think.",
    "Dr. Greco's philosophy of science class honed my ability to analyze philosophical concepts pertaining to the philosophy of science. This was an area I was largely unfamiliar with. Consequently, the course has given me an excellent overview of the field, as I am now familiarized with many of its debates. It has certainly improved my literacy and ability to work within the field.",
    "After taking my first PHIL class last term, I was hesitant to take this class because my first experience was not great, but I still enjoy the subject. However, Prof. Greco and our TF, Kate, were phenomenal and I enjoyed the course very much. I learned more than I had expected from this course, and feedback from the instructors were always very helpful in improving both my writing and evaluation of philosophy readings.",
    "Knowledge: We learned about age-old epistemic concerns within one of our most trusted and widely used epistemic means (science). If you see many dogs with four legs, how do you come to think that all dogs have four legs? Why will the sun rise tomorrow (the problem of induction)? If a drug company tests many things and only publishes the statistically significant results, should we worry (evidential defeat)? Should we believe the unobservable posits of our theories actually exist (Realism vs. Instrumentalism)? Do all facts supervene on physical facts (Humeanism)? Do all laws (even in the special sciences) supervene on physical laws (Fundamentalism)? Is physics the fundamental science? After building this foundation, we turned to modern science issues. Did you think the female orgasm has a Darwinian story behind it (adaptationism)? (Wrong if so!) Do you know how to define meaning (semantics in Linguistics)? Skills: I got more experience writing philosophy papers, this time emphasizing (clarity, yes), but also having novel insights. I had to think really hard to have these. You get to choose your topic among ~4 for each of 2 papers. Then for the final paper, you totally come up with your own. I found this difficult but very rewarding.",
    "We learned all about the philosophy of science - the course description is accurate.",
    "Learned to think about issues in philosophy of science and epistemology."

   "comments": [
    "A couple stunning insights every week. A scientist who takes this class very seriously may become quite formidable in the field for it, I truly believe. Pretty niche subject area. Not sure how many people like this kind of thing, but I think it is important that the course is out there at Yale for an undergrad interested in epistemology and the philosophy of science. So, I don't know what I'd change. The course is well prepared for this hypothetical undergrad.",
    "The material was interesting, but I wish the instructor did a better job showing how all of the topics we covered are related",
    "Great class, lectures, and assignments. I can't think of any improvements.",
    "The class had an excellent structure, requiring a fair amount of work from the student.The paper lengths were reasonable, as well as the reading load. I have no suggestions for modification.",
    "Prof. Greco is very engaging in class and presents material that is relatively easy to follow. The only improvements I can see in the class is to explain concepts at an easier pace, as some things were very difficult to understand and I sometimes fell behind in class.",
    "Strengths: Dan is very clear and draws helpful distinctions during lectures. He encourages participation and responds thoughtfully. He moves up and down the abstraction ladder to give you the principles grounded in examples. I really like this style. The papers were graded very thoughtfully. Kate, the TA, was fantastic. Weaknesses and Improvements: The readings got very dense especially during the realism\/empirical instrumentalism and fundamentalism debates. It was easy to forget what was even being debated, and oftentimes authors were not responding to one another. I liked that Dan did not dwell on the complicated parts of these readings. In Bayes vs. Frequentism, there should have been more of a unit on all the math, and worked examples.",
    "The structure of the course is good - no complaints.",
    "Sections could be more comprehensive."

   "comments": [
    "Not sure. Sometimes I didn't find the subject matter all that interesting. But I felt like every week there would be at least one stunning insight that made it pretty worth going to lecture. It definitely has its moments. In all, I'd say it's a pretty niche subject area. If you like epistemology and don't just think it's the most dismal science there ever was (can't prove induction, I'm sorry), you'll probably like it. Those looking more for metaphysics (as I was) probably won't like it as much.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in both philosophy and science (obviously)",
    "Perfect class for a STEM-student who is genuinely interested in philosophy. Look up \"The Raven Paradox\": if you like abstract thought experiments like these this class is for you.",
    "Yes. I believe an understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of science is extremely important. This class provides students with a helpful (but detailed) overview of the subject.",
    "Yes, this class is a great one in the PHIL department, even if you are not in STEM. The readings and material were about as challenging as other courses, but the topics were more interesting and engaging.",
    "A very good course. You get an eclectic group of students with diverse biases (physics students, philosophy majors, biology, etc.). Kate Stanton is a great TA, hopefully she's still teaching it. Dan is a clear lecturer and an approachable guy. Participation is encouraged, which I like. It's not too high-browed philosophical; it's a very grounded course. It does get abstract at times, and it's definitely more of a philosophy than a science course.",
    "Take this if you're interested in philosophy or science.",
    "No. As a philosophy major who has taken numerous classes with harder professors, I really think Dan set unreasonable expectations for this class."
