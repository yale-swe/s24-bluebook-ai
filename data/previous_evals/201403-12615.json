    "you research 20hrs a week and then you do an oral presentation and then do a grant proposal at the end.",
    "495 can be rewarding. Make sure you talk with your PI and immediate supervisor about what exactly your responsibilities will be for the 20 hours and how you will schedule them into your week. (i.e. Can that time be spent background reading or writing your proposal or are you expected to do lab chores? Can you run your experiments alone on the weekend?) 20 hours isn't too difficult but it can be tough during interview season when you have to come in on weekends in addition to traveling and catching up on missed work for your other classes. I am only taking two other credits for this reason.",
    "If you like research, take this course over MCDB 475\/485. To really get involved in a meaningful project, you need 20+ hours\/week.",
    "I really loved my experience with 495. Your overall experience with the class really depends on how much time you have and the lab you are working in. 20 hours can seem like a lot if you don't plan your schedule around it. I planned my schedule so that I only came into lab three days\/week for 7 hours\/day. As far as the class requirements, there isn't really too much outside of physically being in the lab; there is a 5-page specific aims due during shopping period, a 10-minute powerpoint presentation (and you have to attend 3 days of presentations), and a 10-page mock grant proposal due on the last day of class. There isn't really much guidance, so you will have to look up how to do everything on your own. I chose to do 495 because I thought that was the amount of time required to get any real results. I'm glad that I chose 495 and it really doesn't feel like that much time. Make sure that you have worked with the lab you choose before you commit to this. That specific aims is due during shopping period, so you need to have either already worked with this lab (I think a lot of us worked with our labs during the summer) and already know what your specific project is going to be when you get on campus.",
    "Take it!",
    "MCDB 495 is a great course for anyone who wants to conduct research for credit."
