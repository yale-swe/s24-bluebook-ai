    "This course taught several crucial ideas in conceptual semantics. The papers read were awesome! Discussions in class were great for synthesizing material. The papers taught how to perform the experimental method for conceptual semantic research by \"doing.\" Papers were constructed so that lessons learned by error (first-hand) in previous papers could be applied to latter papers."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course and great material. However, given the nature of the papers (experiments and stat analysis), much more emphasis should have been placed on how to perform experimental analysis and how to construct an experiment from a hypothesis. The \"learn by doing\" nature of the course worked great for internalizing why experiments should be constructed the way they should, but more explicit instruction would help expedite the learning process and allow for more sophisticated experiments\/analysis.",
    "I really liked that we got experience with experiment design and implementation. However, I did not always feel like the connections between the experiments we read about and the broader concepts were clear. In general, the format of the class worked well, but I think the level of difficulty was not entirely made clear-- for example, it has no prerequisite of having taken any cog sci or neuroscience course, but many of the readings drew on neuroscience concepts."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has taken Semantics I or II or equivalent. The level of discourse, semantically, is high and requires a certain level of background information. Material covered is super important! Great!",
    "I might recommend it, but I would make sure that they were prepared for an extremely intellectually challenging course. It would depend on their interests and academic goals-- for someone who wanted to go into cog sci research I definitely would, but otherwise maybe not."
