   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you must, do so with Ngame. He basically writes the rules for the rest of the classes, then ends up doing his own thing.",
    "Since you've taken 110 you know what you are getting into. A continuation of the weekly video lessons, with a focus on verb tenses and moods. Ngame is a very good professor, and is willing to help you overcome any challenges with the material. You cover more material than last semester. It remains good if you like the Capretz method, while it becomes significantly more annoying if you don't. You have to take this course if you want to get your language out of the way so you might as well do it.",
    "It is hard. You have to do all of the work to keep up. But I think that it is worth it at the end because of how much you learn.",
    "Great class! Take it! Ngame is the best!",
    "Only if you really relly really want to learn french. It is more pain than it is pleasure. You learn a lot but not so much more that it makes it worth it",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a fun class with a good community and department and you learn French.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn French. And take it with Ngame! He's the bomb",
    "Best way to learn French, although intense.",
    "I would recommend French 120 to another student who is serious about French. It is a lot of work, so students must be serious.",
    "Very intense, you will learn a lot, but the lesson in the book is no longer interesting because the story is kinda stupid",
    "French 120 is a fast-paced course that will help you learn French if you are willing to put in the time. It does require a good bit of work, with daily homework and weekly tests. I would recommend this course to someone who wants to start learning French. In the past two semesters I have learned much more of the language than I expected to.",
    "I would say that, along with FREN 110, it's a wonderful way to learn French."
