   "comments": [
    "Strengths: thought an important often overlooked topic. Had great guest speakers.Weakness: could have been better organized.",
    "The course was poorly organized and it was difficult to get in touch with the professor outside of the classroom. The assignments were not clearly specified at the beginning of the semester and the weekly homework was sometimes posted extremely late in the week. The lectures were average and loosely tied in with the readings. The course would benefit from more consistent feedback; it was unclear whether we received credit for our homework assignments.",
    "The guest speakers were a real highlight in this course, they had a diversity of experience in industry.",
    "We could learn a lot from this course.",
    "This was a great course, it was exactly what I had expected and wanted to learn.I wouldn't change anything about this course, you get exactly what you expect.",
    "strength: guest lectures are interesting;weakness: too many lecture slides per one class",
    "The course combination of core lectures and external speakers is phenomenal. Many classes could benefit from this arrangement as one directly observes the relevance of the taught concepts. Great!At times, the curriculum could be a bit better structured. For example, when revising for the final exam it still felt tough to elicit the underlying logic of lecture sequence, interdependence between topics etc.The homework assignments felt dull at times. Mostly, they involved citing the course text book. A 20% presentation on a regulatory affairs strategy for an hypothetical drug in development could be more exciting.",
    "excellent."
