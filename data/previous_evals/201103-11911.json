   "comments": [
    "Survey in medical anthro...extremely basic, superficial coverage. You learn about a few anthro buzz words, without any of the actual theoretical framework. The professor shaped the class with freshmen in mind (read: whole sectionsdevoted to talking about what a thesis is). Light reading, relatively easy midterm, two 1,000 word essays and a take home final...the work's not bad, but it's still not worth taking.",
    "If you have never taken an anthropology course before or want to see another side of medicine, take this class. For those who have taken anthropology courses it might be a bit repetitive but the material is interesting and the work is not too bad. The TAs are great.",
    "If you want to learn about the subject, and are ready to work and read, I would definitely suggest the class!",
    "I definitely recommend this class! The material is super-fascinating and really important. These are things everyone should know about. Brotherton is great too! Grading is totally fair - 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. Lots of reading, but it's interesting and not completely necessary to read every word. Take med anthro!",
    "The class certainly covered interesting topics in lecture, but some weeks the reading load was very high - be aware of this before taking the class. Course included one midterm, two short (3-4 pg) essays, and one take home final, also essay style. There is also a section. In all, I'm glad I took the course. It opened my eyes to a new area of anthropology and it was well-taught, so no complaints here.",
    "i would describe it as hard to pay attention to, and after The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, no longer engaging (to a non anthropologist major)I would not recommend this because you probably should take another anthropology class that isn't only about medicine and decide if you like anthropology",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The courseload really is not that heavy (a midterm, two short essays, and a take-home final). There is a lot of reading, but you don't really have to do it (although Prof Brotherton picks great articles to read, so its totally worth it to actually do it). I feel like I learned a lot in this class about global and public health issues, so take it if this is what you're interested in.",
    "BEST COURSE AT YALE. Honest.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It gives you a good, broad look at medical anthropology, but I must warn you that this class is very similar to Panter-Brick's Biocultural Perspectives on Global Health Class.Nonetheless, Professor Brotherton is an amazing lecturer. I am not a lecture person at all, as in, I don't learn well in that kind of setting and am better off reading things and thinking on my own. But these lectures were fantastic. You basically don't have to put in any additional work \"studying\" the material because he goes through everything so logically and coherently that it just sinks in as you listen. And the fact that the lecture is pretty long for the nature of the course actually helps with that. I love that it was all about big picture ideas and larger concepts than about memorizing nitty-gritty details that you forget anyway. Big picture is the way to go, especially at a liberal arts school. I appreciated that. You read four longer books and then there are a bunch of supplemental readings that you quickly realize are not necessary, but do come in handy when writing the papers.",
    "I would recommend Medical Anthro - it's an interesting, easy class where you can completely zone out during lectures and skim the readings and get a good grade. The assignments are entirely manageable.",
    "The class isn't too hard if you stay on top of the readings. There is a midterm, two papers, and a take-home final.",
    "I learned so much in this course about health care in the US and around the world. The set up of the class kind of sucks though because it's really easy in the first half and then suddenly after midterm we're supposed to read a book and write a paper every two weeks. The grading was a little harsh too. They basically introduce you to very complex topics with a whirlwind of information and then get frustrated when you can only make simple arguments about them.",
    "I'd recommend it to a pre-med or anyone who's interested in global health. The books are pretty interesting, as are most of the lectures. It's pretty easy to get an A, but there's a lot more work involved in getting that than I expected (four books to read, two essays, a midterm, a take-home final that can take a while, a bunch of articles to read, and mandatory section). The class definitely isn't a gut.",
    "Great class. Starts off slow but after the first midterm it gets very interesting. The information covered is so useful to the field of global health and it a great introduction to major issues in global health. Also, the books are very interesting!",
    "Yes, especially if you are thinking of going into medicine or public health! It wasn't as AMAZING as some of the reviews said it would be, but I still really enjoyed it and learned a lot. The books are all really great - though some are a bit tedious at time - and I felt like it's changed my perspective on public health and medicine for the better. It's an easy class to do well in, though lectures can get a little boring at times - especially the first couple since there are a lot of definitions. As an MCDB major, I thought it was a little wishy washy at times, and I don't think I'll take another anthro class, but I'm glad I took this one.",
    "I would definitely recommend Anth 114 if a student is considering pre-med. It is a rewarding experience. You learn a lot more about society in general and it's something that all students should experience.",
    "I would take it only if I were interested in the intersection of medicine, culture, and society. Good introduction, though somewhat specialized for a \"general\" survey intro to anthropology course.",
    "Medical anthropology is absolutely fascinating and this was a great broad introduction to the field. I really think that everyone should take this class; health, healing, sickness, and disease are parts of all of our lives, and understanding how people approach these facets of life is extremely important.",
    "If you're interested in medicine and public health, a very interesting and relatively easy class. There is a midterm, 2 short essays (1000 words) and a take-home final, all of which are pretty straight-forward. Each of the take-home assignments are based on books, but you don't have to read the entire book to do well.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in medical anthropology--it's worth it. Don't take it if you're not interested\/looking for a gut.",
    "ANTH 114 is a great course. It teaches an enormous amount about how health care really works, different health care systems across the globe (including in the United States), and health care problems in the modern age. I would absolutely recommend it to another student because I learned a lot for a relatively little amount of work. The information and readings were also very interesting.",
    "This class was very interesting. I definitely got more out of it than I expected to. A lot of my views have not only changed, but I definitely feel enlightened, particularly from the first half of the course. I am glad that I got to see things from the \"other\" side, before I enter medical school. Even though a lot of the principles you learn about are idealistic and almost unrealistic, it's still hard to deny that they are important. For example, the biomedical model used in the Western world is just one model, which certainly does have its faults; also, not everything about the health care system that we know is objective and scientific. History, culture, society, and economics do indeed play a large role in our healthcare system. I hope that I remember this class when I become a doctor, so that I stay grounded and realize that my patient's complaints, a hospital's employee hierarchy, my insurance policy, are waaaay more complicated than I ever expected.Also, another bonus, this class was super easy. I took this as a fifth-and-a-half class, so unfortunately it was on the bottom of my priority list, which I sort of regret since I wasn't able to read any of the four (or five?) books (except for the first half of the first book). I also did absolutely none of other readings (articles and publications, etc). Sometimes I felt like I was walking a fine line (i.e. not having read an entire book and needing to write a paper the same day it was due at 2:15pm), but somehow managed to get an A on everything so far (two papers and an in-class take-home, still waiting for the take-home final grade). Don't do what I did if you can help it, but just saying that this class doesn't require a big time commitment at all.",
    "It's great - Brotherton's lectures are generally fantastic, and if you're interested in the subject matter at all, the class is very interesting. You read four books and have weekly articles to read, but it ends up being nice because it's not too overloaded with reading. The curve is probably a bit tough because the class is full of premeds, but take it!",
    "This class was kind of a weird introduction to anthropology for me. It's very political. I liked that, but more theory-minded people might get frustrated at the last module, which was basically about taking political action.",
    "I have mixed feelings about my experience in Anth 114 with Professor Brotherton. On the one hand, I really enjoyed the readings for the class, especially the books. On the other hand, I felt that the lectures were frustratingly biased; I felt that I was being bombarded with an exclusively anti-biomedical perspective throughout the entire course. While I finished the course knowing quite a bit more about the weaknesses of the biomedical model, I do not feel that I received a fair overview of medical anthropology as a whole. Rather than this emphasis on his anti-biomedical stance, I would have enjoyed studying cross-cultural comparisons while focusing on the similarities between medical systems, or perhaps even learning about the weaknesses of non-biomedical systems.",
    "This class is pretty easy. The papers are easy grading. However, this is very much a global health\/health inequity class more than it is a standard medical anthropology class. I went in thinking I was getting doctor-patient relationships, but that is only the 1st 3rd of the course (and that on a very cross-cultural view). It was like the anthropology side of the global health class I took last year, which is fine, but it doesn't hint about this emphasis on the course description.",
    "Medical Anthro is a good class - I thought that the readings were good, and the subject itself is fascinating.Professor Brotherton is a pretty good professor, although his lectures aren't the strongest point of this class. (The powerpoint slides tend to be text-heavy, which makes it seem like he reads out each slide word-for-word).Assignments: two essays, take-home final.The midterm was fairly easy, but a bit long so it was difficult to finish during class time.I would recommend this class. It's a nice introduction to the field of anthropology, and medical anthro is a very cool subject (especially if you have any interest in medicine\/public health). Go for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was my favorite class this semester!",
    "This is an amazing course. I would definitely recommend this course to all, whether or not you are an Anthropology major or Pre-med. it is an eye opening course to social side of health and medicine.",
    "Great class! Take it! Its a great introduction to medical anthropology, a really interesting class, and the course load is not too heavy at all.",
    "The first half of this course (the first two books) was very interesting. The rest of the class was less so.",
    "great texts",
    "Overall I would recommend this course. This was my first anthropology course and I found it very eye opening. This course allowed me to first view medicine in a new way and then inspire to to get more involved in global health. The course load is fair. There is a very easy in class midterm, 2 1000 word papers, and a take home final. There are four books. I only disliked the third book which I found very dense. Lectures are very interesting and Brotherton is very engaging. The only problem is that there are a lot of articles assigned but you dont need to read them all. The midterm has no article in it and so you use whatever articles you want for the essays.",
    "Intro to Medical Anthropology was, overall, a good introduction to the field of medical anthropology. I feel much more informed about personal and world medical issues. It was interesting, and I think that many of the topics and issues covered are of vital importance today. The only downside to the class was the large amount of reading. I found the reading load difficult, especially since I was taking other reading-heavy courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, if you want an introductory course not just to Medical Anthropology but also Anthropology as a discipline.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a good survey lecture. But I would caution anyone taking the class to make sure they are very clear on the expectations for assignments and to not expect much creative leeway in exploring the issues discussed in class. If you are a critical thinker and interested in a more involved approach, I would recommend a seminar instead."
