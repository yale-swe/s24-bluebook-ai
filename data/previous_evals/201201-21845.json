    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Mandatory interesting lectures, weeekly section, reading responses on 50-100 pages of reading (always interesting)",
    "GLBL 214 is an opportunity to learn more about foreign aid in Africa. If you like the subject, you will find the class interesting. As a writing credit, be prepared to actually do your readings and have a weekly paper due. The grading is very very rigourous (be prepared to get 4.5\/10 on your papers), but is supposedly curved so eventually it all works out. It's a great chance to learn how to quickly synthesize lots of material, analyze, and provide oringinal thinking in quick 2-page papers. Lots of work, but I found it to be worth it. DEF not a 5th class.",
    "Lots of reading and writing, but if you're interested in Africa or development, it's totally worth it. I would recommend this course to anybody interested in those two things.",
    "Yes. African Poverty and Western Aid is a great class for both beginners and more advanced students in the topic. It does a great job of providing the student with many different opinions and approaches to the subject. The reading can get a bit heavy, but overall, the work load isn't terrible. The class also develops the student's writing ability with the weekly essays.(Having the option of only having to do 7 of the 11 essays definitely helps!)It's a great WR option for students looking to fulfill the requirement outside the English or History departments.",
    "Take it if you have zero background in development, or are ready for a littlebit of repetition if you do. If the latter, make sure to take time to delve into material to get a sense of what makes Africa unique. Also, prepare for the weekly two-page responses.",
    "I think this is a great overview of development discourse and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone thinking of going into the field. Personally, it helped me realize that working in development may not be the right path for me, but I could reasonably see it having the opposite effect for someone else.",
    "Take it.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this class. If you are genuinely committed to attempting to answer questions about underdevelopment, take this class. Professor Blattman is leaving for Columbia next year, so I'm not sure whether this course will be continued. My TA was also excellent. Be ready to work hard, read a lot, and reconsider your ideas over, and over again. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. If you are passionate, do it.",
    "I think this is a great course and even for students like me who are not oriented towards African Studies, International Affairs, or even History, it is a writing credit well worth taking with a reasonable, but not overwhelming amount of work.",
    "I would summarize African Poverty and Western Aid as an incredibly informative overview of the theories behind economic development, characteristics of the modern African state, and solutions for moving forward. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Unfortunately I believe the class won't be offered next year, but if you ever get the chance to take it, do.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you are interested in Africa, poverty, aid, or global affairs. Also, it is a ton of work so if you are not prepared to do a lot of reading and writing do not take the course or take it credit\/D.",
    "introduced me to new ideas but I felt the amount of reading and the writing expectations were so much I had to just crank work out and barely got to sink into the material to understand its facets",
    "good",
    "There's a ton of reading and writing, but it's totally worth it. Don't take the class Credit\/D.",
    "If you take any interest in Africa's problems whatsoever, this class is a must-take. The weekly essays may be daunting, but once you settle into a flow they are more than manageable (rememberthat you only have to do 7 out of the 11 possible essays, which isn't bad at all), and the readings really aren't that intense. Very worthwhile writing credit, and of course class in general.",
    "The course was enjoyable. My only complaint is that it wasn't really clear what one should write to do well on the writing assignments. I would recommend the course, but I believe Professor Blattman is leaving Yale next year, so you probably won't have the opportunity to take it.",
    "Only take this class if you're willing to commit to the intense reading schedule. It's pretty rough but very interesting.",
    "Global Affairs 214 provided a strong base for development studies and an exploration of the basics of foreign aid. However, it requires weekly essays and so is a lot of reading and writing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "There is a lot of reading but interesting with diverse authorship. I would recommend the class to anyone.",
    "If you are at all interested in Africa or development, absolutely take this course -but be prepared to work, work and work.",
    "Fantastic overview to the evolving conceptions of what the West's role should be in Africa's development. Beyond this, his class provided interesting insights into what drives development and economic growth across the entire developing world.I would absolutely recommend this course to any Columbian student. The subject matter is multifaceted and engaging\u0096\u00a0I would recommend this class if there's a good teacher for the next year.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in development in Africa, whether public or private sector.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to any students interested in taking classes on Africa, and on any students interested in International development. It is not easy, but it is worth it."
