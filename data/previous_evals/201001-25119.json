   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in power, war, or state-building. The concepts discussed were fundamental to human nature. It was a lot of reading and a moderate amount of writing but it was well worth it.",
    "This is a great class. It is about 2\/3 European history, that is, history of the formation, growth, expansion, and turbulence of European states and institutions that establish order. It is 1\/3 a study of the challenges facing incipient states today.",
    "Political Authority and State Formation examines why states form, how prevailing norms of sovereignty and legitimacy came about, and why some states and systems prevailed over others in international competition. Since that's a HUGE topic, the reading load is heavy and skips around in history a lot--you'll talk about political order in medieval Europe one week and the post-Reformation \"military revolution\" the next. And by the end, you may still be frustrated with the fact that you're grappling with a huge topic--almost ALL history is relevant evidence in this class, which is pretty cool, in a way.",
    "NO!!!!!!!! Don't take it. there is no structure, Sharma is brilliant but all over the place and the readings are dense and long and sometimes not worth it. It's an interesting subject but the way it is taught leaves you confused. You do learn about state formation but the costs outweigh the benefits.",
    "If you care about modern state formation theory and practice, take this course. It shows how important an understanding of historical state development is to understand modern state creation.",
    "I think its a great class - definitely worth taking for exposure to this type of material. Prof. Sharma's thesis will become very obvious very quickly, which can make the class a little repetitive, but there are still a lot of valuable insights to be gained along the way. The reading load is pretty heavy but also worth doing in order to get the most out of the class.",
    "Definitely."
