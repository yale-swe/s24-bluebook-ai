   "comments": [
    "A valuable introduction to major problems in historical writing. A useful consideration of rarely-discussed nuts and bolts issues vital to the success of any history graduate student. Absolutely, take this course early in your career.",
    "I think it was a great class for anyone who is interested in furthering their writing andcomprehensive reading skills. It takes you through the different writing genres as you explore published writers' introductions, editorials, biographies, book reviews, journal articles and more. You also have the opportunity to write your own and receive feedback from the class about how successful it was and ways to improve it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this seminar to everyone in the department. It counts as a research seminar, but unlike most research seminars, forces you to go beyond the rough draft stage and actually produce polished pieces. Professor Gage is a great professor, and she has a lot of practical advice to share about the various types of writing covered in the course (op ed, biography, book review, journal article, diss prospectus, etc). Also had some interesting visitors. Lighter than average reading load allows you to actually focus on how sentences are constructed, and it's a nice change of pace from the usual critical tenor of reading seminars.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to my fellow students, for the reasons outlined in my other question responses."

   "comments": [
    "It was great to finally have a class geared toward specifically writing a dissertation. I enjoyed the constant feedback on my work and thought it was very beneficial as a writer.",
    "I learned a lot of practical information that will prove invaluable as I tackle these various types of writing. I also prepared a journal article for submission.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the discipline by teaching me how to improve my writing skills. It also helped illuminate some of the \"behind-the-scenes\" aspects of being a historian that are not usually discussed in other history classes. Those aspects included the process of writing a book proposal and signing a contract with a publisher; the differences between university presses and trade presses; and the challenges and advantages of being an independent scholar. These topics are often on graduate students' minds, but are rarely addressed explicitly in our coursework. It was very helpful to discuss them in HIST 990."
