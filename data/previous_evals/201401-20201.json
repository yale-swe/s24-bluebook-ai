    "Close Analysis is a strange class because its subject is really a mode of viewing films than it is a specific type of film. Thus, the voices of your classmates will be diverse and interesting, and the wide swath of films will expose you to genres, styles, and national cinemas you never otherwise thought you would find yourself analyzing. It is a good experience, and J.D. is a great professor.",
    "FILM 320 is what the title says. It is looking at films with a close eye that allow us to see what the filmmakers are really showing. Films hold a lot of meaning but those meanings are not always so clear to a casual, surface viewing eye. This class teaches you to look at how the films were made and portrayed closely in order to reveal what the director\/screenwriter\/etc might be trying to say.",
    "If you're in the film major, you have to take it. Otherwise, I'd say it's a good class, but not a gut.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to be a film major. The class is very much driven by the students \u2013 JD shows us a movie and then we drive discussion of it for two hours. If you want to talk about all aspects of filmmaking, this is a great class. Because every student gets at least one chance to lead discussion, you get to talk about a lot of things you wouldn't otherwise discuss: one week you'll talk about narration and the next week you'll talk about orchestration and the next week you'll talk about genre convention.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to get a working knowledge of film analysis.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Close analysis is not for everyone, but this is one of the best ways to learn how to do it well.",
    "Absolutely take this course. JD can come off a big strong but is honestly brilliant and completely worth getting to know - my biggest regret is not utilizing his office hours more. I learned more in a week in this class than I knew about film previously. Do the readings, watch the clips, go to the screenings, and honestly let yourself be taught by JD and other classmates. Close Analysis is a skill that I'm so happy to have developed this year.",
    "Close Analysis will make you better at watching films. It's not always the most fun class in the world, but it always feels like you're learning something, and Prof. Connor leads discussion adeptly and always selects wonderful films. It's the logical next step after Intro--don't put it off. You'll be doing yourself a disservice.",
    "If you're a film major you have to take it and you really should take it with JD. If you're not a film major there might not be any space for you.",
    "If it's with JD Connor, then definitely take it. Otherwise, I can't vouch for it since the syllabus is totally designed by the instructor. Comes as advertised: a close analysis of 10+ films."
