    "A little unfocused. A lot of the students are doing very different things, though the speakers were very interesting. Hard to find common ground for everyone.",
    "The course was a helpful introduction to graduate study. It was great hearing from guests from different corners of academia that young scholars don't often consider. I would recommend further engagement especially with the research process, giving more consideration to approaches to our theses. A class on securing funding, for instance, would be very useful.",
    "The various speakers brought in throughout the semester provided insight into different areas of research, writing, and publishing and was very helpful in showing a broad range of research and writing styles."

    "Even though the course is required, I highly recommend it to incoming E&RS students as it is very helpful in acclimating new students to the expectations of the master's degree."
