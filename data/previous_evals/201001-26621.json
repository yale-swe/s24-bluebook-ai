   "comments": [
    "YES. It's not for everyone, you should probably shop it first because you kind of have to accept the sometimes illogical ideals, but I loved it. I had so much fun. Futurism was a truly unique and spectacular movement.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn more about an interesting avant-garde movement. The readings are not difficult at all, and Dean Fabbri is a really nice guy. He is so passionate about Futurism and his passion shines through in each class. Some students complained that the class seemed to be unorganized, but I did not find it so. Overall, the course is relaxing and unique.",
    "great class",
    "Futurism is art and politics and lifestyle. It's really wacky, but also really fun to study. If you want a class that will blow your mind without making you work too hard, take it.",
    "I would be very careful about taking this class. There is a lot of fun involved (futurist cooking!) but I'm not sure there aren't other art history courses that would be better suited for most people. Don't be one of the hipster art history majors who take ridiculous things like this way too seriously, and you will be alright, but only do it if you really love futurism.",
    "I'd never studied art history, and encountered Marinetti only in a theater class. If you find him interesting, take this course; you get an in-depth look at the Futurist agenda that is absolutely fascinating. No slide memorization or any such exercise, but there is a fair amount of reading (in the form of a series of short manifestoes). There's also great license for creativity and periodic use of the Beinecke - which is awesome, and you should visit either way.Interested students from any year or major have a shot at getting in, so try. I mean, come on, you get to experiment with Futurist cooking.",
    "This is a fun seminar that introduces students to a somewhat esoteric avant-garde movement. It's not a ton of work (you can get away with doing little of the reading), and the discussions can be very lively.I wasn't totally aware of all the expectations of the course, and had no idea what my grade was throughout the semester.The course itself is kind of ridiculous, to be honest.",
    "This course is FABULOUS. Not only is Futurism a fascinating movement you must study, Dean Fabbri is a great leader for those studying it. Not only do you read crazy manifestos, you have assignments where you must apply the principles they declare in order to fully understand the implications they contain. This is a wonderful learning experience, and a lot of fun. You really should take this course - you read about art but also cook from the Futurist cookbook! Futurism should be studied more often, because of its importance for other avant-garde art movements and its tremendous complexities. This is a truly exciting course.",
    "In my entire time at Yale (I'm a senior), this is easily one of the top three classes I have taken here. Professor Fabbri is almost without fault as a lecturer and discussion leader. You don't need to be in the major to understand this class. The subject is incredibly interesting and pertinent to the way our society functions today. You also get to be in the Beinecke on several occasions - a true rarity. You would have to be a raging idiot to not take this class.",
    "Futurism is a hands on course about the art movement. You write a Words In Freedom poem, create a tactile sculptural piece, and anything else you want to make. It's a relaxing and fun course to take where you just talk about art and some theory. The readings are pretty interesting."
