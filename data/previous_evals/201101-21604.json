    "No. Only if you want to learn reason, and even for that it's probably easier to just read a tutorial.",
    "A weird class that combines half the history of electronic music (which, heads up, is super trivial) and half the use of music software (which is actually pretty awesome to know how to use). The tests are frequent but really easy. So are the portfolio exercises. I really don't think this deserves to be a class...",
    "This is an informative and useful seminar for anyone interested in the history and production of electronic and experimental music. Roughly half the classes are history lectures, and the rest (particularly toward the end of the semester) are computer lab days in which you do exercises to acquaint yourself with the music software (Audacity, Reason, Recycle). The course is very, very low stress - there are occasional quizzes on the history and regular, well-spaced software assignments.",
