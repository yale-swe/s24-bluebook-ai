   "comments": [
    "Laid-back, relaxed course for people who don't mind seeing naked bodies",
    "Fun, laid back, with a good balance between homework and class work, as with an excellent and interesting range of activities.",
    "Recommend! The class is mostly studio time with minimal at home work. It was exciting to draw from live models and relaxing to have 4 hours a week to just draw. Our class also visited the art gallery and a cadaver lab to draw bodies from inside out, which was an eye-opening, albeit eerie, experience.",
    "A good and varied course that helps a lot in learning how to draw the body. The models were very helpful and Professor M\u00fcller made it a very valuable experience. Definitely recommend!",
    "Yes! It was a wonderful experience; if Ulrike is teaching it again, it won't be nearly as rigorous, but you still learn tons.",
    "A very good class, but I would recommend it as a continuation of previous figure drawing study, or as an exploration of your own style through the human figure. I'm very glad I took this class because we had some interesting discussions and experiences, and there was lots of time to observe the figure and draw what we saw, but there was not a lot of guidance\/instruction on drawing techniques.",
    "It's a great class. I've learnt a lot of new ideas and approaches to drawing. I found it harder than Basic Drawing, even though Figure Drawing is less work. A perfect class to take credit\/d\/fail senior year.",
    "Recommended! A broad-ranging and fascinating look at both the practice and history and narrative around figure drawing. Great professor, provides exciting experiences.",
    "This is an extremely chill class. Prof. Muller has a very relaxed teaching style, and this class was basically a great way to draw for 2 hours twice a week. Drawing live, nude models was a new experience for me, but definitely a rewarding one, in that it really pushed the limits of what I can achieve artistically. That said, I would have liked more direction in this class-- Prof. Muller didn't really provide any feedback\/ guidance on our work, so it was hard to tell if I was making progress or not. I would recommend this class if you are looking for an opportunity to practice drawing models, perhaps not if you are really trying to actively \"learn\" how to do figure drawing.",
    "I would recommend the class. Great foundational art course, with a laid-back course load. The professor and t.a. were great, and made the class even more enjoyable."
