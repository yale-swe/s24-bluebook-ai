    "Only take it if you're interested.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Though it may not be the most practical, it is always enjoyable and never added stress to my week. Unfortunately, my class was made up solely of female students, so not much diversity. However, the class itself is so much fun and I felt like I learned a ton. One of the highlights of my semester for sure.",
    "Overall, not too much work or reading. Pretty interesting topic, and would definitely recommend for an American Studies major. The papers are short and interesting to write, and the final is a take home.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone looking for an interesting history class or humanities credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's not a crazy amount of work, 3 papers on the short side and a take home final. It will make your writing better, you'll learn a lot, and it wont stress you out too much.",
    "The class is pretty much what it sounds like--it covers women's history from the colonial period to 1900. The lectures are good. There were never lectures that were unbelievably amazing, but they were consistently good, which meant that I always wanted to go to class. There is not that much work: a little bit of reading and a short reading response every week, as well as three papers that are very straightforward.",
    "I would recommend ths class. It is a good intro level history class and the workload is very manageable. The readings are really interesting.",
    "It's a really good class on an interesting topic. Not too difficult, but does require a bit of work for the sections and papers.",
    "This was a great course due to Professor Tannenbaum's enthusiasm. She covered women's history in the United States from colonialism to the emergence of the 20th century. This was a completely comprehensive course that I felt was incredibly well taught. Sections were relevant and were helpful in composing the papers. Workload was not overwhelming and completely manageable. Overall , an excellent course.",
    "You learn about American History through the lens of women's lives. Gender is a big point of focus. Its an interesting look at the day to day lives of people.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, really. It's an interesting class with interesting reading and even more interesting assignments. Easily my favorite class this semester."
