   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the Greek\/Roman foundations of classical art. I am now able to apply these traditional ideals to more modern artworks.",
    "I learned how to analyze art pieces better, and write essays regarding sculpture and how to describe the artwork. I also learned how to be more interpretive.",
    "I learned that the classics are not just an era of art but also a tradition that shapes so many modern interactions in architecture, rituals, literature, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about classical art and also how to navigate the YUAG. I developed research skills as well as being able to evaluate secondary sources.",
    "I improved my analytical skills, observation skills, and my writing skills.",
    "While I went into this class knowing nothing about art, the way it was structured was such that it was not an issue at all. The readings were very interesting, and while of course I only got a sliver of understanding of the massive art world, I now enjoy walking into an art museum so much more than I did before I took this class.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to art history; not only will you learn so much about Greco-Roman and medieval art through very in-depth readings, the class's structure and professor facilitate a lot of student discussion. I learned to construct visual analyses of art pieces, as well as react to influential pieces of art criticism."

   "comments": [
    "This course has a lot of reading, not all of which seemed particularly pertinent. I think if the reading load was lessened to more core subjects OR if students had the opportunity to read only some of the readings and then discuss is a more socratic style more could be learned in the classroom.",
    "I loved that we switched up our location and went to the Art Gallery. I loved that aspect of the course because it allowed me to really engage with the artwork we were discussing in our other classroom. I also liked that I could explore a place I know I wanted to visit often. I thought it was great that we only had three essays, so we could focus on each one for a good amount of time. There were some readings that were very long though, and it was kind of hard to read all of it and come prepared to discuss all aspects in the class the following week. But there wasn't too much reading.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the setup of the class in that we spent half the week in seminar and half the week in the gallery. However, I did not always enjoy the seminar. The discussions could be riveting when the readings were enjoyable but they could also be monotonous with no planned activities.",
    "The course is amazing that it is limited to 15 students and the instructor is very passionate. I really enjoyed getting to take classes actually in the YUAG and seeing the sculptures and paintings we talked about up close.",
    "The readings were very long, dense, and at times boring. Going to the art gallery was super interesting... loved seeing the stuff in person that we discussed in class. Discussion section was interesting, but sometimes lacked energy from other students. Class was nicely organized.",
    "I love how many different topics were covered in this course. One of the best parts was having class in the YUAG every week",
    "The class is great if you want to become more familiar with the art gallery's collection of classical and Renaissance art and learn about the fundamentals of looking at art. However, as a class discussing art history, the course seemed to lack structure at times; the readings, while they sometimes built upon each other, were often disconnected and not taken advantage of. Often, instead of discussing the specifics of the readings, class discussions were very superficial. When students did not do all the readings (which was frequent), seminars were tiring as person after person made some surface-level comment they could glean from skimming the first paragraph. I think the course could have benefited from more specific questions being asked in seminars and from thorough explanations of the concepts discussed in the readings, which were not provided. Professor Harley is very kind, met with each one of us to help us with our essays, and gives wonderful feedback in grading, but she is not the most eloquent in class sessions and sometimes struggled to clearly explain concepts."

   "comments": [
    "If they were interested in art history, absolutely! If you put in the work to focus on what is interesting to you, you will get a lot out of the course. Also, the weekly trips to the YUAG are so worth it.",
    "If they are even remotely interested in religion and\/or medieval\/Greek\/Roman art history, definitely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it focuses on a lot of aspects of art that can all connect in different ways. I really appreciated the amount of history I learned while taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in the classical tradition but not someone who wants an introduction to art history.",
    "Definitely! I think this class was very interesting, relaxing and helped me with writing research papers.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in Art History.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Harley is amazing and the content is interesting, especially if youre interested in Art History",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Yes! I loved being able to go to the art gallery- its a great change from typical Yale classes. Professor Harley is also a great professor- she is very knowledgeable and makes class so fun and interesting.",
    "Definitely! Professor Harley is wonderful and offers fantastic and thorough feedback to every paper you have to write. The articles that you read for class are most often very interesting--occasionally there are some boring papers, however. The workload isn't extreme, and you have the opportunity to visit the YUAG every single week and actually look at relevant artworks in person, too!"
