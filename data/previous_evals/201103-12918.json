   "comments": [
    "I could not imagine taking Korean 110 without Angela Lee-Smith. If you take Korean, she is the one you want to take it with.",
    "Definitely take Korean 110 01 with Professor Lee-Smith. The class is always enjoyable, not stressful, and Professor Lee-Smith is an amazing professor. Within one semester, you will be able to hold a basic conversation in Korean and will have learned so much about Korean culture. Professor Lee-Smith always finds exciting ways to teach the material and she really cares about her students.",
    "Great class! I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a language. Angela Lee-Smith is the BEST. She is a tiny, adorable bundle of energy. She makes the classes fun and interesting (and worth waking up for!) She even invited our class to her house for a big Korean dinner. Plus the workload is not that bad, and you have a lot of fun with the class.",
    "TAKE IT! It's one of the most fun classes I have taken here at Yale. Lee son seng nim is amazing, she'll make you want to go to class even if it's 9:25 in the morning everyday.",
    "I would definitely recommend Korean 110 to another student, especially the section with Professor Lee-Smith. She's such a wonderful professor.",
    "Great class! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Korean culture. I have enjoyed it thuroughly.",
    "Korean 110 requires a lot of time and patience, but overall rewarding. My class became very tight-knit, and in that environment we learned the language collaboratively and thus more effectively. Know that there may be incredibly competent heritage speakers in your class, but don't be discouraged by their performance. Learning Korean is certainly a challenge, but will allow you to access a great culture and people.",
    "As a self-diagnosed narcoleptic, I was convinced there would never be a class in the world that would be worth waking up at nine in the morning for - Korean 110 is the exception. As a white kid with a very weak background in language study, I was worried I would be way out of my league with something as foreign to me as Korean. That wasn't the case at all. Korean with Lee Seonsaengnim is as accessible as it is fun, regardless your history with languages \/ East Asia. And if you're like any of the students in my class this semester, you'll find that Lee Seonsaengnim is the warmest, kindest individual you've ever met. She genuinely cares about her students and is so excited (read: really, really excited!) to watch you progress. I can't imagine learning a language under anyone else. If you feel the least bit curious about it, shop this class. You absolutely won't regret it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if the student was interested in possibly living, working, or studying in Korea.",
    "I would recommend it. The workload is reasonable and the class is really interesting and useful."
