   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course to other advanced Hebrew Bible students. If students are not at an advanced level, I wold recommend waiting, as the course requires an ability tohandle massive amounts of reading each and every week. So, if the student is not aware of some of the scholarly language, they will struggle to keep up with the reading. Additionally, if the student is advanced, they will be much more familiar with the various criticisms discussed, and therefore able to skim some of the reading and still be competent to discuss the issue at hand.",
    "Definitely recommended. A lot of fun and a lot of work.",
    "Professor Wilson possesses a vast source of knowledge and an essential resource for the class.",
    "It is what the title says. It is a great introduction to the history and methods of Old Testament interpretation throughout the last couple hundred years. I thought it was a particularly good course because we typically had three professors in attendance to share and debate their opinions.",
    "Would definitely recommend. It's a ton of work but has been the best class I've taken so far."

   "comments": [
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the field in every way the course is designed to do so. It was fantastic.",
    "I was exposed to a number of classics in the field that I would not have read otherwise. The class introduced me to a number of perspectives that were unfamiliar to me and gave me a good foundation for navigating new secondary literature.",
    "Before this course I was generally familiar with some of the critical scholarship about the Old Testament, but this class helped vastly increased my knowledge about the topic. Even if it isn't a student's particular area of interest, it is very important background information for anyone working in religious studies.",
    "My knowledge of OT scholarship is much deeper and broader than before. It accomplished its goal, I believe."
