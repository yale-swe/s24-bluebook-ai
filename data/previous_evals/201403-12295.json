    "The course was a lot of fun. It was a hefty amount of work, but it wasn't difficult, just time consuming. Be wary if you are already on a heavy load. That being said, the class was a lot of fun. There is no previous bug-catching experience necessary. Learning the techniques is easy and Professor Wells is extremely enthusiastic about the class. The trips were a lot of fun and I highly recommend it especially if you love the great outdoors.",
    "I would definitely recommend the lab! You spend the semester making your own insect collection. There are local collecting trips at the beginning of the year and a trip to Florida over October break, which are all really fun experiences but also a lot of work. At the very end of the semester you will have to devote a huge amount of time to curating and ID-ing your collection, so start identifying things early! It's a lot of work for a half credit, but worth it. By the end of this you'll have learned so much about so many insect families that you never knew existed, and you'll inexplicably want to become an insect collector as a hobby.",
    "This was an amazing course. Marta is a great instructor - her enthusiasm is infectious. You get to go on several field trips, including a trip to Florida over the October break. The bugs are really cool, and you get to keep your own collection at the end!",
    "Yes, but be aware that is will be a lot of work, sometimes even outside of scheduled classroom time.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone with an interest in animal diversity. It takes commitment, both inside class and out -- a lot of the grade depends on the final bug collection, and to do well on that you have to attend the field trips (yes, even the optional ones) and work hard to develop your skills. Plus, there really is a lot to memorize. But by the end of the course, you'll learn a ton, and will be able to identify and discuss the majority of the insects you'll see in your day-to-day life. In that sense, it really does open your eyes into a part of the world we see but often ignore.",
    "I recommend it to anyone with any interest in animal biology, who is willing to put in the time it takes to learn a lot about collecting, identifying and curating insects.",
    "Yes this was such a great lab. You go on awesome field trips around CT and to Florida over fall break and you learn so much. There are quizzes every week that are a pain to study for but you really learn so much from it. You work on an actual insect collection the whole semester, and while it took so much work (especially for just a 1\/2 credit) and long days during reading period, it was so worth it.",
    "This course is a wonderful learning experience, but it is also an enormous amount of work. Sometimes, you are tested on material that wasn't really taught in class. What is really exciting about it, though, is to be out in the field with entomologists, learning more than ever thought there was to know about world around you, and learning about life forms that sometimes you didn't know existed. And then, back in the lab, there is so much to learn as you look at insects under a microscope, as you spend late night frantically identifying insects and spiders. The course can be stressful and difficult, but in the end you learn so much, and it can be very inspiring.",
    "This lab was the bee's knees. If you really want to spend all semester learning how to collect, identify, and curate insects, then take this class. You will spend a lot of time working on this lab, but it's unlike 95% of all other Yale courses. If you aren't an EEB major and you happen to get in, take it, consider using a Cr\/d and have a blast."
