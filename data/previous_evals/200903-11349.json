    "useful class to take for engineering majors. I would definitely recommend it",
    "The class diverges from the textbook (White) in a few sections, which can be confusing if you don't quite understand something in class. Up to the mid-term was way easy, but then it got very hard, so be prepared to ramp up time on p-sets after the midterm. Smooke takes the time to get to know you in this class because it is mainly engineering majors, and he gives lots of examples in various fields. I enjoyed this course a lot.",
    "Good class. Interesting. Worth taking.",
    "It's Fluid Mechanics. You learn a lot of cool stuff, but there are also derivations that probably just annoy you if you're an engineer. The course gets harder as it goes along, but its interesting. If you try, you'll get a good grade.",
    "Fluids is early in the morning, but worth it. Professor Smooke's teaching style works well for the subject, and he uses a lot of examples (and even a few movie clips). Be prepared for a good deal of math around mid-semester in the form of partial differential equations - but try not to let that scare you, since they're not too hard to handle. There's a surprising amount of content in the field of Fluid Mechanics, not all of which you'll get to - but this course is a great overview of any engineer that might be interested in it.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not that bad.",
    "Fluid Mechanics is a great course. Professor Smooke is an engaging lecturer who makes any topic interesting. He's careful to tie in lots of real-world examples from a range of disciplines and sometimes even shows movie clips with fluid mechanics tie-ins. The weekly problem sets go from easy to moderate over the course of the semester, and the text, though intimidating at first, can be helpful and occasionally hilarious. In general though, since Smooke does a much better job of explaining things, going to lecture is much more useful than reading the dense textbook. The single midterm and final together determine 75 percent of the grade, but Smooke's tests, though sometimes difficult, are never tricky or confusing, so as long as you study, it's fine. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Your basic engineering course. Incorporates some Diff Eq, Thermo, Physics, etc.",
    "Make sure you go to class- many of the in-class derivations, etc will be on the tests. The homework is never terribly difficult, but can be long.",
    "This class wasn't really MechE. More like cookbook MechE. You pretty much plug equations for problem sets and don't even have to know the concepts. Also, Smooke's curve was a bit harsh. I have a feeling a quarter of the class got B- or below.",
    "Definately one of the cool mech e classes, lots of applications, smooke does some great examples, teaches mostly out of the book, pretty straightforward, you will want to build something after this class",
    "Take it with Smooke! If you had him for ENAS 151 or 194, this class is much easier - it's plug and chug math applications. I did have to go back and review my calc notes, but only enough so that I could do the math again, I didn't need to fully understand it or derive anything. some of the derivations in class can be tricky, but he follows the book pretty closely and his exams were pretty fair.",
    "If you're reading this, the class is probably required for your major, in which case you should take this course if Smooke is teaching it and otherwise not.",
    "This class is exactly what it promises in terms of material. I doubt you will take it unless you have to, but unlike many required engineering courses, this one is generally enjoyable. Dr. Smooke, if you haven't had him before, is an excellent lecturer who made the 9 am timeslot bearable. The material is what it is, nothing I found riveting, but useful to know. Lectures focus a lot on derivations, but with relevant examples of problems included. The weekly problem sets aren't too bad--early in the semester they will literally take under 2 hours, though they get more involved as the semester progresses and the material gets more difficult. There are only two exams, midterm and final, unlike most science classes. My year the midterm ended up being too easy with a high average, so the final was pretty difficult to compensate, but I think this was atypical. In general a surprisingly enjoyable class that didn't add excessively to the workload--I would recommend."
