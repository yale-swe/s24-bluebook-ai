   "comments": [
    "This course gives a solid understanding of using calculus to model objects, movements, and processes in multiple variables, gave me insight in understanding the concepts underlying both chemistry and physics.",
    "I learned the skills of multi-variable calculus and how it is applicable to physics and engineering and life in general. There is a lot of abstract and practical thinking and connecting of concepts form different areas of math and different chapters.",
    "By taking this course I learned about multivariable calculus and how its concepts can be applied to real-world applications. I was able to practice analytical skills by working through problem sets.",
    "I learned the basic concepts of multivariable calculus: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and applications of line and surface integrals. I gained a lot of practice doing calculations.",
    "Its multivariable calculus, there's not a whole ton to say. I liked the way the math could be connected to real life examples, but honestly pretty standard math class",
    "I found this course to be very helpful in understanding both the theoretical and practical applications of Multivariable Calculus. The material was well taught and organized so one understands why and for what purpose the math exists as well as coming to an understanding of commonly used methods and interpretations of the formulas.",
    "Learned a lot about how to think critically to solve problems. Learned how to use many formulas and how to think in multiple variables.",
    "I learned multivariable calculus"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the main problem with this class is that the lectures went through material so quickly it was often hard to keep up with how solutions were reached in example problems. In addition, the homework often went far beyond the scope of what was taught in the lecture, which meant it took a lot of time outside of class to understand the concepts on a deeper level.",
    "compared to MATH 112 and 115, I found the course material to be much more difficult, both from a conceptual standpoint, as well as in total workload. It was incredibly rewarding to finally understand how object acceleration, electrical fields, atmospheric pressure differences, and other physical phenomena could be modeled with mathematics, but it did take significant amounts of time to understand.",
    "It is an important subject with small class size which helps with learning in and out of class. The class structure was very clear with organized lectures.",
    "This course was strong in that it provided a nice overview of important multivariable calculus. The professor presented the material well and the problem sets were manageable.",
    "Strengths: This class was taught in a very systematic way. This course correlated very strongly with the textbook material, so it was easy to follow. Tests were fair and predictable. If you took the time to understand the material, study, and do practice questions, it was very possible to perform well on the exams. The practice tests, problem sets, and review problems were very helpful. Also, the textbook was excellent. Weaknesses: The pace of the class was a little uneven. I wish we had spent more time on the more difficult part of the course: applications of surfaces and line integrals, and the theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. Also, office hours for the TF were very sparse--I wish there were more opportunities to ask questions about the problem sets and class concepts. Also, in terms of test grading, more emphasis was placed on calculations than on concepts--I think it should have been possible to earn more partial credit from demonstrating an understanding of the concepts.",
    "One weakness I found in the class was that there was a bunch of assumption of previous knowledge. The only prerequisite is math 115, but there was a lot that the professor simply glanced over that was absolutely not in my background. A lot of the explanation of more complex topics were often also glanced over and not really gone in depth.",
    "The class was very well organized and taught and the notes were always very clear and to the point and were easy to go back on and review. Some of the PSETs can be difficult especially since the material can be a large jump from lecture.",
    "It was very organized in how it was taught. Weakness would be that the depth covered in class was not as much as we were expected to know when we completed assignments or took exams. It was hard to apply the general knowledge to difficult problems.",
    "The class has a good grading breakdown which is probably it's only strength. Otherwise the class is not very well taught and is pretty difficult to follow.",
    "I enjoyed the idea behind the class: focusing on how multivariable calculus can be applied to the real world and what its uses are. However, Professor Jiang, though it was obvious he knew the material, had no idea how to effectively teach it."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course over math 120 for the following reasons. First, homework counts as a large percent of the grade which means that the effort you put in outside of class actually can have an impact on your grade. The professor also allows us equation sheets on the exams which takes a huge burden off the student so they don't have to memorize many complicated formulas. He also posts detailed lecture notes online. However, I did have to teach myself a lot of the material, and put in a lot of work outside of class. So, if you are not very motivated to do that, then I would suggest you shop this class before committing.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course because of the small class size in comparison to MATH 120 and of the more application-based approach.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in pursuing engineering or any student with interest in gaining a better understanding of how calculus can be applied to real-world situations.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are good at self-studying and willing to read the textbook and do practice questions. If you want a more interesting math experience, Math120 is probably a good bet. But if you just want predictability on tests and a solid grasp of the material and its applications, and you don't mind being more finicky about calculations, Enas151 is worth your while.",
    "I dont know how it compares to math 120, but its a good alternative i think",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as the material is interesting and one learns good problem solving techniques, but to non-STEM students the material is not necessarily extremely applicable.",
    "In comparison to Math 120, the class is smaller and it has more office hours with TAs that are very helpful with getting through the problem sets. The tests were never harder than the problem sets or practice problems.",
    "The material is presented in a very organized way. His notes are in an outline format so it is easy to follow. Psets are challenging and take time, but are I found them to be pretty reasonable. There are two quizzes, a midterm and a final in addition to weekly psets. quizzes were hard but the midterm was pretty easy. you get cheat sheets which is nice because you don't have to worry about memorizing formulas, you can focus on applying formulas and solving problems, which is what is important to know. probably would recommend over 120. But that response varies a lot person to person and depending on what semester it is and who is teaching it.",
    "I would not recommend this course, at least not with Professor Jiang teaching it, though I would say that with a different teacher it could be more interesting. Professor Jiang rarely explained what he was doing, and spent the majority of the class simply copying his notes from sheets of paper which he brought in, onto the chalkboard, and expecting us to copy them down and understand them."
