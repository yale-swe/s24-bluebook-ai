    "As discussed in our last couple classes - it's a relief to have a class with such little homework, but an assignment or two earlier in the semester on the tough concepts may have helped us retain them a bit better, both in the long run and for our final projects.",
    "I thought that this class was totally manageable but it could have been paced throughout the semester rather than just one big assignment at the end. Still, even the big assignment did not seem unreasonable."

    "Really appreciated the chance to see the shows we were discussing - seems silly, but really helped to illustrate the concepts and stories we were discussing.",
    "It would have been really helpful to have smaller assignments to work on together in class or as homework to help solidify the concepts we learned on any given class day. It felt like I would forget the learnings when we just talked and never did any actual practical work with the items we discussed."

    "Joey consistently checked in with us to ask if the level of detail is too much - I would encourage him to keep up this level of detail. While not all of the details will stick, delving into it gave us the skills to be able to examine these documents such as budgets, recoupment charts, and weekly grosses in the future so that we can make informed decisions about our involvement in such projects. I'll be thankful I took this class even if I stay with the non-profit sector, as I'll feel much less likely to get screwed over by a commercial entity after being gifted with so many detailed examples of what to do (and more importantly, what NOT to do).",

    "I really liked visiting New York and meeting the PR and marketing firms that Joey works with."

    "Notes above in Question #3 - glad to have taken this course, glad it's offered here despite our non-profit focused curriculum. Super relevant to the trends we're witnessing in our institutions to pair up with more and more commercial entities.",
    "I really wish we had had formative assessments along the way rather than just a big summative assessment at the end. i liked the group project and gained a great deal from that but I feel I could have done a better job if we had practiced some of the formulas and charts earlier in the semester and had received feedback at that time."
