    "I thought this class was really well organized, with each lecture devoted to its own important topic in chemical biology. In addition, the independent proposal part of the class was quite interesting and gave me valuable, practical information about how to write a grant proposal. I thought the first exam was quite unlike the problem sets, but this was adjusted for the second exam.",
    "The lectures seemed rather disjointed sometimes, with the lectures of the two professors overlapping sometimes. The concepts covered were very interesting though",
    "Sometimes you need to do a little outside research, but If you know that from the beginning itll be fine. Both teachers are really good lecturers even though its obvious that its not their first priority. They are also great people to know if youre interested in biochem, MD, MD PhD, etc. lots of experience between the two. The Ta was a lifesaver."

    "I would. The material is very interesting, and the independent proposal is one of the most practical things you will learn to do at Yale.",
    "Yes, very interesting course for anyone planning on studying chemical biology or using chemistry to study biology. Great intro to many areas in this up-and-coming field",
    "Yes. Very great course for any researchers out there. If youve ever felt disappointed because other classes just review western blot and Mass Spec over and over, this class is for You. If youve already learned about biochem this class will teach you how to study biochem in vivo.",
    "Yes! As a chem major, enjoyed this course more than biochem, although biochem background was certainly relevant."
