   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how real-world city governments and developers function. Also, I was able to research deeply into my hometown and its history.",
    "This course taught me about the considerations and potential obstacles that go into city planning. We learned about the political, social, and financial factors that can affect the feasibility of a project. We also learned a lot about making development deals.",
    "I learned about the economic and political reality surrounding the economic development of cities.",
    "I learned a whole new way to look at cities. More than anything, I learned how to approach city development from a new perspective and what actually goes into getting a project off the ground.",
    "I learned the basics on how a city functions and how it can develop. Basic frameworks for understanding the city were presented. I also learned many practical skills through the Games, which I thought were helpful and best seen as a learning experience rather than a \"perfect grade\" assignment.",
    "This course improved my Powerpoint, Photoshop, and Lightroom skills. One of the only courses I have ever taken that has really felt like a real world experience, especially in the way that we deliver presentations",
    "Study of the City provides a sort of real-world insight in how urban planning and retail developments operate. My greatest takeaway was the glimpse at the complexity behind any development project and the competing forces that must cooperate in order for it to take place, let alone to succeed and actually benefit the surrounding urban community. Explanations grounded in finance give accounts for ideas of suburbanization and urban renewal, and, through the games, students are expected to delve into an unfamiliar world. Through that experience I learned to seek out a variety of resources in order to replicate what a bank, developer, or public official would do. There is no textbook solution for these issues, and this course intends to show you the forces at work so you can propose your own."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The way the class in laid out is one of its strengths. However, the readings were often just a repetition of Garvin's lectures and were unnecessary. Also, the games never had enough information for the students, so we were very thrown into the work. It was difficult to know what Garvin expected from us, and there was no feedback in terms of grades.",
    "The strengths of this class are Professor Garvin himself. He is a very experienced man who can teach through example, and is very passionate about what he teaches. He brings in people he knows, other experts, to help us learn, and even designs games for the class. The weakness of this class would be the unclear directions for the assignments. Many times the games are confusing and the assignments unclear, which led to frustration among the students for never seeming to meet expectations.",
    "Strength: the weekly presentations that allow the student to work on the final essay throughout the semester. Weakness: not enough professor\/TA feedback on presentation. No idea what my grade was throughout the semester.",
    "The weekly presentaitons were difficult but important. I think that is the type of work that should be done. The Games were good, but I think they could be explained a bit better. I think with a bit more explanation, much more could be learned. For feedback, it would be good to show to us what a \"good\" presentation looks like. A lot of this class was presenting information in a way that was appealing and gained support, and I think Professor Garvin could have told us more how he has been successful in his own projects.",
    "That this course is so unlike any other urban studies class is its greatest strength: the student involvement in games, the overarching theme of seeking to understand our home city in as thoroughly and through a comprehensive economic, political, and social demand lens, and the experience of Professor Garvin and his guests provide a window into the procedures involved in urban planning. Because of the open-ended nature of the games and powerpoint presentations, some assignments may come across as ambiguous, especially because they are due before the topic is discussed in class. Nonetheless, both the professor and TF make it clear that this is part of the learning process. It is, however, up to the student to correct or reconsider a presentation made based on the comments and discussion made in class. Critical thinking is necessary at all times, because comments often point out themes and processes commonly at play in many US cities. Often, these will apply to your own, but it is necessary to remember that not everything may actually have a role. This way, the class will be most constructive.",
    "A stronger sense of structure for the non-game portion of the class."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in economics and real estate, it's a good course. If not, then you should not take it. The games are interesting, but Garvin doesn't give you much information. Garvin is also too proud of himself, and basically uses his own accomplishments for every example. This class can also be difficult if you're from a small town because you won't be able to find as much information in your research.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is truly passionate about developments and making deals. Otherwise it can be very frustrating",
    "Only if you are absolutely interested in cities and urban planning. Otherwise, this course could be rather dry and turn into an ethnography on your hometown.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course to another student. The class may have ups and downs, but it was by far the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. I learned to look at city development totally differently and see the cities I go through in a whole new light. Absolutely recommend the class for anyone interested in some of the economics behind city planning or someone just interested in cities in general.",
    "If you want to know how cities work and have a framework to look at cities, take this class. Garvin has vast knowledge and experience, not to mention connections. He is a luminary in the field, it seems. It's a bit of work, and some people weren't into the type of work, but I think that Garvin understands he asks a lot of students and simply wants them to embark on a journey of learning. Definitely an important class in a field that really should be studied by the future Yalie politicians and public service leaders. Without understanding the city, making effective change in politics seems unlikely.",
    "Strongly recommend! You learn by DOING. The more you invest into your assignments, the more you will learn. Garvin is the premier urban planning authority in the nation, and it shows. His ideas are brilliant.",
    "This course is likely not what you expect, but it is immensely valuable if you seek to understand urban studies and planning. In a sense, it is a window into the field as it is, the reality of the situation. Expect financial spreadsheets and substantial research to figure out not so much what you are supposed to do, but how best to play your part in a game. Because it is a seminar, it is essential to do the readings; if the work is put in, the class ends up being much more rewarding than it might feel in the midst of game-preparations. I would recommend starting the class Credit D if youre just curious in the material, as itll reduce the pressure from presenting and games and, in my experience, play into the desired effect of making the students players. The thinking, awareness, and skill set of this class is applicable in any real world field.",
    "There are propbably other courses that are better suited for those who are interested in cities and urban studies. This one has a high level of engagement, during the three \"games\" for example, \"bringing jobs to stamford\" where we were assigned roles and had to negotiate the relocation of a company with the other players. Aside from the games, towards the latter part of the semester, the class is rather unstructured. We did presentations on aspects of our hometowns, but requirements were often unclear and the choosing of who would present, and for how long, was up to Garvin's whim. The class was focused on the real estate\/development side, which I gained a better understanding of."
