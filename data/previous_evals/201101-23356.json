    "I think that the readings would be more helpful if they were discussed in depth in the course--that lectures were built around discussing individual modes, rather than presenting general overviews, without citations, of the subject matter. I would also prefer powerpoint slides (at least sometimes) to simply a verbal overview of the subjects!",
    "More readings posted to the server would have given us the opportunity to learn more about each subject.",
    "This class was a disaster. Let's see, where do I start: 1) It was supposed to be taught my multiple faculty, but ended up just being Mendelsohn. 2) The professor does not take the lecture seriously: he shows up with a piece of paper in his hands and just starts talking with no structure. 3) He made no use whatsoever of classroom technology. He occasionally wrote on the board, typically some poor diagrams that we could not read from the back of the room. 4) There was little to no discussion in the class. A few lectures into the class people defaulted to sitting in the back and working on other material during class. 5) We were asked to pick topics for our paper early in the semester, having only discussed integrated assessments for air quality. Hence, by the time we covered water, climate change and other topics, we had already started chosen a topic related to air quality\/emissions. 6) The first guest speaker on the 2nd class I think came to give a talk on power plant engineering which was 95% over our heads and of no interest.",
    "Overall, I feel as though this course could use a change in format. Rather than speaking abstractly about those parameters and configurations that constitute integrated assessment models, I believe it would be more helpful for the course to have some type of lab format where half the time is spent deconstructing existing integrated assessment models and\/or building them in a specific software environment (STELLA comes to mind).",
    "This class is a very important part of the MEM curriculum. It is a great way to put conceptual topics such as hydrology and air pollution into a policy-making setting, and most importantly, to consider multiple topics interchangeably.",
    "I liked the idea of the course, but thought a bit more structure would have made it more effective. Each of the sections of the course was interesting, but all of our grade was dependent on our final projects. Maybe having some of the grade come from problem sets\/short tests about each section would have been helpful.Also, it seemed beyond control of the professor, but as an integrative frameworks class it would have been nice to have more co-teaching or guest professors.",
    "Professor Mendelsohn is excellent. However the course was just OK. My favorite part of the course was when professors from other fields came into speak.I think the course needs to talk about more structured examples of integrated assessment and readings that correspond to them.Dave Henry was an excellent TA. Good work Dave!!I know this class was a trial, so there are definitely areas to improve, but I think the final paper\/project was a good idea. And I did learn a lot through doing an integrative assessment myself.",
    "This course has potential but unfortunately it was too broad and vague for its first year. First of all, it needs a smaller classroom and the professor should try and engage the students more. Second, the fact it was titled \"Integrated Assessment\" and only taught by one professor was not a good thing. Other professors need to help teach this course. Third, Professor Mendelsohn should have focused on one of the 4 topics we did (like Climate Change) and give more in depth examples. He glossed over a lot of different subjects instead. It also would have been good to go over actual integrated assessments (that work well and did not work well). Basically, the course needs to have more tangible components because it was too broad and general to get anything out of it.",
    "I appreciated the expertise in economics which Prof. Mendelsohn brought to the class. Professor Mendelsohn is one of the most important and respected economists at Yale and beyond.Shame on Yale, especially FES, for not rewarding Professors who seek to teach integrated, interdisciplinary studies. Prof. Mendelsohn is not a natural or physical scientist, and obviously not capable of representing these views. Much of the information relating to science, even chemical compounds, was incorrect.If every lecture could have been as complete and integrated as the air quality controls lecture with a Professor from the engineering department, this class would have been the most valuable course taught at FES this past semester. Instead, Prof. Mendelsohn had to provide his opinion and experiences on a range of topics, some insightful, some incorrect.While Prof. Mendelsohn deserves respect for the expertise he brings, the class as a model was a failure. FES should find a way to make a good idea work in the future.Regarding the final project, not nearly enough guidance was provided. The TA and the Professor were NEVER ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING FEEDBACK. This was incredibly annoying and cost a lot of extra time in recalibrating the project to the Professor\u0092s expectations. Also, the lack of a syllabus was hard for planning, and things like TA hours should be formed from the get-go, especially if they are to be mandatory later on in the semester.",
    "Professor Mendelsohn was always available to help students and always responded very quickly and helpfully to emails. It is disappointing that the new curriculum mandates an integrative assessment course be taken during the first year of the MEM program, but only 3 such courses are offered and, at least for this course, the other professors scheduled to teach the course bailed on it in the end. If these courses are so important to the MEM curriculum, then I would hope that the faculty would contribute to them. This level of non-commitment by the FES faculty reflects extremely poorly on the School. I am extremely impressed that Professor Mendelsohn was able to successfully teach this course by himself, and I would certainly not hesitate to take another course with him. I think that the course could improve a great deal by increased participation by other faculty members. If the faculty of FES cannot commit themselves to this course that they deem to be integral to the MEM education, then inviting guest speakers from other schools and departments at Yale would be a useful alternative.",
    "This course was a bit of test run for the new curriculum, and it showed, unfortunately.",
    "This course was a requirement for MEM degree candidates, but the necessary links were never drawn as to why this course is vital for all environmental managers. The class felt like a obligation to the professor to teach, and to the students to take, but little else.",
    "This course did not have any homework, exam and test textbook therefore were not incentives to study. Besides there was not textbook to study.",
    "I think we got off to a bad start in this class. The professor was unhappy and all but told people not to class. This is when the most important courses that I've come across at FES and across nearly empty. It was largely because of his attitude initially. This course was also too similar to the environmental economics courses available at Yale. Integrated assessment is subject unto itself and should be taught as such. Of course drawing from environmental economic examples is essential however they should not be all the same examples as topics that are covered in other courses. I think there was a lot to learn from the other students work and the final presentations were not sufficient. It would have been better for us to spend more time on each of the groups works where they could show us the lookup functions or least a visual map of their models. Dr. Mendelsohn is world renown for his work in integrated assessment in many ways I wish we would've spent more time on the subjects and been able to get her hands dirty in the models themselves. This would require guidance from both him and our TA but actually going in programming things whether it be in Excel or some other program like Vena Thesim is really important. People learn by doing not just by reading. we learned a lot for our projects however we only get feedback at the very end. and so there is no opportunity learn from other people's mistakes, other people's holdups, or a professor's expertise. Dr. Mendelsohn plans to improve the course and this is necessary. part of the problem with this course is in fact not his fault. There is a true lacking of strong quantitative analysis at FES right now. We need more courses like dynamic systems modeling, integrated assessment. right now all the courses, if they exist, are introductory. however in the work that we're going to be asked to do after our time here in Yale we must be able to integrate GIS, Excel optimization, and macroeconomic theory into workable models. At at this point there are no teachers nor courses that can advise or guide us in these advanced integrated assessments. Rob knows what he has to do the course wasn't as good as it should have been. I know to be better in the future."

    "Room: Burke Auditorium was massive compared to the number of students in the class. Sage 24 would have been more appropriateTeaching Style: Professor Mendelsohn has the capacity to lecture intelligently and cohesively on the full range of topics covered within the course, but this often results in the feeling of being \"lectured to,\" rather than engaged in a dynamic learning experience.",
    "Making it relevant to students",
    "One way to improve the class would be to spend the class times more focused on the student projects make the class essentially a seminar on integrated assessment project design. Students could present during the course of the semester as they are putting together their research topics. We did this in section but it wasn't very formal. Learning from each other and practicing presentations has been really useful.Another direction could be to focus class time on 3-4 integrated assessment issues over the whole semester and go in depth on each. From class, I felt like we touched on a lot of topics but didn't soak up much information or skills in how to think about integrated assessments. We weren't challenged in class.",

Unfortunately, the course itself didn't make it all that exciting of a topic, and with the exception of the IA model that I used in my paper, I don't feel like I have a great grasp of specific IA tools and skills to apply to a career.",

    "in all honesty I don't think many people read the readings I think this course should be presented in terms of case studies people should have to present on them. Classification is a must in a course like this.

With that said, I wish I was told at the beginning of the year I needed to take it within my first year because I might have taken the water class (which was more focused) in the fall because it fits my interests more. My background is in science, so I thought the economic side of the class was more useful to me. Again, it would have been helpful having a scientist teach that side of the class because professor Mendelsohn glossed over a lot of the science aspects.",
    "I took this course only because an integrated assessment course was required. I would definitely take a course taught by Professor Mendelsohn again, but I would not have taken this course if it was not required. (Although I have heard even worse reviews of Linkages of Sustainability, so I would at least choose this class over that one.)",
    "It would have fit well if there was a clearer sense of how to design the project. This could take the form of workshops at the very beginning or some sort of focused analysis that would have examined all of the materials and models. This sort of information could very easily be fit into a matrix of some sort with all the relvant details for how to create an integrated assessment model.",
    "In theory, it's a great economics-based course to teach my how to think through and balance all the economic costs and benefits of different actions I might take throughout a career in policy. In practice, I don't think it offered as many practical, hands on tools or concepts as I would have liked.",

    "was sitting at a graduation dinner with other FES students and they're talking about their courses at Yale. many of them had focused on policy here or even industrial ecology. I was surprised because all of them are lamenting that the education had deficits specifically their ability to solve problems that are complex and large. what they were wishing they had was skill set that will allow them to conduct policy analysis. the world around us is going green people are accepting this fact however what they're asking of us as environmental leaders is to tell them what's highest on their list of priorities what they should do first and how much and when. Courses like integrated system are essential to beginning to assess and to provide answers. if FES is going to continue to be a leading institution which produces environmental leaders it must create more courses like integrated assessment. after all there is no use screaming at the top of your lungs that there's a fire unless you know how to put it out."

The professor tended to go vaguely over the different theories of how use integrated assessment for a variety of environmental topics (air quality, water, climate, etc), but didn't give us the specific equations, resources, or practice applying those theories to real problems. Instead, we only got a brief description of the theory, and then an even more generalized summary of the findings of different IA studies trying to quantify the damages of something like climate change. It was really unsatisfying to hear about how climate change isn't really going to cause that many economic damages, but not have any meaningful discussion about the different assumptions that went into that assessment, the different factors that are used, those factors that AREN'T considered, or really the details that make vague, generalized numbers useful.
