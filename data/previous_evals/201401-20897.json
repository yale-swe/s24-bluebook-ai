    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody who thinks they might be interested in anything Asian American related at all or anybody who likes history. This class is more than just a history class. It helps you understand the roots of racial formation and helps hone your critical thinking skills so that you can easily understand and dissect current Asian American issues. Professor Lui is a fantastic lecturer. The workload is not bad at all. The final paper (an oral history narrative based on an interview you conduct) that you do for this class is an engaging and fun assignment if you don't view it as a chore. Definitely take this class if you are considering it at all.",
    "Asian American History is an incredibly important topic & a must-take class, whether you identify as Asian American or not. There are so many moments in this history that will move\/shock you, & that you need to know about as a member of American society. Lectures utilize every minute & are exciting, full of primary documents & considered historical analysis. Professor Lui has put together a comprehensive syllabus with hard-hitting readings that add different dimensions to her lectures. Each week, there is a discussion section on these readings which was very well-facilitated this semester. You will submit a reading response each week; there's a midterm, oral history project, and final take-home essay exam\u2014all of which you will be prepared for. The history ends around the 1990s, & I would have loved to see integration of contemporary Asian American issues.",
    "This class was really important for me personally because I felt that I had not done much exploration of my identity as an Asian-American or of my Asian-American family's history. It gave me really powerful knowledge through which to interpret my family's story and a lot of aspects of my own upbringing and identity. That said, it was an intro-level history lecture, so there were a lot of kind of annoying small assignments, and lectures sometimes felt redundant with the readings. I wish we could have asked questions in lecture or really discussed the narratives with which we were presented. Still, while I would have loved to go deeper with the material, I now feel equipped to do that on my own. And while the intellectual\/academic experience was not overwhelming, it was still a very powerful experience to take this class and carve a space in history and identity for myself and my family.",
    "It's a great class, but do realize it's an annoying amount of work.",
    "An absolutely essential course. This is history that you will not be taught elsewhere, and that is crucial you learn. Definitely take the class!",
    "YES. TAKE THIS. AMAZINGLY EYE OPENING. IF YOU ARE ASIAN AMERICAN YOU WILL HAVE A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE HISTORY OF YOUR PEOPLE. PROFESSOR LUI IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH: THIS CLASS WAS AMAZING, IT MADE ME RETHINK EVERYTHING ABOUT MYSELF AND MY SURROUNDINGS, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Yes. Somehow I was deprived of Asian American history for my entire life. It is relevant and important to understanding this country today. Recommend to all who care about learning about experiences of people from different backgrounds (everyone should).",
    "TAKE IT!!! It's an amazing class, and my favorite of this semester. Lui's class will make you reevaluate the entirety of American immigration history. It looks at the experience of Asian Americans through a variety of different lenses, from law and court cases to popular media. You'll learn a lot, from a perspective on American history that is not normally explored.",
    "Definitely one of Yale's must take classes, it defines the American experience for a group that is often left out of the history books.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is a bit more work in terms of writing (Oral history project, essay, and final take home essay instead of a final exam), but if you are willing to put in the effort it is totally worth it. Listening to Prof. Lui lecture is reason enough to take the class, but the TFs are also great, and it really is a unique opportunity to learn about a part of US history that is often overlooked.",
    "Definitely! This is a great enlightening class everyone should take. As a non-Asian, it still felt really relevant and informative. This class makes you challenge the way you see Asians in the media.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It's a gem at Yale, and will definitely change your perspective on Asians in America and give you the tools to think critically about race relations in the States. And, just as a point of clarification: you don't have to be Asian to take this course! Don't let the course title mislead you--Asian American History is important to people of all ethnicities, especially if you're a non-Asian, American citizen. My only qualm with the course is that I wish there were more non-East Asians who took the course. If you identify as South Asian (Desi), Southeast Asian, Pacific Islander, etc. there is material in the course that engages with your relatives'\/your lived experience! It's not just about \"the Chinatown\" experience! Long story short, you're missing out if you don't take this class!",
    "Absolutely fantastic class! Professor Lui is a brilliant lecturer and focuses on the stories of individuals to teach history (which is an honest way to represent what we know of history anyway). All the readings were thought-provoking and introduced me to WGSS and Ethnicity, Race & Migration modes of analysis, which has completely changed the way I think about America\/race relations\/Asian America. I really, really enjoyed section too, which is lead by TAs.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it! This is one of my favorite classes taken at Yale, so far, and the knowledge and way of thinking that I've learned from this class has definitely helped to further shape my beliefs and life perspective. Many people who took this course this semester were Asian, but I think there is definitely value for non-Asians to take this class. Studying Asian American history reveals a lot about American history in general."
