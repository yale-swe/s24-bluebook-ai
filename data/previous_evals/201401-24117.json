    "It's a good course.",
    "Although the course material could be very difficult, the overall organization and execution of the course made the material manageable. I feel that I was consistently challenged during the course, and that I have definitely learned a lot of material throughout the semester.",
    "Much things were talked about, but not detailed enough. After the course, I feel I only got a superficial understanding of GLM.",
    "Strengths:- The class notes are very informative and complement the textbook very well.- Reading the notes (slides and the ones in class) together with the book is not only helpful in learning GLM but also a good practice for reading theoretical material.",
    "this is a very hard class that takes a lot of time to study. but it is very useful for future research",

These two questions are about m-estimation and I don't think he made the right assumption. Furthermore the explanation to the problem he wrote in his email was problematic. But the course is good overall.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0The course notes were very nicely laid out, and were extremely helpful in learning the course material and completely required assignments.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0- The notes were very well written and the lectures were well prepared and time efficient.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0helpful after class and nice to talk about the outside-class materials. reachable and encouraging",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Was an interesting instructor who is very intelligent but perhaps need improvements on teaching skills. Also if solutions to problems\/exams are provided, course would run better."
