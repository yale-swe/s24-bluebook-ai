   "comments": [
    "Gained a knowledge of the intellectual history of Hindu nationalism. Gained experience in engaging with primary sources and writing research papers. It was particularly cool that we were in this class during election season and it was so amazing to see the ramifications of things that we were reading about, in real life.",
    "This course taught me about a topic I had little to no familiarity with. I was able to learn not only from Professor Gandhi, but also from the other students in the class. It was one of the first courses I've taken that deals with current events, so I also learned how to apply a scholarly and critical eye to the news of the day.",
    "I learned about the complex, non-linear development of Hindu nationalism and its relationships to intellectual, economic, political, and gender history. I honed my ability to critically analyze primary sources from a diverse array of authors and put them in conversation, as well as to analyze current events with a historical perspective in mind.",
    "This course traced the development of Hindu Nationalism historically, starting from the emergence of modern Hinduism in the early 19th century, moving through a primary reading of some of the most influential thinkers in Hindutva ideology, before finishing with a discussion of Hindu Nationalism in relation to contemporary history, politics, and society.",
    "This class is both a broad and deep inspection of Hindu Nationalism: in the past and in the present. By looking through historical documents and interrogating the original Hindutva thinkers, it provides context for the modern ideas of the BJP while simultaneously critiquing their ideology and history of communal violence. Through weekly presentations on current news stories, and the personal stories of classmates, the material also always felt really relevant."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course and don't have any big critiques. This course is the perfect balance of lecture, discussion, reading responses and papers. I learnt so much and think Professor Gandhi does a fabulous job of moderating discussion. The readings were always relevant, and never too burdensome. I really appreciated that everyone in the class engaged with the readings well and this allowed for very good discussion during class time.",
    "This was an excellent course. The class size made this function more as a seminar than a lecture, with Professor Gandhi lecturing for some time but also opening things up for discussion, which I thought was a great a blend that allowed for content to be learned but also for great continued engagement each class. The readings assigned were consistently engaging and gave me a full understanding of the subject matter for this course. Professor Gandhi is an amazing professor; she is very intelligent, knowledgable, engaging as a lecturer, and approachable. Whenever I went to her office hours, Professor Gandhi was very helpful and clearly cares about her students. Overall, a great course.",
    "This class's strength is its flexibility and discussion-based style. We could read texts and use them as a springboard for seminar-style conversations while also incorporating the historical context that Professor Gandhi provided. This course was able to bridge current events with their cultural and historical context in a way I found engaging and exciting.",
    "Strengths: Great readings, Prof. Gandhi knew a lot about the topic but also organized discussion very well, and the small class size allowed us to a lot of time to bounce thoughts off each other like a seminar. Fun papers, fun presentations, great class discussions.",
    "This course has a steep learning curve if you have no background on Hinduism or India prior to the course, however Professor Gandhi does an excellent job of answering all questions and giving a solid introduction right off the bat to get everyone on the same page. One way this could be improved would be by sharing the powerpoint presentations or lecture notes online."

   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes, especially if you are interested in how the modern day political forces in India came into being, and tracing the longer history of ideas we today take for granted. One of the best history\/south asian studies courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any other student. I think that this course is especially suited to South Asian studies, history, and religious studies major who are looking for an excellent additional credit or want to learn more about Hindu nationalism, as an ideology and as a historical development. Professor Gandhi is an excellent professor and makes this class engaging and enjoyable, I think regardless of previous knowledge or background in the topic. I think that having some background knowledge on India or the region as a whole would be helpful, just because most students in this class will have some, but I don't think it is needed at all. Overall, I think that this was an excellent course and would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student! Professor Gandhi facilitates an engaging and thought-provoking lecture\/seminar and looks across many kinds of media and scholarship to start conversations.",
    "Yes, this is an important course for understanding India's complex religious and nationalist politics in their historical context.",
    "Yes, absolutely! It's such an important time to understand Hindutva ideology and Prof. Gandhi is a remarkable professor in her own quiet way.",
    "Yes it was very interesting!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student with an interest in India or in the intersection between religion and politics. It is extraordinarily relevant to current events (especially considering voting started over finals in 2019 for the Indian election) and provides insight into a particular nationalist ideology that is often left out of the conversation about religious and nationalist extremism. I came away from this class having learned more than I could have imagined."
