   "comments": [
    "I would if you need the language requirement or are genuinely interested in Spanish. You get a much better grasp of the language. But otherwise, I would not recommend it.",
    "No don't take it.",
    "Do it if you have to take it for language requirement or study abroad. Really investigate which section leader you have. It can make the L4 experience somewhat bearable.",
    "It's an intense Spanish course, much harder than L3. Be prepared to speak a lot and learn all sorts of new grammar rules at a fast pace.",
    "Spanish 140 has the same general structure as 130, it's just more work and more challenging. There was required homework and suggested practice work every night. During class we did speaking and writing activities. You also get to watch a movie (with subtitles) and read a short novel, both of which I really enjoyed. You also make several presentations, one 5-minute presentation on a work of art\/artist, a 20 minute presentation on a topic related to Latin America, and an oral exam. The presentations are not too bad, they just take a lot of prep time.",
    "Yes. It is helpful to become more comfortable speaking and reading spanish. It is also your only option if you want to continue past L3, so I would just suggest shopping multiple sections and choosing the professor you like the best. That makes all the difference.",
    "It's standard. Read the class description and that covers everything. If it is anything more or less, it is due to your professor's personality or the class dynamic."
