    "I learned so much in this course and I know view the world and the things around me in a different way. The connection between words and pictures is so intriguing and is something you don't notice until you study certain aspects of imagery and words. I very much enjoyed all the homework and projects and I looked forward to going to class every single time.",
    "general overview of certain kinds of art the relationship between art and news and our normal life",
    "Words and Pictures taught me to look at the world around me in a new way. Not only did I gain confidence in myself as an artist, but the course also opened my eyes to new ways to push myself artistically and express myself in ways I previously thought impossible. Taking time out of my week, every week, to sit down and be creative was a cathartic and incredibly beneficial experience. I have learned that I enjoy looking at, studying, and making art!",
    "You will draw, cut paint and have absolute fun with this class, there is no certain rubric of doing the assignment so you have free roam over what to do. its really fun and not at all taxing",
    "I learned the skill of bringing art and ideas together and it taught me how powerful and meaningful that combination is. Our discussions taught me about the importance of discussion difficult current issues and their significance. I learned how much I loved art.",
    "I really enjoyed the size and structure of this seminar. I learned as much from my fellow students as my professor and enjoyed many class discussions. It was the first art class I've taken in a while, and I loved the weekly demand of the projects. I also enjoyed our readings."

   "comments": [
    "The professor was amazing and very understanding of the students. I also learned a lot in the class while class time and homework were both intriguing and interesting. The assignments kept you thinking which made interactive and learning new things that much easier.",
    "The seminar style was very helpful; however, the time was very short for an art class.",
    "Strength:very eye-opening, give ample space for free creation Weakness: sometimes the discussion can wander off course and turn into a politics discussion class",
    "This course is all strengths, no weaknesses. The professor is amazing and inspiring, the class size was perfect, the assignments were engaging, different, and interesting, and the in-class discussions were always insightful and enjoyable. Keep this course exactly the same!",
    "Strength -- The class is fun, especially if you take it with Halsey, it always felt more like a chill-out with your favorite bigger brother. And the assignments made it so that the class was overly sooooooooooooooo interesting. ie. We had one where we had to visually express a feeling or an idea... and I wrote \" . \" and that was it - to represent silence. No fuss. Nothing. The teacher appreciated it for what it was and did not try and change my ideas. he prompted me to think in different and more interesting ways. I really really loved this class",
    "Strengths are that this course was extremely welcoming especially for someone like myself who was new to doing art let along displaying it infront of others. It was fun and relaxed and had great discussions. There were very few weaknesses in this class- if I could start it over I would probably have loved to know that the art was the main part of the class so that I could've devoted more time to my first pieces.",
    "The reading materials are interesting and relevant. The class promotes insightful discussion. There is a lot of freedom with the individual projects, and sometimes I wished I had a little more guidance."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course because it taught me so much, was so interesting, and was very enjoyable thanks to the professor.",
    "I would recommend it to students who wish to have a general touch on art design and is wondering about the relationship between words and pictures in art (also in comics! which is a huge part of this course)",
    "This course is really fun and engaging. It's super relaxed and the weekly art assignments are very flexible and the weekly readings are relatively short. It is a good way to explore art if you don't want to commit to basic drawing or you don't feel you're good at art. The professor is a Yale art critique for the grad school and an artist himself so he has tons of interesting stuff to talk about.",
    "Would absolutely recommend Words & Pictures with Halsey Rodman. It's a casual class consisting of a weekly art project (don't worry, your artistic ability isn't judged!) and in-class discussions. Work load is low (approx 1 hour\/week), but I still learned a lot. Overall, little work, lots of casual and interesting discussions in class, and got to produce and see some cool projects throughout the semester. Really refreshing class - take it if you have room in your schedule.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any student regardless of age, artistic ability, or intended major. It was unlike any course I've ever taken and will definitely be one of my favorite classes that I will remember from my career at Yale. I cannot emphasize enough how incredible this course is and how it opened my eyes to a whole portion of the world I had previously ignored.",
    "YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Take this freakin class!!!! You get to read comics for your homework assignments. Draw cartoons, watch movies in class. Its so lovely it could make me want to cry --- and trust me you learn a lot .. a whole lot...",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it was fun and low stress but I learned a lot about myself, life, and current events.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student interested in learning more about art in a less intense setting and interested in perusing individual creative projects."
