   "comments": [
    "The topic is broad and the general overview presented by the course was a great start. The book selections will always be at least somewhat controversial but it is important to show a diverse collection of material.The analysis assignments were helpful, although some books were more purposefully designed than others and I think this made them more worthy of discussion. Regardless of quality of the book though, the class discussion was information and the instructor could clearly communicate the value of each book.",
    "We covered a lot of material in this course, from the role of the book in architecture to the various representational and graphic techniques implored by different designers. I think that all of the material covered is very useful information for architects and designers.",
    "The precedent analysis and subsequent presentations were helpful in exploring different book methods\/techniques; however, more focus on actual architectural methods from Luke as an instructor (instead of us as students) would have made for a more formal critique of the book and its role in architecture.",
    "I found this course very refreshing as a design course outside of architecture in its traditional sense. Luke is very knowledgeable and has a great ability to get people excited about the production of books. I think the case studies are extremely interesting. I think it might be productive to require a rough draft of the students individual book before thanksgiving to get more critical feedback and make the final copy more meaningful.",
    "I would not change a thing, besides the ever evolving book list.",
    "the course is really great and informative. it was nice to be able to take it in the way that i wanted - and not feel pinned in by expectations. luke was good about letting us do what we wanted.",
    "I wish students were encouraged to explore new ways of presenting their book precedent. All websites ended up containing the same type of information although the books analyzed were very different. A lot of interesting analogies could have been made but were given up for diagrams of page layouts that were sometimes uninformative."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to spend time discussing and considering the relationship between the form of a book and the content within. This is exactly what we did in class. I look forward to pursuing some of these topics in greater detail in the future.",
    "My expectations were high for this course. I think it is important that architects understand how to better represent their ideas graphically, and this course certainly does that.",
    "I expected to see more books and their formal critique. Instead, we looked more to small production techniques such as binding and in-design\/indexhibit tutorials. These things can be learned outside of class by the students themselves (we have worked with many of these things before). Instead, if the course were to take on a more theoretical\/formal understanding of the book, it would better serve its role in the school. Right now, it sort of sits as a production course.",
    "The syllabus states the intent of the class: (to) examine the phenomenon of the book in architecture as both an array of organizational techniques and as a mediator. I expected the class to focus on and explore the growing relationship between architecture and the publication of books. The class was divided into three parts: a series of lectures about overall graphic design, publication and distribution ideas; precedent analysis; individual book projects.The class would have benefited from more hands-on workshops in addition to the lectures. As an elective that involved the making of objects, it would have benefited the class to learn more bookbinding techniques and perhaps have a class down in the computer lab discussing computer applications.I would have appreciated more feedback on the final book project before the final presentation. If the ideas for the project were raised earlier in the semester, it may have fostered more critical feedback.",
    "high - and they were.",
    "It was a much better course than I thought it would be in the beginning."

    "This course is very important to me, and I learned a lot.",
    "read, above.",
    "Both as a student and a practicing architect, it is important to understand the relationship of architecture to publishing. Despite the gradual decline of print, to this day the monograph \u0096 and to a much lesser degree the publication of a project- still exists as a symbol that ones work is relevant and consequential. Books can exist as self-servicing, perhaps propagandistic devices, and having a class that studies built and theoretical work vis-\u00e0-vis books is valuable.",

   "question_text": "Comment on the effectiveness of the teaching by the courses's instructor",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor has vast expertise and knowledge on the subject. It is a broad topic and many ideas were discussed over the course of the semester. However, these ideas could perhaps have been organized and presented a bit more clearly and concisely.",
    "I think that Luke Bulman was great. While he lectured from time to time, he let the students, through a critical analysis of individual books, teach the bulk of the course. Yet, he was their to guide and discuss and make sure that we continued to always ask \"What it is, and what does it do?\"",
    "Luke is very helpful and thorough. He should, however, try to vary, diversify, and speed up his lectures. His current method\/content is a bit dry\/slow and production based. We get the production side very quickly and often have experience with it, so lingering on this side makes for a somewhat boring\/slow session.",
    "Luke was very engaging and interesting. More opportunity for discussion would be helpful, but there's only so much time for that in 2 hours\/week.",
    "As a practicing book and graphic designer, Luke\u0092s knowledge of the actual production process proved helpful in illustrating an industry to which architects are inextricably linked. His understanding of books was not limited to a specific era or genre, which enriched many of the discussions in class. He also brought to class an extensive and varied reach of different types of publications.",
    "luke is great -really knows everything about books.",
    "Great course. Thank you."

    "More intensive book-binding seminar. It would be great to learn more about the actual assembly of the books and to practice various methods of binding.",
    "Maybe a bit more on the production of book binding, which we briefly skipped over. I believe this would be helpful for the final project.",
    "More of a theoretical\/formal critique of the Book and its role in architecture, instead of a layout\/production\/graphic design course."
