    "I learned more vocabulary and grammar in Spanish.",
    "I developed skills in knowledge in the culture and language of spanish and spanish speaking countries.",
    "I learned more Spanish vocabulary and grammar in the course, which I will continue to use in the next level of Spanish.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: it forces you to work outside of class and put in extra time. Also really makes you feel like you KNOW the Spanish language Weakness: a lot to process, not enough time to make it all sink in",
    "One strength is that you are forced to emerge yourself in the class. One weakness is that the grading is very arbitrary across professors.",
    "Should have more speaking exercises",
    "This class is primarily busy work and the class was too big to actually practice speaking.",
    "I believe that more in class speaking would have helped this course and improved my Spanish at a faster pace. That being said, a lot of material is covered in the course, making this difficult time wise. I also think that more cultural lessons could be included in the grammar and vocabulary training. Overall, the course was good, though.",
    "The texts assigned were too advanced for our level. Don Quijote utilized an older form of Spanish, which made it extremely challenging for me to comprehend. One strength of the course is that it meets every day and so students can immerse themselves in the language."

    "I would recommend the course, but wouldn't recommend the professor.",
    "I would recommend the course to improve Spanish language capabilities. If they did not already have an interest in the language, I would not recommend the course.",
    "Yes. Spanish is important."
