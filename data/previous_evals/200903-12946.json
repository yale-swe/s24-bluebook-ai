    "This is the essential course of introductory philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Sextus Empiricus, Augustine and Aquinas. Having taken this course, I realise what a terrible thing it would be for any student, even a science major, to go through Yale while never encountering any of these texts. They are so fundamental to Western civilisation, religion, politics and even the pursuit of science itself. The course is difficult and the reading is not to be underestimated, but the syllabus is a list of books that truly oughtto be read before a Yalie goes out to rule the world. I would recommend this course to all students, with the caveat that those who cannot cope with a large amount of reading would probably be better served by another course.",
    "DS philosophy is essentially a crash course through ever single major philosopher and philosophical concept that shaped western history and thought. I personally can think of no better way to gain an introduction to philosophy. TAKE IT!",
    "Excellent.",
    "Difficult and dense, but rewarding. It is what it is meant to be, a lightning survey of Western philosophy with emphasis on Plato&Aristotle. Excellent with a good instructor and classmates, probably miserable with bad ones.",
    "This is a great class, and David Possen is amazing. He's enthusiastic, brilliant, and really interested in going carefully over everything to help kids understand. Class is always fun, and the discussions I had with Possen and other kids as we were leaving were often as interesting as the ones we had had in class. Everyone sometimes got so excited about class that we had to all migrate to a different location and continue the discussion over lunch. It's immensely satisfying to look over at Possen as you're making a point in class and see his head bobbing enthusiastically in agreement. He approaches everything with a love and admiration that one cannot help but adopt as one's own. I think about half the kids in the class are now considering majoring in philosophy because of this class. It was my only class that approached the intimacy and excitement of my high school classes, and it's been by far the best aspect of college so far.",
    "David Possen is a phenomenal professor. He gets so excited about the ideas he teaches in class that it's impossible not to feel the contagiousness of his love for philosophy. He completely changed the way I understand these texts, and he has made them very relevant for me. He also had the remarkable ability to unite our entire class in love for him, greatly enhancing intellectual life for his students. If you're not sure if you want to stay in DS, and you get assigned to Possen, it is worth staying in. Best teacher or professor of my entire student life.",
    "This class focuses on Plato and Aristotle, and one comes to realize the influence of these philosophical thinkers on all subsequent thought after we finish with them. The class spans the ancient Greek thinkers to medieval Christian thought. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, because of the quality of the professor and the highly influential content of the texts, as well as the introduction it provides to individual philosophical interpretation.",
    "DS is a fantastic way to read the great thinkers of the Western tradition in a year. Given the possibility of having David Possen, I would recommend DS philosophy without second thought.",
    "I think Directed Studies is a wonderful program. It is clear to me that it is not suited to every individual, but those who flourish in a discussion and analysis based environment get a lot out of Directed Studies. This being said, one's enjoyment of Directed Studies is extremely dependent on the section one is in, one's professor, and the level of involvement of the other students. If you are lucky enough to have David Possen as your professor, Directed Studies Philosophy is intensive, inspiring, and intellectually challenging throughout the semester.I would whole-heartedly recommend taking ANY course taught by David Possen. He is one of the most incredible teachers I have ever met. His enthusiasm for his subject, his ability to clearly explain EVERYTHING, the supportive way in which he encourages his students to think about the text for themselves, made his class something that I REALLY looked forward to every Tuesday and Thursday. He has a great sense of humor, is absolutely brilliant, speaks so many languages, and is an excellent communicator of ideas. He respects his students and his office hours were always helpful and intellectually challenging (many students would go to office hours just to talk to him, myself included!). He is animated (moving around the room, nodding enthusiastically) and really loves his subject (joining our class at lunch to answer questions and go into even more detail on certain points). His enthusiasm was the driving force behind this class and got all of us so excited about Philosophy!",
    "If you're in Directed Studies and have been assigned Possen's section, consider yourself blessed. If you're debating taking Directed Studies, Possen's an excellent argument to do so. If you're in Directed Studies and are debating switching into Possen's section, that would imply that someone is considering switching out of Possen's section, which is patently absurd.Possen is brilliant, enthusiastic, devoted, and awesome. Take this course.",
    "This is class is a survey of philosophy. I would definitely recommend it to another student on the basis of the teacher alone.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to philosophy",
    "This class is incredible. As is the case for all of directed studies, its all great books you know you should read at some point in your life and you get to read them in a personal environment with incredible professors and wonderful, not to mention brilliant, classmates. Possen's Philosophy is the epitome of this. Every day class was a delight, he lets you take the works into your own hands with the occasional nudge or insight as the conversation strays or reaches a point where some outside information would be of help. This class is phenomenal, I don't know how I could do it credit it words, but if you're reading this you've probably been assigned Possen in which case you're a very lucky person; although, being able to go to Yale and do ds, I suppose you already qualify for that quality.A bit of advice: go to lunch as a whole class after every class."
