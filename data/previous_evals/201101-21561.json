    "This is a great class, if you are interested in insurgency and resistance in a variety of forms in many times and places. If you want a summary of how insurgents work and how to fight them, you might be frustrated at first, but the more diffuse, anthropological approach pays off over time. The work load is pretty heavy - you read a book a week, and names are randomly drawn each week for class presentations , so you really have to prepare. Still, most of the books are really interesting. The class discussions were some of the most interesting I've had in any seminar.",
    "This class is a heck of a lot of work, but it's worth it. The way it works is that everyone reads the assigned book each week and puts together a 10 minutes presentation\/critique on it. In class, McGovern chooses two names out of a bag and those two people must present. This may sound like a Draconian way of ensuring everyone does the reading, but it really works. We had some great discussions, and there was rarely a lull in our two hour classes. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The class is not just about insurgency, but also an interesting way to study power structures, definitions of the state, and international politics from a different point of view. Take it!",
    "Good class, great way to get you to think about political violence. McGovern has a shotgun system by which everyone is more or less forced to do the readings. Makes for far better discussions. However unlike most of your other run-of-the-mill book a week courses , you actually have to read a book a week. Come if you really want to think hard and learn a lot about insurgency from an anthropological perspective.",
    "Yes, definitely--you'll be engaged!"
