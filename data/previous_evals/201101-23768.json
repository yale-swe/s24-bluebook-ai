   "comments": [
    "This class was excellent. It provided a very in-depth look at the workings of human rights law in the U.S., and the professor had a lot of personal familiarity with the subject. She was very willing to provide help outside of class and always led an engaging and well-directed discussion. I would absolutely recommend this seminar to anyone - you won't find a similar class on the Alien Tort Statute at Yale, and even though it might sound tedious to learn about the application of just one law for an entire semester, it was truly fascinating.",
    "IF you're interested in getting to know how to read court cases and the state of international customary law, then this class would be extremely helpful. By the end of the class you'll gain some sort of familiarity with court cases and customary norms.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course. The course material is so well put together. I took another class on human rights concurrently with this one, and this class far surpassed the other. The material that we read is focused, fairly concise, and Nicole is always willing to go over material or issues that we do not fully understand. All in all, the class is perhaps one of the best that an individual could take at Yale if he\/she is considering going to law school.",
    "Absolutely take it. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale hands down. If you want to learn anything about the law, take this class. The texts are very hands-on and you will come away with a wealth of knowledge.",
    "As long as you're prepared both for pre-law people who want to show off their knowledge of legal terminology, and some human rights people whose level of caring isn't matched by their grasp of intellectual principles, you can take this course and learn some interesting legal facts.",
    "Great class if you're interested in law. But it's more of an exploratory\/intro course. Don't take it if you want serious legal scholarship. It's a fun course to introduce you to the topic.",
    "Yes!",
    "I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in international law, human rights, or going to law school in the future. The course is a glimpse into a law school course and Nicole is such a great instructor who simply wants everyone to learn the material. She's so helpful and engaging in and out of class. This is a must-take for anyone remotely interested in the law or human rights. Take it! So many people didn't get into it, but if you do, enjoy!",
    "The class is great, but it helps if you are interested in law and human rights, otherwise you might find yourself lost and completely uninterested. The demand for the course is so high that the chances of getting in are already slim, so it helps if you are actually passionate about the material. The information can be dense but it never ceases to be interesting. It's a great class and I highly recommend it.",
    "MOST DEFINITELY: AN EXCELLENT CLASS! I dare say there is no weakness, but only strengths-- the professor, the curriculum, the organization and efficiency, the class make-up and discussions, the readings, everything. I have learned so much about the fundamentals of legal reasoning and writing as well as the judicial process and international human rights law. The class focuses on the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) cases in the US courts which could seem narrow at first, but it actually allows us to examine various issues from torture and genocide to human trafficking as well as war on terror and international comity issues. Two 20-page papers, lots of awesome engaging discussions, lots of meaningful interactions with the professor who is an attorney at Urban Justice Center in NYC.",
    "Take it!! The work is challenging but stimulating and I loved it.",
    "Fantastic class!! Great look at a variety of subject with one underlying focus. I finished the class feeling very knowledgeable about the subject matter and extremely happy that I took the class. The cases that we read give you a good understanding of the legal process, and the in-class discussions make the class accessible to students from various academic backgrounds."
