    "I would highly recommend this course - both for the amazing material which we covered, as well as the dynamic, challenging, engaging classes which facilitated wonderful intellectual activity from all.",
    "A semester study of formation narratives and subversions of this genre. Yet surprisingly focused - did not feel like a survey at all.",
    "Interesting material; easy workload; enjoyable class.",
    "The course was designed to understand and analyze novels of formation and served as an important lens through which to analyze and reconsider the novel and the bildungsroman. The course also included less traditional texts on the course syllabus, thereby expanding and questioning what constitutes the novel of formation, as well as what is traditionally regarded as processes of formation and\/or ruination. The course had far-reaching ramifications regarding questions of genre, family structure, gender, and sexual orientation asking, for instance, whether the novel of formation is primarily a forum for narrating and understanding heterosexual male development.I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the Bildungsroman or issues relating to formation and deformation, and to anyone interested in reading or rereading some of the major canonical texts like Pere Goriot, Alice in Wonderland, and Great Expectations, but through a different lens. It is also a very comparative class insofar as it includes Spanish, German, Italian, and French texts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it greatly contributed to my knowledge of the discipline and gave me useful background about the European Bildungsroman, along with questions and themes that can be applied to a large range of related texts, many of which were written outside of the European context. In fact, it provided me with several orals topics. I have not yet chosen a dissertation topic, so I cannot evaluate the course in this regard. In general, most of the material was very important to a general knowledge of the European Bildungsroman and novel."
