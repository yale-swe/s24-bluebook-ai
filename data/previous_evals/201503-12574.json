   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course! It is very interesting and extends to many different aspects of society. I would warn that there is a great amount of reading involved.",
    "Solid seminar with some really interesting readings and a really nice\/funny professor.",
    "Definitely take.",
    "Examined various markets in society and how culture and society affects economic behavior. Looked at how religion, taboo markets, race, and gender affect socioeconomic behavior and status.",
    "I would summarize SOCY 321 to a fellow student by saying that it is a great discussion-based course focused on the sociological aspects of a market-based economy. Because of its small size, there is ample opportunity for student discussion and to learn from the experiences and knowledge of fellow students. As a graduate student, I appreciated the fact that there were other grad students in the course and I also really appreciated the fact that the course felt like a great, small discussion-based complement to some of the larger courses I have taken with similar course content\/topics.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in getting the space to read some papers and be exposed to the fundamentals of how sociology works and what concerns the field has. However, if you've already taken a class on sociology and are hoping for in-depth examinations of topics like black markets in prostitution and organs, you would probably be better off doing your own research, or just asking for the papers involving these topics from Dr. Wherry."
