   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses are that each section has a different instructor that does things differently- my class only got to do one composition during the entire semester. However, it is also nice that each instructor can tailor the class to their particular interests.",
    "Begins very basic, so I felt like I had a foundation to build upon. It was a little quick towards the middle of the semester, but slowed down sufficiently so that we could go over everything we didn't know.",
    "The strengths are that it is a small class and so you are able to engage better with the material and the professor really is understanding.",
    "Good selection of material. Could have spent more time on developing melody lines.",
    "I didn't pass the placement test to get placed in higher level courses, but the first half of the course was too easy. I wish there would be more ear training and less going over the principles mechanically because a lot of them were just simple calculations of the same stuff.",
    "The course is intro level but there are people who take it that know more and make the pace a bit fast."

    "Yes! Great course if youre a beginner in music or want to get a better background in the concepts you already know.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in music theory at all (I had no previous experience- but it is helpful to go into the class knowing the names of the notes).",
    "Yes! It is a great class to take even for people with no musical background.",
    "Yes i would, music surrounds us and plays a big role in our lives as human beings and it is important and interesting to understanding how this almost mysterious concept works.",
    "Yes! Nice intro to music theory that will prepare you well for higher level classes.",
    "Not to people who already have some background but it is a fun course."
