   "comments": [
    "INRL 696 is really a course evaluating the current international relations climate. It does this effectively with a good syllabus so if you are interested in this type of subject I would highly recommend it.",
    "This course offers a fantastic introduction to international relations questions, predominately from a practitioner's viewpoint. I would thoroughly recommend it to other students.",
    "Take this class if you want a better understanding of contemporary challenges in international relations (without too much theory).",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend the class as the instructor is particularly knowledgeable about a very wide range of pressing international political and political economy questions (not to mention subjects of international law and jurisdiction). The class is a very advanced primer on the most important subjects confronting foreign policy makers in the world today. It bridges the worlds of the press, international legal bodies, pragmatic national politics, and multinational governance initiatives.",
    "Definitely yes. The course covers both the theories and practical issues.",
    "Definitely take the course, it is not easy and requires a lot of readings but totally worth it: my knowledge of international relations after taking it increased significantly."

    "It certainly helped me think about several issues that I would not have considered beforehand.",
    "The course was very helpful in that it taught me skills that I will need down the road - how to write policy papers, memos, concisely, following a rigid structure."
