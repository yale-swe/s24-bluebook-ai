   "comments": [
    "It is definitely a good class to take if you want to learn more about the coding that goes into SAS and R. The course was much more intense than I had thought, so taking it among other difficult courses was not the best choice. I do think that the professor sometimes treated the course as if we were students in computer science\/biostatistics rather than mph students trying to learn some computer science with just a little touch of biostatistics (as the description of the course had made it seem to be). I think the professor needs to be more sensitive to the limited expertise we have in the subject as well as the fact that we have work for other classes.",
    "The course provides systematic training in programming skills in SAS and R. I got improvements in practice through the homework and projects. The lecture notes which are mainly codings are very clear for understanding the methods and further review.",
    "It was a lot of work and directions were unclear at times, BUT I LEARNED A LOT about programming in SAS and R!",
    "I learned a lot from this course. it is excellent",
    "A strength is that Dr. Esserman is very knowledgeable in SAS and R. A Weakness is that there were a lot of \"assumed\" concepts in the class. It was either assumed that we had learned how to do specific advance programming in previous classes or assumed that we would learn it on our own. It was also very difficult to complete the class without adequate feedback on our homework and projects. Assignments have not been graded since October so going into the final its impossible to know where you stand in the class and to know whether or not have you been doing things correctly.",
    "The course had good intentions of teaching us macros and how to write more efficient code, but the lectures were taught poorly.",
    "This was the class that I by far learned the most in this semester. I feel extremely more confident using SAS and R than I had coming into the semester, and I dont think I would have gained this skills at another class at YSPH. I think that these skills are very useful going forward, and the class does a good job of catering to useful programming skills without an extensive biostatistics background. There is room for improvement for the class though. Increasing the clarity of assignments and increasingly the flexibility of grading would be useful. I think that we all appreciated the real world focus (particularly of the SAS component of the class), but with relatively vague assignments it was at times frustrating to be graded on a relatively strict rubric. Also, I spent the most time on this class over all of my other classes this semesterwhile I learned a ton on the homework assignments, some significant portion of time was spent trying to figure out things that werent taught or emphasized in class. A large part of programming, for me, is indeed learning by doing and trial and error, but being a full time student with other obligations as well, I feel like increased clarity in the homework instructions and certainty that all homework topics are discussed in class sufficiently would help alleviate some of the time burden of the homework without decreasing the learning. A final note: I think most of us come into the class with a much stronger background in SAS than in RI think slightly more emphasis on intro\/intermediate R language before diving into functions might be helpful in the future.",
    "I learned a lot in this class and am very glad that I took it. It was challenging and sometimes frustrating but I also think that is part of the coding process. The assignments were not always well tied to the material covered in lecture, which made it difficult because my first instinct was to go back to the lecture code when I didn't know how to do something. Tying these together a little more may help students feel more prepared to do the homework (ie. covering how to merge combining macros before the homework on combining macros is due). Lastly, the assignment write ups were not always transparent. It might be helpful to have someone else (or a TA) look through the assignment write up to make sure that it aligns with the grading rubric and clearly articulates what students are expected to do, as there was often confusion.",
    "This course was a great way (for a non BIS student) to keep practicing statistical programming skills during second year. I thought the material was useful and pretty interesting, and although some assignments seemed more helpful than others I liked the structure of the course (five homework assignments, a midterm, and a final). Some of the assignments were poorly written, either the way that a question was phrased or the dataset being used. I think it would be really helpful for students to have the grading rubrics available to them when completing assignments, so it is easier for them to understand what the professor views as the most important aspects of the assignment. The midterm project was really interesting, and a great hands-on thing to do, but was WAY too long. I'm not sure how it could be reformatted to be less time-intensive while still testing the same skills, however.",
    "Major strength was that the class was taught in the computer lab so that students could follow along with the code being run. I felt like the SAS part of the class was really helpful, but did not gain as much from the R part. We did not spend an equivalent amount of time on formatting and data management in R as we did in SAS, and spent most of the time writing functions in R. Could have used more relevant examples of code for the R functions assignments, I felt like we were not provided with adequate tools. The SAS project was extremely tedious and time consuming, could be shortened by providing students with the list of variables needed to complete the assignment since it took a lot of unnecessary time weeding through which variables to use especially since they were different by year. From the SAS project onward it took a long time to receive grades back on assignments, so I recommend making assignments shorter and\/or hiring a TF to help with grading. Overall, I feel that this course enhanced my programming skills and I definitely feel more comfortable using both SAS and R.",
    "I am really glad that I took this course. It was a lot of work but I definitely feel that my SAS and R skills are significantly stronger than they were at the beginning of the semester. I know that this was the first time that the course was taught, so there a few adjustments that could make it a little better. First, I understand the need to cap the class and to have a way to assess whether the students have had enough experience with SAS and R to be able to handle the course, but I thought that the quiz wasn't a good way to assess that for those of us that hadn't used SAS or R all summer. Additionally, the classes in YSPH are never capped so it was hard during registration to know whether or not we were officially in the course until after registration was processed and it was difficult to know if we needed to register\/shop for another class or not. The lectures are good and very informative. I think a 5 min break is generally helpful in a 2 hour class. Also, I think that incorporating a little more interactivity into the lecture would be helpful - even if it is just a couple minutes of trying something or filling in part of the code ourselves. Definitely shouldn't be the focus of lecture, but could help us to have a little more hands-on work. The homeworks in general were a good way to practice what we learned in class. I think in many cases the instructions for the homeworks could be clearer. Questions were always answered, but I often felt as if many of us had the same questions and had all asked about them individually, where as in other courses when there is a question the professor posts a response to the whole class. Lastly, while I definitely got a lot out of the midterm and final projects, the midterm project was incredibly time consuming - I think I collectively spent 20-30 hours on it (the final project did not take me nearly as long) and I think could've been made a little less work for us with clearer instructions.",
    "A lot of ambiguity in the way questions are worded. There's absolutely no clarity in what's expected of you. You are expected to read her mind to understand what's required of you. Grading system felt more punitive than the Spanish inquisition. This class also went far beyond a programming class. Also come equipped with psychic abilities too. For the SAS project you first had to understand a paper she co-authored, go to NHACS website, download the years needed, decipher the criteria to make up variables which's needed to reproduce tables in the paper and so much more, it's gonna take a full day to go into it. I think this is totally unfair cos when working with researchers you'll be told the criteria for making up variables e.g. race\/ethnicity. The little SAS book by Delwiche is the pry text for the SAS part.Do yourself a favor and forget it. That book is childs' play compared to this course and what's expected of you. Use the Ron Cody text, instead.(learning....a progs guide.) I can't say I can program now, though it's probably allayed my anxiety and the apprehension I had towards programming books.",
    "I declined to rate this class overall in the question above because I don't think it's fair to rate a brand new course the first time it is taught. While I found this course stressful and not as rewarding as I would have liked, I think the course and the instructor have great potential. This was like a beta version. The strengths of the course were the very clear in-class course materials that were created by the instructor, the instructor's willingness to make herself very available to students, and the usefulness of the material. The major weaknesses were the course assignments. Many had the feeling of not having been field tested, which undermined their usefulness for learning. Sometimes the assignments were impossible as assigned and had to be modified when we had already started. Sometimes they required knowledge we could not possibly have based on class without asking the instructor for extra help. Often, I felt the expectations were not clear. Finally, it was impossible to appropriately budget time for them because the time commitment was extremely variable--some assignments took a couple hours, others could take tens of hours. All these things made me dread assignments for this class and undermined my ability to learn from them. Some, like the SAS project, felt like hazing. Again, I think this is all because it was a first-time class. With clearer, cleaner assignments, this will be a very valuable course in the future.",
    "The course brought SAS and R to a higher level, and I learned plenty of new tricks in data analysis. However, the second part of the course, which mainly focused on R, was not useful at all. I was expecting to learn something that could make R as the counterpart of SAS, but the course focused on deeper knowledge of statistics, which is not that useful in data analysis."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Professor Esserman was clearly very knowledgable about the subject and had lectures well prepared. I think a weakness of hers would be her lack of sensitivity to student's abilities and time. She also sometimes seemed reluctant to help much with the homework, or at least unapproachable.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Professor Esserman always answers questions from students patiently and clearly. The contents of each class are organized very well.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Instructor was responsive to questions via email, which was good because I HAD A LOT OF QUESTION! I have several complaints Homework assignments were VERY UNCLEAR with what you wanted!!!! I think one thing that would help would be to actually do the homework assignments before assigning them. The Function HW assignment in R required things that we didn't know how to do, and I think if you had done the assignment yourself before assigning it, you would have realized we needed more information and taught us how to do this in class. Also, your rubrics have additional information on what exactly you want us to turn in, so it would be helpful to see these when doing the assignment. For example, in the SAS macro assignment, there was nothing about a global macro variable, yet it was something you included in the rubric. The output you actually want from the R project is very unclear. You should specifically say you want mean sample size, total sample size, etc. Also, for the SAS macro assignment, you took off points for not giving 2 different types of graphs. Your instructions say \"Provide output for two different types of graphs, one scenario where you use a subsetted data set, and another where you use the full data set.\" The way this reads because of your use of commas is that you want one graph of the full dataset and one graph of a subsetted dataset. It does not read that you want one graph of a histogram and one graph of a boxplot, and I know that I am not the only one that read it like this. YOU NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH WHAT YOU WANT! Your emails to clarify questions often were unclear as well, but they definitely got better as the course went on! For example, your emails to the class clarifying the race variable for the SAS project made no sense. It was only in a personal email that you sent to me did it finally make sense. Also, if students have questions for you regarding the assignment, you should clarify to the entire class because there is a good chance that the entire class has the same question. For example, in the R function HW assignment, you should have sent the information regarding how to read datasets into R functions to the entire class. We didn't learn this in class, so the entire class needed to know this. At one point during the SAS project, somebody was confused about something, and she asked me about it, and I answered them. She then asked me how I knew that, and my response was that, it was in a personal email that you sent to another classmate. If I hadn't asked another classmate and then relayed the info to her, neither of us would have known this critical detail for the project. It would make your life (because you will need to answer fewer of the same questions) and the lives of those in the class much easier, if you email the entire class because WE ALL HAVE THE SAME QUESTIONS.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0very good.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Dr. Esserman knows a lot about SAS and R and was very quick to answer emails. One weakness is that it is difficult for Dr. Esserman to clearly get across what she expects in assignments. A way to improve this is to provide more clear instructions",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Dr. Esserman was very unresponsive to students' questions, and never provided elaborate answers so we did not know what to do. In addition, she did not return assignments on time (I just finished my final and STILL have not received my midterm back) and was very harsh on grading. She did not specify what she wanted for assignments, and thus we were unable to improve. She also refused to put up examples of what may constitute a good code, so it was impossible to determine what to do for subsequent assignments.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Professor Esserman was very helpful and approachable in person and office hours were a very useful way of getting help and understanding material. Initiating more class involvement from the get-go of the semester might allow for students to be more open to asking questions during class when they dont understand something. Also, Professor Esserman was great at promptly responding to emails, but sometimes the responses were a bit unclear or still left questionswasnt a major issue, but potential improvement going forward.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Denise tried hard to assist students and was very accessible by both email and in person. I think she was not used to working with students with only two semesters of statistics. Her comments sometimes showcased her frustration but overall she was knowledgeable on the subject.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Dr. Esserman was one of the most helpful professors I've ever had when attending office hours. Very patient, and very willing to look at my code and help me see the next steps. Sometimes unclear in writing, Dr. Esserman's assignments can be tricky to understand the objectives of, but I do appreciate that she always tries to be succinct. Her emails can also come across as kind of brusque, so I tried to avoid emailing and go to office hours, which were always great. She was very passionate about the topic and willing to go the extra step to help students.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Strengths are that she is a good lecturer and made herself readily available by email to answer questions on assignments. However sometimes her responses seemed rushed and therefore did not completely address what was being asked. Another suggestion is to be more clear on instructions for assignments, there were several questions and uncertainties especially on the SAS and R projects, so just being more straightforward would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0I really liked Denise as a professor. She is very responsive to in-class questions as well as questions over email, and I found her incredibly helpful in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0She gives you tools for a unicycle and expects a Jet. She just threw code at us without clear explanations. Even the book Advanced R by Hadley Wickham is so much clearer,methodical(with explanation for every line of code) than class notes. The reason why class notes are scanty is 'cos she wants us to attend classes. I think this is unfair 'cos YSPH has no video system and this is not a class where the overall picture matters,thus scanty notes would suffice. It's a class where you need to understand every line of code and why\/logic\/alternatives. Most of the grading for the midterm project and final project is based on the last couple SAS lectures prior to the MIDS (macros)AND last couple R lectures prior to the FINALS(simulations). I honestly wished the SAS project had been given to us in bits as homework. This builds skills, thorough learning and understanding. The projects were exhaustively overwhelming. Frankly, Denise is not here to teach. She's here to assess students who have it all figured out. When you asked questions for clarity, she had this incredulous look in her eyes.....",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0The professor spent an incredible amount of time on this class and was always very responsive. The course materials she made (commented sample code) were pure gold. The problems with the assignments I mentioned above meant that she was constantly helping students outside of class. She was generous with her time and gave detailed, thoughtful feedback. I think it would improve both her experience and students' experience if she established clearer expectations about assignments before we began them.",
