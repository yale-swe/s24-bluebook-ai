    "A great course if you want to learn about Astro but don't want to be tested about it. You will learn mostly from your discussions with your fellow and that's how you expand your ideas of time and space. I love how we learned everything from scientific newspaper. Like, now you can read an articles on gravitational waves and really understand everything they are talking about.",
    "I would recommend the course. It provides some general knowledge of astronomy.",
    "Definitely recommend this class to another fellow freshman as a science credit. Not too much work and the material is really interesting.",
    "Very cool course for anyone not interested in studying astronomy. If you really like math\/want to see the equations in (apparently) a similarly low-stress environment, take that instead. Good class overall. Low workload, interesting material. Professor Edwards is very engaging and knowledgable. Would recommend.",
    "Incredibly interesting and engaging",
    "An overall view of the ideas of relativity, expanding universe, and astronomy. Conceptual based, not mathematically."
