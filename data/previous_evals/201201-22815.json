    "I would recommend english 120. You get to read a lot of great essays and also have a lot of flexibility in your own writing. It is a lot of creative non-fiction. Expect either writing or editing an essay every week. Work shopping essays is a great exercise in which you get a lot of feedback from peers.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to improve their writing, both in creative nonfiction but also in analytical writing. It is a lot of work though (one essay per week), so I wouldn't suggest it to someone who is looking for a more lenient course.",
    "It's excellent. Take this class. Take it now. You will learn to write. If you think writing clearly isn't necessary, you're wrong.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to anyone interested in becoming a better writer for any reason. I took the class as a senior and, while I wish I had taken it earlier so that I could go on to take more writing classes at Yale, I would recommend it to anyone of any year.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, and be sure to take it with Colleen Kinder if you can. You won't regret it.",
    "English 120 is a really good opportunity for learning to write more clearly and precisely. You learn to write for audiences, and to write in an interesting way. These skills are really important and will serve you well whatever you decide to continue with. The pace of the class feels fast sometimes, with a draft or a final paper due almost every week. The key is to put time into your drafts, because then you'll get the best feedback and revising will be enjoyable... you won't feel like you have to just scrap the first draft, which you will end up doing if you write it quickly the night before (drafts aren't graded, so that's tempting). Class itself is enjoyable; you discuss the essays that were assigned as readings. Readings are always really light, and there's a great variety, so you're sure to love at least some of the things you read over the semester.... And if you don't like some others, it doesn't feel like a big deal - it's one day and you move on from them. You're not tested- your essays and participation make up the grade. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the class! Just don't slack on the drafts and it'll be a good experience and your writing will REALLY improve",
    "English 120 is, in my opinion, a course that every Yale student should take. You read really great works of nonfiction writing, both classic and on the newer side, and the reading is always a lot of fun. The workload (a draft one week, a final paper the next, and so on) is doable as long as you plan ahead, especially with research\/reporting. And, since enrollment is capped, everyone gets to know each other well, and workshops are pretty low-stress.",
    "The reading is moderate, but enjoyable to read. Make sure to write down notes as you read, so you can participate in class. Class is all discussion, so be prepared to speak. There are 5 essays. Workshops can be a bit tedious.My overall recommendation is to definitely take the class! Best class I've taken at Yale thus far!",
    "English 120 is a lot of fun. It's a fair amount of reading, although never overwhelming, and while it can be a lot of work to write a draft or a finished essay almost every week, the topics are interesting. I felt like the class was challenging, but never difficult to get through. I would absolutely recommend this class to anybody and everybody.",
    "Absolutely. Even if you already have your writing credits. This is worthwhile. Professor Kinder was THE BEST. We read a lot of great essays, and she came to class prepared to launch us into great discussions. At the end of every class, she always brought the discussion around to the skills each author used to write a great essay. You could tell that she knew what she wanted us to get out of each essay and why she chose it.",
    "English 120, in a nutshell, teaches you how to write engaging non fiction essays in a creative way. For example, ever want to talk about some kind of life changing experience that you had? Obviously, if you just \"narrated\" what happened and then concluded why it was life changing, no one would really read it or find it \"engaging\". English 120 teachers you to write about these non fiction ideas in a way that will capture the reader's attention and it is TONS OF FUN.I took classes in Literature analysis (metaphor, simile etc) back in high school...ENG 120 is nothing like that. You read model essays from writers of the \"modern essay\" like Malcolm Gladwell, Wesley Yang and Virginia Woolf and learn about \"why their essays work.\" Then you take these techniques and apply them to your own writing. Over the course of 5 essays (each essay has a first and final draft), your writing will improve by leaps and bounds through emulation of these techniques and fusing them with your own creativity.I highly recommend Prof. Kinder, she is a writer by profession and gives you a page of insightful comments in addition to hand written annotations on your essay (more than I ever got from my high school teacher). She is extremely dedicated and really good at explaining writing concepts. She has less reviews than other ENGL 120 professors because she has taught less classes than other professors, but trust me, she is a really incredible professor. I like her because she \"actually writes\" the non fiction style of essays she is teaching, so Prof. Kinder is very clear when explaining the inner workings of an essay.",
    "I loved this class. Writing or revising an essay every week is daunting, but it improved my writing a lot and helped me find an efficient writing process. The class also introduced me to a lot of great nonfiction."
