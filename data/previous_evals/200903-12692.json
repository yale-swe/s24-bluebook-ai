    "I would say take this class!",
    "Good course if you want to know the ins and outs of the international dimensions of civil wars.",
    "Yes. Great course for those interested in intra-state conflict. Emphasis tends to be on ethnic conflicts, but any IS\/Political Science- International Relations major should find something to be interested in. From humanitarian interventions and refugee flows to political calculations of international institutions, this class approaches conflict from many angles.",
    "I recommend this seminar to anyone who is interested in the topic. The final paper really allows you to explore whichever conflict you are interested in discussing.",
    "Definitely take it",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in secessions and irredentism.",
    "This class seemed great from the description but was a little slow at times. Professor Siroky talks quietly and extensively and hasn't quite learned how to draw students into material yet."
