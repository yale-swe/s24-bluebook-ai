    "This class was incredible in terms of shaping how I think about literature. It was obvious that the professors put a lot of thought into constructing the syllabus all of the texts were exemplars of different narrative techniques. They were naturally in dialogue with each other, and we could see how texts resembled and differed from each other in narrative strategy. Of course, the main idea of this class was syuzhet and fabula, leading to the questions: what's the story and how is it told? They're simple questions, but they led to such wonderful insights on literature and life itself.",
    "The course did a great job of teaching me how to read literary works for their meaning and the professors also put a lot of effort in preparing students how to write good essays."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: syllabus, lectures, professors, papers, short writing assignments (I thought the 1-page paper assignments were useful it did help to simply be writing) Weaknesses: discussion sections were a little rushed. for example, one day on Woolf was not nearly enough. I think an optional weekly discussion section might be helpful and would attract enough interest."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Lit120 has developed a bad rep, which it certainly does not deserve especially now. The professors have designed the course with so much care such that we can see how the texts resemble and differ from each other in narrative strategy. The texts themselves are amazing and change the way you think about storytelling and even life itself. Lectures were generally very good. The quality of discussion section, of course, depends on your professor. While Quint is a brilliant scholar, he wasn't the best discussion leader. That said, there were only 4 people in my class, so it was a bit difficult for all of us. Still, I think it's worth taking with him since his insights in class will make you want to reread the books. Plus, he gives excellent feedback on papers.",
    "Yes, I think it's a great introductory course for students interested in literature, and especially the nature of narrative. I took it as a senior Humanities major with lots of prior English experience, and still felt like I got a lot out of the course."
