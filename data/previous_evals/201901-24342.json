    "A better ability to communicate (reading, writing, and orally) in Spanish.",
    "I learned a lot of new vocabulary (health & wellness, the environment, the neighborhood, etc.) and a lot of new verb tenses as well (the imperfect, the subjunctive, imperatives, etc.). We also engaged with important literary texts and gave presentations about different Spanish-speaking countries, which helped to hone our understanding of the Spanish cultural sphere as well. Overall a very solid impression of the class.",
    "I learned more about the culture of different Spanish-speaking countries as well as new vocabulary. I gained more comfort speaking, writing, listening, and reading Spanish.",
    "Increased confidence, improved speaking and oral comprehension.",
    "I developed a basic level of spanish competency"

   "question_id": "YC403",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are definitely the course's organization and weakness I would say is integrating the literature and movies more into the course structure instead of them just feeling like a random aside.",
    "This course is fast paced, but the pace forces students to understand concepts and practice their skills. There is no time to get behind in this course, which keeps it engaging.",
    "The primary weakness I want to emphasize is that I feel I didn't get enough opportunities to speak in the classroom. Maybe it would have been better if Profesora would call on people directly instead of opening up the discussion for the classroom (because then no one talks because everyone is tired because it is a 9:25)",
    "It is very well organized. I think it could improve by having more projects that get students speaking with each other.",
    "This course was fantastic. Good variation in materials.",
    "I think the problem with the course is that it meets every day and is generally only offered in the mornings. This creates a whole lot of conflicts and huge opportunity costs for students who would like to take a two hour course once a week."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would especially recommend Seora Baffi. It is a good course to take if you're actually interested in increasing your Spanish fluidity and not just fulfilling a language requirement.",
    "My Spanish skills and confidence in communicating in the language improved greatly over the semester. I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes definitely. It was really exciting seeing the work I put into the class aggregate over time -- I didn't know any Spanish last fall, and now I know thousands of words and can engage with a half dozen different tenses. I am definitely not fluent, and wouldn't even consider myself proficient, but I am proud of the progress I've made.",
    "I would!",
    "Absolutely. Both enjoyable and I learned a lot."
