   "comments": [
    "It introduces well to various techniques of multi-variable calculus that are used not only in math but also in other sciences, esp. physics. However, prospective math majors should take Math 230 instead, as math 120 focuses more on applications than on foundations.",
    "The class is very conceptual. If you're bad at visualizing 3D coordinate systems, it'll be a lot of work.",
    "Math 120 is certainly not an easy course but getting past it feels great exactly because it is challenging!",
    "To summarize the class, the first half pretty much consisted of preparation for the second half. The second half contained the bulk of the material which, for the most part, revolved around line integrals, surface integrals, and volume. I would definitely recommend this course because even if you do not plan on majoring in a STEM field, the material learned allows for a new vew on how certain things work.",
    "The class will give you a solid understanding of multivariable calculus by the end, but expect to be using the textbook as your main study tool. Class lectures essentially cover the same information as the textbook, so it might be beneficial to preview the week's material ahead of time so that you're not confused by the material presented in class. When midterms and finals come around, try to go to Miki's review sessions, since she sets the class curriculum and writes the tests.",
    "Math 120 is not suitable for people who have never done multivariable calc or anything close to it before. if you are not a maths genius do not take this class unless you really must.",
    "gets through a lot, good to know multi",
    "Pretty straightforward multivariable calc course, your experience really depends on who you get. Professor Koberda was a bit dry, but very straightfoward in his explanations of concepts and was always available for extra help. He's definitely at the better end of the spectrum of the course teachers.",
    "Yes, take Math 120 if you are looking for a solid foundation in calculus and basic math skills! Though the material can be tedious at times and the tests can be quite difficult, Math 120 applies to many other fields, especially economics and the sciences. If you enjoy calculus and want to have an understanding of three-dimensional math, Math 120 comes in handy. Make sure you shop different sections and take the class with an engaging professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 120 to another student. The class provides the tools necessary for many careers and gives you a good background in math.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class unless required to."
