    "I would never recommend this class to anyone outside of the BENG major, and it should not be required for the major based on how it is taught now.",
    "You have to take it for your major if you're BME. Hopefully they fix all the problems with this course by next year.",
    "Fun fact: BENG 356L is the lowest rated class on CourseTable at a 1.6. By a margin of 0.7. \"Psh,\" you say, \"students are bitter, it can't be that bad.\" Yes, we are bitter. Because it was that bad, and the rating should be a 0. The course was so terribly taught that I took the time to write a response in every single evaluation box so that future BME students might not have to suffer through this travesty of a lab like we did. Fahmy's \"teaching\" was a slap in the face to students and instructors everywhere. We started off the semester with a series of 2 hour plus long lectures over material we never actually applied in the lab. Fahmy was consistently late to lectures (by 15+ minutes), established little to no communication with us and our TAs, and was an unengaging, sleep-inducing lecturer, to put it very, very nicely. Fahmy failed to properly manage time over the course of the semester, eventually forcing us to condense a semester's worth of lab modules into ~5 weeks. Our poor TAs (who could also never seem to get in touch with Fahmy) were swamped with the task of guiding us through our projects, and Fahmy was nowhere to be found during the second half of the semester, as in we literally never saw or heard from him. The material in this lab had great potential but was completely ruined by a complete lack of respect by Fahmy. He essentially abandoned the course a couple weeks in and left everyone else to tread water. I can't stress enough how horrified I am at the fact that part of our tuition money and time was dedicated towards this course. This lab contributed negatively to my Yale education and Fahmy should be banned from teaching any courses in the future.",
    "This is a terribly disorganized lab, but, if you're a BME major, you have to take it, anyway. Try to get into the section with fewer people so that you won't have as many scheduling conflicts.",
    "If this course is as it was this year, absolutely dont take it unless you have to. It was honestly the worst taught class I have ever taken at Yale and expect to take. That being said, the material covered is pretty interesting (biomaterials, MRI, microfluidics), the TAs do a good job running the modules, and I expect the course to improve in the future.",
    "i would not recommend this class because it was just a huge headache for everyone involved",
    "This is honestly the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. It was plagued with poor planning, poor organization, and poor communication. We didn't start labs until there were 6 weeks left in the semester, and this put a huge strain on the TAs and students to get everything done in time, especially because the lab reports were due in the last 3 weeks of classes. Fahmy was completely unresponsive and unprofessional, and the labs only got done because the TAs were the ones to handle them. Fahmy regularly came late (one time he came more than an hour late), and when he did come to lab, he would lecture on material related to, but not directly relevant to any of the labs we were supposed to be doing. His assessments were not reflective or indicative of the material we were supposed to learn in the labs. This is a class that is nowhere near the standard I have come to expect from Yale, and it's shameful how much this class was neglected and how poorly it was organized and taught.",
    "I would sadly not recommend BENG 356L to any other student, but as it is a requirement for the BME major it's not like anyone actually has a choice. Take it because you have to take it, but bear in mind that this is one of the worst classes that Yale has to offer. It was both stressful not to have any structure to the class and ultimately a waste of time for everyone. I feel as though there was so much potential in the material presented in this class, but it ultimately failed in execution. I remember reading the reviews and thinking people must have been exaggerating when they talked about how bad the course was, but they were right. Keep this in mind when taking the class.",
    "This lab class had the potential to be great like the first semester lab class, but I was totally let down. I would absolutely not recommend this class to anyone at Yale, even other BME majors. Almost every hour I spent in the lab was a complete waste of time",
    "This lab is not run well at all. You dont have enough time to do the labs because you waste all of the time being lectured, but you dont really learn anything.",
    "If you have to take this class with Fahmy, I'm sorry in advance.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT IF PROF. FAHMY IS TEACHING IT! DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS PROF. FAHMY TEACHES!",
    "A terrible course. This course was terribly taught, poorly ran, and lacked transparency. At many times no one knew what was going on--whether that meant the material being taught, the place\/time we were supposed to meet, or the content being tested. Our professor, Dr. Fahmy, was a poor lecturer. He mumbled when he taught, did not present material clearly, and was frequently late, without adequate notice. At one point, he gave us a quiz that tested us on material different from the material that he advised us to learn. Furthermore, Dr. Fahmy was absent at many points during the course, whether physically or by not responding to e-mail (that frequently were inquiring about course logistics). Many times, our course material was given to us on the day we were supposed to meet. Due to Professor Fahmy's poor teaching, we ended up several weeks behind and did not start doing physical lab until more than halfway through the semester. At that point, we had to rearrange lab groups, change lab procedure, and scramble in order to complete the lab objectives. To conclude, this is not the first year that this class has been poorly run. This class very much needs to be revamped and rethought because it is doing a terrible job of teaching lab objectives.",
    "This class is mandatory for BME majors, unfortunately. We had three modules with lab reports, all of which were pushed to the end of the semester. Unfortunately, the class was very disorganized, and had little cohesion, so most students had no idea what was happening. There was also, curiously, a final examination, but the questions were poorly designed. The professor was also difficult to contact, though he is a very nice person. When you take this class, appeal to the TAs for questions regarding the lab report. Good luck."
