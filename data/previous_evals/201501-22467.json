   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Bazell was great, and you learn a ton about cancer. It is a great class to have in a seminar form, because it allows for a lot of discussion.",
    "Definitely take this course. You will learn a lot because you'll be held accountable. At the same time, Professor Bazell manages to bring various perspectives to a subject we are all familiar with.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 040 01. Whether you're a science major interested in history\/politics, a poli-sci major interested in science, or even anyone who likes interesting, thoughtful classes, it provides a wide range of appeals. We don't just learn about cancer and what is known on a scientific level, but also on a personal level. For example, one of the main texts we read is \"Emperor of All Maladies\" (now a documentary) by Siddartha Mukherjee, which is a biography of cancer.",
    "A wonderful class that explores many aspects of the cancer world. Really interesting readings, and great professor. Definitely try to get into this class.",
    "It's great if you are not looking for a class that's too heavy on the science!"
