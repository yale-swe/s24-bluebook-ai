    "Voice Lessons are very useful, especially if you practice and have a dedicated teacher.",

    "Great course. Master an art you love in weekly lessons. It rocks.",
    "If you want to seriously pursue voice or just love to sing, take this class.",
    "If you've done the theory requirement, no reason not to take this course. Still, be wary of Janna oversubscribing her studio.",
    "Voice lessons for credit is an experience that totally depends on your teacher. Some of the teachers are wildly underqualified, and some are fairly decent. Some students make great progress, while others likely retrogress. The program lacks any central oversight, so it is entirely up to the student and teacher to try to make progress over the course of the semester. Because the teachers and students are all incredibly busy, it can be very difficult to schedule lessons since the program provides the god-awful 9am-noon on Saturday slot as a standard time for lessons, during which neither students nor teachers want to have lessons. It\u2019s usually a pretty low workload, but I can honestly say I got next to nothing out of taking these lessons this semester."
