    "FILM 350 is a class that introduces students to the world of screenwriting. The final project is a 8 to 12 page screenplay. The midterm project is a large portfolio that consists of analysis of nine famous screenplays and work on your final screenplay. I would recommend this to a friend that was interested in a creative writing-type course. However, I would warn them about the midterm project because it was a lot of work. If the student is just looking for another casual writing course, I would recommend something else.",
    "I would recommend Film 350 without hesitation to students seriously considering pursuing screenwriting in the future. Keep in mind that there is a lot of work that goes into the midterm folder, but this class is an enjoyable experience. You'll grow tremendously from it. I know I did.",
    "Intro Screenwriting is the perfect class for someone looking to get into the art of screenwriting without much experience (as an intro class should be). The class is entertaining and will definitely inspire a love for the craft if it really is your thing. The work is definitely manageable as long as you don't procrastinate on your midterm folder and final draft (as many do!). I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in film and telling stories.",
    "I did enjoy this class. I was happy to be exposed to a genre of writing I hadn't experimented with before. Professor Lapadula also does a good job of building a community of writers. I made a lot of friends in the class!",
    "Absolutely take this course if you want to learn how to write screenplays! You've probably heard about the midterm folder but don't let that deter you....but don't forget about it until the last minute if you do take the course. Marc is a character, and I do think his antics are more amplified during the first few weeks in order to pare down the class size. This course is certainly one that you'll look forward to concluding your week with if you do take it."
