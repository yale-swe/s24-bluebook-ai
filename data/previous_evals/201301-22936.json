    "It's demanding and a bigger time commitment than most of my other classes, but if you put the work in then you will definitely learn. It's a great class and people should definitely take it.",
    "Definitely take it if you took L1. You will learn a lot more grammar as well as practice speaking a little more. If you can, take this class with Youness! He explains all the concepts extremely well and is a very understanding teacher. Youness made learning Arabic fun, and inspired me to want to do well, even though a lot of the material is tough.",
    "It does require a lot of time and hard work, but it's definitely better than L1 as far as my enjoyment of the course goes.",
    "I would summarize it as daily exercises and weekly quizzes that are relatively straight forward. Exams can be difficult but as the class progresses you get used to the exam format and can improve. I would recommend it only to someone serious about learning arabic.",
    "Depends on your professor and what you are looking to get out of it. I am totally in love with arabic so no matter how good\/bad I will keep taking it wherever I am but I rather take arabic classes taught in appreciation of the language and in depth analysis. Arabic on college campuses usually is taken by Americans that are interested in doing work in the Middle East so it tends to try and be more pragmatic which to me is problematic because Arabic has a very special logic and flow to it. I would have liked to learn it in a more traditional manner respecting the language rather than \"what can we teach you in 4 months that will make you understand stuff when you are working abroad in Iraq or something\"",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course -- it greatly increased my knowledge of the Arabic language and my interest in the region.",
    "I would recommend that people take the class with Youness, but I would want them that the course is organized very poorly",
    "Yes I would recommend this class"
