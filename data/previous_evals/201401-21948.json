   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are considering inorganic chemistry as a specialty. The lab reports are actually meaningful and will help with your analytical skills. Awesome lab class, awesome professor. Looked forward to it every week. However, the Friday afternoon lecture was a bummer and was rather ill-timed.",
    "Do not mistake this class: it is a full-credit lab. The actual experiments are not intensive, but coming to lecture on Friday afternoons, as annoying as it may be, is both required and very helpful for the 4-5 full lab reports you will have to do over the course of the semester. Luckily, Parr and the TA's are usually pretty accessible via email and respond within a small window, though they may be slightly condescending. All told, it's a decent class.",
    "Nice intro chem lab. Very personal without the crowdedness of the other intro level ones.",
    "Good class. If you've taken pchem lab, this class is much more reasonable and Parr is much more reasonable. The labs were pretty chill and I thought it was good",
    "For a lab, it's not too bad. The lab sessions are fine. The lab reports aren't too bad. If you're a chem major, this is a good choice for the advanced lab requirement.",
    "Chem 251L is a great lab, but it differs from other labs in the department in terms of how you are expected to write the lab reports. Parr is aiming for a more realistic, journal-like style, a style that actually requires you to be a good scientific writer and understand what you are saying. This makes writing the lab reports harder and longer but also infinitely more rewarding than, say, an orgo lab report. There will be 4 lab reports in total if you don\u2019t take it as the optional WR credit. As for the lab itself, the experiments are well conceived and interesting (the last one is a Grubbs ROMP \u2013 now that\u2019s contemporary chemistry, young man!), sometimes bordering organic chemistry. But don\u2019t be afraid \u2013 if you\u2019re ever in a pinch, Parr will be there to help you. Parr will also always be happy to read drafts of your lab reports and he will always give you useful feedback on them. It is obvious that he cares about making you a better scientific writer. I recommend the class to all chemistry majors.",
    "Yes--it is a reasonable amount of work, you produce compounds with lots of pretty colors, accessible to both majors and non majors. Also a writing credit for scientists who don't want to take an English class.",
    "Very interesting class. The lab reports require some real critical thinking and research into the literature. If you want to learn about inorganic chemistry experiments and techniques, jonathan parr has crafted the perfect class for you.",
    "Overall a nice exploration of some topics in inorganic chemistry. I thought the experiments were very neat, and although they didn\u2019t make sense to me at first, after writing the lab report, I found myself with a much better understanding of the things we did. It doesn\u2019t really follow the lecture course that well though, so if you\u2019re taking both simultaneously, it doesn\u2019t help that much. There were also some topics like crystal planes, Tanabe Sugano diagrams, Nephelaxeutic effect and gerade\/ungerade that we didn\u2019t touch on in Inorganic Chemistry at all. It wasn\u2019t clear whether or not we needed to talk about these topics in our reports, and I often found myself having to do a lot of outside reading to accommodate these topics. We only stayed until 5 PM a few times during the semester. The Friday section is annoying at first, but they turn out to be really valuable as Parr explains which is expected for each report and how to go about it. I wish he would have uploaded the slides he prepared for these lectures, because they would have been useful references during report-writing. I most appreciated that the course was not like the run of the mill chemistry class. There\u2019s definitely more of a focus on writing in a more professional manner. Redundant data, poor explanations and bad organizational structure are the things that are most important for your report \u2013 there\u2019s not as much of an emphasis on yield or proving that you did the experiment correctly. It definitely feels like a mature version of laboratory and I liked that a lot. Do the writing credit! It's not a lot more work.",
    "Good lab, liked it a lot more than orgo lab. There's a decent amount of writing though, which is often a lot more than you expect. The experiments are very interesting and I learned a lot."
