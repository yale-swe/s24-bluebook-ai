    "10\/10 would recommend",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester. It's so fun to learn about sports with a group that is also very passionate about the topic and everyone brings in their own perspective as a fan or player of a particular sport.",
    "This was a really engaging class, although I think (like a lot of seminars) the other students taking the course could make a huge difference. The material is used as a jumping off point to discuss a huge variety of issues. It's a lot of work though; in the same week in which we had less than 48hrs to write ~2400 words for the midterm, we were assigned 3 documentaries, 2 films, and ~80 pages of reading. If you're willing to put the time in, it's definitely worth it.",
    "I have only felt truly engaged with two classes at Yale. This was one of them. Take AMST 307 not because you're a sports fan, but because you want to understand how important an education truly is.",
    "Definitely recommend it, but be prepared to do a lot of work",
    "Sports, civil rights, and american leadership is a really interesting and provocative class.You'll learn about the interaction between sports, politics, race, and society, a topic seldom covered in mainstrream classes. You also won't just be covering the obvious topics like jackie robinson; you'll did into historical figured like Babe Didrikson, Jack Johnson, etc. Note: THIS IS NOT A GUT! There is a lot of reading and documentary viewing, so don't take this as a fifth class. That said, if you want to really understand how sports has changed society, this class is for you!",
    "Definitely take this class if you like sports, reading, and writing",
    "Take it. You will enjoy the subject and the analysis. It's so worth it!",
    "As a sports fan, I thought this was a fun way of reading good sports books and watching interesting 30-for-30 movies. This class will attract a number of sports fans, so be aware of that if you're not as into sports. The final paper isn't too bad, though Dean Spooner grades fairly harshly.",
    "Generally a great class. If you are passionate about sports, you will love it. Seminar is almost completely discussion-based, so get ready to participate a lot and listen to what your classmates have to say. Dean Spooner is so engaging, and effortlessly guides class discussion. All that said, the workload is heavy, and often feels like it is unnecessarily so for instance, reading a book and watching 3 films for one week, all on a similar topic. There is a major final research paper, which was challenging but rewarding in the end.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in sports. It's a lot of reading, but the books typically fly by because the content is worthwhile."
