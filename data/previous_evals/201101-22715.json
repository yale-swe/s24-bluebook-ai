    "Take it if you're interested in the subject, certainly, but know that it's not going to be a rigorous math class.",
    "First time this class was taught. Interesting subject matter, but a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. Class started out easy, but shot up in difficulty after the midterm. Instead of a final test, we had to do a final project, but all the project recommendations were quite advanced. Homework involves programming in MATLAB, but the programs are straight forward enough. First problem sets had trivial linear algebra proofs in them, but by the last problem set, we were having to do straight-up analysis proofs. Never having taken analysis, I was quite unhappy.Wavelets are a rather new thing, so there are not many online resources or textbooks or wikipedia articles to help you out if you're stuck on homework and need to look something up. Went to office hours a lot since the professor was really the only source for help.",
    "I would say only take this class if you have some prior experience with MATLAB or you're pretty good with computers or if you have a serious interest in learning. The math used here isn't terribly bad but there's a lot of notation to learn and it can get extremely difficult very quickly especially when programming is involved. That said, if this class is taught again definitely take it with Feiszli if you're interested. He's an exceptionally good professor and I can only imagine that taking this class with someone who isn't good would just be excruciatingly painful.",
    "great course, some of the most useful and interesting things you'll ever learn!",
    "I would recommend MATH 262 to another student.",
    "I'd recommend it. It's an interesting subject, and there's a lot of focus on motivations for the theory and applications, which I appreciated. This was the first time it was offered, so it was pretty disorganized and there were a lot of errors in the problem sets."
