    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It was more of a social history of sports, since we mostly focused on women and minorities in sports. This made the class quite redundant at times and the conversations weren't great, unfortunately. I didn't need to dedicate an entire semester to learn that white men treated women, minorities, and gay people unfairly. There were some readings that were much more interesting about topic like cheating, technology, TV, etc, but a lot of the in-class conversation focused on the social aspects."
