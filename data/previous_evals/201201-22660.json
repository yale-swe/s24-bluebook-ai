    "I would recommend this class as a part of the Spanish sequence at Yale. Although it's taken mostly as a prerequisite, the course has provided me with priceless skills and the ability to use the Spanish language better.",
    "The course is solid. You have to learn about 10 tenses one after another, so don't go into it thinking you can troll around the whole semester like you did L1. You will have to work, but then again it's Spanish, so while L2 is harder, it's not hard. It's well-organized, and well-planned (just like L1).Lissette's very nice, though she's disorganized. She often didn't know when assignments were due, or told us the wrong due dates, or forgot to check for assignments. She's a kind lady.",
    "Expect to do a lot of work outside the classroom, especially compared to 110.",
    "Spanish 120 is exactly what you'd expect, it's a lot like Spanish 110. I thought the course was well organized, the workload was reasonable, and was well taught.",
    "It is not a really difficult class but you have to work hard and be vigilant to get good grades.",
    "Very hard. If you've taken spanish, go ahead. If you havent, do something else or prepare to be stressed all the time",
    "Yes, gives you solid foundations"
