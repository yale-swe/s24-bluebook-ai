    "Excellent course; students come out of this course with a great skill set, applicable for research or work settings. Grading system was variable throughout the semester which was, for lack of a better word, annoying to deal with. Some assignments that I spent a lot of time of ended up being graded on and up\/down scale. But all in all, what's important is that this class teaches you a lot!",
    "1. Instructor is not necessary for student to learn the material. Lectures are hapazardly put together and a waste of time. Class material was self taught.2. Instructor needs to clarify, on day one, his expectations and grading framework. Throughout the semester his expectations of the students and project goals were constantly changing.3. Instructor sells the course as an introductory GIS course for those with no prior experience, however he only teaches to those in the top 5 or 10 percent of his grading scale. There needs to be an instructor who cares about the rest of the students.4. Bowers is an inappropriate space for this course. This course needs a lab component.",
    "I do not believe that GIS can be properly taught through a lecture. It should be something that looks more like a lab, where the steps to achieve certain results are described in practice.",
    "The class started very intensly and requires extra time and effort for non-GIS experienced students in the first place. Upon catching on the learning curve, it requires a standard amount of work, and allows for extra credits if desired",
    "The skills in this course are incredibly valuable. I was a bit frustrated with the homework process - Ifound it to be incredibly stressful, and I wished I had a sense of the rubric or concepts we'd be graded on before I started assignments - I often felt like I was working in the dark, trying to guess what made one approach good or bad. This confusion often persisted after the assignments were turned in - we could see which projects did well or poorly, but I was less clear on *why.* The grading system also seemed to discourage people from working together, which is something that was really helpful later on in the course, when we formed teams.",
    "#3 Completing the out of class assignment takes time but is well worth it.#1 You don't really have readings for the class but the handouts that are given to you to explain different features of GIS tools serve as a useful reference.#9 The class is large yet Professor Tomlin has always responded to my requests in a timely manner. His feedback is concise and instructive.",
    "Professor Tomlin is a wonderful teacher in the sense that he is enthusiastic and instills some excitement and wonder about the subject matter, but his explanations really work for certain kinds of people and don't work very well for others. He is very conceptual but it was sometimes hard for those of us who are less naturally inclined to spatial problem solving to understand his approach.The reason I felt the course was not so suitable for students with interests similar to mine is that the course seemed geared toward people who would like to be using GIS themselves to solve problems during their careers. That's a bit more depth than I was looking for, which was to understand what GIS can do, to be able to have some facility with it, and to be able to interact with GIS specialists on a high enough level that I could ask them to solve certain problems for me.",
    "I learned a lot from the assignments (which sometimes took 20 hours a week..) but it was worth it. The lectures though were too long and I couldn't followthem. At one time it's super basic, the next moment it's too in the weeds and I can't even understand what we are thinking.",
    "Good class, but the pace was very fast",
    "I think it would have been valuable to have some hands-on Lab time to interact with the software as we were discussing the concept - perhaps a 1 hour lecture, then 2 hours of guiding us through steps in the Lab. While the handouts were extremely detailed, I think the opportunity to ask questions while using the software would help facilitate the learning process."

    "-variable grading system hard to follow",
    "The grading system in this course didn't really work for me. I couldn't help thinking the instructor was making it up as he went along. I was told at one point that my grade was suffering because I was choosing not to do the optional brainteasers, which makes me wonder what the instructor's definition of \"optional\" really is.",
    "Not sure if this was me or the course, but I found the assignments very difficult--even with all the help, I found it very challenging to figure out how to approach issues conceptually.",
    "INSTRUCTOR-- give him the top 5 students and hire someone else for the rest of us.",
    "I do not feel confident about using GIS and about the skills I learnt in this class because the assignments (which are the only moment when you really sit down to use the software) were individual and completely unguided! This made it unnecessarily incredibly time consuming, while having someone by my side to help me understand the concepts and the tools would have been fast and much more productive.",
    "Instructor can be a bit difficult to approach-- a bit harsh at times.",
    "Grading criteria for each assignment varies and lacks adequate explanation, many times feeling arbitrary.Some of the teaching techniques serve as enablers for overachievers. For instance, there are many, many opportunities for extra credit for those students with the time and drive to complete them. This resulted in a very skewed grading distribution at the end of the semester.",
    "The grading scheme (per each assignment) is arbitrary, and tuned based on the average responses of the class members. It might be challenging to understand what is required\/expected\/graded at first",
    "The class was extremely big and the classroom I felt was not the most appropriate. Getting a seat in the far back made it really hard to pay attention.",
    "I found the process of turning in homework to be incredibly stressful - I really wish there were more tutorials, more group work, or some other kind of mechanism to be able to play around with concepts before beginning the process of starting an assignment. Pretty early on, a divide between people with GIS experience and those new to the course began to emerge, and I felt a bit frustrated about the lack of tools to help newer people catch up, especially when both homework assignments and overall grades were often made according to a curve (i.e., extra points given to the best homework assignments, etc.).",
    "I didn't mind it but many people found the grading structure frustrating. I think it allows for flexibility and resilience (e.g gives opportunities to make up for a poor grade on an assignment).",
    "The most infuriating thing about the course was how unclear it was at times how we were to be evaluated for our work. Sometimes the instructions were vague and grading criteria were only provided after our assignments were due. Sometimes it would be revealed only after we had turned in assignments that the assignments wouldn't be graded at all. I was unable to best allocate the hours I had available to all of my various class-related and non-class-related responsibilities because I didn't know when I needed to put in more effort on GIS versus when I could have devoted more time to something else that needed my attention.",
    "The lectures.",
    "Assignments need more of a rubric. It was difficult to know what we were being graded on (aside from one or two points in the agenda) and therefore to know what to include in the homework submission. Did all of the maps need legends\/scales? Did some of them? Did we need to have 3-D maps? These are things that we were graded on, yet this was not made clear in the assignment. Also, if participation in brainteasers makes a difference in your end grade, even if the submissions do not get full points, this should be made clear at the beginning of the semester and not the end of the semester.",
    "Actually, this is an excellent class.",
    "Lectures could be faster paced. Also limiting the size of the course would be ideal.",
    "A more clear plan for the end of the semester. A clearly explained roadmap for where we have been and where we are going would be very helpful if presented toward the end of the semester before the group assignment begins.",

    "Group work went very smoothly in my circumstance. We worked well together, supplemented each others knowledge, and caught each others mistakes. The process went much faster than had it been done solo.",

    "There are many ways to approach work in GIS and working in a group allowed me to learn more about how others are thinking about this. I also informally would work in groups on homework assignments and although not always the most efficient use of time, I found value in learning and exploring the tool with others.",

This happens most of the time, but it can be frustrating when someone falls behind with their work or does not make meetings on time.",

    "Take the undergrad course if you, like me, are looking to have basic facility with GIS but not to have GIS be a central component of your future job.",
    "It takes a ton of time!!",
    "Do not wait until the last minute.Make use of the course website - you will get your questions answered there.",
    "I think if you consider taking this class, take it, but be ready to work hard!",
    "Put a lot of work in at the beginning to make sure you get the basic skill sets and tools before the course becomes increasingly difficult. It is extremely rewarding to track your improvement and your newly acquired skill in using GIS to solve problems and answer questions."
