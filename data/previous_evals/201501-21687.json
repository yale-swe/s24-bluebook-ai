    "Very good course, about the formation of a British national identity in the early modern period. Big ideas were made concrete through text and visuals, mostly primary sources. I enjoyed doing the little class presentation and shorter paper, the longer paper was alright too though there was a lot of information to draw from. I also enjoyed seeing everyone elses little class presentations . Really well developed and well taught. Professor Wrightson is lovely and provides ample individual guidance. I do want to mention that there is a lot of secondary reading for not much discussion on said secondary readings. Of course its great to focus on the primary material, with the secondary foundation, but usually wed discuss each secondary reading for about two minutes (which could go up to 90 pages). While preparing for class I would spend about 10x as long going through the secondary sources, and so it is disappointing that I spent so much time working through the details when the basic premises were enough. So Id suggest cutting down on the reading only to get the key points that will be relevant to the primary sources.",
    "This course is perfect for any potential history majors; it trains a historical mode of thinking, connecting and imagining history with a space for exploration. I wrote papers on homosexuality, gender, and performance at a course I never expected to be able to do so. It's imaginative, challenging, and maturing."
