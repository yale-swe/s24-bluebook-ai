    "surpassed them",
    "The class met my expectations.",
    "I liked that it was an overview, but also tied in specific examples that were relevant to FES.",
    "I appreciated that the skills taught were tied directly to environmental issues.",
    "I learned a lot more than I thought I would, and it was not as challenging as I thought it might be considering I had no previous knowledge.",

    "Yes, though the instructor moved too quickly for an intro course.",
    "They aligned very well.",
    "It aligned well.",
    "I was prepared to not to like this class but ended up enjoying it and learning more than I thought I would.",

    "It was almost exactly as I expected it to be.",
    "They aligned pretty well with my expectations, In fact I learned more than I was hoping to.",
    "I was totally impressed by the degree to which I found myself \"thinking like an economist\" during the course.",
    "A lot of the course content overlapped with the macroeconomics class that I had taken online over the summer, and I thought that there would be less overlap. But otherwise, the knowledge, skills, and insights I gained aligned with my expectations.",
    "The course and concepts covered aligned well with my expectations.",
    "I had no prior expectations.",
    "They aligned very well with my expectations. Having zero background in economics, I will say this course was very useful in exposing me to basic fundamental principles.",
    "This class met my expectations quite a lot. Since this class is only half-term, only basic economic concepts were covered. But I found them helpful in other classes of social science and perspective.",
    "Very well",
    "Very well",
    "The knowledge I gained in the class very much aligned with my expectations. I had never taken an economics course before and the material covered in the course was what I was hoping to learn before taking more advanced economics courses.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The problem sets were very useful and the teaching strategy effective.",
    "The short duration of the class made learning difficult.",
    "The instructor was great. No complaints.",
    "The strengths included an amazing professor and TF group. I wish the depth of the material was more synthesized considering it was a 6 week course.",
    "I think the TFs were really great and the homeworks helped me to practice. I think the homework answers were sometimes confused between the TFs and the Professor, which could be a problem to know what was the correct answer.",
    "Matt was a strong teacher whose pedagogy encouraged students to develop their own economic intuition. While difficult at times, this approach proved ultimately useful--I observed students in his class making cogent economic arguments in other courses within FES. Very thankful that this class, which I wouldn't have taken otherwise, was required and that Matt was the one teaching it.",
    "More in class examples.",
    "Strengths: I gained a fairly solid foundation in econ. Weaknesses: for a mandatory intro class where many students had no prior econ experience, this class was a bit too challenging. Problem sets went a little too far, speed of concept introductions was a bit too fast, etc. I understand this class is a graduate level, but again, given the mandatory nature and the fact that many students had no econ knowledge, this was a little too challenging.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and thought that it did a good job keeping concepts as simple as possible. At times, the teaching felt disorganized and there was a lack of clarity, and the TAs had to step in to fill in the gaps in students' understanding. But overall, I thought it was great.",
    "I think that Matt is a great lecturer but perhaps could have gone over more examples in our class that were applicable for the homework.",
    "Although there was a lot of information to fit into a quarter, it never felt overwhelming. It was structured well and the problem sets were challenging but helped me learn. My one critique would be that I did not feel I had enough time to finish the final.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course was trying to fit too much material into too short a period of time. I understand the course was approached as a primer for future coursework in economics applying concepts to environmental and natural resource problems. However, the course was much too ambitious in what it aimed to achieve given the course is 1.5 credits over six weeks. Homework assignments were much more difficult than the concepts explained in class, and I found I spent a great deal of time in office hours with TA's trying to understand how to approach and solve the problems. A strength of the class was introducing a wide range of students to microeconomics. Although the professor was not always effective at explaining concepts to students who had never taken economics previously, he did try to engage and ensure that most students at least understood the basics.",
    "I thought the strength was in the concreteness of the structure - it was very well organized and planned out. No major improvements needed.",
    "The course was very fast paced in my opinion, it could've been more detailed and a full semester course instead of a half semester one.",
    "Matt was my favorite professor of the semester for his teaching ability. He put so much effort to make his curriculum engaging, and truly felt invested in our progress. He also helped me immensely outside of class.",
    "I enjoyed the course but felt frustrated with how slowly it moved. But I suppose that's because Dr. Kotchen had to teach to a room with a wide range of backgrounds and familiarity with economics.",
    "Both the professor and the TA's did a great job covering the concepts in understandable ways and providing help with working through the material. Office hours were very helpful. One suggestion might be to bring in more specific real-world examples to discuss in class in a more intentional way, as opposed to just coming up with examples in class in the moment.",
    "This course moved far too fast for me to comprehend appropriately. The Professor was wonderful and insightful and would love to take future courses with him in a different context than a prereq. My objection is to the fashion in which the prereqs were implemented, in which it feels like I only really had half a semester of actual learning in the courses that I was fortunate enough to take, and the prereqs were a blur.",
    "The reference book for the class is a really good one to follow well the lectures. Also, weekly assignments are helpful to understand well the concepts. But this class should be full term course rather than half-term course.",
    "I though the course was very good althouh I would have loved to have a more mathematical approach that would help me in more advanced courses.",
    "In class lectures and problems were very clear and engaging.",
    "A strength of the course was the weekly assignments, which were a lot of work but seemed to cement the concepts we were learning in lecture by applying them to problems. The lectures were organized and often straight-forward, which made them easy to follow. I appreciated when environmental applications of economic concepts were given.",
    "Good professor, great TAs."

   "comments": [
    "Take it!",
    "Prepare for a rigorous academic environment that will require a lot of time outside of class if you are not familiar with economic concepts. Additionally, weekly problem sets were time consuming and challenging.",
    "If you haven't taken an econ class or it's been a while, it's a nice way to cover some ground.",
    "It's a good refresher if you already have a background in economics. It can be a bit intimidating if it's your first time learning these concepts.",
    "It is fast paced and the homework sets can take some time, but it provides a good foundation for the material.",
    "Come prepared to work and, since this an economics class for students without an economics background, to have assumptions from other disciplines brought into question. The struggle is worthwhile--this class is already paying dividends in my other studies and will continue to over the longterm.",
    "Very suitable as an introductory course to economics.",
    "It takes a lot of time outside of class to do the problem sets.",
    "work in groups and go to the TA's office hours. and read the textbook!",
    "This is a very accessible introduction to microeconomics. I have no economics background and found it somewhat challenging but not at all unreasonably hard.",
    "I would advise building in enough time early on to do the homework problems and to take advantage of office hours as much and as early as possible if you are struggling with the material. It is helpful to read the accompanying textbook, but for students without any previous knowledge in economics, you will likely still be confused in class and need to attend office hours to fully grasp the material.",
    "That for a basic economic background, go for it.",
    "For a half-semester and 1.5 credits, this course demands a lot of time!",
    "Read the chapters ahead of class and try to understand the concepts on your own! Also, the problem sets are important, but don't learn to do well on them.",
    "See if you can take microeconomics either in full with the Professor and devote the necessary time to it, or take it prior to coming to the school.",
    "take good notes during lecture",
    "this class would be a good refresher for your economic knowledge.",
    "If you are not familiar with economics it might require of you a little more time but it's a very useful class",
    "I would say that the class was very useful as someone who has never taken an economics course and is interested in taking more advanced economics courses in the future. The assignments were a bit of work but were useful in learning to apply the economic concepts we learned in class. The textbook was really basic and did not cover anything advanced, and Professor Kotchen seemed to model the lectures off of the chapters in the textbook he assigned each class.",
    "take it if you've never taken an economics course before."
