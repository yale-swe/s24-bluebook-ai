    "This was my first American politics class ever, and I loved it. The material was all really interesting (no \"how a bill becomes a law\" nonsense), and I learned a lot. Professor DeCanio was hilarious and made lectures enjoyable. The workload is manageable if you keep up with your reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. One can learn an abundant amount of information, and formulate political opinions they would have never done before.",
    "This is a great class for a basic touch into different sides of government. This is not AP Government, but looks at various issues of congress, the president, and the bureaucracy. Prof DeCanio is great, and has an amazing sense of humor. The reading isn't too heavy, but you need to do it because there are random quizzes that are a large portion of your grade. No exams, just a final paper, which is awesome. I highly recommend this if you like political science, and even if you are on the fence.",
    "Take it. 10-ish quizzes and a paper. No final. The quizzes are easy. Beware, however, sometimes you may have to read 200 pages in a weekend. However, if you do the reading, you are guaranteed an A on the quiz.",
    "No computers or online notes. One final paper. Mandatory section. No mid term or final. Gem. 10 in class quizzes.",
    "My favorite course at Yale so far. Take it!",
    "Great class. Make sure and stay on top of the reading because of the quizzes, but other than that it's great. The paper at the end is fine, DeCanio is fantastic, and the stuff you're learning about is fascinating.",
    "Intro to American Politics is a pretty good class. It definitely isn't what you would expect from an \"Intro to American Politics\" course; it focuses heavily on the problems with government such as voter ignorance. Professor DeCanio is an interesting guy. It'll take you a bit to figure him out. Many people have said that this class is a gut because there is no midterm or final, but the quizzes keep you accountable for the readings, so in that regard, it is certainly not a gut. I'd recommend this class, but make sure that you're interested in the actual content of the class and that you're not expecting a typical American Politics class.",
    "This was not a high school gov class. There was no boring textbook detailing facts. We read great scholarly texts and some of the best books about politics and government as we focused on specific areas of government such as Congress, Bureaucracies and the Presidency. There was a fair share of political philosophy among the case studies we studies. We also looked a bit at Latin American governments.",
    "You have to show up to every class, if that is a problem, dont take it. I took it CR\/D and was perfectly happy with that. There are true pop quizzes which is why you have to show up. The readings are light for about half the semester and then you end up reading a lot at the end - again thankful for credit D here. An incredibly boring course, but if you are looking for a CR\/D and dont mind showing up to class I recommend it.",
    "This is not really a survey course as much as a class about what is wrong with our (American) government. Professor DeCanio is really funny and interesting to listen to, but also very cynical and with a somewhat depressing outlook on politics. Still this course covers very important issues that everyone should be aware of, such as voter ignorance, who influences who in government, and why politics is the way it is right now. Would recommend for anyone who cares about government and as a foundation course for any students interested in the Politics and American Communities American Studies concentration!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my peers. The readings are interesting, the lecture is engaging, and the section is fun!",
    "Scandalous.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any polysci major, or anyone wanting to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of American government. The class was not too difficult or work-heavy, and DeCanio is a really interesting and hilarious professor. His pop quizzes (though they added a little bit of extra stress at times) were really very helpful in the end. They forced me to stay on top of the readings and to read them in full, which in turn made me learn a lot more than I had in other classes and realize how much I enjoyed the material in general. The final paper also was a really great tool in that it helped me explore a specific topic (lobbying and government responsiveness) in depth and develop my research skills. As a freshman, this class was very useful to me in growing as a student and ultimately picking a major.",
    "YES! Take it!",
    "Absolutely amazing class! Definitely an intro level course -- small lecture with students from every grade and major (a lot of international students too). The material was not inherently difficult, but DeCanio will really challenge you. He'll make you question everything you think you know about American government and politics. He is super cynical, very entertaining and is a great lecturer. I looked forward to coming to class everyday. He gives out short quizzes almost every lecture to make sure you have done the readings (don't worry -- they're very easy). This makes up 50% of your grade. The other half of your grade is a 10 page research paper on a topic of your choice in American government. I felt as though this class was very fair and very enjoyable. I learned so much in this class -- and you will too. A must take! DO IT!",
    "This class is basically a criticism of the effectiveness of American democracy in reflecting the will of the people. Students need to show up to the lectures and at least skim the readings because there are a lot of pop quizzes. Most of the grade is based on the final paper, which has little to do with the rest of the course. The professor is funny but frustrating, as it feels like he is pushing his opinions on the class."
