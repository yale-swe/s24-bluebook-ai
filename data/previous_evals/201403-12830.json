    "FREN 110 is quite an intense course but it is very rewarding. It is amazing how much french you can learn in one semester!",
    "FREN 110 is a wonderful course if you want to learn the French language. The French in Action (basically you watch a video series that gradually incorporates new material) is totally immersive and really forces you to learn the language. It's also quite a bit of work - expect to spend over an hour each day on the workbook. The weekly tests and the fact that the class meets daily can get a bit annoying, but it is totally necessary. Professor Ngame is wonderful, and he is very effective at teaching new terms. He also makes sure you know the material before the weekly tests. I'd definitely recommend taking the class with him!",
    "French 110 is a tricky, but incredibly rewarding class. You will have to work hard (because it is an introductory class), but the work pays off. Take this class with Ngame if you can. He is a fantastic teacher who makes coming to a 10:30 class every morning completely worth it. Yale's French program is also fantastic and a very good way to learn the language. Great class and great professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Professor Ngame really wants his students to succeed, and makes class extremely enjoyable. Go to office hours if you can, even if you aren't struggling in the class! Be ready to put in the work, though. Properly doing the workbook exercises and studying for the weekly tests is no doubt time consuming. With the French in Action method, most of the learning is up to the student, as far as the grammar goes, and class is for reinforcement of these rules and practice. There is an intensive option for beginning french, but this course moves plenty fast. However, all this work is definitely worthy it. Considering majority of us had never taken a French class before, I was amazed by how much my classmates and I had learned by the end. In one semester, most of us went from barely being able to greet someone properly to having full conversations in french.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone, it is a considerable amount of work and you will have to make sure you get the help you need if you begin to struggle but I strongly recommend it!",
    "A course that will help you master the language if you put in the work. At the very least will give you working french. Very unforgiving if you fall behind because there are weekly tests - you meet daily with a small class. Ngame is a great instructor. The curriculum is pretty rigid, if you don't dig the syllabus, don't take. However, the method is very effective for picking up french quickly by placing students in a \"survival\" situation. Most students stumble in the beginning but it will get better. Like Spanish, not a gut."
