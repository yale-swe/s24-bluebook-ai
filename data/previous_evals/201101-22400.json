   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're sincerely interested in the topic, otherwise it will just seem like tons of memorization about places, people, fossils, that you just don't care about. If you're unsure I would take the intro to biological anthropology first. Lectures were fairly interesting, though.",
    "Good class if you can manage the coursework without any structure from the professor. Maybe not because hard exams and no curve.",
    "Fun class. Not too difficult, and not too taxing. I would recommend it if you have a vague interest in the material going in, but otherwise it might be hard to really appreciate it. There's not as much \"science\" in the class as a science major wouldlike (not to say there isn't a fair amount of biology and evolution covered), but a science major is more likely to take this class for the social science credit, anyway.",
    "I would recommend Human Evolution. It is a really fun course where you learn about anthropology and human evolution as if you were digging up the remains of ancient hominins yourself. Be prepared to do a lot of memorizing for the tests and study on your own time. There are no assignments, so make sure you keep up with the class. The lectures are really interesting and not difficult to understand, but it might be helpful to have a background in biology.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who really knew that they were interested in the physical evolution of primates into humans. Anyone who is more interested in the cultural, social, and mental evolution of humans will not find this course terribly interesting.",
    "The subject matter was interesting (although not quite to the extent that comments from previous years would lead you to expect). Know that this is a course where a lot of memorization is involved and what Prof. Hill presents as semi-anecdotal is also test-able material. Many people did poorly on the midterm exam because we didn't know what to expect and the level of detail you needed to know was very very precise. The final exam was a lot more manageable. (Midterm, Final, 5 page paper, lab practical).",
    "Human Evolution is a lot of memorization. When the first test comes around it is difficult to know what to expect because there are no practice tests and Professor Hill just tells you to know everything. For this reason, the average on the first exam was much lower than the average on the second. However, if you pay close attention and take notes on his lectures you will be fine.",
    "boring class.",
    "Absolutely recommended. The course covers important, relevant material for people in all fields of study - from biology to philosophy - and will shape the way you think about what it means to be human.",
    "This class is basically a very interesting lecture twice a week with no work aside from studying for the two tests and completing the (five page!) final paper. That said, the tests were REALLY difficult. It was easy to be lulled into the sense that this class was a joke but you really need to know the material in order to do well on the tests. There is also a lab practical which you need to study for because you will need to be able to identify a species of hominin by looking at its skull. Overall, this class was a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend it.",
    "Do not take this course if you like a structured class with suggested readings and a clear path of learning. The lectures tended to meander, looped back on themselves, and lacked clarity. The slides were mainly just pictures or blocks of text, which are clicked through too quickly.The class is interesting, and I learned about evolution as I didn't know it before, but I think that reading a couple books or articles on your own time would be more beneficial for the time taken.",
    "You should take this class if you are curious about the patchy knowledge we have of our own past! Hill presents the latest findings from the perspective of a veteran researcher, an the material is quite manageable.",
    "I would only recommend the course to people very interested in human evolution and to people who have had some evolution\/anthropology background. I went into the class with limited experience and struggled right off the bat.",
    "Human Evolution is an interesting class that covers both the history of the study of human evolution and the physical evidence (fossils, artifacts, etc.). It's a really interesting class and Professor Hill is a great professor with a bunch of stories. The class is very fact based, and theres a decent amount of memorization for the test, but Professor Hill encourages students to think critically about ways of interpreting the data and how those interpretations have changed over time. The section is really cool and involves looking at casts of fossil hominin skeletons! It's not super easy, but doesn't involve weekly assignments or much work other than the tests and a short paper. Overall, a great class."
