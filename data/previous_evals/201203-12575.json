    "Excellent survey of Francophone African literature and film. Recommended for anyone with an interest in postcolonial art. The reading is quite light, and the films are excellent.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course! The readings and films are extremely fascinating and it's a way to learn about Africa without the usual gloom and doom.",
    "I took this class Credit\/D because I was afraid of the french reading requirement -- it was a great class to take for credit because it was outside my field of study and yet still relevant and illuminating for daily life. Take this class if you have any interest in language or translation, or any interest at all in the colonial and post-colonial experience."
