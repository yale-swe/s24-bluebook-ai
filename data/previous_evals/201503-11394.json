    "Take it if you have an interest in inorganic chemistry and knowing more about organometallics. This course however may not be as appealing as the other chemistry courses available. Professor Crabtree is great in his field but probably not the best in delivering things in an interesting way. Lessons can be quite dry.",
    "This class is hard to do well in. Without problem sets, sections, or a TA, it's pretty self taught and the material is pretty challenging anyway. The material is interesting but it's easy to put off really learning the material without problem sets to keep you in check and you won't realize it until the midterms.",
    "Mostly grad students (I think this semester it was about 40 grad and 5 undergrad). Taught in pretty much in the same way as Chem 252, but without psets or section (TAs). Can be hard to stay on top of the material, but overall an interesting class.",
    "Class has 2 midterms and a final. Other than that there is zero work. If you are self motivated then this is a great class to take"
