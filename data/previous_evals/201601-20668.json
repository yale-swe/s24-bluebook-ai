    "I would recommend the second term of DS Literature to another student, because of the many connections people can draw from the previous term makes the current term much more enriching.",
    "It's a ton of reading. Trying to finish War and Peace in Spring Break was a real struggle, but I have also learned a lot from it.",
    "Professor Levin's DS Literature section is fantastic! The class is discussion intensive and we primarily focus on detailed reading of important passages of each text. Professor Levin takes great care to help students with writing and anything else they might need through her office hours. Also, she offers valuable contextual information on each work we read, making sure we can get the most out of our short time with each work of literature.",
    "A great introduction to the important literary works of the western cannon with the chance for great discussion with access to excellent faculty in a small group. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "An introduction to the most important works of modern Western literature. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I whole-heartedly recommend D.S. Literature with Professor Levin. She brings an excitement to the course and offers intriguing insights on each of the works. Her seminar meetings are definitely participation centered, which means you will want to do the (admittedly extensive) reading. In particular, Professor Levin often focuses on specific passages and encourages close analysis of lines and scenes. Outside the classroom, Professor Levin always takes the time to meet with students during office hours and to discuss individual papers. Be sure to take her up on these opportunities.",
    "This semester of DS Lit will be much more intense than the first. The reading will be more involved, both length-wise (if you don't read Don Quixote and War and Peace over winter\/spring break, you're going to hate yourself) and content-wise (there are actually authors--I'm looking at you, Proust--about whom it *is* physically impossible to write a coherent paper the night before the deadline). You'll also be asked to do fewer straight-up close readings and instead incorporate that technique into the answer of a much more specific question--something that is challenging, but incredibly beneficial to your writing. Above all, do not assume that because you did well in the fall, this semester will be a piece of cake; if you do, you're setting yourself up for a seriously rude awakening."
