   "comments": [
    "Light workload, great breadth, but far too much time focused on the minutaie of algebraic derivations. Nothing really clicked conceptually, and the lectures weren't really goal-oriented. Spend an hour and a half not knowing what's going on. The psets are also a hodgepodge of calculation based questions that you really need Wikipedia (or the prof) to solve. But SKL is AMAZING. Also get exposed to a lot of cool ideas.",
    "If you have taken any physics or earth science, this class will be mind-numbingly boring. The problem sets are deceivingly hard because the questions are poorly phrased, so it really just comes down to learning how Lamoreaux phrases things. I honestly feel like I didn't get anything from this class, and I'm a little disappointed. I took it because I needed another physics credit over the 300 level and this was the only one of any interest to me--it is truly a gut class and I can't decide whether I really liked that or really hated it. This class is very straightforward, which is good, but it felt like a waste of my time.",
    "a hidden gem in the mine of science guts. take advantage while you can.",
    "Steve is wonderful, as is the class! Be sure to ask him about the time he was bombarded with ionizing radiation whilst working as a postdoc. Take it if you are looking for a less time consuming introduction to environmental processes or as a lighter addition to an otherwise heavy schedule.",
    "Yes - take it. Great intro to environmental physics, very manageable workload and the professor is super approachable and wants you to do well.",
    "This is an interesting physics class with a focus on the qualitative discussion of environmental issues. A good choice for physics electives.",
    "A great physics class for non-stem majors, where you learn knowledge and skills applicable to all disciplines.",
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Steve Lamoreaux's 342. You know why you're here. If you don't, let me tell you. You're here because you want an easy 5th or 6th credit. You're here because you need a physics credit. You're here because you need a QR. You're here because you want to take a class with Steve and listen to the stupid jokes he sometimes tells. 2 midterms (questions given beforehand), 4 psets, and a final PAPER. Yeah, you read that right. You write a final paper for this class. A+ for those who know this is what they want. If it's not...run away.",
    "If you like math and physics and are looking for a fun and interesting course, this would be a good choice.",
    "Great course if you want a relatively stressfree science credit. It's a little haphazardly structured, but Prof. Lamoreaux is enthusiastic and funny and the workload is light.",
    "This class is perhaps one of the BEST science classes that Yale has to offer. Professor Lamoreaux is an eccentric, humorous teacher that intersperses each lesson with earth science demonstrations, including a visit to the now-defunct Van de Graaf Particle Accelerator. Workload is very light (4 psets, each taking no more than 4-5 hours), and tests are straightforward. Lamoreaux covers controversial material (i.e. global warming), which makes the subject particularly interesting. If you are in need of a Science credit, enjoy learning about the Earth, or go to Yale, you should definitely take this course.",
    "As a poli sci major, I felt pretty comfortable taking this course although the material is stuff I normally would have never studied. That's due in large part to the fact that Professor Lamoreaux is really kind and patient and he understands that a lot of the subject matter are things that social science\/humanities\/other majors are not normally exposed to. Sometimes the equation derivation stuff gets dull, but go to Professor Lamoreaux for help on the psets if you're confused, he always makes time to explain things to students. The tests are really not difficult, just study what he tells you to study. I recommend taking this course if you're not a science person and you need the credit\/ want to learn about really important scientific things that you wouldn't learn about otherwise.",
    "I would absolutely do it. To the non-physics major, this class was 80% non-physics majors. To the physics major, this class counts for your major and its fun and easy! Take it. It's a win win."
