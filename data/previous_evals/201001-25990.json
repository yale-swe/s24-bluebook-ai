    "Not on its own, but i would recommend DS in general, and you've got to take the good with the bad in DS.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, if you like political philosophy.",
    "An important course with important ideas about how society functions. You should take it if this kind of material is interesting to you, and pay lots of special attention to Arendt at the end.",
    "If you're reading this, you're in ds, so there's no need to explain why that was a brilliant choice on your part. Furthermore, you either have been assigned Master Smith as your professor, in which case, do not switch, or you are considering switching to his class, in which case you're in a comparative situation, and it seems like a bad idea to rank the history teachers of directed studies here.",
    "I would recommend (and have already recommended to every single prefrosh I met) the Directed Studies Experience! Directed Studies was incredibly rewarding and I cannot say enough good things about it. The intellectual community that was developed over the course of the full year, the opportunities to get to know professors, the in-class discussions, colloquiums, and Art Gallery Talks...all made Directed Studies an in-depth and rich experience! The reading assignments are lengthy and there are many papers, however, the works we read and the students' excitement and curiosity about the reading makes the experience challenging and rewarding."
