    "A requirement for the major, very based on case studies of specific languages. If you are not a linguistics major, I don't recommend it.",
    "If you're a linguistics major, you have to take it. Just make sure you take it with an experienced professor who has good reviews.",
    "LING 232 is an introductory phonology class. This semester it was taught by Daniel Kaufman, who traveled in from NYC once a week to teach it for two hours. I didn't love the class, because it was often geared towards the more advanced students in the class, after speeding through the basics of any given topic. I took it because I had to as a linguistics major, but it is the topic I find least interesting in the field. If you're a major, you have to take it. If you're not, I would recommend making sure it's being taught by a good professor before taking it.",
    "So, I know a lot of people were very frustrated by the class this year, but hopefully next time it runs it will meet twice a week like it should. The topics are interesting, and definitely fundamental if you want to do further linguistics study. If you're hoping to take classes later that have Phonology I as a prereq, make sure you don't put this class off too long."
