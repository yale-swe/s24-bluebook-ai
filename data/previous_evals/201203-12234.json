    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I am not an Econ major and I thought it was a perfect fit because the topics aren't super economics-technical. I think the subjects are topics everyone should have some knowledge on. There isn't too much work and the final paper is actually kind of fun. Guest lecturers are really cool and super well-known.",
    "its a good overview for pre-med students. not too much econ, but you'll also have to put in work to actually know what's going on. in general it's a good background to have for medicine",
    "Really liked the class, learned a lot. Definitely only take it though if you have an interest in the subject material, or think you would like to. It can get VERY specific at times, so if you're just looking for broad themes this isn't for you. The exams will ask you to be pretty specific. The workload is very light, all of the readings are optional, 2 reading responses, midterm, 6-8 page final paper, and a final. Go for it.",
    "It was great! It offered a really comprehensive introduction to the state of the American healthcare system and I feel like I have a good grasp of what the situation is!",
    "Econ 170 is a class you must take if you have any interest in understanding how the US healthcare system works. You leave with a decent understanding of Medicare, Medicaid, doctor payments, etc. and a very good understand of the Affordable Care Act. If you're not sincerely interested in the topic, though, not a good class.",
    "Especially if you are thinking about going into medicine, you should take this course. Healthcare is becoming more and more a crucial part of the US economy and it is important to understand the implications of contemporary legislation about healthcare. If you are going into medicine, i think it is crucial that you know now exactly what you are going into - how the system works, reimbursement schemes, and what is likely to change the profession in the coming years.",
    "Yes, I would especially recommend the class to anyone interested in healthcare-related fields. There isn't much work throughout the semester but it all piles up at the end with the paper and final, so I'd advise getting started on the paper early. Curve is a little tight.",
    "This was a fantastic course. I learned a lot and I feel like I came away with a lasting understanding of healthcare. I do think that bringing more readings into the class (in lectures, or just by making them mandatory in some way) could enrich discussions a bit, but since we covered so much material already that might be difficult. Most of the guest lecturers were good although I usually learned more in our regular class meetings.The tests were hard but fair and very well-structured--I even felt that while taking them, I was really reinforcing what I had learned. The tests gave us the chance to show a lot of what we knew.",
    "Anyone who wants to be an informed citizen should take this course. I'm not a premed or an economics major, and I found this course to be absolutely fascinating. As healthcare becomes an increasingly important aspect of our economy, we as citizens will need a solid understanding of the healthcare system, and that is exactly what this course delivers.",
    "Yes take this class if you have any interest in healthcare, public policy, or just want to be more knowledgable about the most important debate going on in our country.",
    "Optional readings, one midterm, short final essay and final. Workload is light and material interesting despite dry\/info-packed lectures. A course with important material for life in general and for understanding practical applications of economics and policy. It is little work and a lot of memorizing for the Medicare portion of the curriculum but it is cool to understand how these parts of the health care system work since so much current and future reform policy is rooted in the constructs of the domestic systems. Take notes of what is said in lecture rather than on the text-dense slides which can be otherwise difficult to interpret later when reviewing for tests.",
    "Health Econ is a lovely class coming from a man who has been on the inside of the system. Professor Forman has worked as a radiologist for many years, and really knows the ins and outs of the healthcare system. An excellent look into the defining political struggle of our age.",
    "soo much information.",
    "Fantastic, fantastic class. Easily my favorite class this year and at Yale thus far. Everything is extremely applicable, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every lecture and all the material covered. A course packet or textbook would have been helpful though. Not a gut- I know many people who wanted to take this as their 5th class. Definitely take it, but be prepared to learn a lot. Workload is fairly light\/non-existent throughout the semester since the readings are optional and not tested, but come test time, there will be a lot of powerpoint slides to memorize.",
    "You won't be able to really digest the information during lecture, so make sure you take good notes. Most of the digesting and understanding happens outside of lecture and before midterm\/final when you are forced to memorize the information. When studying for tests, don't forget to look at little details because you will be quizzed on them. I think econ majors had a hard time understanding medical concepts - Professor Forman will use big medical words during lecture, but don't be too overwhelmed, as you won't be tested on them. Definitely not the gut I thought this would be, but you have no workload (except for occasional reading responses) when you have no tests. However, the time you spend on health econ will spike before tests.",
    "EXCELLENT COURSE! Gives you a fantastic background on topics that every American should be familiar with. Not super intense on the econ side of things, but nonetheless a great overview on important topics in health policy.",
    "I think this information is so important for everyone to know. Take it! It involves a good deal of studying for the midterm and the final, but everything else is manageable. You learn so much, and Dr. Forman really knows what he is talking about. Shop it to see if you like his lecture style - quiet but interactive.",
    "I would recommend this course wholeheartedly.",
    "Health Econ was a very practical class. It wasn't necessarily a class where you're extremely interested in the information, but by the end you really understand how much you've learned. What's great is that this information is all extremely useful and relevant - it's stuff that is essential knowledge in real life, not just in the classroom (which is a nice change from how classes normally are!). Dr. Forman is truly an expert, and you can learn a lot from him. While a lot of people often felt confused in class (the information could be better organized), with the review sessions it would end up being clarified. The 2 reading responses and short insurance assignments aren't too much work, and the final paper can be on any topic and is actually interesting to learn about. While the midterm was pretty tough (tested very specific details), they acknowledged this and not only generously curved it but also made the final more fair. Overall, the TA's and Dr. Forman really want you to learn and do well in the class, and I can say this is one of the most useful classes I've taken at Yale. Even though as a pre-med I sometimes I felt out of my element with all the econ-specific topics, I was able to keep up.",
    "Health Econ is a great, great class to take. The lectures are incredibly interesting and relevant. If you are very nervous about grades it could be a good class to take credit\/d-- 60% of the grade was undecided going into the final, so at this point I have actually no idea how I did.",
    "FANTASTIC class for anyone interested in health finance, health economics, health policy. Requires lots of studying, but is well worth it.",
    "Good class with little work other than midterm, term paper and final. This class is barely an economics class, but rather a course on the details of the health care system with a large emphasis on public coverage. The material is interesting, but be prepared to memorize every detail about Medicare, Medicaid etc. because it is tested in excruciating and random detail.",
    "Econ 170 gives a broad overview of everything health economics including insurance, physician reimbursement and healthcare reform. We had some great guest speakers as well. This course is a must not only for those considering medicine, but for everyone else as well as a consumer of healthcare. There is a micro prereq but you really don't need any prior econ. 2 reading responses, a midterm, final, and 6-8 pg final paper.",
    "if you are interested in the largest area of the US economy, which you should be, then take this course. It can be \"dry\" in the sense that you are going over all the nuts and bolts of a complicated industry, but I feel that it's worth it. This is not an econ theory-heavy course, which is good, especially if you are sick of the core econ courses. If you do want to look at supply and demand curves, there is a more econ heavy option. This course, though, explains the industry in a way that few others can. Accessible for non-econ majors and required material for all US citizens, in short.",
    "ECON 170 was a great course. Guest Lectures from experts in different areas of the course material punctuated Prof. Forman's excellent lectures. Assignments were always well-structured and fair, although sometimes there were significantvariations in grading by the two TFs. The course focuses on Healthcare Economics and not just plain Economics, so I would even recommend it for someone interested in the American Healthcare system as much as I would for an Econ major.",
    "Good class. You will learn a lot, whether you feel like it or not. You might get really bored in the lectures, so just be prepared for that. The review sessions by the TAs were helpful. The grading on the reading responses was suspect, as it was not evident what was expected of you. The exams were fair, but required more memorization of the slides, figures, and facts than anticipated. Also, one question on each exam was heavily focused on just one of the guest lectures, so attend those and know the minutia.Take it if you are interested. Credit\/D might be best.Howie is a great resource so tap into that, no homo.Shoutout to my boy KOBE!",
    "A class based on fact memorization. A good overview of the workings of the healthcare industry, and I'm glad I took it. Not much opportunity to discuss ideas, as the class has no section, but Forman and the TA's were very knowledgeable and accessible enough. I was annoyed by the emphasis on memorizing and regurgitating facts and small healthcare intricacies on the exam, and that there was no discussion in the regular fabric of the class, but I'm glad that I was educated about the basic economic principles and drivers of this incredibly important sector of the world economy. A GREAT class to Cred\/D.",
    "I was already interested in this subject, and I found the class to be very valuable. We learned a lot of useful information about the basics and upcoming changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and other healthcare entities. If you're going into medicine, this is good stuff to know. Some other perks: great guest speakers, no section, almost no mandatory reading.",
    "Health Econ is a really interesting introductory course that covers many aspects of healthcare. As a premed without any college-level econ, I learned a lot about the U.S. healthcare industry ... this course was full of new information for me, but it may be less interesting to someone with a solid econ background and\/or prior knowledge about health econ.If you're a pre-med looking to understand the industry before you enter it, I highly highly recommend this course. I have become much more knowledgeable on the topic and now feel comfortable discussing Medicare, health insurance, Obamacare, etc. with friends or at the dinner table.The tests were challenging, so take it credit\/d if you're concerned about grading.",
    "Indifferent. The material is extremely interesting. The way the material is presented is confusing and the pace in which Forman lectures is fast. The TA's are not that helpful. And your grade is mainly on one paper, which isn't bad, an impossible midterm and a challenging final. The class doesn't require you to actually think about the material, but just to memorize, which I think is its greatest weakness.",
    "Absolutely take this course--whether you're an econ major or not. Great for everyone.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow economics major.",
    "Don't take it- not easy, and pretty boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It is a must take class for pre-meds, even if you have little to no econ background. I found this course to be one of the most rewarding and enjoyable classes at Yale.",
    "It's a good, informative course. The lectures could be more lively, but it's a great class if you want to learn something about health care policy.",
    "This class is a very good introduction to the U.S. healthcare system.",
    "I regret that I didn't take this course earlier in my Yale career. I would have probably focused my senior year research on health econ.This course will both teach you a lot about an important part of our economy and show you many open questions left in the field. Most econ classes are not this practical and energizing. Take it early on!",
    "fun, interesting, hard tests, probably not.",
    "Take this class! You'll learn a lot in each lecture. It's very well taught, helpful for pre-meds (especially for interviews). The two tests are challenging so I would study hard and really learn details and concepts. If you're unsure about taking this class, try it Cr\/D\/F. It's well worth your time and effort!"
