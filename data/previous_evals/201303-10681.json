    "This is one of the most amazing courses on offer at Yale. Take it if you can get a seat.",
    "I would certainly recommend Moral Choices in Politics. If you are broadly interested in political philosophy and interested in reading works of both philosophers and prominent historical figures, you should absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes, definitely! It is a well-structured, interesting discussion about morality within the realm of politics. Definitely take it if you are interested at all in this issue. Probably one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it but don't think of it as a seminar so much as a lecture where you can ask questions.",
    "Certainly, it is one of the courses that will most link the ideas of great authors to thinking on isssues realted to politics and moral issues on three main points of analysis and you will almost certainly also ahve colleagues that are very intelligent and prepare for evry class.",
    "Professor Kapustin is among the teaching \"greats\" that I've had the pleasure of having as an instructor over the course of my Yale career. Simply put, he is a rock star. Superbly articulate, competent and knowledgable about the authors and their writings. Encouraging and eager to meet with students. Warm and very funny, while still demanding clear and thorough thinking. Inspiring lectures. I would recommend him as a professor to any other Yale student in a heartbeat.",
    "Yes. Kapustin presents an incredible amount of material and assigns a highly reasonable amount of reading and writing. I was constantly impressed by how well he knows the authors and how clearly he presents his ideas.",
    "A class that's absolutely worth taking, if you can get in. Kapustin is a really good seminar leader and the reading and material are very interesting",
    "Fantastic class. Every class with Professor Kapustin is a tour de force. Take this if you can get in.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Kapustin is a fantastic professor. The course is a fascinating exploration of the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of various political actors, as well as some theoretical examination of the types of dilemmas they faced. It's a unique class where the focus is on the morality of the acts which make up politics and not on the larger political philosophical theories.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get into a class with Kapustin, take it! This class was everything that you ought to learn as a social science major at Yale: the perfect mix of philosophizing vs real life application of theories.",
    "Great seminar, definitely take it! Although the course was very theoretical, Professor Kapustin is an excellent teacher. He manages the seminar really well and is always very prepared. I left every day feeling like I had learned a lot because Professor Kapustin always directed discussion around a central theme to pull out the most important aspects of each reading. Do the readings and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "One of the best reading lists at Yale, with one of the department's best professors. Enough said."
