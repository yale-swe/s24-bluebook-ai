   "comments": [
    "Be careful about this class, as it moves very quickly, but if you decide to take it, take it with Miki. She is extremely clear, dedicated to teaching, and accessible.",
    "Definitely take this class with Miki (Yuwen is also clear, but Miki by far the best). She is always really clear, and though the material is difficult especially around the last third, she gets you through. A lot of students have already taken multivariable and so the curve may be difficult.",
    "Math 120 is a good class if you need to learn multivariable but it is not particularly exciting. It teaches multivariable very well which is required for a ton of majors but if you are just looking for an interesting math class I would look elsewhere.",
    "Math 120 is a multivariable calculus seminar. The material moves very quickly, but it is all manageable, especially if you have a good instructor. There are two midterms and a final, none of which are too difficult. I would recommend this course if you are able to get a good section instructor. Miki is probably one of the best math teachers at Yale. She is clear and helpful, has a ton of office hours, and is committed to making sure you understand the math.",
    "It's definitely a tough class and studying hard for the midterms and final is essential. Take it with Miki, if you can! She is quirky and fun as well as very organized and skilled at explaining difficult concepts.",
    "Miki is great! She makes every class enjoyable, even when you're learning a new theorem at the end of a 75 minute class. Her teaching style is very clear and well-organized (and she definitely has a good sense of humor), so if you pay attention for the ride you'll be well-prepared when exams come around.",
    "I found this course to be challenging, but also very doable, especially with the multitude of outside help that is offered. Professor Marketa Havlickova is really wonderful--an excellent teacher and extremely open to sitting down and talking outside of class.",
    "Calculus with more variables. Concepts Builds on previous courses. Gotta take this course.",
    "Math 120 is a really hard class that is very difficult to do well in. It doesn't bring much joy to math, and even though I went in wanting to be a math major and loving math, I'm leaving the class someone who will never take another math class again. The problem sets were hard and the exams were even harder and I did not enjoy one second of anything that has to do with this class. It is a great joy that I am finally done with it. I wish someone had told me not to take this class. That being said, if math is the only thing you love and you're incredibly talented at math and you love a good challenge, take the class.",
    "I would only recommend this class if they want to be a math major or need it to complete another major. It was not a fun class for me, and if the person in question did not absolutely love mathematics than I would not recommend it.",
    "Math 120 is a difficult course. I came out of high school having taken BC Calculus, and this was far more difficult. However, I came out of this course feeling very rewarded. It is satisfying to work through the problems, and be able to get to an answer. And Miki is phenomenal! The peer tutors are also a wonderful resource. All in all--a very time-intensive class, but time well spent!",
    "Yes - I am not sure how the other sections were, but I enjoyed mine.",
    "If you have to take Math 120, take it with Miki! She is really good at explaining everything, even though the material itself is pretty confusing and hard. It's not a super exciting class unless you're really into theoretical math, but there are some cool things that are kind of exciting.",
    "Take it! And take it with Miki! Difficult concepts, long and tedious problem sets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but taught in an engaging and lucid manner by Miki. She is absolutely brilliant, and she made the subject matter genuinely fascinating. A good teacher is crucial in a class such as this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Miki is perfect \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she draws smileys on the board, and puts stickers on graded exams! What could be better.",
    "This is a standard Multivariable calculus course, so if you like math, you will enjoy it, and you will struggle if you don't. Miki is great teacher to take it with, though. She is a great professor and cares that you understand the material. She is also really funny. Take it with Miki if you can, but know that her section fills up really quickly.",
    "I would summarize Math 120 as a difficult and rigorous mathematics course that should be taken by those who truly love math or need to take it for their major. It is not the easiest way to satisfy the QR requirement and should be given some thought before enrollment.",
    "I've taken multivariable before, but I still found this class somewhat difficult. Nonetheless, it's a fantastic class that I would definitely recommend.",
    "Math 120 with Miki was awesome! She's a super popular math 120 professor, and you should definitely try and get into her section if you can. She usually has office hours every day except Friday which is super helpful, and is always willing to meet with students one-on-one if you can't make her office hours. The course itself is pretty challenging, but manageable if you work hard and don't leave your work for the last minute. Definitely seek help as soon as you run into something you don't understand; waiting to get help until later will be a recipe for disaster. Overall, it was a great course taught by a great professor!",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed MATH 120. Maybe that's because I'm a physics major and I got Miki as my professor (and she's amazing, funny and really clear in her explanations). Some of my friends in other sections complained that they were learning nothing from their professors and that the section was useless. On the other hand, I felt like I couldn't miss one of my sections, because Miki was really helpful in understanding everything. The curve is ridiculous because some kids in tha class have already taken multivariable before, but it's a good class if you get a good professor.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 for students who have a good grip on Calculus because there are many concepts and problem solving techniques which are expected from students that will not be taught in class. Also do not take this math course unless you need it to fulfill a major requirement.",
    "Math 120 is difficult because unlike in high school where I had an entire year to learn Calc AB and BC, we learned multivariable calc in around 13 weeks. It was exhilarating but also quite hard. As great as Miki was, she went really quickly and I spent most of class time copying notes rather than actually understanding the material. I spent a lot of time outside of class self-studying. Definitely try to go to office hours or go to the peer tutors (they're great!) for extra help. Also, I didn't realize how many people had already took multi in high school, so sometimes I felt at a disadvantage especially because the class was graded on a curve. I took the class to get a taste of college math, and that's just what I got.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 09 to another student\u00e2\u0080\u0094 anyone who has taken BC and finds calculus in itself interesting, and even someone who has already had experience with multivariable. I took a semester of it last year\u00e2\u0080\u0094 even used the same textbook\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and still found this course interesting and challenging."
