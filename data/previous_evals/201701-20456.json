    "This class did not teach much or anything useful about UI. May have picked up some random insights about architecture.",
    "general history of the gui and the user interface; an appreciation of art and architecture; about specific people who've influenced technological development and helped define design within different periods of time.",
    "Absolutely none. I now know less about user interface and design than before I started taking this class. This was a huge waste of time, and the worst class I have taken at Yale. During lecture, all Professor Gelernter did was give his opinion on random aspects of design (mostly on random architecture and 20th century artists, and not on THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE), which I actually disagreed with most of the time, and said that he was right and everyone else was wrong. The assignments just had as put together a total of about a dozen Powerpoint slides throughout the semester, which taught me absolutely nothing and did not help me develop any knowledge, skills, or insights. The most annoying thing is that this could have been an interesting class, and I do want to learn about user interface design, but I learned nothing from this course. I learned more from one day of another computer science class where we covered UI\/UX and could have learned more from an hour of reading on the web. Professor Gelernter did not follow his syllabus at all, which I felt was a breach of trust, as I did not get what I was promised out of the class. He stated the first day that we would spend 2, maybe 2.5 days on classical design and then move onto computer design, but we ended up spending half of the semester on things like Gothic churches and the Centotaph. When we finally did move onto computers, we basically only watched a terrible quality demo of the original UI from the 60s. In regards to assignments, we were told we would use a special program to make interesting user interfaces, but instead all we did was critique buildings around Yale and 2 websites. As I said, this was the worst of all 36 classes I have taken at Yale, and I do not think Gelernter should be allowed to teach it again.",
    "discussed some design principles. I get that certain principles are transferable, but definitely think more time should have been spent on user interfaces.",
    "Mostly I learned how to make a great powerpoint.",
    "I learned about chairs, architecture, and Yale's history, but learned almost nothing about the graphical user interface",
    "none",
    "This course helped me consider UI\/UX from a different angle. Professor Gelernter starts by discussing architecture and helps give insight into what makes a good and a bad design at the very core. These concepts are important to understand when designing software product and building efficient and beautiful user interface systems.",
    "Insight into developing novel user interfaces, critiquing existing UIs of various commercial services.",
    "My knowledge about the beginnings of the user interface increased"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is a mess. It is not well organized, we barely talked about UI at all. Every class for the first half of the semester started with \"we're going to finish up talking about architecture today\" and then another hour of talking about buildings with no relation to UI at all. I think the idea was to teach about the basics of aesthetics, but the amount of time spend on it was ridiculous and could have been done in one or two classes. The rest of the course was spent talking about the history of UI and the computer. While this is technically about UI, it is not what should be taught in an upper level CS elective. Assignments are easy and grading for the most part seems arbitrary, since it is based on the professor's individual aesthetic taste. It also seems like assignments are a tool to make sure people go to class -- he does not post the assignments online and gives them out as paper copies once meaning you miss it if you are not in class. Of the five assignments, only two of them were UI related and we only actually designed a UI in one.",
    "some lectures were very interesting, but other lectures went too much into boring historical anecdotes. i think it would have been nice to evaluate different pieces of artwork\/design during class instead of having lectures on history (that often repeated themselves)",
    "0 strengths. Too many weaknesses to list here. See my response to the other questions.",
    "Lectures sometimes contained some nuggets of wisdom, but often just felt like rants of his personal opinions.",
    "We did not do any coding. I was hoping to actually learn user interface design in a reproducible way.",
    "Strengths - how to make a powerpoint Weaknesses - everything else",
    "There are many weaknesses. First and foremost, the course teaches almost nothing. Lectures are generally rambling and tangential, and \"we'll get to this topic\" means we'll get to it maybe 4 classes later. There was almost no teaching about good UI design practices, what types of considerations must be made as a designer, or what makes something good versus not good. It took a very long time for us to receive feedback on our assignments, and the purpose of each assignment with respect to learning was always very unclear. Feedback on homework often seemed arbitrary and subjective.",
    "Strength: Excellent lecturer, covers a lot of abstract questions from design of chairs to building and its relation to UI design Weakness: extremely lacking in practical assignments.",
    "We really didn't go into UI as much as we could've because we spent so much time talking about architecture and monuments.",
    "Professor Gelernter is very interesting and full of knowledge. This made for a class where I learned some things, but not many about designing a user interface. It made for a good fourth class. The focus on architecture helped me appreciate Yale as a campus more and also improved my eye in general."

   "comments": [
    "I would only say take this class if you are looking for an easy grade. While grades are unpredictable, the assignments are easy, don't take much time, and there are no tests. Otherwise, if you are looking for a class you will get something out of, would not recommend -- no reason to take this course.",
    "take this course if you already have an eye for design and an interest in art\/art history. do not take this course if you want to learn about design or how to implement a GUI. you have 5 assignments, no tests that are graded harshly (depending on the professor's point of view). they're all done on powerpoint slides. some lectures are really interesting (the ones where he puts up powerpoints and evaluate different objects\/artwork\/GUI designs) but some are very boring when he repeats his point of view or goes over the history of some designer\/architect for the 20th time.",
    "No",
    "I would not take this course if you are expecting to learn things. If you want a low workload cs elective, then go for it. Reviews last year mentioned that you didn't actual code things up which I was fine with as long as I learned some design principles.",
    "if you want a gut that you don't have to attend.",
    "Take This class only if you keep your expectations low. You will likely skip class many times and not learn a lot from class. Professor Gelernter rambles on and does not get to actual UI related topics until 6 weeks into the course. This is almost as much of an architecture course as it is computer science, and you will learn very little about either.",
    "Yes, it's a really great class and you get what you put into it.",
    "Only if he takes into account feedback from the past two years + about this course...",
    "Here's a quick comparison to another User Interface course my friend from another college took: Other college: Learned about design elements (e.g. colors, fonts), various implementations, interactivity, and so on. This course: Half a semester on Western architecture and the other half on several Youtube videos of the Mother of All Demos. Yes, you could argue that the two things covered were important, but honestly it felt like there was no clear lesson plan. Professor was frequently late, missed the first day of class for an interview at Trump Tower (and another one later for the same reason), and never stuck to his promised lesson plan.",
    "Take this if you're interested in the history of the modern UI, if you're a CS student who's always wanted to take an architecture or a history class, or if you want to hear Prof Gelernter's take on Yale and life."
