   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student with any interest in art history in general and\/or the art of this time period specifically as the lectures are extremely engaging.",
    "An awesome survey of the -isms. 1st half is absolutely stellar, 2nd half is a little dry - but it's worth it. Prof. Zeidler is a crazy bastard and a really compelling speaker. 1 reasonable paper and typical midterm and final. Definitely take it.",
    "Definitely take this class! Don't need a huge background in art history, but it would be helpful.",
    "Pretty good! Zeidler's cool, and the subject matter was great... it flagged a little post-Cubism, with all the Dadas and so forth, but then it picked up again at the end. An engaging introduction to art history. The readings were not that interesting, but they were also not that crucial to doing well in the class. It's worth it to be able to walk through MOMA and really get what's going on. Also, Zeidler in general is pretty brilliant and precise... unlike some professor (*cough*NEMEROV*cough*) he never gets into annoying rhapsodic statements about Art---he always hews close to the work he's showing.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It covers a lot but it's still able to go in depth about each of the avant-gardes it includes, so I think it strikes a good balance.",
    "I'd recommend it, but be aware that there are courses that cover similar material out there that are probably less work. Lectures probably aren't necessary for a decent grade, but there is a paper due right after Thanksgiving and both the midterm and final cover tons and tons of images, which inevitably means that you'll have a lot to memorize.",
    "Awesome. You must take it. If you're interested in modern art, you'll deepen your understanding of it, and if you don't get modern art, you'll change your mind.",
    "This course is fascinating up until the midterm and then it takes a real turn for the worst. The second half of the class is bogged down with too many mediocre artists and pieces. Unless you are really interested in Russian Constructivism, you will likely get bored and frustrated after the midterm. Zeidler also becomes really hard to follow once he starts getting into Dada, Constructivism, and Surrealism, which is very frustrating.",
    "A good course, worth taking if interested in the material. Also worth doing extra reading for. Some material that I wish had been covered was not, it is very much a reflection of Prof. Zeidler's interests.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and would recommend it, but I'd also say you should definitely shop it if you're interested, because Prof Zeidler has a very distinctive lecture style and you should see if you like it and are interested in the material. That said, I think it's a really valuable class to take, for anyone interested in art history or who just wants a sense of more modern art (because let's face it, most of that stuff is really confusing and off-putting if you haven't studied it). It's one of those classes you leave feeling more cultured and knowledgeable than you came in.",
    "I loved this class. Lectures are insightful, Professor is funny, workload isn't overwhelming, and the readings are extremely interesting. One of the best classes I have taken. I would recommend this class to everyone, but it does help if you have a background in art history or have taken an intro lecture or two.",
    "This class is pretty vital for anyone interested in art history, especially art history since the late nineteenth century. The material itself makes the class worth taking. However, a lot of this art can be very conceptual, so although you can probably get a good grade with relatively little effort, you'll get a lot more out of the class if you actually do the readings, participate in section, and try to sort out some of the ideas on your own.",
    "A good summary of important topics from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism, complemented by a worthwhile set of readings. Not a whole lot of work, definitely take it if you have an interest in either art from that period or even just a general interest in the first half of the 20th century.",
    "The title of this course can be misleading. While you will study the art of the early 20th century (Western art, of course, what else?), Zeidler has a very specific focus that makes this less than a full survey. After a certain point (around 1910) the central focus is art relating to industrialization and mechanization, especially the Germans and the Russians. You won't do Kandinsky or Mondrian or lots of other clearly famous people, but you'll really know the Constructivists. I found this kind of disappointing, but it might be right up your alley. Zeidler's lecturing style is complex and rich but a little hard to piece back together after class.In short, I thought this was okay, but not quite what I was hoping.",
    "Entertaining but not academic lectures. In fact, somewhat depressing because he hated everything he taught. Would not recommend another Zeidler course but obviously it depends on the TA."
