    "I learned Heidegger's philosophical approach and general take on Being. I learned how Heidegger relates to Kant, Aristotle, and others. My philosophical muscles were stretched. I was given tools for evaluating other disciplines. I was personally challenged to think about whether I own up to my own responsibility and whether I live in light of death (and, for me, resurrection).",
    "I feel as if I gained a solid understanding of Being and Time and Heidegger's philosophical beliefs. By no means am I a master, but I feel as if I can recount an understanding of the material to others and the next time I read this work I will be able to glean more from it.",
    "In this course, I developed a solid grasp of Heidegger's fundamental concepts and decided to pursue this line of thinking in my further coursework."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were very engaging. The professor was excited about the material, which made students excited about it. The professor treated every student's question as worth discussing. What was helpful to me about the course was that the readings were not overwhelming. If all of the secondary reading was required, not just recommended, I would've had to move too quick and would've got less out of it. But it was also important that I did a lot of the secondary reading.",
    "I am not sure there was any weaknesses to the course itself, the material is just very tough and demands a comprehension unlike other classes. I think one thing that could be improved is more handout to connect Heidegger's terms. The handout and the powerpoint at the end of the class was extremely helpful and having some materials earlier in the class to understand how all the terms connect would be helpful.",
    "The lectures were clear, interesting and well-organized. I believe an extra session would be useful even for graduate students."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. (a) Heidegger is so important to contemporary philosophy and to many other disciplines. (b) The lectures are very engaging. It's worth taking a course with Prof. Hgglund even if you're not into Heidegger.",
    "Absolutely. For those who are interested in ontology or phenomenology I think this course is a must. The material is quite interesting and you can see the effects of Heidegger's thoughts on theory in all fields after this work.",
    "Absolutely! To both graduate and undergraduate students it is a fascinating and useful foray into Heidegger's thought."
