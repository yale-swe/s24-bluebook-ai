   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to students, especially ER&M students, who want to get a solid foundation in what it mean to be part of an Ethnic Studies program and why Ethnic Studies is so important in higher education today. Do you not expect this to be a rigid, formal seminar, rather it is a far more free flowing conversation that can be fascinating but also disorganized.",
    "Highly recommend - Ethnic Studies is a must-have, must-take course for anyone hoping to understand the people around them. Prof Rasmussen makes it that much easier for the class to engage in open and honest but informative discussion on subjects often considered too PC to talk over in academic settings.",
    "It is a great way to learn about many of the problems which face our society today. I would recommend the course, but only if you're willing to do the work.",
    "Take it! You will not regret it!",
    "This class is required for ER&M majors, but if you are not one, I would recommend this class with some heads-up. Just be prepared for a large class size so it may not be the seminar feeling you're expecting and not everyone becomes very close because of that discussion isn't always rapid-fire or engaging. There also isn't always very much structure to the discussion, and if the rest of your class hasn't done the reading, a lot of talking in circles happens. That being said, the readings are usually very engaging and all about important topics that everyone should be aware of and debate. We had a number of really exciting and memorable discussions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Birgit is the sweetest. The readings are absolutely amazing. Class can sometimes be disorganized. The syllabus is very flexible, and Birgit encourages dissent and change, so make sure you're cool with that. The final project options are awesome. Perfect seminar for ER&M majors. I wish the class was a bit smaller.",
    "Take it. Birgit is great and the material is fascinating.",
    "Comparative Ethnic Studies is unlike any other class at Yale. Professor Rasmussen takes a genuine interest in her students and ensures that they learn about issues they actually care about.",
    "It was kinda fun. A bit boring.",
    "I 100% recommend this class to anyone, if you can get in. The syllabus is THE best and I learned a lot. This was one of the most racially diverse classes I've been in, and people are able to talk about their own experiences of race and ethnicity, which is important and rare in Yale classrooms. Class conversation is usually good, although it can be awkward sometimes. While Birgit is a great professor, at times she can talk too much. That said, please take this course. I wish everyone at Yale could.",
    "The class is essential to a complete understanding of American society. I would absolutely recommend it to my peers"
