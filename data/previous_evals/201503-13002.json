   "comments": [
    "I don't think you have to have a particular vested interest in the areas of dance or film to enjoy this course. It is a discussion-heavy course that surveys the chronology and development of dance on film, which includes watching a wide variety of films, studying many philosophies on dance and its relationship to film, and developing the vocabulary and skills necessary to write about this form of art. Overall, you will walk away from the course with a keen eye for movement and its depiction on film, and the means to discuss and debate how we define what qualifies as \"dance on film.\"",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because the content was very interesting. It is a lot of work, with weekly film assignments, and sometimes quite long readings\/viewings for every class period. Only two papers, which form the majority of your grade, although the class does not focus on writing skills. Your grade is up in the air, but the class was very engaging.",
    "Whether or not you have any experience with dance or film, if you're interested in either of those two media, I'd definitely recommend this course. You cover the history of dance and its intersection with film, from Loie Fuller in the 1800s to Pina Bausch in the 2000s, and besides getting to watch and read about the films you discuss you also get to make some via weekly film studies and the final project. Although the readings can be kind of heavy\/hard to understand sometimes, you get a lot out of discussing them. I learned about more than just dance and film in this class -- I learned about a whole new way of thinking about and talking about art in general. Take this class! You won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who was interested in dance and\/or film. I learned how to view dancefilms through in a new way, and even better I feel like I've gained the skills to talk about them.",
    "The class is definitely challenging and gives one an appreciation for the arts. It helps broaden your ideas of movement and dance as well as what qualifies as a dance. It also allows you to learn how dance in impacted by being on him.",
    "Film 045 is a fun freshman seminar that focuses on dance-film, especially avant-garde dance film. The professor is wonderful! I would recommend the class to another student, as I've learned so much about dance and film in general through Professor Coate's extensive work in the dance world. The guest lecturer brought in was utterly amazing as well.",
    "This class is a fun, deeply engaging, and informative immersion in the history and future of a revolutionary medium that will change how you see dance, film, AND dance on film. Readings are not horrible, only 2 papers for a WR, and no tests or anything. As long as you do the weekly homework and contribute, you're golden.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but only to the right kind of student. If you are more interested in popular dance and film and significantly disinterested in avant-garde art forms, this may not be the course for you. However, if you are willing to explore this side of dance and film, it can be very fulfilling. Furthermore, Emily Coates is very helpful outside of the classroom if you want to become involved in the dance community at Yale. My one word of warning is that this course is definitely not a gut. If you want to get anything out of it, you do have to put in a lot of work."
