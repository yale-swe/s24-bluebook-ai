    "Yes, I'd recommend.",
    "I absolutely loved Korean 152. Professor Angela Lee-Smith was the best and most caring teacher I had at Yale. I actually looked forward to going to class every time. We had very dynamic debates and class material was quite interesting. The other students were very engaging too!",
    "Definitely recommend, if you are serious about improving your Korean skills. You will have to put in the work in memorizing vocab and preparing for class, but I promise you will reap the benefits! Also, the class dynamic is always bubbly and you also get to know your fellow classmates really well!",
    "Nice class if students want to drastically improve their vocabulary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you'd like to improve in learning, writing, reading, and speaking Korean."
