    "Take it credit d",
    "I would recommend, although you should still shop the available sections.",
    "Yes, it is a solid WR credit and you learn something.",
    "ENGL 114 is a great class in which you learn how to construct and write a solid essay. The course requires constant reading, writing, and revising, but in the end I felt like I had come out a better writer. The course teaches you how to become more organized and structure the essay. Professor Chema is invested in her students and gives really helpful feedback on essay drafts. The course is really independent of the topic, so do not be discouraged if you get into your top choice section. The point of the class is to learn how to write better and the topic just serves as a springboard for ideas and class readings.",
    "If you are in it for the writing credit, I'd recommend a different class. This isn't worth the work and you can learn a lot of writing in other English-intensive courses.",
    "I came into this class with a psychology background and this allowed me to fully appreciate many of the things we discussed and read. As a result, I really enjoyed this class. My narrowly scientific perspective on emotions broadened quite a bit after having taken this course. As a writing course, it seemed pretty traditional to me. About the same level of work and not too difficult if you are comfortable writing and revising 5-6 page papers (the longer research paper is given extra time). I would recommend this class if you mainly want to gain an enthusiasm for writing and are truly passionate about emotions and related psychology. This class also helps improve writing, but only as much as any similar class traditionally would."
