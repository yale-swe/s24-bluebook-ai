    "If you want to read these two authors and talk about them extensively, take the course. Marta is great and will give you all the help you could ever wanton the papers.",
    "An excellent close study of modern literature's two most important novels. Prof. Figlerowicz, in addition to being an erudite scholar and reader, is a gifted facilitator of discussion (skilled at inviting enthusiastic contributions from all voices, loud and quiet). Each discussion, without exception, was challenging and productive. Once-a-week participation in an online forum was not at all onerous (just a paragraph) and was, in fact, a useful way to get more out of the reading and to prepare for discussion. I took the class never having read either Ulysses or Proust, and I got a lot out of it. Occasional secondary reading is also carefully selected and always stimulating. Great class with an amazing, amazing professor.",
    "This is a class that will return whatever you put into it - well worth taking, but easy to get lost in because the texts require such careful attention. These two authors are incredible, and Professor Figlerowicz has inspiring insights about their work; I would recommend it highly to anyone who is willing to dedicate some significant time to reading and thinking about the texts.",
    "A very interesting course going over Ulysses and Proust's Search. The readings are beautiful and amazing. Ulysses is so cool and the Search is wonderful. The papers are very reasonable. Professor Figlerowicz is pretty great. The discussions were usually good, as an English Major I usually rooted my comments in the text but sometimes they got a little philosophical or comp-lit-y for my taste.",
    "So the two main reasons to take this class are 1) the readings are awesome, these are two pretty amazing books, and 2) Marta Figlerowicz is super awesome. She's super pro-student. Like, when she had twice as many people who wanted to take her class as she had seats she OPENED TWO SECTIONS which is unbelievably generous. She basically took on twice as much work to make sure everyone who wanted to take her class could. Go to her office hours -- she's really interested in getting to know her students outside class. Finally she is just brilliant. Great professor + great readings = the kind of class where you can feel your mind expanding every time you're there. My only complaint was that in my section there were a lot of people who never talked so sometimes the room would go silent. Do as much of the reading as you humanly can (it's a lot but not by any means unreasonable) and use your responses as an opportunity to prepare a comment. Professor Figlerowicz is so friendly and so interested in hearing everyone's ideas so don't be shy!",
    "It's an excellent class, good discussions each week. The reading is manageable and always amazing. Professor Figlerowicz is fantastic, I recommend the class to everybody.",
    "YES! Take this course its wonderful. You read Ulysses and parts of In Search of Lost Time, as well as a number of secondary sources (not that many, but Professor Figlerowicz makes other sources available online, which I would advise taking a look at). You can either write two papers or prepare a research proposal an a longer research paper. There are weekly reading responses. Professor Figlerowicz manages to make a class about two texts a class that draws on and engages with many elements of broader Modernism; definitely take it if you're looking to tackle these seminal texts and in the context of \/ in dialogue with the larger movement (or even just if youre looking for a fun English course!). I learned far more about writing and research than I expected to from a paper proposal and long research paper; Yale English courses often dont provide enough formal support and guidance for students transitioning from close-reading papers to longer research papers, and this course provided that information and support in the way not many other classes do. Professor Figlerowicz is also a great seminar leader."
