   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. It wasn't as \"arty\" as I'm used to (as an art history major), but it was great to have the opportunity to to spend time examining other kinds of visual culture like old books in Beinecke. Overall, it's a fairly easy class where you will learn a lot. Professor Genoni is awesome. Take this class, you'll enjoy it.",
    "Absolutely! It was an interesting topic, and getting to handle books at the Beinecke was amazing.",
    "This seminar is a great! I would definitely recommend it to other students!",
    "It is really great to be in a seminar with Prof. Genoni. She has lots of energy and makes classes fun, interesting, and interactive. It is great to explore the hidden collections around Yale and really interact with the material. The course may feel a little scattered, but definitely worth any confusion along the way.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, or any class Professor Genoni teaches. She has a real knack for finding the most interesting things in boring essays or books and assigning just that part. She expects a lot but you will be rewarded for hard work.",
    "Passionate professor and interesting topic. This is not a traditional seminar--it meets regularly in special collections and features less open discussion (and less reading) than many seminars. It's very interesting, very specific, and not for everyone: make sure you like the vibe of the first class. Overall, definitely recommended.",
    "I would summarize it was an exploration of different forms of representation in Early Modern England. There was so much variety covered that it is difficult to summarize.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. It is wonderful. You come out feeling like you really learned something. It gives you an amazing opportunity to not only learn about something but experience what you are learning about first hand in Yale's collections. Plus, Professor Genoni allowed us to contribute to her exhibition, giving us real world curating experience as well.",
    "This course is so awesome. It's excellent at the conceptual level and the times at the Beinecke are a blast. Professor Genoni is one of the nicest teachers you'll meet.",
    "I would recommend HSAR 448 to another student if they were interested in working closely with historic books and materials. At times it can be hard to see the overall purpose when you're working so closely with so few things, but if you're willing to stick it out and throw yourself into the details, then the end product is really enriching.",
    "Take it, but only if you are actually interested in art (it gets a little technical)."
