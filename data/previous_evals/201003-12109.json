    "Take it! It is a really nice, chilled class. Yes, you have to put in work, but it is rewarding.",
    "In Italian 130, you really improve your reading, writing, and especially your speaking skills. I definitely recommend it, and make sure you shop around teachers to get one that you will enjoy spending class with each day.",
    "I loved this course. It's a great way to learn the intricacies of Italian grammar while becoming more conversationally talented. We watched good movies and read interesting articles, and, on a day-to-day basis, it was not that much work.",
    "I would recommend Italian 130 to students who wish to further their knowledge of Italian language and culture. Even though it meets every day and sometimes gets tedious, the knowledge one receives is well worth it.",
    "Yes, Italian is very interesting and fun"
