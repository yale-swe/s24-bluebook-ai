   "comments": [
    "Learned about different philosophers and how to not be horrible in the workplace.",
    "I learned how to apply various philosophical theories from the Western tradition to real-life situations that I may likely encounter in my professional career. I was also exposed to many different television shows and movies that illustrate longstanding ethical tensions and dilemmas. I also evaluated the ethics of American drone usage from this perspective.",
    "I learned how to approach ethics problems.",
    "I learned a lot about ethical principles in a very tangible way. I had never been exposed to ethics before so this was great!",
    "I learned a ton about applying different moral frameworks to my decisions.",
    "This course was an incredibly unique opportunity to apply philosophy and ethics to a professional context. We learned about real life, and current, cases and class was always interactive.",
    "Learned a ton about the main ethical theories and how they apply to the professional setting.",
    "This course inadvertently scared me off of lying. Thank you, Immanuel Kant.",
    "I learned a lot about ethical decision-making and how there are a number of ways through which an ethical dilemma can be examined.",
    "Learned a lot more about applying ethics to the general business and professional landscape. Learned about different philosophers' use of ethics in tackling problems that we face everyday and what we need to use going forward in our jobs. Mercedes was a great professor and the assignments were incredibly fair. Really enjoyed the class.",
    "A broad coverage of ethical theories, covering examples of they apply to modern examples",
    "A hreat look at ethics in general.",
    "I truly enjoyed taking this course - the material taught in the readings for our weekly homework assignments as well as that discussed in class was always relevant in my day to day conversations with friends, family members, and Professors. We covered a broad range of ethical dilemmas, from the rise of artificial intelligence in the workplace, to health care dilemmas and air pollution, to the appropriate behavior for successful business interactions in other countries and much more.",
    "Great",
    "Learned about many of the ethical schools of thought and famous philosophers that shaped the field of ethics - Kant, the utilitarians, deontology, John Rawls, and more. Also learned to understand the thought process behind ethical decision making.",
    "Through taking this course I gained a comprehensive understanding of important ethical issues in business.",
    "nothing, gutty gut",
    "I learned how to frame certain situations from an ethical perspective. As someone entering the medical profession, these skills will definitely be useful.",
    "I learned to look at the business world from an ethics point of view.",
    "The course was a brief overview of a collection of philosophical theories.",
    "This was a wonderful and informative class on professional ethics",
    "I learned a great deal about philosophy in this course. It was very enlightening in many respects. We looked at multiple theories and concepts and applied them to the professional world.",
    "I learned about ethics, ancient philosophers, and how our society is formed, the differences between right and wrong, etc.",
    "I learned so much about ethical business practices around the world and how to think about ethical dilemmas through different schools of philosophical thought.",
    "This course introduced me to a few central ideas of ethics: utilitarianism, deontology, and aristotelean virtue ethics. There were also some interesting case studies and readings which were good opportunities to apply these theories.",
    "An introduction to ethics and philosophy, which is not addressed in any other ENAS courses.",
    "Good",
    "Practical application of ethical concepts in real life.",
    "I learned how to apply academic ethical theories to practical everyday scenarios.",
    "Since I have never studied philosophy before, i was able to get a good grasp of the concepts and different sources of philosophical discussion. Relating the difficult concepts to real life situations helped in understanding the basic idea surrounding a specific topic. I took away more learning related to business than anything else. It has sparked a new interest in the sources of ethics and morality which i intend to research further.",
    "I learned about a variety of ethical decisions that have to be made across different professions -- in the field of medicine, in finance, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really wasn't very clear on the point of the class, but it was good to get a credit. I think sometimes some of the information she presented was wrong, but she was very kind.",
    "The course is strong in that it isn't an intimidating way to engage with political philosophy and its practical applications. I think it also benefits from the fact that it is overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, juniors, seniors, and graduate students. The course is weak in that the PowerPoints are incoherent and unorganized. We also neglected so much of the course packet, which ideally needs to be trimmed. Attendance is sometimes low.",
    "I liked how this course related and used material immediately from the professional world. It did not rest heavily on philosophy so it felt very relevant.",
    "I felt that lectures were a bit long and sometimes were drug out too long. The weekly readings helped me understand the topics much better than the lectures and the assignments bolstered that understanding.",
    "This course was great because the methods used to teach will help me remember the material very well",
    "This course is incredible--I cannot think of one weakness. Professor Carreras is incredibly engaging and dedicated to her students, and makes the class as engaging and interactive as possible. She uses various methods of teaching--lecturing, case studies, videos, etc. that are all interesting and engaging.",
    "There are very interesting reading assignments, particularly for those interested in going into business and economics. However, the lectures often seemed unrelated to the readings and relatively hard to follow.",
    "Professor Carreras is very sweet and is always there for her students to answer questions and provide help. I would warn anyone taking this course, however, that you don't learn very much unless you go to every lecture and pay attention. Although, I believe that most people take this course for that sole reason-- little work and no challenge. Professor Carreras does a good job teaching this course and making it not stressful for the students, but the weakness of this course lies in the fact that no one takes it seriously.",
    "To call this class a \"gut\" would understate the lack of engagement. I have never taken a class less serious than this one. Extremely enjoyableI liked going a lot. But this is not a serious course, despite that Professor Carreras is absolutely wonderful.",
    "It seemed to be hard to keep students engaged with the course, as very few showed up regularly to lectures. I believed Professor Carreras was a wonderful professor who was passionate about the topics, but there seemed to be a disconnect between her teaching style and the interests of some other students.",
    "Learned a lot more about applying ethics to the general business and professional landscape. Learned about different philosophers' use of ethics in tackling problems that we face everyday and what we need to use going forward in our jobs. Mercedes was a great professor and the assignments were incredibly fair. Really enjoyed the class.",
    "The strength would be professor carreras' desire to have all of her students learn and her ability to craft interesting lectures. The low workload was also very important for me this semester. There were no weaknesses in my opinion.",
    "Although I like that Prof. Carreras wants to engage everyone in the classroom, there were simply too many students in the lecture for her to be soliciting answers to the questions she posed. It often led to awkward silences and a waste of time. Otherwise, the cases we read were generally very interesting.",
    "Very interesting",
    "Interesting course with a very comedic professor",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely Professor Carreras, who is always open to talking to students and answering questions in a timely manner, as well the course material itself, which is widely applicable to many areas of one's professional (and personal) life.",
    "Great course",
    "Wonderful class, a great opportunity to gain exposure to ethics and philosophy in a low-pressure way. While the homework was fairly straightforward, the articles we read were very interesting and allowed the class to see some of the many different ways in which ethics can be applied in the real world.",
    "This course is fabulous for anyone interested in business ethics or a cursory overview of ethics more generally.",
    "The weekly homework assignments provided a nice way to study ethics in a diverse range of fields. One weakness of the course was not knowing the overall structure of the course. It was difficult to find a common thread that connected lectures to each other.",
    "Its a great case study based survey course for ethics. Prof Carreras is phenomenal and really cares about the students.",
    "The course topics were interesting and relevant to life after college, and we had fun thinking about and discussing different moral dilemmas. The paper was interesting because we got to choose our own topics. On the other hand, homework felt more like busy work than actual work. The weekly homework had more \"read the text and fill in the blank\" kinds of assignments than any where we were actually thinking about what we read and giving an opinion or making an argument. The work would have been much fulfilling if it we had less frequent, more hearty assignments such as reading responses that made us think and answer rather than search for the line to quote in the text, but then you would need TF's from the Philosophy department or that were really familiar with the material to grade them. I think people would be more invested in the class if these changes were made.",
    "Interesting topics that cover many professional areas and archival theories",
    "This is an excellent course. Mercedes was successfully able to explain complex ethical concepts so her students could understand them and how they apply to the professional world.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course. The readings were very helpful and explained the concepts from class very adequately.",
    "NO WEAKNESSES! Professor Carreras is incredible and such an amazing professor. She is so knowledgable, and really knows how to teach her students. The course is engaging, perhaps could be even more improved with the usage of more videos or episodes of shows to showcase certain ethical behaviors we have learned.",
    "Strength: it was a good overview of ethics theory. Weakness: it was a shallow analysis at times.",
    "Very engaging",
    "It is very dynamic so it makes you feel interested.",
    "Fantastic course! Definitely recommend.",
    "The course does not provide students with an answer about what is right and what is not. The purpose of this course is to push students to arrive at their own answer and to be able to defend their decision. The open class discussion helped students learn how to appropriately defend their beliefs\/decisions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you don't want to think at all and get an A, take this class. It will occasionally feel somewhat like a waste of time, but you can get other work done during the class. If you tune in, you can learn about the western canon of philosophers (some of them). Class isn't very engaging, but it can help you graduate.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I conditionally recommend Professional Ethics. The weekly homeworks are of high-school level difficulty. It requires basic reading comprehension and some critical thinking. The \"case studies\" are just heavier-weighted versions of the weekly homeworks with more open-ended questions. All are graded generously. The final paper is long, but getting to the sweet spot of around 15 pages isn't as hard as you think, because you're just applying the philosophies of the course to a complex real-life issue with ethical dilemmas surrounding it. Also, Mercedes reads them all which will be a blessing. On many days, class is boring, mostly because it's painful watching Mercedes go through disorganized PowerPoint slides. But when it isn't, you're watching clips from so many great shows and movies, and listening to interesting podcasts! Many people don't feel the need to go to class, which is an insult to those who go, but whatever.",
    "If you can get in, this is a must-take!",
    "Yes - not high stress and learn a ton!",
    "Yes! I loved Professor Carreras, and the course material was engaging and relevant.",
    "Take this course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course--it is one of my favorites at Yale! It's a great opportunity to learn about philosophy in a concrete, business setting, and Mercedes is truly the best.",
    "Definitely, Prof. Carreras is extremely energetic and passionate about the topic. She makes the topics extremely relevant and engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in ethics in the professional world and a brief overview of philosophy theories. The workload is very light: besides the final paper, which is kind of long, there are just weekly reading comprehension assignments.",
    "If you want an easy course with a kind professor and not much workload, this is a good class to take. But if you'd like to use your Yale career to take classes that you will learn from (think how much money you're paying for each class you go to)-- take something where the material is interesting, not just because the class is easy.",
    "If you want to waste a credit on a course that will not challenge you, that will not push you, that will not engage you at all, by all means take this course. If all you care about is a good grade, this is the class for you. Though I really hope Yalies are serious about learning and growing and improving as people and would steer clear of Professional Ethics for these reasons. This is just not a serious class. A \"gut\" is easy; Professional Ethics poses absolutely no challenge at all. For many, this is the class's sole advantage. For others, this is its entire problem. Fun, but utterly unserious.",
    "Yes, I think it a fairly low-workload class that offers interesting insights into the world of ethics.",
    "Learned a lot more about applying ethics to the general business and professional landscape. Learned about different philosophers' use of ethics in tackling problems that we face everyday and what we need to use going forward in our jobs. Mercedes was a great professor and the assignments were incredibly fair. Really enjoyed the class.",
    "Professional Ethics was just the sixth class I needed this semester. It has a very very low workload. The entire class is based on reading assignments where you literally copy the answers directly out of the coursepack. Professor Carreras is one of the nicest professors I've had and she really wants all of her students to understand what can be some dense material. This was a pretty chill class, but I still felt like I learned something. Take it if you can get in (very popular).",
    "yes!",
    "If you're a senior that needs a gut, take this class.",
    "Good class to take if you want to learn the foundation of popular ethical theories like utilitarianism, deontologism, virtue ethics, etc",
    "Pretty interesting and applicable material",
    "Absolutely, if you can get in, take it.",
    "Yes",
    "Enjoyable course, recommend if you're a senior",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - the workload is very manageable and the material is incredibly interesting and applicable to both one's professional and personal life.",
    "This is the perfect 5th class. It's interesting and not at all overwhelming. You'll get a nice introduction to some philosophy. On a week to week basis, there's reading and short answer questions on that reading as a response. Then there's the final paper that will sneak up on you if you're not ready. Prof. Carreras is the sweetest and you'll be lucky if you're taking the class with her.",
    "Throw on your trucker and your sweat suit and join the party. This is the guttiest of guts. A mandatory class for any student that needs at least 16 and 1\/2 inches of fabric to close the top button on their shirt. Mercedes never disappoints.",
    "Great course. Professor Carreras is a gem and the course is really interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely would recommend, especially for students who have no previous knowledge of ethics or philosophy!",
    "Yes I would recommend taking this course!!! Prof. Carreras was extremely knowledgeable and kind.",
    "great opportunity too get a 5th credit",
    "Fantastic course! Mercedes is super sweet, material is interesting, grading is fair. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to seniors who are entering a professional work environment after graduation.",
    "Yes. If you can get in, it will broaden your view of the business world with a minimum workload.",
    "A student should take this class if they want a very brief overview of important philosophical thinkers\/theories that is interesting, but light enough for a semester with a very heavy workload. This would make a good 5th or 6th class. Weekly easy homework assignments and a final 15-page paper on a topic of your choosing. Lectures are always pretty relevant to professional life and interesting.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend",
    "Take it! Great perspective into ethical dilemmas + insightful guest lecturers!",
    "Great class, light workload, the professor is really nice and interesting. This class is also great if you're looking to see ethical concepts you may have learned in the past applied to real world examples.",
    "A gem! Ive seen a lot of students, however, complain about the class for one reason or another on these evaluations. This is not meant to be the most exhaustive ethics class, nor the most organized, but Mercedes teaches with more heart than any professor at Yale. She is generous with her time, kind and fair to all her students, and always clear in her explanations. The assignments are weekly reading comprehension questions about articles (yes, really) and a 15-page final paper about a topic of your choosing. Each year people seem surprised that the class is easy and sometimes feel let down, and I just dont get it. If you want a tough philosophy class, then this one is not for you, so dont take it and then complain that it didnt give you what you wanted. If you want a nice, relaxed class, and you get in, then sit back and just enjoy this gift.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Carreras is a wonderful professor and makes this class what it is. The course could potentially be very dry, but Professor Carreras makes it enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS - very easy to do well and thought provoking as well. It is a must - a great 5th class .. a gut!",
    "Absolutely. Especially if you've never taken a psych or ethics class, this class is a crash course in the most widely used theories on morality.",
    "Absolutely great class. A class where there is no pressure to work for a grade. I went to class with one goal: to learn.",
    "Yes!!!!!!!",
    "Yes. It's a wonderful compliment to the other engineering courses. It stimulates thought that is not easily available to STEM students.",
    "Yes, I loved the class.",
    "Yes yes",
    "Yes. You learn a lot.",
    "Yes! Professor Carreras is amazing and the course is very interesting.",
    "It should be a core course for all students, regardless of the degree!!",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. I absolutely would recommend this course to any student. Mercedes is a breath of fresh air. She just wants us to learn and have a good time. While it is so easy to skip class every single day and still get an A, I came to class every day because Mercedes is just so awesome. Coming to lecture was a break for me from the fast-paced, cut-throat atmosphere I often feel in the typical classroom environment. Not all heroes wear capes -- Mercedes, thank you for being my superwoman."
