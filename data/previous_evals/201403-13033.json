    "Yes, it is a requirement for the major so you would have to take it. Helps to have a yearlong than just a semester long project I think.",
    "Do the yearlong project! I feel like a one semester project would feel to rushed and crammed. Despite the difficulties of writing so many pages, I believe that HSHM 490 is fulfilling and really demonstrates how far my academic journey has progressed.",
    "Yes, because it is required for the HSHM major. As someone who started the project in the fall of senior year, I would say that that is okay to do and everything will turn out just fine. However, seeing the Mellon Forum presentations of some other peers who started research in the summer before senior year made me think about how much more I could have done, had I started earlier.",
    "it is very different from a normal class because you do the work on your own but it allows you to focus on something you are really interested in",
    "Requirements are not that hard to complete."
