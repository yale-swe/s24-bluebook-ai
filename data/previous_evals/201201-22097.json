    "This class is a great, laid-back course in which you will learn plenty, never get tested, and take a field trip to someplace exotic!! What more could you ask for?",
    "You get to go to the Barbados if you're lucky. However, the readings are mostly from before 1980 and are very dry and scientific. If you're not a geology major, you will likely struggle through them and it will take you some time to do the reading responses.",
    "The course is designed to have an awesome Spring Break trip and that's really the whole point. But nobody knows what's going on regarding the geology for pretty much the entire time. You get to read really cool geology papers (and not really understand them). This is the most laid-back course at Yale period but it annoyed me. I honestly recommend that you go on a Spring Break trip with your friends, spend a little more money, and set your own itinerary, instead of using up a credit for a class like this that won't teach you that much just so you can go somewhere exotic for cheap over 8 days. If you're a geology major and actually like\/understand geology, then this class is everything you've ever dreamed of.",
    "This is a great survey geo class which should be accessible to anyone who's interested in the formation and continued processes of a wide range of geologic areas, from Barbados (of course.. I'm sure more posts will tell you all about that. It was sweet, needless to say.) to the Canadian Rockies to the Alps and Appalachians. It's the sort of class that you'll get as much out of as you put into it. Because of the (perceived, though not yet verified) lax grading, some opt not to go to lecture and waste their tuition on what becomes a very expensive trip to Barbados..., but you can really learn a lot in this class. Take it if you can get in, for the field trip, for the professors, and for the knowledge.",
    "Take it. Have generally interesting lectures on continental plates. Take a fantastic trip with awesome professors, get to experience Geo field work (its kick ass), hike, discuss, cook dinner, and see beautiful things. There is no reason not to take this if you can get in. There aren't any tests. The only assignments, research summaries, are reasonable and not a waste of time, you will learn a little bit. Plus Mark and Dave are awesome, and there is TRIP.",
    "I mean.. you get to go to barbados. how could you not take this class. It was worth doing a lot of catchup on material (as a non-geo major). reading responses can get annoying and feel tiresome towards the end of the semester. the final paper is a tough one. but, let me repeat, you get to go to BARBADOS.. the instructors are also great. awesome and easy to get along with. class turns into a social group fairly quickly",
    "TAKE IT - G&G is amazing",
    "The trip is super fun and pretty much makes this class worth taking. But you probably should have at least a cursory interest in tectonics because the trip comes with a whole semester of lectures on the topic. These were generally really interesting and I learned a lot from this class.",
    "You should not leave Yale without taking a class in the G&G department. End of story. Dave and Mark are the best professors I have ever had and Global Tectonics is one of the best classes at Yale. The lectures are really interesting and you learn about processes you should have known about a long time ago. Tectonics provides a fascinating fusion of the different scientific disciplines, and this class is a perfect introduction to the field. And the field trip is AMAZING-you learn so much and have a great time! The work is reasonable and the professors and TAs always available and eager to help-just try to start your final paper early!",
    "This is a fun class. There are lectures 3 times a week, which usually aren't needed to do the work, but I would recommend them anyway. It is a good way to get to know the professors and recognize the other students in the class before the trip. The work is weekly reading responses and a final research paper. There is also a field trip over spring break, this year to Barbados. The field trip was great-- We did a lot of geology so don't take it just for a trip, but we also hiked and had fun at the beach and other places. The trip also lets you know the professors and other students in the class really well. I think all of us who took the class and went on the trip are glad we did it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is one of the hidden gems of Yale classes. Interesting classes, one reading response per week, a final paper, and an AMAZING spring break trip. The best class at Yale.",
    "This class is awesome! The material can be hard to understand at times, but if you ask a lot of questions and do the readings, it's an extremely rewarding class! Plus, you get to go to Barbados!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "I took this class senior year- a great decision! Take the course with your friends, if possible, so that you can all go on the spring break trip together (lots of geology and lots of fun!). If you don't have any background in geology, you will find the subject hard to grasp, though, so be prepared to look up and define terms on your own outside of class, to make a concerted effort to take notes and understand the material and to talk to Mark and Dave outside of class. It's also three days a week, and you should not skip or you'll miss too much.",
    "This is an interesting class and is definitely worth considering, especially if you can take the trip. A great way to complete the science requirement would be to take the intro Geo class (Dynamic Earth) followed by this one. Lectures are hit-or-miss and can be extremely engaging or somewhat scattered. The weekly summaries can be frustrating, as geology papers can be difficult to understand. Still, all-in-all, it was an absolute blast. The Geology department is amongthe coolest at Yale, with fun and helpful professors and TFs and a great community you can join if you want. And the trip is a lot of fun. Lots of geology, but also lots of hanging out and getting to know some great people.",
    "Fun course, especially because you get to learn geology field-methods during the spring break trip to Barbados. Lots of fun and informative. The course can be confusing without any prior background in geology, but there were no exams or psets, just scientific paper summaries. A fairly easy class with low workload.",
    "A well-taught survey of tectonic geology. This class examines specific types of phenomena by looking at one region per week or so. This is not a gut: there is a 1-2 page single-spaced reading summary per week (and the readings range from 4 pages to 35 pages), as well as a 15-page double-spaced review-like paper at the end. =============== The highlight of this class is definitely the trip. It teaches stratigraphy field techniques in Barbados, and the trip basically involves field work from 9-4 and doing fun stuff afterwards ;) I got to know a lot of my classmates pretty well on the trip, and it's quite amazing how much the TAs and profs tell you. Make sure you at least somewhat like the outdoors though as you'll be climbing up and down steep rock faces and hills often and hiking through somewhat-dense forests. ================= You don't have to be a Geology major (those made up about half the class) or a senior (less than 1\/4 of the class). Be prepared to write a long review-paper NOT based on original research though. ================ The professors and TAs are pretty good, but I regret not going to their offices and talking more about my paper and so on. Dave and Mark are the most chill professors I've ever had. They're also clearly very knowledgeable too. The class can be really useful if you (unlike a sizable portion of the class) go to class all the time and make use of the resources you have. The Powerpoints DO NOT make sense on their own. =============== Basically: the retention of information from this class is somewhat low due to the lack of exams, but the trip alone makes it worthwhile.",
    "I would definately recommend this course - professors Evans and Brandon are very knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. On some days lectures can be tough to follow but overall the course gives a fresh perspective on looking at landscape.Some of the weekly responses will take some time to write but overall the course is great. I learned a lot from writing my final paper and the trip to Barbados was amazing",
    "If you have any interest at all about the geological formation of the planet, this class is AMAZING!!!!!"
