   "comments": [
    "This is a great, important class to take, even as an undergraduate. You will learn how to read books thoroughly and quickly, how to engage and critique material, and how to write well. It's a necessary survey-type course that assesses a lot that is missing from the undergraduate curriculum.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student largely for the strengths I've listed above. In short, not only was the class intellectually fulfilling, it was also a great survey of different models for becoming a historian.Also, the class had students from a wide variety of backgrounds (international relations, geography, medicine, forestry, among others) which made the discussion rich and widely-applicable. With the success of this semester, I imagine that diversity in the class will continue."

   "comments": [
    "Again, I've outlined the ways in which the course was a study of the sociology of the academy and how helpful this is for an incoming grad student.Because my research is in the history of medicine, content-wise (i.e. regarding historical \"facts\") this course was not as useful. However on a theoretical and conceptual level the course has been very useful. The main contribution to my future research is a deeper understanding of historiographical issues surrounding the public. Though this is quite specific to my research, given the structure of the course - where you are allowed to write on any topic discussed in the class for your final paper - and the depth of discussion I imagine that most students will be able to find a historiographical problem that they find useful.",
    "The course really asked students to consider the history of science as a field, asking us what defines the discipline and its possible future directions. This is a useful way to conceptualize the course, and perhaps we can also ask about the past of the field as well. The course can provide both a sense of where we are coming from, what the field looks like now, and where we might take it in the future."
