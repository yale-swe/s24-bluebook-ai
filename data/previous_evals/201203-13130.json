    "Take it! Awesome readings, awesome professor, awesome class. This was the first philosophy class I've taken, and I may have bitten off a bit too much, but the class was great. I don't recommend taking this class as your first class in philosophy, but I would definitely recommend it to those who've had experience with philosophy in the past. Otherwise, the concepts were really interesting, the lectures were engaging and the class was generally something I was able to look forward to.",
    "Existentialism is a fantastic overview of some of the most famous contemporary philosophers. Scott is one of the most well-structured, interesting and witty professors I've had, and the readings (while occasionally challenging) were incredibly fascinated. Take it!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course gives a solid foundation to understanding the existentialist tradition. The lectures were for the most part informative and sometimes even illuminating. The readings were important works of the existentialist cannon. Edgar sometimes strays in his lectures, but overall he keeps the class awake and interested.",
    "Existentialism is a very difficult class for many reasons. There is a lot of reading, and a lot of dense, incomprehensible reading. Professor Edgar doesn't really help you out with understanding it at all in his lectures because he is very slow and always remains at the surface. There is a ton of writing (why isn't this a writing credit??) -- 3 shorter papers and a longer term paper. The final looks like its going to be very difficult (I'm taking it in two days). I definitely spent about twice as much time for this class than any of my other classes.How much reward does this class give for this difficulty? I guess that depends. I don't want to seem like some pretentious analytic philosopher when I say that a lot of of this stuff is more like literature than philosophy (in, fact a lot of it was literature). But a lot of the time the material was not as rigorous as I would have liked, and often it seems that these philosophers us unnecessarily complex and dense language\/terminology which obscures what they are trying to say. There is a thing that happens when you read someone like Heidegger where you think \"perhaps here is a tangible way that this applies to my life\", but then you think \"no wait, am I sure that I know exactly what 'throwness' or 'being-towards-death'is? They are complicated terms they must be much more complicated concepts than I am thinking of.\" This is the risk with many of the philosophers. Although I will say I loved reading Nietzsche, and that it is truly and interesting question about how to react to the ultimate meaningless\/contingency of life, although I think not one which is unanswerable in normal language. But if you're a person that thinks that stepping outside of \"rigor\" and reading something more \"literary\" can make you understand things an a \"deeper\" or \"emotional\" level, then I won't necessarily fight you to the death over that, and you probably the person that will get the most out of this class. Although for me, this class was more useful from a historical perspective: now I can say who said what when. But I can't say I had any major life revelations or anything.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course.",
    "Take it. One of the best philosophy courses I've taken with one of the best philosophy professors here.",
    "If Scott Edgar is teaching, TAKE IT. This class is the best! Strengths: Scott Edgar. He is definitely the most awe-inspiring, engaging lecturer I have encountered in my time here. This class changed the way I think about the world. Existentialism itself is interesting, but Scott Edgar is what makes the class so stellar.I also went into it never having read any philosophy before and came out feeling like I could pick up a work of philosophy and have an idea of what was going on. DS people also loved the class, so something for everyone, and 75 minutes always went by too quickly, which is saying a lot.Note: I am a more science-oriented person, and this was my first-ever philosophy experience, and I was a bit nervous about the whole thing. I took the class credit-d. I highly recommend that for this class even though the grading was not so harsh because I was able to enjoy the class more fully and have more fun with it.",
    "Awesome for Existentialism lovers.",
    "I really loved this class. I always left questioning my life and my decisions (I think this might be more due to the subject rather than the course itself). Still, all the readings were pertinent and interesting. Edgar is a good, if cautious professor. His final was challenging (he essentially had us plan and memorize 10 essays on different topics and then gave us 4 to write in-class). It would have been nice for him to contextualize existentialism at the beginning of the course so we would know what to look for in the reading.",
    "Take this class! Professor Edgar's lectures are wonderful, funny, insightful, and easy to understand despite the challenging material. The readings are excellent. Don't be discouraged by Kierkegaard at the beginning. Everyone except for Heidegger is easier to read. This class was the best. Take it.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a small lecture course and an engaging section. The readings are very interesting as well.",
    "Yes, take this class! Very important topic, very useful for life, and for you as a philosopher and intellectual. Great prof, great texts.We had 4 writing assignments and a final,though. Lot of work, though this did keep any one grade from being crushingly important.",
    "TAKE IT. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Assignments are manageable and even help you learn the material. Edgar is so cool.",
    "Only take it if you are a Philosophy major, or for some reason REALLY know how to write those Philosophy papers. As a non-humanities major, I took this class because I was interested in the readings and the philosophers we read. Nevertheless, my grade really took a tumbling with this class because I had neverwritten a Philosophy paper before. The grading was really harsh. Considering there are no pre-reqs to this course, you technically have to be a Philosophy major to get a good grade in the class and I found that unfair.That being said, the context was amazing and Professor Edgar was awesome. He really knows his material and you could tell he really enjoys teaching. He is engaging in class and he gives careful accounts of the reading we had to do for that class. As a non-humanities major, I really enjoyed taking a class by him. He was great.",
    "I would recommend it--the material itself is interesting, and the reading selection for this class felt very cohesive (everything won't make sense at the end, but you do begin to see how each reading connect to each other).",
    "Yep!",
    "A very solid survey of existentialism. Edgar is great at summarizing texts in understandable terms. However, the lectures mostly did just this. So don't expect new insights into the texts, or even much argumentative discussion of the philosophy behind the texts. Which, I guess one would generally not expect in a survey course anyway. There are three short (3page) papers, one longer one (8-10pages), and a final exam.",
    "Yes, if philosophy interests you. Be warned it's a lot of reading but lectures are very helpful.",
    "A truly interesting class on Existentialism, on the nature of freedom and what it means to be.",
    "Yes and no. The course does a pretty good synthesis of Kierkegaard, Nietzche, Heidegger, Sartre and Camus. You'll be able to say you've read these people in conversation and then fake the rest to make it seem like you know what you're talking about. Unclear why you should take the course, though. The conclusion of the course is basically one of four options: Become an irrational messianic ax murderer, commit suicide, go pagan and celebrate human torture, or just rebel. Against what? Unsure. Just rebel. There are no values or anything out there, so live however you want. There. Now you can move on.Edgar is a good lecturer. He holds your attention, and cracks witty jokes. I do wonder why he doesn't commit suicide after teaching this course. I should ask him that.The course asks very specific questions. You should not go in thinking you'll ask all of life's existential questions: You'll ask: Can I believe in an immoral God? How should I confront death? Is there morality? You'll answer these, though, very specifically, focusing on becoming an individual and not a socially defined creature. Don't expect to come out with answers to life's big questions telling you to be nice to your neighbors and love your wife. It won't do that for you.",
    "The readings are great and the material helps you give meaning to your life. Do the readings thoroughly and you will get a lot out of it. Reread the passages a few times before you start writing your essays.",
    "Existentialism is a terrific course! The course will introduce you to the thinking of each of the philosophers on the reading list, but it will also get you to think critically about these ideas and about what \"Existentialism\" really is. The central philosophical questions of the course are themselves compelling--what is the meaning of human existence? what constitutes a human self? Whether or not you agree with the responses of the various philosophers you will read, their answers will provoke your own thinking. Although this course is a lecture, Professor Edgar really engages students with the material by asking and responding to student questions during lecture so it feels a bit more seminar-like. The course includes 3 short essays, a term paper, a and final. It is a fair amount of writing, but it is helpful because each work you write about you will get to know that much better.",
    "This class was one of my favorites during my time at Yale. Existentialism as a philosophy is incredibly influential on much of today's society. Learning about the development of this philosophy has helped changed my world view. I recommend this course to everyone.",
    "Very good course. Comprehensive and stimulating. Makes you think beyond the course itself. I'd certainly recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in philosophy, spirituality, or of the general philosophy of life."
