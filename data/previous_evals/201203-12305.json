   "comments": [
    "Of all the potential Economics seminars to take as a senior, this is definitely the one you should most want to take. Not too much work, interesting readings, and a kind professor.",
    "Take it.",
    "Good class. Enjoyed the combination of theory and current events.",
    "This is an overview to the banking sector. This focuses a little less on how banks actually work and more on bigger economic issues actually effect banks (depression, financial crisis, etc.) No textbook. Relatively untechnical. Doesn't get too too sophisticated. So if you are familiar with the banking sector already, you will be reviewing a bunch here.Workload consists of the assorted readings. Graze through all of them. No need to take scrupulous notes. There's no exam and the in class discussion of them will start there then expand onto tangents.You do a couple of in class presentation on specific topics (frequently not related to banks directly. Just economic new in the US). The hardest part about it is to keep each presentation to 5 minutes. Some topics require you to learn much more than others to be able to present in front of the room (and some are REALLY boring).Final paper isn't too stressful. You get to to pick what you want to do. 15-20 pages. and that's it.",
    "Great seminar. Manageable workload of a final paper and a couple of short presentations. Readings were interesting, and we covered current events closely. If you do not know that much about capital markets, this class may be slightly challenging, but Professor Perna keeps class engaging and will answer any questions you have.",
    "Great seminar to fulfill the econ requirement.",
    "The course really helped with summarizing important events in a concise and eloquent manner through its requirement of students making at least two 5-minute presentations on a topic in the news of the professor's choice. In addition, it had no work outside of the two presentations and final essay. However, the course was very disorganized. Perna needs to do a better job fixing the format of his readings (i.e. using classesv2 and putting each article separately, instead of a jumble of copy and pasted articles in one ms word document). Next, the class needs a textbook. Perna's presentations seemed foreign to me without a solid book to understand the material. However, if he chooses to give us readings from the book he needs to lighten our reading load coming from the articles. I suggest he give us reading from the book and then a few articles that we can talk about in class along with the presentations. Perna is full of great experiences and information, but he needs to be more organized with how he presents material, especially to those without a huge finance background.",
    "Excellent course if you really want to get a handle on the real functioning of the banking system."
