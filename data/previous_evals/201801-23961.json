    "Unfortunately, this course wasn't very useful to my overall education. It's strengths were that the instructor and TF were nice and tried to be helpful. In terms of weaknesses, many of the topics we covered felt somewhat random and didn't necessarily feel like the most important areas of public health. Many of the topics were most relevant to areas of Epidemiology and the course was very skewed to global health topics. I'm doubtful that I will use much of the information covered in the future. Also the structure of the class was somewhat repetitive. We read papers at home, answered questions on those papers, then had an outside presenter present on that topic, then student presenters presented the papers we already had to read.",
    "The weakness of the course is that we have to work with a group for the final grant paper and there is no way by which we can submit team participation scores to the course instructor. I was at a disadvantage of being stuck with the team members who were not motivated at all to work on the proposal and the final presentation. It made everything so challenging for me. Every time we would assign tasks within our group for background reading\/research but the other members would just come and chat and express their non-specific views on the topic. This made me feel so frustrated. I hope Prof Albert can add a qualtrics survey or something for team participation score so that we can let the instructors know if we are having any specific issues with our team. I believe this is extremely important since the final grade is dependent on teamwork.",
    "Topics and presenters were interesting. Structure of the class did not allow for enough discussion, although this would have been a more interesting way to spend the class time. Weekly reading response questions seem unnecessary.",
    "Overall, I would have appreciated more diversity in the speakers. I felt that a few of the speakers, while undoubtedly experts in their respective fields, held somewhat dated views. Notably, one speaker was disrespectful to a student by refusing to learn her name because it was difficult to pronounce. I feel it would be useful to bring in more diverse voices, perhaps at various points in their careers - as an example of this, Nicola Hawley was one of my favorite speakers. Additionally, this was marketed as a course that spanned all fields of public health, but the focus was overwhelmingly biased towards epidemiology. It generally felt as if the invited speakers did not know what they were expected to do other than present a short slide set - were they supposed to go through their discussion questions? Were they intended to go through the student's proposed discussion questions? It was never really clear, and there were several uncomfortable moments of \"what now?\" throughout the course.",
    "The course was well organized with each lecture cover an important public health topic. I really like the course structure that we could hear from guest speakers from different disciplines. Through the challenging project, we could aggeragate what we have learnt into real world problems. However, I feel the workload is a little high that there were too much background reading assignments.",
    "provide a comprehensive view of global disease burden",
    "Course was a good introductory class for students that are just being exposed to Public Health and need an overview. It seemed well suited to the PhD students as it provided a reasonable overview of a host of relevant public health topics. The speakers were very good but the student presentations varied pretty widely. I was surprised at the lack of interpretation and critical thinking from many of the student presentations, especially from the students pursuing their PhD.",
    "This course exposed us to many good articles on interesting topics, and give us great opportunities to practice our presentation skills.",
    "average",
    "Although this course has less relationships with biostatistics students compared with students from other track, we still learn a lot from it. Ko selected every weekly topic carefully and invited experts to give us a talk. Communicating with them directly is very helpful."

    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Professor Ko was helpful when we asked questions about our final project. In terms of weakness, it was sometimes frustrating that he required students to meet with him, but offered very few hours of availability.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Fine",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0While the instructor was obviously very knowledgeable in his field and more broadly in public health, I felt that his expectations for students and assignments were often unclear and vaguely defined. While I appreciated his attempts to engage all members of the class, the instructor had a habit of picking on people from particular departments to answer specific questions related to that field, and if they did not know the answer, acting as if this were a personal failing on their part. He often dominated the discussion for long stretches of time, time which may have been more valuably spent on having the invited guest lead the discussion (which they often seemed surprised that they were expected to do), or having more of a back-and-forth discussion with students.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Albert is a talented and enthusiastic professional. I was enriched by his talks.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Great instructor",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Albert was terrific, very intelligent man with an intellectual humility that made him approachable and open to discussion.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Professor Ko is amiable and gave us great suggestions on presentation skills. He also provided interesting topics, and help us develop our own proposal ideas.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0average",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Ko is a very responsible and supportive professor. He actively encouraged every student talk and participate during the class. He also gave very helpful suggestions on our final project. Without his help, we could not accomplish our project."

   "comments": [
    "This course invites speakers from Yale to discuss global public health topics, with a particular emphasis on topics relevant to Epidemiology. If you are outside the field of Epidemiology or have a particular interest in any topic, you may not find the content of the course helpful. Though the professor and TF were nice, I wouldn't recommend this course to other students unless required to take it.",
    "Hanna was very helpful and responsive.",
    "Average class, not too much work.",
    "I feel that the course is somewhat poorly defined in its goals and as such is difficult to summarize. It is, to me, a series of invited guests and lectures from various epidemiology-focused fields of public health, some more interesting and engaging than others, along with a term project that does not seem to complement the class. It often felt like more of a \"history of public health\" course rather than a \"frontiers\" course. I do not feel that this course is a valuable addition to the PhD curriculum - I think it is more appropriate for MPH students.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who hope to have a general picture of public health. For those with a background in public health, this course might be too basic.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "Course was good for what it was, I prefer classes that allow for a deeper dive into material and the structure of this class is intended to be very topical and cover a lot of areas with relatively little depth.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. This course has engaging activities and a vivid classroom atmosphere."
