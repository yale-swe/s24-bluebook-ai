    "Learned how to engage in chamber music.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of chamber music performance, particularly as a second violinist in a string quartet. I learned how to interact with other members of my quartet, began to develop a quartet sound, and gained both general and more specific knowledge about how to best play the Mozart Dissonance.",
    "How to communicate and make really great music in rehearsal! An amazing way to learn how to give and receive constructive criticism and work with amazing students and faculty",
    "I gained experience playing music in an intimate musical setting with my peers.",
    "Develop ability to think critically about the score and to communicate one's musical ideas to the group. I further developed my collaborative skills, rhythm, intonation, and overall musical maturity. A serious chamber music course that any instrumentalist at Yale should consider auditioning for.",
    "Chamber musicianshiphow to communicate musically, engage with others, prepare a long piece",
    "Further development of musical communication skills by working closely with other musicians, expansion of musicality through coaches' and peers' feedback, increased knowledge of the chamber music repertoire."

   "comments": [
    "This is a wonderful course that's very well organized. The only problem I had this year was that both of my coaches had pretty limited availability, so we often had to have coachings 2 days in a row every 2 weeks instead of once a week (which would have been more useful). It would be great if the coaching schedules were a little more regular\/standardized so that every group got the same amount of support.",
    "Great class! So wonderful to work in chamber groups and work one on one with faculty then be able to come together and listen and comment on other groups progress. The only weakness was sometimes performance class would go over and it was sometimes difficult to sit and listen to six groups in a row.",
    "The meetings where everyone plays for each other and gives advice are so helpful, as you get to perform and work out the movements before the concert and learn by advising others. The course is also extremely well organized.",
    "n\/a",
    "Sometimes it is easy for coachings and scheduling rehearsals to fall through the cracks, but there is not a way that this could be improved by the instructor, I think.",
    "Good feedback and coaching throughout the semester.",
    "I think this course is very well organized and taught! I particularly enjoyed the coachings and comments in studio class. I don't have any ideas for improvement.",
    "The studio classes are often great performance opportunities I wish there were guest coaches sometimes that could provide different perspectives and valuable feedback.",
    "Strong all around! Great coaches, fun studio classes, really excellent instruction",
    "Wonderful coaching and feedback during studio classes, a great way to connect both musically and personally with musicians at Yale. A good balance between group-directed rehearsal time and coachings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "Yes. If you are musician and have extensive chamber music background, then yes.",
    "This is an amazing class well-organized, exciting, and valuable.",
    "Taking this class is something that I don't regret - however, this class is way more than a 0.5 credit should be. Yes you \"only\" have your 2 hours of rehearsal, 1 hour of coaching, and \"bi-weekly\" studio class for 1.5 hours, but beyond that, it's imperative to think about the hours of practice put in for preparation of all these things. While I am personally willing to put in all that time because I enjoy chamber music a lot, this semester was a little disappointing in part because of the coaches assigned to my group. I greatly appreciated their enthusiasm and kind words, but my group and I found ourselves feeling like we didn't improve much from the beginning of the semester until the final concert. It was really disappointing, disheartening, and also de-motivating in this way, and although I understand that the coaches invest a lot of time into their groups, it would be really helpful if the coaches could be more articulate in their feedback and provide advice that can help make things better, rather than trying to fix basic, foundational skills that frankly an undergrad student not majoring in music doesn't have the time for. This is not to say that all of the coaches are unhelpful - my past experiences with some of the other coaches have really been amazing. But this leads me to also express discontent that some groups are able to request certain coaches\/repertoire and are given priority, while others are not given the same treatment. This class has probably given me more ups than downs per say, but there have been times where I have felt that this class is unfair and biased at times, and the workload is something one should be aware of before auditioning for this class.",
    "yes, if you want to play chamber music",
    "Yes, definitely. This is an amazing class for anyone interested in chamber music.",
    "Yes. It was fun and informative for those who like chamber music.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student with a passion for chamber music!",
    "100% would recommend if you like chamber music!",
    "I would recommend this class to any musician interested in exploring chamber music literature and meeting other musicians with similar interests.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes. Coaches are amazing and chamber music is some of the most rewarding and powerful music one could study,",
    "I recommend this to any serious musician at Yaleit will undoubtedly challenge you!"
