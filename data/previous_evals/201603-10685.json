   "comments": [
    "The detailed feedback from the professor and one-on-one meetings to discuss the feedback helped me understand the requirements and expectations from an assignment and develop my writing skills both in terms of context and structure. The material we studied in class was interesting and helpful in understanding the chronological development of the film industry. I also believe that the movies we watched for the class were well chosen classics and added to my general cultural knowledge.",
    "I learnt how to write and also how to apply film theory to my film analyses.",
    "I increased my knowledge of how to clearly express my ideas and support them.",
    "I learned to write at a college-level and was challenged.",
    "I learned how to make an argument and the importance of a solid position.",
    "I feel like my writing skills have greatly improved over this semester in this course. I learned better ways to conduct research and how to properly formulate my disparate ideas in a witty, concise, and organized way. My film analysis skills also went up. Coming home for winter break, I've gone to the movies a few times already and each time I can clearly see my film studies education coming into play. It is a joy to be able to recognize these new details and figure out what they mean.",
    "I developed my knowledge for identifying techniques in filmmaking. Additionally, I am now more curious as to intention of the director\/corporation of the film.",
    "Critical thinking skills and argumentation and developing my own thoughts in an essay"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The professor was passionate about the material we covered in class, and very interested in teaching and being in conversation with the students to hear their perspectives. The material is interesting if you like watching movies and want to learn about the history, it gets even more fun once you start discussing contemporary movies. Weaknesses: The readings were particularly difficult, even for people with a background on the topic, let alone us students. I feel like because of the difficulty of the readings it was hard to have a discussion in class and the information we read about are not as well grounded as it could have been with more clear material.",
    "Strength: covered a lot of film theory and films that I would not have otherwise seen or appreciated Weakness: some of the readings were too long",
    "Overall, the course was run very well.",
    "The class could talk more about what we could write about and how.",
    "It was very good. Favourite class",
    "This course has engaging reading, fun class discussions, and interesting prompts to write about. Basically, I loved everything about this course. There were a few times when class readings came in a bit late, but we were able to squeeze in time to complete the assignments.",
    "The strengths of this course are the in-depth anaylsis\/discussion regarding films and readings for the course. By examining others' writing style we were able to address strengths and weaknesses in their arguments so that we may take them into consideration in our writing.",
    "Some of the readings were dense, but most had interesting topics"

   "comments": [
    "If they are interested in movies, want to have a general sense of how the industry developed and willing to read -a lot- about it, it is an enjoyable class. I am glad that I chose this topic for my writing class. Jordan is very encouraging and his passion for the subject really helps keeping up the dynamic of the class.",
    "Yes, this course taught me the useful skill of how to write an academic paper while engaging my interests in film studies.",
    "Interesting material and well taught.",
    "Yes I would. It is well taught and Jordan is always available.",
    "Yes the teacher is awesome and does a great job at helping to learn.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!!!! Especially if the student has an interest in film, this course will offer so many new tools with which to evaluate the cinematic world around them. It has changed my life, to what degree I have yet to see. I'd consider this one of the best courses I'll probably take as an undergrad.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as the professir was very personable and took ample time to provide feedback and guidance on writing, including additional office hour appointments. The class was intriguing and the reading was reasonable.",
    "Yes, definitely. The professor is engaging and the topic of film is interesting"
