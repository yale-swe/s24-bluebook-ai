   "comments": [
    "This course was such a learning experience--I've learned so much about the development and history of empire (British and French focused), cities and their architecture, the governing bodies of cities, and the nexus between cities and empire--how they intersect and speak to one another, but also how they may contradict. I've learned so much about so many different cities around the world that I've now added to my travel bucket list because they all seem so beautiful and magical, and I've come away with a more nuanced perspective of imperial and colonial cities, and how that may dictate their place in the world today.",
    "I have expanded the ways in which I think about empire and urbanism and how those two distinct concepts overlap and interact throughout history. I have a better understanding of a number of specific case studies from various points in history, as well as the broader conceptual understanding of empire's impact on cities and cities' impact on empire.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Freeform in so many ways--different themes, different cities, different histories covered every week; great professors (story time with Professors Kennedy and Gitlin is simply a treat); amazing and interesting readings Weaknesses: Would definitely want to learn more about cities and empire and the military; as well as maybe a little more on decolonization and postcolonialism",
    "I quite liked the classs experimental naturethe case studies and time periods covered were exciting for their breadth and often led to opportunities for unusual comparisons. During the last class, we discussed the possibility of integrating military and diplomatic history more directly, as common themes running through most, if not all, the cities covered, and I think addressing the geopolitics of empire from both military and diplomatic perspectives would help assemble the disparate case studies into a more coherent history. With respect to readings, I appreciated the weekly forays into different cities and wouldnt recommend substituting those more specific articles for more general ones. But I would recommend adding some reading material, particularly in the first half of the course. Introducing foundational theoretical texts on both imperialism and architecture\/urban history would help lay the groundwork for the discussion and comparison of specific cities throughout the whole of the semester. I think the class this semester would have benefited from general readings on empire and urban studies, since everyone seemed to be much more familiar with one over the otherI could have used more readings on how to read and understand architectural history, for example, as that was the area I was less comfortable with (the cities part, I suppose, of Cities of Empire). That being said, the final paper offered the opportunity to catch up on those aspects that I was less familiar with, and the opportunity to pursue a city in depth, using the example set by the discussions of other cities all semester, was a wonderfully rewarding way to conclude the class!",
    "I think this class just had many of the markers of a class being taught for the first time in terms of how Professors Kennedy and Gitlin worked out the kinks as we went along. The readings were fascinating and our discussions were interesting and wide-ranging, but I think the course could have used some broad themes that threaded the weeks together.",
    "I liked the powerpoints and the teacher led discussions. I wish there was a bit more historical information than theorizing about the concept of cities. I would like more stories and interesting situations from which to derive greater thoughts. Other students in the class are very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student--especially if they are interested in empires, cities, urban studies, decolonization, etc.--because this course carries all of that packed into it, and really opens your eyes to a new way of analyzing and looking at these topics. Professor Kennedy and Professor Gitlin are two AMAZING professors, and no class is ever uninteresting. We jump through so many different cities and time periods, all connected through themes, and it's amazing to make these temporal and spacial connections as we build a pathway towards understanding cities and empire.",
    "This was kind of a wacky class but I liked it overall. The readings were usually quite interesting (although there are quite a lot of them) and our class discussions were wide-ranging. I think if this class is taught again in the future Professors Gitlin and Kennedy will have worked out some of the kinks from it being taught for the first time this semester and will hopefully structure it a little bit more. It was never boring.",
    "yes, if you like the professors (who are very dedicated and interesting, and leaders in their fields). The subject will be more of a historiography than a specific timeline of events and places. The workload is light and only consists of an essay at the end, besides for weekly readings. Kennedy and Gitlin are fantastic and it is absolutely worth taking a class with them"
