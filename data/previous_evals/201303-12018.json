   "comments": [
    "For someone new to creative writing, or for someone who has always enjoyed it but has never set aside enough time to work extensively, I would definitely recommend this course. It's a new one, so it's still under construction in some ways, but seeing as it's not a major time commitment AND it's enjoyable, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this course. All the professors are wonderful-- I had shopped professor Deming's section at the start of the semester and he was great. Professor Crowley is wonderful, especially with fiction, so if fiction is your favorite genre, definitely take it with home. Work load is minimal-- lots of great readings that I would do in my free time, and assignments that are fun. You get the pick the genre in which you are workshopped, and you learn a lot from other students in the class.The guest lectures definitely enhanced the experience-- it gave the course a good variety in its formatting, and also allowed students to ask questions of professional writers. Take this class!",
    "English 123 gives a broad overview of fiction, poetry, and drama writing. The class, in my experience, was quite enjoyable and also quite manageable. You will learn mostly through critique of your writing. The class culminates in a portfolio instead of a final exam, which is nice. Each unit does seem rather brief, though. Nonetheless, if you can fit it in your schedule, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Not Prof. Crowley's section, at least. The class was badly organized, and I didn't get very much out of it -- I'm certainly not a better writer than I was in August. A waste of time.",
    "Take this class! The peer-editing style is great for improving your writing!",
    "It's a great class: low stress, fun, even a bit cathartic at times. I would definitely take it, although beware: it's not a writing credit. The grading is holistic and depends on how well your pieces come off to the class. You do get to revise them before you receive the final grade, which is nice. If you want to take this class, I suggest taking it with Professor Crowley, since his section seemed the most laid back, and his system of workshopping everything we wrote was very very helpful. He also is very lenient on grading. Take it if you have an extra class to spare.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to become a better creative writer but doesn't yet have the training or confidence to take more advanced courses.",
    "Take it! I loved it!",
    "Good course - could be improved by using some of the in-class time for writing exercises. The seminar part of the class (for Crowley's section, at least) was almost entirely workshops, so beware. Prof Crowley is great. He is a fiction writer, but I didn't sense that the class was biased toward any particular form, and he was frank about where his expertise\/interests lay. He is very eager to meet with students and very helpful if you choose to see him at office hours. WARNING: This will not improve your \"skills\" as a creative writer - it's not \"rigorous.\" It will give you a sense of whether you find creative writing within an academic framework a fulfilling exercise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in fiction, regardless of experience. If you have written a lot of fiction before, you will still learn something from this class, and if you have not, it provides a great way to build a body of work. I would definitely recommend professor Crowley! He is funny, nice and extremely helpful.",
    "A wonderful introduction to creative writing in a variety of genres. Lectures on fiction, poetry, and drama are followed by a string of assignments that build on one another. A wonderful chance to write and begin to amass a portfolio. Classes are generally spent in critiquing one another's work, which is fun and very helpful.",
    "A three part course on fiction, poetry and drama that assumes no prior experience. You get what you give, in terms of improvement- there is so much to learn from so many points of view, from the lecturers, guest speakers, and classmates. A fantastic course for any level writer that I would highly recommend."
