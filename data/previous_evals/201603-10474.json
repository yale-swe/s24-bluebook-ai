   "comments": [
    "You will learn a myriad of reactions that bring full circle all concepts taught in Orgo1. You will learn what makes a certain compound more reactive than other. The beauty that comes with this course is being able to look at a random organic molecule and have some idea of what it will do next.",
    "I developed extensive knowledge of organic chemistry, building nicely on the material taught in Organic Chemistry I. I also developed extensive problem solving skills, which are required to answer many of the more complex questions on exams, designed to test understand of broader themes and common mechanisms.",
    "!This is the first time that I got the end of a class and never figured out how to succeed in it, not even for the final. I tried so many different strategies and approaches for understanding this material, and I could not get it in my head. I have never tried so hard and been so frustrated by an academic challenge - it truly made me feel stupid. The only thing I can say is that I should have allowed even more time for learning HOW to learn the material. If there's one thing I learned from this course, it's that you must allow more time for it in your schedule (really, take fewer credits if you're taking this class), be persistent with the professor and TA, and get a tutor right off the bat if you're at all struggling. I honestly felt so defeated by this class. I hope that students who read this will be able to have a positive and rewarding experience learning the truly beautiful material taught in this class because they heeded my advice to not underestimate it.",
    "I learned how to think both backwards and forwards - how to from a particular point\/subject matter and work towards the answer, as well as how to begin with the answer and move towards the original idea.",
    "I got an enormous amount out of this class. At a very basic level, it is a puzzle-solving exercise, extended through an enormous amount of material. I learned how electrons move in great depth, and understand the consequences of chemical principles such as resonance, electronegativity, and acidity\/basicity in a way that now can help me predict reactions.",
    "This course gave me an excellent foundation for organic chemistry. We learned about many reactions, how they're related to each other, how to use them to synthesize complex compounds, and understood why reactions proceed the way they do.",
    "Concepts of organic chemistry reactivity and structure, and a whole of reactions that one can use to synthesize complex organic molecules from simpler ones.",
    "It is a lot of organic chemistry, and I learned a fraction of it, which was still a ton. But there was no way I was ever going to be able to shove all of it into my tiny undergraduate pre-med (maybe?) human brain.",
    "A lot of organic chemistry reactions",
    "This course taught me a lot of new chemical reactions that expanded the versatility of my knowledge of chemistry. Because of these new possibilities, organic syntheses began to resemble problems to be solved by interconnected patterns. I think this class effectively captures a most interesting aspect of chemistry: that simple rules and observations cumulatively produce complicated systems and ideas.",
    "I reinforced my abilities not only to memorize material but to truly understand it. I was forced to improve my understanding of the material to not only predict what would occur if something occurred but also to rationalize why it would occur or not. I also learned how to think in a more backwards way. While sometimes going from the product all the way to the reactant was difficult, I found it very helpful to at least attempt it both forward and back and the attempts usually lent some insight as to what lied in between.",
    "I definitely gained a greater understanding of the many mechanisms of organic chemistry, how they overlap and intertwine to produce various compounds. It definitely took a lot of time to invest in studying the large mass of information but it definitely forced me to think more critically and quickly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Alanna is the BEST!",
    "The strengths of this course are certainly the teaching staff (Prof. Schepartz and both TAs), who were obviously interested and very engaged with students and who demonstrated a strong desire for all students to succeed. The course itself is very difficult and often stressful; however, this is likely to be an attribute of the course regardless of the professor, and is likely due to the incredible volume that must be covered in this semester.",
    "This class goes incredibly fast. If it is truly necessary to cover as much material as we do, I understand - but in that case, it would be immensely helpful if the reactions\/mechanisms were presented in a way that made it clearer which ones we had to know; I personally spent a huge time with the textbook trying to cement\/fill the in the blanks from the lecture, and was never clear on what we were expected to know or not. The answer keys are very vague, and would be much more helpful if they included some sort of indication about what kind of reaction\/mechanism a question indicates, for study\/reference purposes. It was nice to have quizzes halfway through each test unit, but it is not necessary to have a \"midterm\" on the last day of classes. Many other classes will either have 3 midterms and a cumulative final with the 4th midterm's material included on the final, or the final with essentially be the 4th midterm. Psets were extremely long to the point of not being helpful- they would much better serve students if they were composed more of quiz\/test-like questions.",
    "This course taught me how to actually understand Organic Chemistry. In Orgo 1, I learned how to think about molecules and their effect on our lives. However, in this course I actually gained a fundamental understanding of why atoms and molecules cause processes to occur the way that they do. It's a great course.",
    "This course is one that is often feared, and unfortunately, it was feared by myself and most of my classmates at the beginning of the semester, and likely throughout. It has an enormous amount of work, not from an assigned perspective (the p-sets feel a little long, but I'll accept that some of the redundancies are built in to help facilitate learning or getting accustomed to material), but simply from the point of view of studying for the exams. The class builds upon itself incredibly well, thematically, as I found when studying for the final. I wrote out review notes, summaries, of each chapter, starting at the end of the semester's work and going to the beginning, and I found that most of what I learned in September, what I had struggled with in the early days, came back naturally, and was (for the most part) a clear building block for what would happen later in the course. The difficulty lies both in this thematic increase, which is arduous but necessary for the course and incredibly rewarding, and also in the pure volume of reactions that are necessary to learn. However, I also recognize that a breadth of reagents are necessary for understanding the topics, and that synthesis questions require a broad approach and an ability to go in many directions at once. If it were possible to reduce these in some manner, it would make life easier for the students who take it, but it might just have to remain one of those courses from which any insight necessitates a lot of hard work.",
    "Strengths: extremely organized notes and lecture, challenging but fair exams, relevant homework problems Weaknesses: office hours were inconveniently timed and located",
    "As organic chemistry is expected to be, CHEM 221 was not an easy journey. But learning to develop a bank of reactions, understand what made certain reactions favorable or unfavorable, and apply them to the synthesis of complex molecules turned out to be an interesting, new way of thinking that I've come to appreciate (now that I'm done with the class). But despite the innate difficulty of an organic chemistry class, Professor Schepartz kept it alive with her enthusiasm for the subject as well as her concrete and precise lecturing. Combined with textbook reading, practice problems, and the knowledgeable TAs, I believe that CHEM 221 is among the least painful organic chemistry courses out there--and that's saying a lot! (I did enjoy the class very much.)",
    "Strength - straightforward teaching, although fast-paced. The material taught in class follows the book closely so easy it was easy to find clarification for anything that is confusing. It was a pretty good class, though hard. Weakness - the class is sooo time intensive and there is so much memorization involved it almost feels like the people who do well are also the ones who have time to dedicate hours to just studying for this class every day. For others who have other difficult classes and a lot of other commitments, unless they are prodigies they will have to accept a lower grade just because there just isn't enough time. There was one time when I had 3 midterm exams on the same day (a Friday), and we didn't finish learning material for the orgo exam until the Wednesday before the exam, so I knew my at least one of my exam grades was going to take a hit.",
    "This course is extremely fair in that everything needed for the quizzes and exams is covered in detail in class and well supported in the numerous practice examples. Professor Schepartz makes good use of class time to explain new concepts, and the textbook is very useful if read before lecture. There are a lot of assessments in this class, which can be a tad overwhelming at times, but they do a good job of breaking up a lot of material into manageable portions; therefore, I would not necessarily recommend changing the scheduling.",
    "The strength of the courses included ample opportunities for practice and the emphasis on homework completion helped to maintain stress levels down. Some areas for improvement were the numerous amount of examinations. In total it was 4 quizzes and 4 mid-terms with a final. However, I tended to study for each quiz as if it were a mid-term and this intensity was hard to maintain especially towards the end of the course. Perhaps it would have been better to reduce the number of quizzes and exams by one."

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT! I would even audit this class just to truly sit and watch how Prof. Schepartz beautifully explains life molecules.",
    "If you're planning taking this class, the chances are you have to take it, and aren't taking it just for fun. It is definitely much more material than Orgo I, however, it doesn't get any more conceptually difficult. Prepare to work hard and study a lot. If you do have to take it though, definitely take it with Schepartz: her love of chemistry shows through in her teaching, which makes lectures much more bearable.",
    "This class is SO hard. But possible, if you truly allow the time for it, and if you do, the material is really quite exciting. Take no more than 4 credits, including this class, if you have an average extracurricular workload. Be ready to take fast notes.",
    "I loved this course. It's hard but if you do the work, engage with the material, and listen closely in class, it's very manageable. It's necessary cumulative and constant review of the material is necessary but this also shows how different processes work together.",
    "Absolutely take this. Or, because I'm not going to convince anyone who doesn't already have to do so, if you are taking this, try to enjoy it. I got so much out of this class, and really feel that I understand chemical patterns better for it. I took it concurrently with the MB&B Biochemistry, and the crossover between the two helped immensely with my understanding of biological principles and the reasoning behind certain reactions or interactions. It's a lot of work. You know this, and everyone who has taken it has told you so. Stay on top of the material, try to spend some time after each class going through your notes, and don't just cram for exams. Every class says this, but it's really the only way to make this one work if it doesn't come easily to you. Still, it's incredibly worthwhile at the end, and the material is fascinating if you let go of the fear that's associated with the class.",
    "If you're reading this you probably need to take this class, but if you can take it with Schepartz, definitely go for it. She is an incredible professor with extremely well organized lectures and notes. The exams were usually the perfect level of challenging - you will not know the answer at first glance but they're not impossible. The course is a lot of work, with weekly psets (graded for completion only), 4 quizzes, 4 midterms, and a final, but it is manageable if you study the material as you go and you pay attention in class.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is a requirement.",
    "Schepartz is a fine instructor, and the material is often much more interesting than in first semester organic chemistry. Here's the question: are you ready to really make this lecture about a third of all of your waking existence? If you do not have the time or energy to give this material what it demands of you, then you are, as I was, in for a pretty painful semester.",
    "I recommend it if you have to take it or if you really really enjoyed 1st semester organic chemistry. The material is interesting and if you like organic chemistry in general, it is the same fun electron-pushing stuff. There is just so so so much material to memorize (so much more than 1st semester) and the exam questions are more challenging in my opinion because the material builds on the previous stuff and you are expected to know everything. At least homework is graded on completion so that helps.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, perhaps with the precaution that this course is most enjoyable and most rewarding when one can put quite a bit of time into it. It is a good idea to always read the relevant chapters in the book before coming to lecture as well as to do all of the provided practice and homework problems. The material here is well explained and interesting, but its sheer volume requires that one stay ahead."
