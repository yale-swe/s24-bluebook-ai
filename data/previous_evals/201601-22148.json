    "TAKE IT!!! Best class this semester.",
    "Highly recommend! This class has a distinct lecture format where an expert in an area of ASD speaks each week with really interesting insight.",
    "Take it if you're even vaguely interested in autism; you'll learn so much about it.",
    "This class really isn't a seminar, but a small lecture class where you get to ask a lot of questions. You get mostly guest speakers who are experts in their respective fields of autism care\/research, so that was awesome. We also had guest speakers for whom autism was personally in their lives as someone with the disorder or a family member\/caretaker of someone with it. Also, the practicum placements were the best part about the class. They were 3hrs\/week of going to an school or residential care facility for people with autism, and I personally found my experience very rewarding. In all, the class had really interesting lectures, there was no other work besides the internship and the final paper, and the internship was really rewarding. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about autism in detail. The professors are true experts and all the guest lecturers are interesting. The practicum experience is simply one of a kind and you will become a better person from it. I highly recommend this class for a not too crazy work load but a very fulfilling experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The practicum is such an incredible, eye-opening, unique experience. You also get to hear from many guest lecturers who are experts in the field\/have had experience with autism themselves. It does take quite a bit of time if you choose to go to Benhaven (~30 minutes each way), but it's extremely rewarding. Dr. Volkmar is also wonderful.",
    "This seminar is really a lecture. The only reason I'd suggest taking it rather than just doing the readings on your own is the placement. Every student is assigned to work with people with autism in the community - in a school for children with autism, a residential program, or the like. The placements teach you so much more about what it's like to interact with children and adults with autism and how this disorder affects so many people than any class ever could. It's great that the professor (Dr. Volkmar) is so highly regarded in his field, but the truth is that he only leads a couple of the classes. The rest are lectures by other leading psychologists in autism research. It's interesting stuff, but you get so much more out of the placement than the class itself.",
    "Definitely take this class. The long walk is no excuse - the material is so interesting and the speakers are great. Professor Volkmar puts so much care into the class, and the speakers he brings in provide such a broad base of understanding about the multifaceted impact of autism. Getting to work with kids on the spectrum was also a fantastic experience (one I hope to continue). It's also very little work outside of the internship (just one big paper at the end), so you really get to learn just for the sake of learning the material throughout most of the semester.",
    "A really really great course that gives you actual experience working with autistic people!",
    "Super interesting and engaging class- the course works well because you are not responsible for the material on tests, but you learn it because it's interesting! Nice for a non-stressful, enjoyable class. and the practicum is amazing!"
