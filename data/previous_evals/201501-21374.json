   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, although as a lot of past reviews warned, it's very heavy on theory. If you're primarily drawn to the pop culture aspect of it, just be aware that there is very little pop culture. This course focuses mostly on art and classical music. The discussion, however, is pretty interesting, and it's not a ton of work during the week, so it was a good seminar to take for someone who's a little bit afraid of seminars (but is willing to put in the work and struggle at times to understand the theory-heavy readings). Eyerman is great, and he's super flexible with deadlines and assignments. He let us choose whether we wanted to have reading responses throughout the semester or have the paper at the end be worth most of our grade (we picked the reading responses). I think this class would be especially worthwhile for someone with an art or music background, but if you're interested and willing to participate in discussion, it isn't super necessary.",
    "I would recommend SOCY 591 for anyone with a modicum of interest in the arts or in popular culture, or who just wants to engage with culture in general.",
    "Definitely recommend the course- great professor with a particular interest in this extremely rich area of sociological thought and a syllabus that translates into a very fulfilling seminar experience in class every week.",
    "As an undergrad taking this course, I was very much intimidated at first. However, the professor was really good at drawing out responses from everyone and facilitating discussion. I didn't expect it to be so theory focused. I would recommend looking at the syllabus and seeing if the readings interest you before committing. Overall, it was not a bad experience but I didn't get as much out of the class in terms of learning about the current organization of the arts. Rather, I learned a lot about the history of art criticism and different theories of examining art, which is valuable, but not what I thought I signed up for."
