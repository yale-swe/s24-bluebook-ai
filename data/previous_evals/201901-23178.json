   "comments": [
    "Perhaps better direction. At times, we were unsure of what was going on because the Ambassador was not clear.",
    "The course covered a lot of different types of crises and we had some great guest practitioners as well! The beginning of the course felt much more structured than the second half, however, and toward the end it often felt like there wasn't clear direction of what was going on in the class based on the syllabus and communication from the professor.",
    "Clearer guidelines when it comes to research papers",
    "Strengths: Engaging, diverse, exciting, filled with practitioner's advice Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "While this course was interesting and there was a lot of student engagement, I think a lot of the students' learning focused heavily on the student group presentations, student-created simulations, and guest speakers. I took the class hoping to learn directly from Amb. Thomas's experiences, and I think the classes earlier in the semester were more what I expected -- him giving an overview of a crisis and his experience about it and allowing us to ask questions. I think there needs to be fewer student presentations and a greater lecture or discussion component, which I think is missing from this class.",
    "amazing instructor! With an in-depth knowledge of issues and their complexities"

    "Yes, given that they have a specific interest in humanitarian\/environment crisis response and enjoy the challenge of engaging with the material outside of regular assignments.",
    "Yes Ambassador Thomas' experience is worth being shared.",
    "Yes! It has been a wonderful experience learning from Ambassador Thomas. He is warm and funny, and will give you a firsthand look of what it is like to be a State Dept. bureaucrat.",
    "I think the course needs to be restructured to address my earlier concerns. There needs to be a greater focus on the professor, not the students.",
