   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about anxiety disorders, eating disorders and abnormalities, and Autism Spectrum Disorder in this course.",
    "Psyc literature babble\/jargon",
    "I learned how to conduct an independent literature review, analyze original data, and write scientifically.",
    "I developed research and writing skills and an extensive knowledge of my thesis topic.",
    "I gained valuable experience with the process of designing and executing developmental research. I will be beginning a Ph.D program in the fall, and this year-long research experience helped me prepare for that training process.",
    "I feel like I really learned a lot of the ropes of doing an independent research project - down to how to frame the research questions, how to format the methods\/results sections and what sorts of ideas to focus on in the discussion. I've learned how to more effectively use SPSS and gained exposure to BVA for EEG analysis through this project, both of which are highly valuable skills that will surely help me in the years to come. Finally, I learned that research can sometimes be frustrating and you don't always get the results you want, and sometimes the results don't even quite make sense - but that is the nature of academia, and if I'm going to pursue graduate studies, I had better get used to it!",
    "As for most undergraduates who undergo research during their time at Yale, the hands-on process is incredibly enlightening and valuable, especially when paired with an accessible and astute adviser.",
    "I learned a lot more about how to do comparative cognition research with dogs. I developed an ability to think more critically and logically about my research methodology, which has actually poured into a lot of different aspects of my Yale career. I also found myself really considering research in the future after being under Laurie Santos' guidance - she taught me a lot about how someone can both be an intellectual and care so much about their work while also being a human and care about the wellbeing of their students.",
    "I learned how to conduct fMRI research and write a substantial research paper with a literature review in my thesis.",
    "I learned how to develop realistic research analysis plans for a two-semester long project, and learned to work with the help of graduate students and lab mentors in the lab.",
    "I developed my own research and gained a lot of insight about psychology. It was extremely rewarding.",
    "I learned a lot about developing and conducting a large scale research project in psychology! I also learned a lot about statistical analysis!",
    "When I joined my lab, I was pretty certain of pursuing medical school. Working on my senior thesis in the Holmes Lab has taught me how to think about a research question critically, how to run and collect data from human subjects, and how to write a well-organized scientific paper. My graduate student and I read through a few papers together for me to gain a conceptual understanding of this research. My research question could be answered by using data from the study that my graduate student mentor was running, and I had a good balance of guidance and independence in my analyses. Through writing a thesis-length literature review my first semester of PSYC 499, I was able to develop a strong conceptual understanding of my project. I also established the angle that I wanted to approach this research and learned a lot about what it meant to develop a research question and methods to answer this question. My final research paper for my second semester of PSYC 499 was extremely rewarding to write, as I was able to gain extensive practice in using R for my statistical analyses and manipulate my data. The lab was very supportive and is the reason why I will be continuing with research during my gap years and why Im strongly considering pursuing graduate school.",
    "This course definitely helped me develop my scientific writing and quantitative analysis skills. It helped me gain a better understanding of the overall research process, from conducting projects to forming theories on the data."

   "comments": [
    "Nothing I can think of can be improved. This course was incredible!",
    "eh",
    "The strengths and weaknesses are quite self-explanatory. Writing a thesis is a lot of hard work, but what you put in is what you get out of it.",
    "The Senior Essay experience depends entirely on the quality of the mentor relationship. I received a lot of really crucial support from my mentor, which made the process go smoothly!",
    "I really liked how much hands-on mentoring I got from my grad student advisor, Ema, throughout the whole process - it would not have at all been possible without her. Furthermore, Prof. Joormann was also very supportive throughout the process and helped me with proofreading the introduction.",
    "Strengths: It allowed me an opportunity to build my research abilities, learn how to write a full research paper, and how to really work in a lab setting where I had autonomy over my own project. Also, learning how to collaborate and do behavioral coding was awesome! Weaknesses: I think how great this course is really depends on your advisor. I was very fortunate to be with Laurie Santos, because she cares so deeply about her research and her students and wants to see them succeed - I can't say enough good things about her. However, I know that this is not the case for everyone in these courses, so I would highly advise trying to pick an advisor you get along with.",
    "The course is entirely independent and so being able to conduct my own research in conjunction with my supervisor was challenging and rewarding.",
    "The major strength is that the lab I worked in was very organized and was very clear in the way it provided learning opportunities for research assistants. The grad students are very caring and understanding of undergraduate students' level of understanding, and they provide a main source of growth for the students.",
    "I think it's great the amount of freedom you have in the course, but a way to improve the course would be to have more peer mentorship from a student who did their senior project already.",
    "I felt that I had a perfect balance between guidance and independence. My PI and graduate student mentor and I developed my research question together, and I gained experience with data collection and analysis. I wish that I could have learned about the research that my fellow psychology majors were conducting, and practicing presenting to each other would have been a wonderful experience."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I absolutely would. Getting the opportunity to carry out research during my time here at Yale is something that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I see myself working with individuals with Autism in the future because of this course.",
    "what",
    "Make sure to select an advisor that will invest the time and effort into helping you craft your project. Without my advisor's help, I would not have been able to produce as polished a final product as I wanted.",
    "Yes! If you plan to do any kind of formal research in the future, this is a wonderful experience.",
    "If you're a psych major, well, then, you have to do it. Choose carefully who you decide to work with for your thesis. My lab was very supportive of me, which made things a lot easier and less stressful than they could have been. Nothing wrong with switching to a different advisor than one you've been working under in past years, either.",
    "Highly recommended! Research experience is valuable, particularly if you are considering grad school. Remember, though, that the quality of your experience in 499 depends on two factors: your interest in the research topic, and your thesis adviser. And if you have to choose between favoring the former or the latter, always go with the latter. Because if you're taking this course, it's because you're a senior Psychology major and you have at least a basic level of interest in Psych research, regardless of the field, and your relationship with your thesis adviser will make or break your experience. Yes, you'll create a polished finish result either way, but for most undergraduate research, the journey and what you learn during the research and write-up process are just as important as the finish product. Good luck!",
    "If you have a vague interest in research, it's definitely worth a shot for at least a semester. Definitely find a good advisor that you click with and whose research interests you, and try to work in a lab before you sign up for this course. It's definitely the course that I learned the most life applicable skills from, and I couldn't have asked for a better academic experience in my senior year.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, definitely do your senior thesis as a research project!",
    "I recommend choosing your lab carefully and look for labs where there is a strong culture of mentorship and allows you to have some independence over your research. When I joined my lab, I was pretty certain of pursuing medical school and I leave strong considering graduate school. Working on my senior thesis in the Holmes Lab has taught me how to think about a research question critically, how to run and collect data from human subjects, and how to write a well-organized scientific paper.
