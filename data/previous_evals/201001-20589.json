    "I would highly recommend this class to other students; summary: close-readings of Dinesen and Sebald.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. The way Professor Jacobs intertwines ethics and literature through close-reading has influenced my reading and even some of my papers for other classes.Close-reading, exclusively - perhaps slightly too exclusively, though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. For anyone interested in Sebald and Dinesen, this course would help open up the world of their work. Dr. Jacobs is an excellent guide through their often tedious worlds.",
    "I would recommend the course, definitely. I'm not quite certain how to summarize it; in some ways it was quite complex but never confusing.",
    "Egoistically speaking, I wouldn't recommend the course to too many others. Jacobs is an engaging teacher with whom discussions are of course especially fruitful, if the course is not too big."

    "This course taught me a lot about literature-reading-skills; it was one of the first courses I've ever took on 20th century writers, I therefore learned a lot; I am sure the knowlefge of Sebald's 'nets' enriched also my further research",
    "The class influenced my way of reading."
