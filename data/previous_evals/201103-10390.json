   "comments": [
    "This course investigates practical alternative energy sources, particularly solar energy. Yes, I would recommend this course -- especially if you are interested in researching energy and\/or chemistry that relates to the environment.",
    "Chem 505 is a course which is meant as an introduction to alternative energy technologies, specifically solar energy (solar cells, solar fuels). Each unit had a different focus, but generally had something to do with each professor's research area. 3 midterms, 1 paper, no final. I would highly recommend to any student wanting to learn more about solar energy technologies.",
    "Chemistry 505a was a good general introduction to alternative energy chemisty with specifics in the areas of DSSCs, Computational modeling, and physical methods. \u00a0Some parts of the course were more general than what you would expect from a graduate level chemistry course, but it was an overall good experience and I feel like the course taught me a lot.",
    "Alternative Energy was an interesting course, which started with a one-month general overview of the energy industry and global warming perspective and then proceeded into focusing on dye-sensitized solar cells (organic solar cells). I took it as an undergraduate electrical engineering major, interested in the alternative energy field, and was still able to follow the material, though had to catch up on my own with the chemistry. The workload is manageable and most of the assignments are not graded. Be ready for completely different teaching and testing approaches, as it all varies with the professors. The material is also a bit fragmented at times, but I enjoyed the course overall.",
    "This course should be considered a basic introduction--the best wayto get something out of the class is to ask questions and do outside reading. I would recommend it to those who want to better understand why alternative energy has become such a hot topic."

   "comments": [
    "I am mainly interested in chemistry that relates to the environment (alternative energy, bioremediation, biogeochemistry, etc.). Although I may not do research specifically on energy, I think it's important to know how different renewable energy sources are obtained and how they affect the environment.",
    "This course provided a good overview of the different ways in which one can approach research into alternative energy solutions using the chemistry field.",
    "As a non-chemistry major, I found the course interesting and rather rigorous. My previous knowledge of semiconductors and PV cells was useful and I used this opportunity to learn more about a whole new perspective in terms of organic solar cells and the science behind them. The bio-mimetic approach that some of the research was based on was really intriguing and provided a new perspective, as most of my previous courses were rather math- and physics-based."
