    "In terms of knowledge, I learned graph theory through eigenvalues and matrices. More valuable than the contents, this course taught me diverse ways of problem solving. The problems in the homework allow me to try different approaches and train my character to be more resilient in the face of adversity. Overall, the abstract and hard material made me more familiar and methodical when approaching problems I cannot solve quickly.",

    "The course is very well organized, the material is very interesting and everything related to this course works very well. I don't see an obvious way how the class could be improved. The only \"weakness\" is that the psets require a lot of work, but they are very helpful.",
    "lectures, notes are super helpful. I don't see how it can be improved.",
    "The course is very challenging and definitely forces students to reason about graphs by their spectra from the first pset. The lectures were very easy to listen to, however I would've liked to have gotten more examples of concepts rather than specific proofs, especially later on in the semester. While Prof. Spielman made the proofs very interesting and easy to understand in class, often times it felt like they were proofs that could be understood in written form, and the lectures could have more examples in them (like the Jupyter notebook examples).",
    "The strength of the course is the rigor provided by the homework assignments. They let students think through each of the questions carefully and provide most of the learning in this course. In combination with the lectures, the problem sets allow students to gain a true understanding on spectral graph theory.",
    "In my view, it's a perfect course."

    "I would only recommend this course to students who are interested in Theoretical Computer Science. Otherwise, the work is too much and maybe they would want to invest their time elsewhere.",
    "This course took over the majority of my time this semester, and I would only recommend it to another student if they are taking a lighter course load, and are willing to put their research on hold temporarily. However if this is a relevant topic for a student, I would say it is potentially worthwhile, if logistics work out.",
    "Yes, if the other student would like an intellectual challenge. This course meets my expectation of it being a challenging and rewarding course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone else if he or she is interested in related topics."
