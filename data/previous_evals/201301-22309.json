    "I would certainly recommend it. If you are at all interested in colonial policy and Africa - and read French - and if you are looking for a class that's less political science-y and more literature-based, you should definitely take it!",
    "An introduction to Congolese culture through representation in film and literature. AMAZING, TAKE IT. You'll learn so much with a great Professor.",
    "I recommend this class if you read French well and are prepared to read lengthy French texts, and also if you are interested in studying different kinds of Literature.",
    "This class is not difficult, but Prof. Miller is a very harsh grader. You should be ready to write the perfect paper for his assignments, and even that might not be enough. If you take this class and aren't ready to put in that much work, I'd say take it Credit\/D."
