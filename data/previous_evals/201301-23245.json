    "Take this class.",
    "Yes! Really fun! Fun reading. Fun professor. Take this class if you like writing, even if you aren't confident with it. It get's you thinking about writing and reading critically. Favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "English 120 has a easy\/moderate reading load, with 5 essays with first\/finals drafts due over the course of the semester. It's always interesting and you'll really improve as a writer. I really recommend taking it with Leslie - she's nice, smart, helpful, and really makes class enjoyable.",
    "Highly recommend. A great workshop, and a great way to think about non-fiction.",
    "English 120 is a great way to better understand literature of all genres. It shows the different choices that authors make and explores the reasoning behind them. Practicing that kind of reading helps cement understanding of these different choices, which I found very helpful. I would definitely recommend this course because the skills learned are transferrable to any course that requires reading and\/or writing."
