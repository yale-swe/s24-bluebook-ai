   "comments": [
    "the class is too dense. If there was less material and better application\/concept via case studies, the few important takeaways may stick better than just a complete compendium of nutrition information",
    "Great course, but highly dense material.",
    "I loved this course and learned a great deal - not only about nutrition and chronic disease but also to critically appraise literature and be sure to look up the references myself, not just read synopsis written by other people. The lectures ran for about two hours, but never felt too long or boring. The discussion sessions were also ran very well and allowed everyone opportunity to participate.Weaknesses - some of the homework assignments were a bit vague and felt like writing an essay rather than answer specific questions.",
    "We do learn some interesting and useful fact and research.",
    "str: perspectiveWeak: guest speakers",
    "This was a great course that broadly covered the major chronic diseases that nutrition can affect. I think it did a great job covering background material and other pertinent information.I think the weakest part of the course was the discussion section which sometimes did not seem to fit well with the topic for the week. In some cases, the homework was unrelated to the topic or didn't do much in terms of reinforcement of the material learned in lecture.Improvements need to be made in adhering to the scheduled class and discussion times as these frequently ran long.",
    "Strengths: very comprehensive and useful information. Excellent resources and further reading provided. A fantastic basis for nutritional epidemiology.",
    "2 hr class is really long. After 1 hour 15 minute, I am unable to concentrate. A 5 minute break would be nice.",
    "I really loved this course! I wouldn't suggest any improvements.The lectures were very clear and interesting and the section brought about a lot of good conversation and were generally very interactive. I also really enjoyed having an outside guest nutritionist from the Smillow Cancer Center talk with us during section.",
    "This is an excellent excellent course. Engaging, fascinating, systematically presented, and clear to understand. Discussion section was thought provoking and enjoyable to be at. I loved this class.",
    "The course was very well structured, and the expectations for weekly assignments and exams were communicated well. Though this course understandably focused more on epidemiology that nutrition science, I think it would have been interesting to learn more about mechanisms of action for different nutrients.",
    "The course was incredibly fascinating and very well structured; discussion sections were also a wonderful addition. Really focused on the biologics of nutrition and policy implications - excellently conducted.",
    "The course was extremely well structured and provided wonderful insight into nutrition, chronic disease, and policy.",
    "One of my favorite classes I have ever taken. It had a excellent balance between learning general facts and critical thinking. I have a wealth of knowledge regarding nutrition, and more importantly this foundation makes me want to learn more. I don't know what else I could ask for.",
    "Great course! We covered a lot of interesting topics and the course material was very cohesive.",
    "I appreciated how Dr. Mayne attended discussion sections so that we could get to know her better. Tests were also fair. Nutrition is also an important topic in public health and I learned a lot.",
    "great maybe more workload for 1st year students",
    "Strengths: very well organized, useful relevant knowledge in nutritionWeakness: Some lectures had too many slides which weren't touched upon in homeworks or exams.",
    "This course is very well structured and rich in content. The assignments of the course are very helpful to better understand the knowledge presented in the lectures and get acquainted with current hot topics in the field.",
    "Overall, this is an excellent course and is the best I have taken at Yale so far. It is a fascinating class that gives excellent information in a way that is easy to take away from the class and apply to real-life and work settings. The lectures were packed with information, but the information presented in a manageable way. The homework added depth to the lectures and the discussion sessions were an excellent way to reinforce concepts and develop analytical skills. After the class, I feel prepared to evaluate and analyze nutritional studies appropriately.",
    "1) A lot of material was covered - anybody interested in nutrition or diseases related to nutrition should take this course.2) The lectures were engaging and the Professor was dedicated to the course. Her lectures were engaging.3) You will come out of this class knowing a great deal more than you did coming in - that is always the hallmark of a great course.4) While the TA may be different the next year, the TA this semester was exceptional."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0she's extremely knowledgeable, but she is a lecturer and she wants to give a complete picture of nutrition. I think that if this is a one course that should help define how we see nutrition and CD, then the focus should be less on hitting every topic in a thorough way, and more on hitting key topics more thoroughly. Those key topics are what people are going to remember and use in practice, not structures of fat or the how marketing amongst consumer companies are bad (that's something that's already seen by students). I guess what I'm saying is that I'm much more interested in the \"insights\" rather than just getting detail because it's there. I think if I was going to become a nutritionist and going to get a degree in such, then it makes more sense to have this class operate that way. But to me, my impression was that this was a survey type class and should really hone in on key takeaways versus all detail.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne teaches in a manner where you don't feel like you're being lectured. Her teaching style is really conducive to learning.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is amazing and I absolutely loved attending her lectures. Her lectures are very informative, easy to follow, and present some complex concepts and what could potentially be a boring\"laundry list\" of various trials in an engaging way. After attempting to read those trials prior to the lecture, I can honestly say that there is no better way to learn about the different nutrition trials than from her lectures and the discussion session. Her approach made me feel that my opinion is valuable and I felt encouraged to ask questions and participate in the discussion.",

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0I found Dr. Mayne to be a clear, professional, and incredibly well-versed lecturer. The topics were fascinating and covered in excellent detail.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0The instructor is fantastic. She is clearly a brilliant scientist and knows where she stands on many issues; she has a breadth of experience with many different facets of nutrition issues and a depth of knowledge on its effect on disease. That being said, she is completely open to conversation\/different opinions and tells you when a question is outside her realm. Her lectures are well-planned and provide a balanced perspective on the real research behind nutrient recommendations. Her discussion topics are relevant to current issues and provide an avenue for important discussions to be held.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne provided interesting lectures each week, and also offered many opportunities and answers to student questions. I appreciated how she incorporated recently released trials and evidence into the lectures. She also was readily available to answer questions and comments outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is a great professor; very engaged with students and shows a genuine interest in helping students understand course material.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne was a wonderful instructor.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is the reason why that this course is one of the best I have ever taken. I liked her professional demeanor as well as her knowledge of everything nutrition. It was very apparent Dr. Mayne has spent much of her time continuously crafting this course to perfection. Her lectures were always clear and interesting, and she is responsive to the questions raised during lecture.Thank you for an excellent experience.",

    "Erikka was great, but I think she should consider cold calling and pushing students more. Students don't talk because they are shy and distracted, etc..but there is expectation to have at least the HW completed so why not pick on people because at least they have an answer. It's not like it's pure cold calling where a person may or may not have thought about the question at all.",
    "The TA, Erikka Lottfield, led the discussion sessions. She did a good job at stimulating us to participate and give everyone equal opportunity to present. Overall , great job. Can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Erikka Loftfield is responsible!",
    "she was great",
    "The TA did a good job. She was prepared for discussion but it sometimes felt like there was a lack of flow between conversation. She also needs to be aware of the time because she frequently ran long because she wasn't willing to cut any material from the discussion.",
    "Helpful and well organized sections. Encouraging in grading and feedback.",
    "She was a great TA. Always responded to emails and questions promptly. She is also very knowledgeable and encouraging. Her feedback was very helpful.I would give her full grade on teaching capabilities.",

    "The TA was very knowledgable and led discussion well.",
    "Erikka did a very good job managing discussion session. I also appreciated the fact that she actually read through and commented on our homework. I often feel that other TAs have a cursory glance over our work and really don't read what we have to say. Thank you.",
    "Erikka is a great TA. She knows the material very well, offered helpful comments on the homework, and did a great job leading the discussion sessions.",
    "Great TA. Erikka is knowledgable and very smart.",
    "very helpful",
    "Erika is very helpful during the discussion sessions and office hours. She's a great TA!",
    "Erikka is an excellent TA. She wasalways quick to respond to questions, and was flexible in her office hours and meeting times. She really enhanced the discussion experience, and I feel like I learned important analytical skills from the discussion sections. She did a great job at leading discussion.",
    "1) Erikka was always well prepared, and it showed because she knew the material well. This can make a major difference in the quality of the discussion section, because it keeps students engaged.2) The TA was able to explain the material in a clear way that is to the point. Any complex point that we have discussed, she was able to break down in a very logical way.3) The TA was always ready to answer questions - I emailed her several times with questions about topics in class, and she always responds in a timely manner with a detailed and thorough response.4) All of the above qualities were also evident during her office hours.5) In discussion sections she was engaging because it was clear she enjoyed teaching and enjoyed the material."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this because it's important to know. I will say that Susan's slides are enough to get through the class, which I think is a bit of a tragedy because Susan is so brilliant that more value from her insights may be extracted in person than her lecturing.",
    "Highly recommended if you're interested in the field of nutrition. However, be prepared to study to digest the dense material",
    "Susan Mayne is a terrific instructor.",
    "Great course about nutrition and its effects on chronic diseases, including cancer, CVD, etc. The class fills a large void for undergraduate education at Yale--I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in nutrition, public health, or food. The course material is highly relevant to everyone's everyday life.",
    "great to take for your career and personal development.",
    "It was a great course with a lot of information.",
    "Definitely recommend as an excellent introduction to nutrition and nutrition-related research.",
    "A wonderful course, my favorite this semester. I was honestly sad when it was over, highly recommend it to any student!It is very good at helping students to critically evaluate literature and to begin to understand the vast and varying research findings related to nutrition and chronic disease.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The instructor is very knowledgable, and this course provides a great introduction to various nutritional aspects of many chronic diseases.",
    "This course will take you through a range of chronic diseases, delineate the nutrients relevant to the disease, and explain the evidence behind the associations. The material gets into the current policy and public health issues relevant to the disease\/nutrient. Most lectures are followed by an interactive discussion later in the week, where a short assignment will be due. All readings not associated with the assignment are optional.I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in the topic; even if you have previous nutrition and chronic disease experience, this course is will be more than worth your time.",
    "The Nutrition and Chronic Disease course overviews the impact of an array of nutrients on health, in addition to policy issues related to nutrition. Depending on the week, the weekly assignments can be a bit time consuming but overall reinforce important concepts learned in lecture. The exams cover an extensive amount of information learned in class (and require committing lots of information to memory), but are graded very fairly. It was an interesting and recommended course!",
    "I would recommend this course for a fellow student; I gained a lot from the course and learned a great deal about nutrition and physiology and the impact of nutritional policy.",
    "Great course!",
    "This is a class that I really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone, even outside CDE, that wants to take one of the best courses at Yale.",
    "A lot of material at times, but definitely worth it. I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes. This course is great for all students who want to gain a greater exposure in nutrition and learning how the topic relates to other areas of public health, specifically CDE.",
    "yes",
    "Informative course for those interested in nutrition and how it relates to chronic diseases and other areas of public health.",
    "This is a comprehensive course on the roles of various nutrients in chronic diseases and aging. It also introduces the food guidance systems in the U.S. and food politics. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in nutrition and chronic diseases.",
    "This class provides knowledge that is important for anybody interested in a career in public health. The course is structured in the following manner: first macro and micro nutrients are covered. The evidence on their benefit and harms are explored. Than specific diseases related to nutrition are covered including obesity, eye diseases, cancer, and osteoporosis. At the end, the policy implications are discussed. This class is a must and you will enjoy learning the material as it is clear that a lot of effort went into constructing the course."
