   "comments": [
    "History 001 01 is a freshman seminar that emphasizes analysis and thoughtful reflection on the key moments and figures of the modern American Civil Rights Movement. I would highly recommend those even remotely interested in more deeply learning about this period of American history to take the class.",
    "This is a great class that I would recommend to anyone.",
    "This course explores the Black Freedom Movements mostly through biography and autobiography. The books are interesting to read and provide students with a deeper understanding of what individuals, as well as the masses, experienced during this period. The short responses are easy, comprised of summary and personal remarks. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "This class is a survey of the various leaders and groups during the black civil rights movement. It was really great - I learned a lot! I would recommend this course to another student so long as he is prepared to do the reading.",
    "Great class that makes you think about the Movement in a broadened sense, enlightening you about people in the Movement you might have never known about otherwise.",
    "This is an AMAZING Class. There is a LOT of reading, but it's so interesting you do all of it. Professor Feimster is great; she's incredibly nice and always willing to help out a student. Feimster is an easy grader; I imagine you could get away with not doing the reading, but it certainly felt like everyone did most of it because it was so interesting. The class is structured nicely with a big final paper, but the last two weeks are light so you have time to prepare for it early. If you're at all interesting in Civil Rights\/Freedom Movements, you should take this course.",
    "I definitely would, especially if they're interested in AfAm.",
    "An introduction to the discipline of history that studies different (often more recent) angles on the Civil Rights Movement. Recommended if you're interested in studying history and doing your own research, not as a broad survey for non-history majors.",
    "YES I would. It's like a book club with a research paper at the end. The class is really interesting and chill, and Professor Feimster is so nice and helpful.",
    "This class will help you to understand the nuances of the Civil Rights Movement and its effects on the present day so much better than the standard story that most learn in high school of MLK Jr. and little else. The readings are absolutely excellent and well worth the time, but sometimes seminar just felt like a book club that didn't encourage particularly interesting analytical discussion of the material. Were seminar itself to improve next year, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Professor Feimster had a wonderful syllabus - I truly enjoyed the various perspectives on the civil rights movement, and found myself seeing this time period in a completely new light. If you don't mind reading autobiographies\/biographies - which make up nearly the entire reading list - this class should definitely keep you engaged, as all of the individuals had amazing lives. Rather than focusing on court cases, this class takes a look at the intertwining and conflicting roles of race, class, sex, and ideology in the fight for rights - things that are often glossed over or overly simplified in history books. The workload is definitely manageable - bi-weekly reading responses and a major research paper at the end of the year. We also saw some great film clips and documentaries that changed things up. I feel so lucky to have taken such a wonderful seminar - Professor Feimster made an effort to make this class enjoyable and intimate, and it certainly was! Definitely try to get into the seminar if you can!",
    "Take this class. Professor Feimster is a fantastic teacher, and you'll learn a lot about the civil rights movement that you didn't know you didn't know. Professor Feimster also works hard to connect with her students, whether she's attending concerts or inviting us over to her house.",
    "I recommend it. Great Class. Wonderful Teacher!!"
