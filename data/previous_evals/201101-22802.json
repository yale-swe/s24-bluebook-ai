   "comments": [
    "Very interesting material, professor DeRose is funny and engaging and he will spell out concepts quite clearly. Only remark is that too much time was spent on the first part of the course, leading to a somwehat rushed and unbalanced end.",
    "It's a solid course for metaphysics and a bit of epistemology in the modern period. Workload is manageable, papers not too difficult, and midterm fair. It's fairly straightforward -- not much you wouldn't expect.",
    "Take it if you have to for the major or are only interested in metaphysics. Don't expect to talk about ethics or the other areas that the various authors wrote about. Decent amount of reading, though not overwhelming and tests were fair.",
    "Boring. Requirement for philosophy majors. Unless you're one, don't bother taking it.",
    "This is an interesting course that gives you an understanding of some main threads in early-modern epistemology and metaphysics. I would not hesitate to take it if you're a philosophy major (it's a requirement, anyway), but if you're not a philosophy major, maybe look somewhere else for this stuff.",
    "This is a nice survey course. I enjoyed lectures, DeRose has a nice sense of humor and is good at making complicated arguments quite a bit clearer. The material is interesting and manageable. I think it's worth taking.",
    "Good class. Good outlook on a newb philosopher.",
    "It's not particularly painful, but I would only tell a student to take it if they had to for the major. If you're just looking for an introduction to philosophy, there are better philosophy courses to take: (Kagan's intro classes: Life, Death, or Intro Ethics), American Philosophy, Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Religion. If you are a philosophy major, I recommend waiting until you are older (junior or senior) to take this class (provided that you get some background on these guys in your other philosophy classes, which I can't imagine that you wouldn't). That way, you'll just find the course easy, you won't have to go as much, and it won't be too annoying.",
    "Modern Philosophy is actually a wonderful course. I say \"actually\" because at various points in the semester you may think to yourself, \"why are we reading Leibniz? He is just completely crazy!\" or, \"I'm pretty sure this is \/not\/ how perception works.\" But the narrative of the class as a whole is really coherent, really interesting, and, if you follow it closely, can teach you a lot and give you tons to think about. You have to be interested in philosophy, willing to study classic philosophers with appropriate respect and diligence, and a little bit patient. If you are, you can really get a lot out of this class.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're interested in epistemology. It was my first class of that kind, and thus took some getting used to at first. It's also a great intro course for the major.",
    "Philosophy 126 is an immensely enjoyable introduction to some of the most important Western philosophers. The reading for the course is \u0093Goldilocks\u0094 (not too much, not too little), and Professor DeRose\u0092s lectures are some of the best lectures I\u0092ve had at Yale. Do be aware that the course covers almost exclusively metaphysical and epistemological topics, rather than ethical or political topics. However, even if you don\u0092t think you\u0092re interested in metaphysics or epistemology, I\u0092d recommend taking this course, which will probably change your mind.",
    "Yes, but only if you find the material interesting. It's not as bad as other people make it out to be, but it's not exactly a consensus that the material is interesting. Shop it, see if you like it. What you see is what you need, no surprises, and its a pretty manageable workload- you could avoid Kant if you really wanted to.",
    "This is a well taught class on an important group of philosophers, but can be difficult to take without knowledge of the structure and method of philosophical argument.",
    "i would recommend this course to somebody interested in philosophy, but it requires some pretty good analytical and argumentative skills so it is not for everyone.",
    "If you are taking it, you're probably doing it for the major. I have, thus, little to say.",
    "Yes. Take it. Derose is excellent. The material is consistently intriguing, and I enjoyed it a lot more than the Greeks. I'd actually recommend that you take this BEFORE 125, because I would have enjoyed Plato far more had I known what was coming.",
    "This is a great class, both for people into philosophy and people just trying it out.It's not difficult, and Keith DeRose is an excellent professor. His lectures are clear, informative, and sometimes really funny.The philosophers that you read are all pretty great and interesting reads, and DeRose chooses very manageable segments of the books for you to read, making it easy to keep up with the class.This is especially good for people who would prefer a more analytical approach to philosophy--DeRose cares mainly about the actual arguments themselves, rather than the biography of the philosophers or the intellectual history or the literary aspects of the works. For people interested in Modern Philosophy as a springboard to more modern analytical philosophy, this is a great class.For people looking to find an intellectual-history approach (like Smith's Political Philosophy class) might want to look elsewhere though.",
    "Prof. DeRose's dynamic voice will keep your attention in this engaging intro to several philosophers. Rather than a broad survey of the philosophical disciplines, this course is more a look at certain specific thinkers and ideas--if you're not required to take the class, look at the syllabi of several intro philosophy courses to see which you'd prefer, but definitely shop this one if you can.The requirements were straightforward, lectures were interesting and pretty clearly delivered, readings were quite reasonable, and I particularly enjoyed section (with Alex Silverman).",
    "DeRose is good. The class is interesting. If you don't like epistemology or metaphysics, then do not take this class.",
    "Very good course. Great line-up of philosophers. Professor DeRose is an excellent lecturer. He is personable, funny and knows his stuff down cold. He is very engaging, and allows questions and some interaction from students (but not too much because that just gets annoying). I also liked how the grade was broken down between a paper and two in-class exams.Some possible improvements: 1) it would be nice if the professor stuck to the schedule and allotted times for each philosopher. We only spent one or two sessions on Kant, while we lingered on less interesting philosophers for much, much longer. 2) make section count towards some part of the grade. Section attendance was not mandatory, but the TAs reserved the right to change grades based on poor attendance. Also, we had to submit section questions each week.",
    "It was pretty good, so if you are not in DS and are interested in the authors then yes.",
    "Good but narrow introduction to early-modern epistemology and metaphysics. Not really a History of Modern Philosophy. If you're interested in its subject matter, and\/or have to take it, do! Keith DeRose does a good job."
