   "comments": [
    "Pretty good class. The material is simple enough that you could probably not go to class and still do well by reading the textbook every now and then, but Ronen Talmon is nice and you should probably try to spend more time with him.Good fifth class for people wanting to do math\/physics\/comp sci\/engineering\/ etc.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if he or she is actually interested in differential equations. Professor Talmon is a great guy who is extremely nice, but I think he overestimated our math ability. About half of the class dropped after the midterm. The biweekly problem sets were nice, but the final exam was brutal and painfully long. None of the questions on the exam were anything remotely like the problems in the book. If you're like me and keep up with the material in your classes and study well ahead of exam dates, then that's great, but that won't help at all in this class.",
    "A course of ordinary differential equations. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in pursuing math. At this point, you know if you want to pursue anything of the sort.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. The ENAS version is supposed to be pretty good. Professor Talmon just lectures straight from the textbook, and the text is expensive and poorly written. Instruction relies on a lot of worked examples, little explanation. The work tends to be tedious computation. Work load is too bad, but both exams and problem sets are long and tedious.",
    "I heard from friends taking the ENAS difeq's that their class was much more computational, where this class was a mix of some theory some calculation.",
    "This class basically delineates multiple methods for solving ordinary differential equations. There are some small proofs of techniques, but nothing very rigorous.",
    "I would recommend Math 246, though not strongly. It was an average course overall, I would say.",
    "If you'er choosing between the ENAS version and the MATH version, definitely take this one, the MATH version. If you have to take Diff Eq, take this one. It's do-able, and you end up kind of liking hte subject matter. It's kind of fun! That said, if you don't have to take Math 246 but need a math class (e.g. for econ&math major) you might be better off taking something else.",
    "Yes. A simple, proofs based course. Not unmanageable at all for someone who isn't a math major."
