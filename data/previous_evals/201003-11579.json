    "Marjorie Shansky is a wonderful professor. The small class size and the good pacing of the course led to considerable in-class discussion and lots of peer-based learning. We covered a lot of topics and I learned a ton.",
    "I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the class and professor.Marjorie Shansky really makes the course fun. She's a local lawyer who comes in once a year to teach this class, and I really appreciated her applied professional perspective. She's very engaging and is interested in students learning about what interests them and enjoying the class.",
    "The class discussions. Because it was a small class, everyone had abundant opportunities to contribute to class discussions and we were able to discuss topics in depth.",
    "I enjoyed reading the case studies and discussing them in class. This was helpful.I like how each student was assigned to discuss a specific case.",
    "The opportunity to learn from a practitioner made the course material very relevant to real world scenarios."

   "comments": [
    "3\/4s of the way through the course the case-book and case study method seemed to offer diminishing returns as each case began to resemble many we had already read. Perhaps a bit more inter-disciplinary methods would have continued the excellent initial momentum. The guest lecture was fantastic and I learned a ton. Maybe another guest lecture and a field trip at the end would improve on the current method?",
    "It's not a very traditional class (laid back syllabus and style, not lecture format, etc).I didn't mind this at all, but if you prefer structure, this might be a little too loose for you.",
    "Perhaps have more classes where we step away from the case history and look at other materials, or have additional guest speakers.",
    "Although I enjoyed the open discussion set-up of the course, it would have been nice to sometimes have more directed questions from the professor about how things are vs how they should be. I liked hearing my classmates opinions and I enjoyed the critical analysis discussions that we had.Also, bringing in a few more guest lecturers would be valuable. I really enjoyed our one guest speaker because he brought our discussions about land use policy to life and made the topics very real for me.",
    "I probably would have benefitted from a few smaller written assignments along the way to make me organize the material."
