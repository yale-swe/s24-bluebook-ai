   "comments": [
    "This is a decent course. Read a play a week, one long term paper, one very short assignment. Bromwich essentially leads a mini lecture by just going through the play scene by important scene. The comments are enlightening. The good thing about this is that when someone has something to say, it's usually only if it's important. The student input is good. The bad part is that you feel unmotivated to participate or even read the plays because he's just gone go through it. Another thing that annoyed me is that I received no grades in this course over the semester. I have no idea how I am doing in the class. Bromwich is also not very helpful when you meet with him. Where most professors will help guide your ideas and help you with what to write, Bromwich just spouts smart thing at you. Not the best senior seminar.",
    "A really great course! Try not to be intimidated; Professor Bromwich runs his class pretty formally but really enjoys new ideas and interpretations from his students. Don't be afraid to speak up. The discussions were pretty heady at times (perhaps because of our particular group) but very enjoyable. I hadn't taken a Shakespeare course prior to this, even though it is recommended, but found this one to be particularly good because it covered some of his less popular works (Measure for Measure, Coriolanus). Work was about a play a week (sometimes less) and a 20 page term paper at the end. Definitely recommended!",
    "You read Shakespeare plays with David Bromwich. Fairly self-explanatory.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to junior and senior English majors, but be aware most of your grade comes down to a final paper.",
    "As some students have said, it's not really a seminar-- it's more of a small lecture. It helps that this lecture is with a brilliant professor, and based on some excellent Shakespearean texts that you will look at in new ways.",
    "This course was a solid Shakespeare seminar. The political element was most pronounced when we read Machiavelli during the first few sessions and then read several of the history plays, which are most naturally suited toward the kind of discussion of rhetoric and power that Bromwich was interested in. Otherwise, it was a pretty standard, Harold Bloom\/AC Bradley\/William Empson-style class. This was wonderful for me, because I had never really read these critics in a serious way. Bromwich is actually a very good teacher, although he is often quite disorganized. We did not discuss the Montaigne readings in any depth because we alway were behind schedule. He is also somewhat intimidating in the classroom, at least in the beginning, so the tendency was for him to dominate discussion. This wasn't entirely a bad thing because he's really a very sensitive reader of Shakespeare. Take it if you're looking for a good Shakespeare class with a long paper at the end."
