    "DO IT! It's a lot of fun, and really thought-provoking!",
    "It's an unusual course. The exposure to primary literature is great, definitely useful if you're really interested in biology. Professor Zhong is good, but he can be frustrating -- sometimes he'll ask questions that have multiple answers but clearly expects only one, so your own answer can get waved down.",
    "This class teaches you a lot about the most recent developments in neurobiology, and in that sense the curriculum is wonderful. The one big problem that I have is that we were not given any feedback about how we were doing in the class. There was no percentage-wise breakdown of how much the midterm, final and class participation were worth, and the professor would never tell us. The midterm was graded by one professor while the final was graded by another professor, so we had no idea about what each of them expected and how each of them graded. The professor vaguely told us that the grading would be lenient at the beginning of the year, but I just discovered recently (from someone who took the class last year) that the professor is actually a very harsh grader, and so now I feel very much deceived. I should've suspected something was wrong when there were only 5 people left in the class by the end of shopping period (apparently there used to be more than 10 people last year).Professor Zhong is undoubtedly very intelligent and an expert in his field, but he has very strong opinions and he is not the most compassionate professor I have met at Yale. All of his class discussions are structured entirely as spit-fire sessions of questions, and unless you have an answer that is phrased in exactly the same way as his own answer, you will be cut off mid-sentence and dismissed as wrong (even if the gist of it is right). His teaching style definitely keeps you awake during class, but it can become extremely frustrating after a while. He is not very approachable and he is very vague about his expectations.",
    "I would highly recommend Brain Plasticity and Development, especially for those who have taken a variety of bio courses and are looking for a seminar style class to use and synthesize all they've learned. The class covers a variety of interesting topics, including brain development, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, plasticity, diseases, and addiction. You get to read and discuss primary research articles with the professors and your classmates, and Professor Zhong is one of the most interactive lecturers I've had at Yale, which really keeps you engaged!"
