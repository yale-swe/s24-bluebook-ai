    "AMAZING CLASS! Take it, you will learn so much. Start the papers early, they are fun to write. Try to keep up with the reading, at least skim everything.",
    "Take this course! It's amazing. You will learn so much and will be able to say you have read both Bibles by the end. Professor Martin is such a fun and gifted lecturer. I found his lectures to be extremely engaging and even entertaining. Seriously, this was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale and I would recommend it to anyone. I had never taken a religious studies course before and I found this one to be extremely accessible and worthwhile. Also, not too much work (just 3 papers) and all of the reading is from the Bible. It's super interesting and you will feel so knowledgable by the end.",
    "This is my absolute favorite class I've ever taken. You are actively missing out if you don't take this course.",
    "A great class for people who are interested in issues of sex\/gender\/marriage\/etc. in religious texts. If you want something that looks more at theory and modern feminist writing on this, \"Sexuality and Religion\" with Prof. Kathryn Lofton might be a good fit for you. \"Sex in the Bible\" was exactly what I wanted though, since the class focuses much more on the Biblical text itself and interpreting it, rather than supplemental readings. You have to write 3 \"1 page\" single-space reading responses (so really 2 pages), 2 short 6 page papers, and 1 final 8 page paper. Doing a longer reading response was sometimes a little annoying, but overall it was a great class and enjoyable section!",
    "Definitely take this class regardless of how much or little you know about the bible. It is taught extremely well and you will feel a lot more informed by the end of it. Also, if you are interested in gender theory and want to get a better understanding of the way gender and politics have been politicized by the religious right wing, this class is for you. You'll get to literally read the words of the bible and realize a lot of the rhetoric against homosexuality etc has very little basis in the actual text of the bible.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. I would emphasize its ability to give someone a great view of the history or religion and its ties to gender, sex, and sexuality throughout history.",
    "This is a great survey course about the Bible concentrating on sex and gender. Prof. Martin is great and an absolute pleasure to listen to. Subject matter is provocative, no matter what religion (if any) you belong to.",
    "Definitely take this class! If you have a religious background, take it--you'll learn how to read the Bible in a scholarly way. If you don't, take it--you'll really benefit from learning about the history of the Bible. Prof. Martin is awesome and very entertaining. Great class!",
    "I would recommend this to another student.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course! TF graded generously, lectures were always in and engaging, subject material was fascinating, and the workload was completely manageable. Good for a HU credit or as a 5th class... Good survey of the issues of sex and gender across the entire bible and Christian history!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the Bible or the history of sex in Biblical times--or both. It's a great course you can really only find at Yale. It is challenging but enjoyable and made me feel like I was really earning my Yale education.",
    "\"RLST 156: Women are baby-making property.\" Of course, this does not reflect Prof Martin's views or anything, but that is probably the best way to explain what the Bible says about women. The course material is about sex and sexuality in the Bible, which does not always mimic how modern people depict the Bible."
