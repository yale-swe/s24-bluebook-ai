   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want to have a background in the Cold War in literally all the European countries except Russia. The Russian-American aspect is discussed but the focus is on other countries.",
    "This is a pretty chill, low-stress seminar. The class discussions are really interesting and you get at the Cold War in very different ways than just who was fighting who at any given time. The movie list that we covered had some great films on it! Honestly, it would be worth taking just for the movies. The reading were generally pretty interesting as well. The main downside is that it was taught Friday afternoons this semester.",
    "HIST 275J was definitely a film class that drew on history. I think you should take it if you're interested in film and thinking about the Cold War from a different perspective. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and would take it again. I think it was a valuable class where I felt comfortable talking in the seminar and I felt like Prof. Syrimis did a good job of making sure that everyone felt comfortable.",
    "This was a great course for someone who has never taken a films studies course before. I really enjoyed it and the work load wasn't overbearing. Professor Syrimis is entertaining and the majority of the films are fascinating.",
    "Seminar discussion and presentations on films and history about the Cold War. Best if you come in with ideas to talk about and actually watch the films so you get something from this class.",
    "Absolutely. Fascinating exploration of the regions very affected by Cold War politics (some dealing with that legacy even today), but less explored in other courses. Lots of cultural analysis; fantastic readings and films for each week."
