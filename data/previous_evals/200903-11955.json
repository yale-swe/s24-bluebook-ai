    "I really enjoyed this course, and I came out of it feeling a lot smarter than when I came in. It seemed like not a lot of people knew about this great course because we only had six people in it--all girls. This was really great because we basically got to have this tiny discussion seminar with Dr. Levin who is an incredible and brilliant professor. Also, she is president Levin's wife, so we got to go the the president's house for dinner at the end of the semester. There are, of course, lots of other reasons to take this class, but seeing the presidents house is definitely a perk. We read the Iliad, the Aeneid, Beowulf, Song of Roland, Paradise Lost, The Rape of the Lock, The Prelude, and Song of Myself. With the exception of The Prelude and the Song of Roland, I came to love all of these poems. I found the Prelude kind of insufferable, and the Song of Roland just didn't seem as epic as the other poems but was still an interesting read. You will come away from this course with new insight into the big themes of epic poetry--as Dr. Levin summarizes it: the Hero, the Divine, and the role of Art--and how different poets have treated these concepts over the course of Western history. You get a really cool perspective on how all these very different works fit together. The classes sometimes seemed to drag on a bit, but I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Very good. Lots of reading but things you should have read anyway to be an educated Yalie and enjoyable. Great chance to hear Professor Levin's wisdom in a tiny class without taking DS!",
    "How else are you going to take a class with Jane Levin without taking Directed Studies? Really, she makes this class what it is. Yes, this class gives you a chance to work through most of the major classical - romantic epics (minus The Odyssey) in a framework that helps you make all sorts of connections (the idea of the hero, the idea of the divine, and the idea of art) between the poems, but the class simply would not be the same without Jane Levin. If you enjoy reading longer works of poetry and want to take a class with the nicest professor you will ever meet at Yale, then take this class! In terms of workload, you have two 7-8 page papers, a presentation, and a written final. Reading can get heavy at times (Wordsworth), but it all works out in the end.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. The readings are great -- basically highlights from DS. Prof. Levin is incredibly knowledgeable, a good discussion leader, and always available to students. The workload isn't too bad -- lots of reading of course, but only two 8-page essays. The final isn't bad at all. Overall, I would recommend this course."
