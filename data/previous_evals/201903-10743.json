   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot more Chinese vocabulary, grammar, and culture! Liu Laoshi (and Wei Laoshi) really encourage discussion among us, which improves our speaking and listening skills, as well as our exposure to Chinese culture.",
    "My Chinese speaking and writing skills have vastly improved over the course of the semester. Before taking this class, I thought I knew most Chinese grammatical constructions. After I realized there is so much I dont know about Chinese, and so much that I want to find out.",
    "This is one of the assignment-heavy courses I took this semester but it was so worth it. By the end, I am able to get a general understand of simple Chinese books and articles, in just a semester!",
    "Expanded vocabulary, more comfort in speaking\/using common grammar patterns in conversation",
    "I improved my Chinese skills a great deal in this course, especially in terms of reading and writing. I started off the semester barely knowing any characters, and now I can confidently read and write a few hundred. The course also improved my spoken fluency and, most importantly, it helped me find a learning style that works for me.",
    "I learned a significant amount of Chinese characters and have improved my reading and writing ability",
    "Chinese reading and writing, mostly. Speaking and listening were both practiced but much of it was learned from home before coming to Yale.",
    "I developed my reading and writing skills of Chinese characters, which I had no previous experience with. This course taught me to be able to memorize large amounts of characters in a short period of time. As well, my pronunciation developed to be more accurate over the course of the term.",
    "I improved my chinese skills. Due to my upbringing, I already knew how to speak mandarin pretty well, so although I learned some grammar and a couple new words, what I gained from the course came primarily in the form of reading and writing. I can now write ~600 more words than I could before, and that makes me quite happy."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful class. Engaging, well-taught...it's a fun course where we learn a lot too. Not too many weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: rigorous, learned a lot of character, Liu Laoshi is very engaging Weaknesses: our class was split in two where half the time we had a TA. I was not as engaged in the TA sessions because I felt the examples she used contained too many complicated phrases so I couldnt focus on the main phrase we needed to learn.",
    "Strengths: Very comfortable, encouraging environment for participating and making mistakes, teacher's super chill Weaknesses: Course pace\/difficulty depends on student's comfort in picking up new material quickly for the quizzes\/tests",
    "This course is fantastic all round, but I think it could benefit from different types of projects. We do a lot of essay writing and presentation, but I wonder if more creative projects could be assigned that could put our Chinese skills to test in real world scenarios.",
    "It was certainly a lot of work, but all this work has yielded worthwhile progress and results",
    "Very good course.",
    "The strengths of the course was the support and help from my Chinese professor, as well as the documents posted on Canvas aimed to aid our learning and consolidation of knowledge. The course could be improved if there were specific planned areas to work on during the weekly TA sessions, rather than being time slots just for the student to ask their questions. In many cases, the student doesn't have many questions about the weekly material, so the TA sessions aren't that helpful.",
    "This may be specific to my class because section 2 was split in half, but I did not like the format of going to one classroom one week and going to the other classroom the next week, especially because they were in different buildings. The material was thankfully all on the same schedule, but it was just kind of confusing, and in my opinion, unnecessary. Moreover, the overall pace of the course was kind of slow, even for someone like me, who recognized almost 0 words at the outset - we learned ~10 words per day for most of the semester, which I think is the rate at which elementary school students are taught in China. We started learning more words per day towards the end, and I wish we kept that pace all the way through. However, the frequent essays and oral presentations were a little too much. Speaking skills could be better improved through informal discussions, and writing skills could be gained by being taught more of the formal language and terminology used in essay writing. Besides these things, the course was pretty good."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any heritage student, especially those who are not good with their Chinese, have difficulty in speaking with their peers\/relatives in Chinese, don't speak with correct grammar, can't read\/write, or have an American accent that they'd like to get rid of. Liu Laoshi is caring and open to the struggles of American-born Chinese students and this class is perfect for their improvement!",
    "Yes if they want a rigorous semester of Chinese, it ends up being very rewarding.",
    "Absolutely, this course will push you to have a better understanding of Chinese.",
    "As someone who's mostly only spoken Cantonese at home, with previous schooling in Mandarin and relatively basic phrases in conversation\/writing, I still managed to do alright. Also audited heritage L2 last spring, which helped me review a bit before coming into L3. Most of the class was fine as long as you spend 1-2 hours on the weekend reviewing the next chapter for the week and writing out all the characters to get them into long-term memory. I only read had a little trouble speaking because of the Cantonese thing, and everyone has their own weaknesses - teacher was lenient in most cases as long as the effort was there.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone pursuing Chinese for their language requirement. It's an excellent course that is engaging and taught well. I was excited to go to class everyday because this class not only had amazing teachers, but amazing students as well that made the learning process way more fun.",
    "Yes, if the student is willing to put in time.",
    "This is a good course for people who speak chinese regularly at home with their parents, but have forgotten a lot of the reading and writing.",
    "Yes, because it allows you to learn a lot of a language in a short period of time. However, because you are required to memorize so much so quickly, you might not retain the information learned indefinitely.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone at about my level (at the beginning of the semester) who wants to learn chinese. But for this course, recommendations don't hold much merit because there is only one sequence of classes for a heritage chinese student to learn chinese at Yale. I think learning chinese is a very useful skill, and this class serves that purpose, so I would recommend it, but this recommendation doesn't really speak to the course's individual merit, only to that of the institution."
