    "This class will probably be the most useful class I take at YSPH. I have learned that nutrition plays a huge role in so many chronic diseases, and the mechanisms by which it does have fascinated me. The class was engaging and interesting, and most of the homework assignments were helpful in building important skills and knowledge for the field of nutritional epidemiology.",
    "Dr. Mayne is extremely knowledgeable and presents on a broad range of topics while also keeping the material focused.",
    "By far, my favorite class of the semester. This is a great bridge class between my Global health seminars and epidemiology class.",
    "Overall, I learned a LOT of useful and interesting material in this class. The best part of this class is that it is a really great balance between scientific background, past\/current research, and policy implications.",
    "I thought the class was fantastic. I came into the class thinking I already knew a lot about nutrition and its relation to chronic disease, but I learned so much more than I had anticipated. I thought our homework really helped facilitate a deeper understanding of the material and that the lectures were very interesting and engaging.",
    "Great content, extremely knowledgeable professor, relevant homework assignments.",
    "This was my favorite course taken at Yale so far. Every lecture was engaging and an important topic in nutrition for chronic diseases. I have learned so much from this class, including both the research and policy side of nutrition. My only suggestion is that the homework assignments should be worth more points because a lot of time was spent researching and writing up the responses.",
    "Great. Very insightful",
    "Strengths: Covers a wide range of concepts Weakness: The lecture slides are a bit dense",
    "This course was excellent and provided a comprehensive summary of basic nutrition, the links between nutrition and chronic disease, and nutrition policy. I learned a lot in this course.",
    "Excellent course!",
    "This course was easily my favorite of the semester. The material is intriguing and important to so many aspects of public health. Dr. Mayne does a great job at keeping the content up to date and using the most recent research to support her lectures. The lectures on occasion can be long, but they are always easily to follow and laid out in a clear way. The assignments are also helpful in applying what we discuss in class and better understanding the scientific literature. One thing to consider about the homework is making them a little shorter, or asking to include less for the 1 page or half page response limits. Fitting everything into the responses was often difficult in the restricted lengths.",
    "Tons of relevant, interesting, and current material presented by fascinating professor",
    "BEST COURSE I'VE EVER TAKEN AT YALE AND POSSIBLY IN MY POST-HIGH SCHOOL LIFE! Dr. Mayne did an incredible job at covering a wide range of topics pertaining to all demographics while keeping it incredible coherent even to us non-biochemically-trained students. The course is quick but incredibly interesting and you can't help but to be interested and engaged in the material. If you're a CDE student, this is a MUST-take. If Dr. Mayne's replacement lecturer is even half as amazing, then the excellence of this course will live on!",
    "I learned a lot from the class, I think we learned some really useful and relevant information to be well educated in public health. I think some parts of the examinations were a little too specific rather than assessing our overall knowledge, other than that I really liked this course.",
    "Given that this is Susan's last class, I thought it was well taught and I doubt that anybody else would have the capability to teach the material as she did. However, I think -- for the purposes of anyone else who would take up teaching this class -- that more in class interaction should be included. E.g. in class activities, participation, as opposed to a purely didactic lecture style. I suppose this is what the sections were for!",
    "Overall the class was great. I wouldn't change anything. I just wish there was more time to learn even more!",
    "This course is excellent. It gives a fantastic overview of chronic diseases, uses diverse resources and is extremely practical.",
    "This class was one of the most useful and interesting classes I've taken. It covers a lot of ground and you come out learning a lot. I really appreciate learning a little bit about the biology behind the chronic diseases and how nutrition interacts with them, but also that this was not an overwhelming part of the course. I also appreciate the policy portions of the class and getting a better understand of how the most up-to-date research affects policy and nutritional recommendations, and what organizations are involved. I don't think there's much to improve in this course."

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne was has so much valuable experience and passion to share with students, and these qualities greatly contributed to her being a great professor for this course. Further, she was always responsive to questions about course material or related topics. I'm very thankful to have been able to take this class with her before she leaves!",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Maybe is amazing with how much she knows and how straight forward she is with her information. However, she can also be hard to approach with questions.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is a graceful teacher and phenomenal human being. She was always willing to meet outside of class to review material and answer an questions. I think it would be helpful to set some office hours because she can be a very intimidating person to approach at first.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Professor Mayne was great. She explains complex topics very well\/in a way that's easy for everyone to understand. She also makes lots of connections between the material we're learning in class, which made it very interactive. I think the only thing is that because we learned so many studies in the class, the powerpoint\/lectures could have been better organized to make the overlaps\/inconsistencies clearer.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne was a great instructor who is very clearly passionate about this topic. Her enthusiasm for the material is contagious and definitely made this class one of my favorites this semester.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is an amazing lecturer who thoroughly understands all aspects of what she is teaching. She was able to answer student content questions immediately and thoroughly off the top of her head. Lectures and readings were always posted well before lecture. She was able to share personal insight into several of the topic areas because of her wealth of experience in the field.",

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is an amazing professor. Her knowledge of the field is without rival and we were all fortunate to have had the opportunity to take her final class at Yale. She always clarified any questions that came up in class in a complete and logical manner, as well as providing resources that we could turn to for additional information. I never thought I would be so comfortable talking about zeaxanthin outside of class, and that is a testament to her teaching ability. As sad as it is to see her leave for the FDA, Dr. Mayne will have a lasting impact on all of us from class.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Fantastic in all metrics",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is fantastic! My only criticism is that it was really unclear why I lost the points I did on my midterm?",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne's lecture style is smoother than a silk sheet in a vaseline factory.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Susan is really great, she is clearly very well informed on the subject and very god at relaying that information back to us.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Susan knows the material better than anyone else (which explains her departure for the federal government) so it was my privilege to have been taught by her.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Incredibly knowledgeable. Willing to answer any and all questions.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0She is a seamless lecturer. She answered questions extremely well and brought in many interesting and relevant emerging applications to each new subject.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0A wonderful lecturer. Her lectures are seamless and they have a perfect balance of topic background, personal experience, and up-to-date research\/topics. She definitely covers a lot during lecture, and expects you to know the material well and to be able to apply it for the tests."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Nutrition is so important to so many aspects of public health, and this class truly develops your understanding of why and how.",
    "Lots of great information on nutrition and chronic disease. If another student is interested in these things, yes, I would recommend it.",
    "YSPH should continue to hold this course, even with Dr. Mayne taking a temporary leave of absence. I talk about this course all the time and it has definitely shaped my career trajectory-- now I am considering work at the intersection between nutrition and NCDs.",
    "I would summarize this class as a good overview of nutritional topics and how they relate to chronic disease in America (and somewhat globally). There is a variety of nutritional topics ranging from micronutrients to supplements and I had a great time learning about these topics.",
    "This course provided a very thorough and thought provoking overview of the important topics in nutrition and how diet influences the risk and course of chronic disease outcomes. I learned a lot that I believe will will both serve me in my future career and in how I evaluate the current research to determine my own diet and healthy eating patterns",
    "Wonderful class for anyone interested in nutrition's role within public health. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Every person should take this class!",
    "I would recommend it to another student, because it covers a wide range of topics and is pretty interesting. The slides tend to be a bit dense, but it is still informative and keeps you thinking.",
    "This course provides an in-depth look at the evidence for the role of nutrition in various chronic diseases. It has been one of my favorite courses so far, and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This course teaches students about the epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and policy issues surrounding nutrition. I hope it continues to exist in the future!",
    "In this class you will learn a ton about the impacts of diet and nutrition on the full spectrum of chronic diseases. Being familiar with these interactions and the science behind it is critical for anyone interested in chronic illness and all of public health. I hope the course continues even after Dr. Mayne leaves but if it does not, any similar would be a great asset to have taken. Definitely take it if possible.",
    "Great course if interested at all in nutrition.",
    "I learned so much from this course- I can't imagine having not taken it. Definitely recommend taking it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, I learned a lot of useful information that I think we should know as public health professionals.",
    "I would recommend this course greatly to another student given that there are so few nutrition classes at Yale. I hope that someone will be able to teach this course next year, as I think it really is an integral part of the chronic disease syllabus.",
    "If you're interested in nutrition and chronic disease, take this class! Really enjoyable.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Although it will be hard to replace Dr. Mayne, I hope that such a valuable class continues!",
    "As a chronic disease epi student this was a much needed class because I felt it gave me the crash course I needed on the biology and the recent literature of the major chronic diseases. Since nutrition so often plays a role in these diseases, it was very useful to get a better understanding of how nutrition factors into health, how dietary recommendations arise, and the limitations of current nutrition literature. I learned a lot. Definitely recommend."
