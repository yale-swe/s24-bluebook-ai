   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course for anyone who loves HSHM courses, but wants to focus on topics in physics and chemistry, such as special relatively and aether.",
    "I would tentatively recommend this class. Personally, I enjoyed it. I like Bill and as an HSHM major, I genuinely enjoy learning about this stuff. Plus, the reading requirements are very lax for a seminar (which is a plus). Also, I think as this course progresses, it's going to get better- there is a lot to cover in science from Newton to Neutrons.",
    "Take this course. It covers the history of science from about 1600 to about WWII, in a historical sense. It also helps explain concepts that you may be embarrassed to ask about in chemistry or physics. The paper is fine.",
    "A pretty laid back class that is very interesting if you're into the history of science. You get to read fun articles\/book chapters for class and just talk about them. There is a final paper that you can write about whatever you want, and also every week one or two students will lead the discussion for half the class (then after you present you write a short paper about the topic). Overall, I'm glad I took it.",
    "If you are looking for a seminar, then maybe. But there might be more interesting seminars out there for HSHM.",
    "Take it. It's a great class and a lot of fun to go to. There's not any feedback on your performance, which is a little bit worrying, but other than that it's a great class.",
    "ummmmmm...... i don't know. if you're looking a really chill seminar that doesn't demand a lot of work during the semester, but that you can learn a lot from if you're willing to invest yourself without someone breathing down your neck then take it and you'll learn a lot. but you'll get your butt kicked toward the end of the semester as all of a sudden you're on your own to write a final paper on any topic that may or may not be related to what you had been studying prior to that.",
    "Good class!!",
    "Fantastic class! Think I learned about as much about history as about science. Really enjoyable for science kids and the non-science-oriented (such as myself) alike!",
    "I really liked this class. I learned A TON about physics and 17th to 19th century science. Professor Summers is an incredibly understanding, knowledgeable, and engaging teacher. The class is mostly a seminar style discussion with interesting readings. We had two papers over the course of the class, and you had to lead one of the hourly long discussions of a reading. You should actually do the readings. It was really obvious when people didn't and it just makes for a boring class. The class was fun though! I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "This was a fun and informative course. As a science major with a strong interest in the physical sciences, it was quite enlightening to learn about the historical background of many concepts I had previously seen only in a science class. Professor Summers was engaging, and his clear enthusiasm for the material inspired my own. I enjoyed the discussions we held in class. I would recommend this to both science and non-science majors.",
    "Take it if you are HSHM. Interesting stuff covered that you might not otherwise know. Two papers and a presentation. I learned a lot about the origins of western scientific thought.",
    "An overview of the birth of the modern physical sciences."
