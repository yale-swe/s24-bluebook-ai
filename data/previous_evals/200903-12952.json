    "I would summarize DS 005 as a general view of ancient Western historians, with some time also spent on the political commentaries of Plato and Aristotle as well as Augustine and Aquinas in the Middle Ages. I would recommend the course, because even though some of the material was dry, I still feel as though there was much to be learned by reading it.",
    "History and Political Thought is definitely the most disjointed class in the DS curriculum. If you don't have a great base of factual happenings from Ancient Greece through the Middle Ages, this class will seem a little inconsistent. I found these readings to be the hardest to get done, often because too much reading was assigned and the authors had dry styles. I would recommend either wikipedia-ing some basic information about the time period or reading the introductions in the works themselves.My particular section with Professor Freedman was fantastic. He's absolutely the best. He's hilarious, down-to-earth, generous with food (!) and extremely knowledgeable about everything (at least that's how it seems). Be prepared to get bad grades on your papers. Professor Freedman is either the hardest or second-hardest grader in DS, and you won't get a ton of comments either. The greatness of the section totally makes up for this aspect of it though.",
    "The Directed Studies Literature section is what one would expect - a survey of great works historical and political of the Western cannon. The course's only weakness is an inability to cover each piece in depth. However, I still found the course extremely rewarding, and it has affected the very way I think.",
    "DS History and Politics has an emphasis on \"politics.\" Don't expect a military or social history course; while you do learn interesting pieces of history, you mostly learn about the evolution of political thought and theory. Even though I myself am a history buff, however, I found this to be perfectly fine, because everything we read had massive political, historical, or social significance. The class's focus was definitely on the macro, as it should be, but sometimes you did wish that the micro was incorporated into class discussions rather than just the lectures. However, that little problem has more to do with the sheer amount of material which the course covers, rather than some problem with the course's goal.Take DS. Be prepared to work, and not have fun on most Thursdays, and bitch and moan about those to details to all your DS and non-DS friends, but also be prepared to learn a lot more than most other people seem to and also to be able to sound like some kind of snobby pseudo European historian-genius to those around you. But its OK, because their jokes are just out of jealously. And an overabundance of energy which you, as a DS student, will never have to suffer.",
    "I think Directed Studies is a wonderful program. It is clear to me that it is not suited to every individual, but those who flourish in a discussion and analysis based environment get a lot out of Directed Studies. This being said, one's enjoyment of Directed Studies is extremely dependent on the section one is in, one's professor, and the level of involvement of the other students. I felt very lucky in my set of professors this semester. In the case of Professor Paul Freedman in particular, I appreciated his knowledge of his subject and his engaging way of discussing it with the class. He always used strong examples, organized our discussion around thematic ideas, and drew parallels between the works we read. I felt like he did a good job processing the large amount of reading we were assigned. Professor Freedman was always supportive and respectful of his students, so he was well liked by the class. On a personal level, I always felt it was difficult to know what Professor Freedman expected from his students; especially in writing our papers, I never seemed to know what he was looking for in a good paper, and I think other students felt the same way. In our discussions we frequently strayed onto modern day topics that connected back to the text. Some students may have seen this as helpful and engaging, others may have found it frustrating because it took time away from looking at the text. I did not really have a preference, but I noted this element of Professor Freedman's teaching style.",
    "The course strikes a perfect balance between the historical and political science aspects. Although slightly more time could have been spent on the Middle Ages, overall the readings are interesting and cover the most important events in ancient history. Professor Freedman is amazing - not an easy grader (but it's not entirely impossible to get an A on a paper, either), but he is a very kind, intelligent, and witty teacher. He uses a Socratic method style of teaching that makes students really think in class and search for their own answers rather than being hand-fed them. Excellent both at leading section and at lecturing. With a different teacher, H\/P might have been somewhat boring, but Professor Freedman makes it an entertaining and invaluable experience.",
    "Take it if you like ancient Greece and Rome. The whole class is pretty much reading long passages from ancient authors (who by no means write in an interesting, poetic, or readable manner) about what they have witnessed."
