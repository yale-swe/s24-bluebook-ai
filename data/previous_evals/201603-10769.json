    "I learned a lot about literary theory, which is why I took the course. The syllabus was a bit weird, but I'm glad I took the course in the end.",
    "Defenses of Poetry not only taught me how poetry has been defended (and attacked) throughout history; it also taught me why we should continue in the steps of the former party, forging our own defenses ad infinitum. As long as the Manichean duel continues, poetry will be O.K., I think. \"Punk rock died when the first kid said 'Punk's not dead,'\" said Dave Berman. And although he is a real good poet and songwriter, I think he's wrong on this one. Poetry (of which punk rock is a part, like all imaginative activity, following Shelley) has always been self-conscious; self-consciousness involves self-criticism, indeed, it involves the dialectical play of self-criticism and self-defense that I've just mentioned. Every offensive move comes with an equal and opposite defensive turn, a \"___'s not dead\" for every \"___ is dead.\" There's the magic, and great poets have always known it. Now I know it too. Paul Fry is a total genius."

   "comments": [
    "It was a very engaging class, that really endeavored to give a thorough defense of poetry through a variety of means",
    "The course covers a wide-range of compelling questions regarding the nature of poetry. Dr. Fry has selected a unique collection of readings for the course and navigates the texts exquisitely. However, as someone who did not already possess the technical vocabulary, it was difficult to fully understand the nuances of the text as well as its application to poetry directly. I also would have liked to have had more discussion comparing the texts so as to further refine our understanding of the author's engagement with the subject of poetry, language, and literature.",
    "I feel like some weeks there were good readings on the syllabus (like Guillory) and some weeks were really boring readings on the syllabus (like Arnold). The class size itself was small and the discussions were fun.",
    "There is literally nothing that could be improved in this, the closest I've come in my 4 years to a perfect course at Yale. Except maybe capping the class (after Fry's own 'A Defense of Poetry') with Ben Lerner's 'The Hatred of Poetry,' which in fairness was released only this summer-- surely after this course had been planned out for the semester. There were only eight of us in the seminar, and I loved it. I don't want more people. I want to be one of eight smart people in a room talking about poetry and literary criticism for the rest of my life. Holy shit. I think I might actually go to graduate school."

   "comments": [
    "Abosolutely, it's a class anyone intersted in what they're learning should take",
    "This course is unlike any other in the English department. It bridges the gap between poetry and philosophy, and is heavy on the critical theory, but you will love every minute of it. Take this to defend your humanities major to your parents, to your friends back home, to yourself. A magnificent experience.",
    "Yes, however, I would only recommend it to students with a particular set of reference points. In order to engage with the class discussion at a higher level, I would have needed to spend unreasonable amounts of time to do further reading a research each week to assist my understanding of the text as it assesses and critiques other works.",
    "Take this class if you are very interested in literary theory or wish to take a class with Paul Fry (he's wonderful and it is really nice to pick his brain with all the wealth of information). The class does often feel more like a 2 hour lecture with Paul Fry, and he does often quote from his LITR 300 theory lectures if you have watched those online. The papers are not difficultly graded, but I think that there isn't much to go off of because there is a lack of direction with papers. Fry however, is a wonderful professor who takes his students thoughts seriously.",
