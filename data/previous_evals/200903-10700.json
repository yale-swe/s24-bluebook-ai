    "I would definitely recommend HSAR 597 01 to another student. Working with Rob Nelson is really inspiring, and the themes and ideas of the class are applicable far beyond Byzantine art.",
    "Word and Image in Byzantium is a look at the word and image juxtaposition through the lens of Byzantine art work, specifically, illuminated manuscripts. The readings are heavy in Byzantine art history scholarship, which can be quite dry at times. However, the readings are varied enough and discussion open to make the whole class interesting. It helps to have a thorough knowledge of Byzantine art before taking this class.",
    "A somewhat scattered introduction to Byzantine ms. illumination. Not much of a focus on Word and Image when we were looking at Byzantine examples (though the earliest debates in the earliest weeks were very useful and could have easily been applied.)"

   "comments": [
    "This class gave me insight into how theories and arguments in any branch of art history are formed, how scholarship should be wide and how arguments should not be made by picking only examples that fit your theory. It also reinforced ideas I had about the cross-disciplinary realities of art historical scholarship and how different branches of study can help to illuminate the topic being researched and studied. In terms of furthering my knowledge of Byzantine art, I feel well versed in the illuminated manuscripts, their evolution and significance - but still only a vague understanding of Byzantine art as a whole.",
