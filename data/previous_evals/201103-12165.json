    "Genetic analysis is taught by a lot of good lecturers. There are no exams, so you may not actually end up learning the material very well unless you are very self-motivated. The problem sets are not too difficult, but I wouldn't say they're completely simple, so you should really take them seriously (there were 6 problem sets). Undergrad discussion section is not all that inspiring - I wish we could get the same level of discussion as the grad students. The TAs are nice and willing to explain things.",
    "Take this course, especially if you like genetics.",
    "For an upper level bio class, yes. Just be sure to have a solid group of friends to work through the take home questions with.",
    "The class was not very cohesive. It includes a broad survey of different methods of genetic analysis, but due to the fact that multiple lecturers are covering the material and do not coordinate lecture materials with each other, it was generally pretty hard to follow. Some lectures were very basic and built from the bottom up, while others resembled began with a cursory introduction and were full of slides probably cut and pasted from talks given at conferences which were rushed through and not given proper treatment. The workload was very light. A take home question around 1000 words was due every week or two, and a 500 word discussion section response was due whenever discussion section met, which was also once every week or two. The take-home questions were really open-ended and encouraged creativity, which was good, but would have been more useful had the lectures provided a solid enough background in the first place. Grading was very fair. I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a decent class with a low workload, but not to anyone trying to really get a solid background in genetic analysis.",
    "Sure, why not? Be aware that the take-home questions are not easy, you need to work and perhaps ask other people when working on it. Yes, not an easy class, but definitely manageable if you have help.",
    "A great course, not too much work. Learn a lot about genetic analysis. Genetics is much more complicated than what MCDB genetics teaches and is a very interesting way of approaching biology. Read some very interesting landmark papers. Just 8 papers\/short reading responses and 6 reasonable take home questions.",
    "Genetic Analysis was a good course, especially as a low-key second science course to fill out your science appetite in an otherwise demanding schedule. The lectures are sometimes difficult to follow, but the lack of exams is a great plus. Take this class with a solid group of friends who you can work together with on the take home questions, because they're pretty challenging. I think the grading was pretty easy though, but I did put a lot of effort into each question."
