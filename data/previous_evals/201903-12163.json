   "comments": [
    "The small class atmosphere helped all students stay engaged and encouraged participation, but sometimes the class was too small to achieve diverse group discussions. Additionally, the online homework from the book was not very helpful in cementing the learned skills, or at least not nearly as much as in class work, and it could seem repetitive or annoying, depending on how smoothly the automatic grading was working.",
    "It was a very engaging course and the material was well structured. Sometimes it felt that we were moving too quickly through the material and some of the grammar, in particular, could have been reinforced through repetition and repeated discussion or engagement in the classroom.",
    "It's helpful that this course met every morning, but both the active teaching and the immersion elements could be improved. The instructor could have spent more time walking us through different elements of German grammar in greater detail before throwing us in, and it would have been good to do more to create an atmosphere where everyone spoke, spoke frequently, and were pushed to do more in German. While that was hard in this small of a class, both would have done a lot to improve learning and reinforcement."

    "If one is looking to improve their conversational German and learn more about the country, this class is very interesting in helpful in that regard.",
    "Yes, this is a necessary course for German study and it helped me develop my language skills substantially.",
    "I would, but they should recognize that to get the most out of it they'll need to be self-motivated and do a lot of work on the side."
