   "comments": [
    "You will essentially learn a lot of medical vocabulary and not do much else. You can speak up in class, but other than that there is not much speaking practice.",
    "I learned how to give presentations and write papers in Spanish, which was something I never did before. The fact that it was designed for medical professions also made it very interesting.",
    "We gained the necessary vocabulary and background knowledge to describe and discuss relevant medical topics in Spanish. We were able to improve our writing, speaking, and reading comprehension abilities using a specific topic that the class was interested in!",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think my Spanish actually improved by taking this course. The expectations set by the professor are so low that many people do not even attend class, and those who do spend the majority of the time working on other things.",
    "writing and listening. wished we had more opportunities to speak",
    "I improved my conversational spanish and increased my medical vocabulary immensely, while also gaining insight into topics in medicine that I did not even know so much about in english.",
    "I certainly developed my knowledge of medical terminology in Spanish.",
    "I greatly improved my knowledge in both spanish and the medicine.",
    "I learned so much in this class! We covered many topics, ranging from immune function to cardiology. All of the lessons were very interesting and fun to learn about.",
    "I vastly improved in my Spanish writing skills.",
    "Wonderful class. Learned so much about common diseases and medical afflictions.",
    "applying Spanish to the complex medical field.",
    "This class was a great way to practice Spanish as a non-native speaker at an L5 level. The content was interesting, and the presentations were very useful in terms of practicing fluency. Honestly there need to be more Spanish classes at this level that cater to advanced but non-fluent\/non-native speakers.",
    "This class really improved my Spanish speaking skills and increased my comfort level with the language. Not only did I learn all about different medical disorders and treatments, I learned how to speak about them in Spanish, which allowed me to learn on two different levels."

   "comments": [
    "It is a great class to take to fulfill your language requirement without too much stress.",
    "It was a great course - good way to practice Spanish in a low-pressure environment.",
    "I really like how the course was structured because I felt that I was not only just practicing my Spanish, but also learning new information about health and medicine-related topics that I took interest in.",
    "Mercedes was great and incredibly knowledgeable, so she made it easy to learn (and want to learn) the material. The only weakness was that students didn't have to speak Spanish as much as typical Spanish classes, but it still required a very high level of understanding.",
    "This has the potential to be a really interesting, useful class, but it is not. It could be improved by encouraging more student engagement through in class activities such as 'interviews' with 'patients' and other activities that give students that chance to practice speaking.",
    "more opportunities to develop speaking skills",
    "Professora Carreras is incredibly engaging and personable. She makes sure to keep lectures interesting and interactive.",
    "This course is very strong in that you can make what you want out of it. I definitely learned a lot in this course and the professor was incredibly helpful.",
    "I loved the course. I cannot think of much to change it - perhaps slightly more structure in class.",
    "Can't really think of any weaknesses besides the meeting time.",
    "Excellent course. Conversation-based, and material is structured very well.",
    "The strengths were the material (very interesting), the professor (very nice!) and the level of Spanish expected\/practiced (good but conversational). Honestly I feel like the only way to improve this class would be to practice more- either more presentations or group discussions."

   "comments": [
    "If you need to get a language credit, take this class. It's super manageable.",
    "Definitely! You get to practice Spanish in a low-pressure way, and learn the medical terms in Spanish, which is important especially if you are a pre-med.",
    "Yes! Especially if you are interested in medicine or applying Spanish to a different topic that you wouldn't otherwise learn about, take this class!",
    "Yes! The workload was very manageable and Mercedes was great as an instructor. The class environment was very welcoming and engaging, and the variety of learning materials was always refreshing.",
    "It's an easy class which is why most people take it. I ended up being disappointed because I learned nothing and the professor made me very uncomfortable throughout the semester.",
    "I would 100% recommend Medical Spanish to anyone interested in improving their conversational and written spanish while also delving relatively deeply into topics in medicine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in develop their knowledge of medical terminology in Spanish or to someone looking for a fun class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great course to keep up with spanish and learn interesting material at the same time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in human health. Very interesting, fun activities and learning exercises, and not too difficult or stressful.",
    "YES",
    "Most definitely. Great way to improve your Spanish and learn very interesting info about such an important topic.",
    "YES!",
    "YES. It does have a reputation of being an easy class, but I got so much out of it. Yale really, really needs to have more courses like this for L5 Spanish. I took a different L5 but was very much in over my head because most of the class was native speakers, so I felt like I got way more out of Medical Spanish. Would 100% recommend.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you want to learn more about medical disorders as well as improve your Spanish speaking\/comprehension skills."
