    "I would recommend this course to another student. I am not a language person, but I do want to learn how to speak Italian fluently and it is a magnificently beautiful language. While this course didn't necessarily help me with speaking it did allow me to solidify my knowledge of grammar. It wasn't too difficult and it was nice to have a class with a consistent and foreseeable workload. Professor Iglesias was fair. She was not an easy grader but she was also not a hard grader and as long as you want to learn Italian she is happy to teach you.",
    "take it if you need to complete it for language requirements, you watch great movies here too",
    "This course doesn't cover a lot of new material from 110\/120 but it goes a little more in-depth a puts it all together. For me, it was less work than the L1 and L2 because it's less memorizing vocabulary and such and more simply using what you know. You watch a lot of really good movies and read some good short stories and such.",
    "Ital 130 is a review of the topics that were covered in L1 and L2, but it also examined these topics at a deeper level and introduced some of the nuances of italian grammar. It is about the same amount of work. There is more examination of italian culture through film and literature.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep increasing their fluency in italian.",
    "I would recommend the course. My italian got better, however I would have liked more practice with speaking.",
    "Review of all Italian grammar, some culture, obviously you attain better fluency",
    "A review of Italian 110-120.",
    "Only take this class if you're interested in furthering your Italian. A lot of it is a review of Italian 110-120 and the fact that it meets 5 days a week can get exhausting. However, all the professors are really nice and the program as a whole fosters a nice community-type environment.",
