    "ENGL 435-- Henry James-- was an absolutely wonderful senior seminar. I had read some Henry James prior to the course but very much enjoyed the opportunity to read his works in chronological order and to chart his development as a writer (from Roderick Hudson to The Golden Bowl). James is a difficult writer but I definitely felt that I had a much better understanding of \"how to read\" James by the end of the course. Professor Yeazell was also lovely! She did a really good job with facilliating discussions among all the students, expanding and pushing back against all of our ideas (in a constructive way), and making the class environment a very comfortable one.",
    "This class is a fantastic senior seminar. It was one of the best class environments I've even been in. Professor Yeazell is great at leading a section and creates a vibrant class environment. James is hard. Don't be fooled by that. It is a lot of work and will be one of the hardest classes you take, but it is worth it.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. Take this if you are up for a challenge. Not only is Professor Yeazell an exacting seminar leader -- there is zero tolerance for airy interpretation -- but the texts themselves are almost impossibly difficult to read, especially later in the semester. Make sure you like Henry James at least a moderate amount before signing up! Writing the final term paper is rewarding and a real accomplishment. Could not recommend Professor Yeazell more.",
    "ENGL 435 is a course on the novels of Henry James, beginning with his first and ending with his last. The syllabus contains seven books, which demands approximately 300-400 pages of reading per week. Discussion focuses on literary analyses of James' prose and tracing themes throughout the entire body of novels. Grading is based on participation and two papers that include secondary criticism on James. I would recommend this class to any student interested in modern American or English literature. James' work is important and beautiful, though at times slow to read, and Professor Yeazell makes him accessible.",
    "Henry James is one of the greatest authors, and this class offers the best study of his works with appropriate regard to both breadth and depth. Class discussion is engaging, and-- though it is a great deal of reading-- there seemed to be no way to spend my time more meaningfully. I would highly recommend this course, as it is the best course I've taken at Yale thus far!",
    "Overall this was a really memorable class in my academic career at Yale. The class covered a lot of material, which allowed us to delve deeply into the material and see the progression of Henry James' literary career. The novels were a lot of fun to read, which made it really enjoyable to go through the pretty heavy reading load. Semianr was always engaging because it didn't feel like Prof. Yeazell had a specific agenda that she wanted us to follow. While she was always prepared for seminar and all of her comments were very thoughtful, she also allowed students to pursue their own interests and take on the novel discussion in sometimes unexpected ways. Prof. Yeazell was obviously very knowledgeable on James and it was exciting to hear her interpretations of the material. Prof. Yeazell was a really inspiring professor. She often came up in my discussions with friends as someone I really admire for her knowledge and ability to make everyone feel comfortable in the seminar. That being said, I think we all still knew the high expectations for the standard of comments and essays, and this was a welcome challenge. Prof. Yeazell was also very approachable and made time for us. She was very helpful in meetings, and I really appreciate the time and effort she dedicates to her students.",
    "A good look at the novels of Henry James, expertly led by Professor Yeazell. It was a lot of reading but all enjoyable. The only downside was that we often did not spend as much time in the language as one might have hoped. The discussion focused mainly on plot and character. Little to no discussion of James's stories or critical work besides \"The Art of Fiction.\""
