    "This course provided an introduction to the historiography of early national America. Assigned books included key works in the field as well as newer approaches and interventions. The course assignments were structured to train students in historical writing and to allow them to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.",
    "I learned how to lead a seminar (propose discussion questions for a book\/articles and facilitate conversation); I learned more about the historiography of the early national period",
    "This course taught me how to perform many professional functions of being a historian including writing book reviews, leading a class, and creating annotated bibliographies."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the overall structure of the course, the opportunity to practice writing book reviews, and being given a choice of final assignments to best suit my needs and interests. I would have liked to see more scholars of color assigned on the syllabus. It would also have been helpful to engage more directly with the fields of black studies and indigenous studies as they are in conversation with early American history.",
    "I would have liked to learn more about black women, abolitionist societies (female led, especially) and religious movements. I think there's a tough balance to strike between 'classics' of the field and books that will actually appeal to students and spark conversation. But the people who need to read the classics will do so for their orals anyway, so aside from one or two, I would have liked the class to prioritize new research and exciting approaches. Sometimes the class really just stalled and I think this is because people felt that the books were outdated or unrelatable to their own work or just not worth reading closely. And if the class is pure discussion for two hours, it's not a good use of time if people aren't that engaged with the texts or the conversation."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in early national American history or those looking for a class in which to receive a broad overview of the field, perhaps for comprehensive exams. I do not think the course would be of as much interest to students beyond those two groups, as the discussion tended to be fairly focused on the content of the assigned readings and on the nature\/dynamics of the field.",
    "If someone studies early national America then it's a foundational course, but for people outside the field, the readings were probably a little tedious at times, especially Wood, Bushman, Newman, Johnson, etc."
