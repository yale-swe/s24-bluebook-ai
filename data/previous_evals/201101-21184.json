   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It is an ideal way to gain valuable research skills, while examining what is a very important genre in the field. There is a good balance between primary sources and \"theory\" materials, which prompts fruitful cross-disciplinary dialogue.",
    "Religious Studies 583 01 offers students opportunities to read South Asian and Tibetan religious biographical and autobiographical materials in conjunction with theoretical scholarship on the literary project of composing a biography. The seminar provides a forum for exploring the literary value and function of Buddhist life-story texts and for discussing with fellow students the artistic, political, and doctrinal implications of these materials. I would recommend this class to any student interested in South Asian or Tibetan Buddhism or in religious biography.",
    "I would say that it's a class where we read and assess the biography and auto-biographies within the Buddhist and particularly Tibetan Buddhist traditions. We discuss not only the dogmatic elements and issues that arise in the texts, but also look at the texts as literature. It is definitely best if you come to the class with some background in Buddhism, though it's not totally necessary. But Prof. Quintman also brought in secondary sources that related Western biographies to our class material, and therefore broadened our perspective on the whole topic. I would definitely recommend this class because I think it's just all very interesting!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend those interested in Asian biography, especially Buddhist biography to take this class. I learned a lot, and we read a lot of interesting material. The instructor is also fantastic."

   "comments": [
    "As mentioned before, it helped me think more broadly about the role of \"biography\" in religious studies. Also, the research project I completed dealt with materials that I will likely explore further in the future.",
    "This course was very helpful in offering a designated period and space for deepening my knowledge of Buddhist biographical literature. We read a fruitful assortment of texts and a useful collection of theoretical materials--all of which helped me to engage with Buddhist literature more fully. Professor Quintman's vast and profound knowledge of the materials also helped me to understand, absorb, and contextualize the literature in a way that I am sure will be useful for not only my comprehensive exams, but for research in the future.",
    "As a student of Tibetan Buddhism, this class was hugely important, especially because we read so much Tibetan material and because it was in translation. It got me thinking a lot about Tibetan texts as literature and the theological function of such texts. I loved what we read and it only deepened my love for what I study.",
    "This course provided the space needed to research the way in which biograhpy is used in the traditions that I am currently studying."
