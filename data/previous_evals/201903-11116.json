    "Exposure to new historiographical approaches from subfields other than my own.",
    "I engaged with some classics of the field (i.e. Thompson, Braudel), I learned how to dissect a book, and I learned about my cohort peers.",
    "I learned a ton about the methodologies and intricacies of the academic profession of history. I had no knowledge of the difference between social and cultural history, the important paradigms for various fields, or what constitutes a good study or not.",
    "negotiating material from different subfields, thinking about different methodologies, collaborating with other students",
    "I gained a much better understanding of the work being done by professional academic historians teaching in universities in the United States right now.",
    "I enjoyed and benefited from reading a wide variety of historical works, and felt that I learned a lot about the methods, theories, and perspectives which historians from different backgrounds can apply to their research and writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The instructors should be more coordinated among themselves to create a coherent lesson.",
    "Strengths: getting everyone to know each other Weaknesses: some of the books were painful to read (Mattingly, Moore, Pflugfelder, Smail) because they were neither important classics nor relevant to many people's field nor engagingly written. Also the discussions were really unwieldy in the beginning, though that improved with smaller groups later in the semester.",
    "The strengths are that the entire cohort gets to know one another. The weaknesses, of course, largely stem from its size. I'm not sure how to solve this other than to break it up into smaller weekly sections. Another idea I had for the course would be to let each 'subfield' choose a book for the whole class to read. That way, every discipline is covered, and people can be more engaged with the work of their colleagues. Perhaps if the first few weeks were reading the 'classic' methodology books, we could then move on to reading a book chosen by our colleagues in each subsequent week.",
    "Class discussion was almost impossible as a full group. Certain students dominated the conversation and sometimes the professors did as well. I liked the small group discussions and thought they helped the class greatly. The class was also skewed in favor of students of Europe\/the US and material on the rest of the world was included much less often.",
    "A strength of this course was in bringing together our diverse cohort to talk about issues that most of us care deeply about. It's my sense that the structure of the graduate program in history does not require as much breadth of knowledge of the field of history as graduate programs in history have in the past. This course is one of the few requirements that resists this trend, and I am grateful that it is required... even if my peers are more comfortable with the super-specialization model of graduate training preferred by many today. The course had far too many students to be conducted comfortably in its current seminar format. If two professors are to teach it in the future, I would suggest that each professor conduct his\/her own seminar based on a common syllabus. Each professor could randomly draw the names of half of the students in the class each week in order to form smaller discussion groups. Some care might be taken to ensure that each student is in the same discussion group as each of his\/her peers for at least a couple of weeks of the semester.",
    "I enjoyed many aspects of this class. I liked the fact that covered so much breadth. I also liked the types of assignments, especially the faculty interviews and the book presentations. However, I felt that there was not enough information provided about expectations for the assignments; I felt like I often went into writing the assignments not entirely clear what the goals of the assignment were, and felt that that took away from my engagement in the course. Also, while I enjoyed the large class size because it allowed for cohort integration, the class sometimes felt too big, and like there wasn't enough room for us to engage with one another on equal terms.",
    "Good to get a relatively broad survey of history as a discipline. I think we might be better served though, by restructuring this as a hard historiography course. What I mean by this, is that instead of trying to construct a given theoretical school backwards from an exemplary work within that tradition, maybe we should read more of those foundational texts. For instance, reading Marx instead of (or in addition to) reading E.P. Thompson. I think we would also benefit from having some STS readings, or something from the history of science canon. This could easily supplant the Dan Smail book, for instance."

   "comments": [
    "It is an obligatory course.",
    "The organization of the class was stressful. Students less comfortable with jumping in with fully-formed opinions felt silenced by louder peers. I do think it was valuable to get to know the cohort, but most of the readings seemed random and unhelpful, I never got specific feedback on my assignments, and the mood in the room was often bordering on hostile or at least anxiety-inducing due to an unwieldy size. Maybe this isn't meant to be a discussion class. If the goal is to get everyone in the room, perhaps the professors lecturing and then breaking us into smaller groups for discussion would work better than the free-for-all discussions that usually resulted in only the same few people ever speaking up.",
    "I certainly think every student in his\/her first year of the graduate program in history should be required to take this course. I don't think other students would benefit from it nearly as much.",
    "Yes -- whatever the shortcomings inherent to a course of this nature, the opportunity to be in a classroom environment with everyone else in the cohort is critical, both socially and intellectually."
