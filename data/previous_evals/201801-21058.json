    "The strengths are definitely the focus on the auditory and vocal part of language learning, which is something that most high school language courses fail to focus on. The French department at Yale is really great and they've definitely discovered a great method for teaching a new language rapidly. The only weakness for me was the relatively heavy workload during reading week and finals period where you have a written finals as well as an oral presentation within the span of 4-5 days."
