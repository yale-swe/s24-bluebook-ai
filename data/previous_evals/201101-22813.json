    "This was a great class, mostly because David Possen is a great person and teacher. He is probably the best professor I've had at Yale. His enthusiasm is unbounded, he cares deeply about every student, and he's also brilliant. He'll do anything for his students. Kierkegaard is a lot of fun, too, though I'm not sure I would have loved it with a different professor. Kierkegaard's prose is surprisingly readable and beautiful (even in translation), and David makes it pretty easy to understand. He also makes it meaningful even if you're not Christian or even remotely religious. Great stuff, great class, best professor.",
    "I wouldn't particularly. I'm not a philosophy major and not really interested in religion, so studying a religious philosopher wasn't really up my alley. But, if David Possen ever teaches again, take his class regardless of what it is because even if it's a subject you aren't interested in you will like the class with him.",
    "Kierkegaard and the Examined Life is a thorough and interpretive (i.e. not straight-edge) examination of the works of Kierkegaard, focusing mostly on his aesthetic works (i.e. his works written by the pseudonyms -up to the Concluding Unscientific Postscript). Engaging and challenging.",
    "Do it but only if you are good at philosophy and have a special interest in Kierkegaard. Read Kierkegaard before you do.",
    "The class is a great introduction to Kierkegaard's thought, and encourages students to consider its implications regarding their own lives and perspectives. Professor Possen is an excellent lecturer who is both interesting and caring. A great class for learning to appreciate a less famous philosopher.",
    "This class is amazing. I'm not a philosophy major, and took it mainly because I love Possen, but it was still fun and interesting. It's not really that applicable to modern philosophy, but it's an interesting take on Christian philosophy. I would definitely take this again, if only for Possen.",
    "Yes, EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "There is an amazing course in there somewhere, but it hasn't yet been brought to light. Possen is great, very enthusiastic, but he's too stuck in graduate school. The course is basically him teaching his dissertation, and it becomes both narrow and nitpicky -- you go over specific little passages, get into these hermeneutic debates, but you never feel like you're really sinking your teeth into the meat and potatoes of what kierkegaard is saying. Plus, the stuff with socrates gets old really fast. there's no deepening of understanding. the ideas -- irony, depravity, dependence on grace -- don't really get developed or complicated in any interesting way. also, you don't read all of Kierkegaard's interesting stuff, and you don't spend enough time really engaging critically with the ideas, asking \"is this right? is this true? on what basis are we supposed to believe this?\" Yeah, yeah, our reason is corrupted, but it becomes unsatisfying.ALSO: i'm sure there will be other comments about this, but possen gives a group take home midterm, which is quite an experience. i learned a ton from it, I have to admit, but its WAY more stressful than a normal midterm.That said, I enjoyed some aspects of this course. Possen is a wonderful guy, the TA was great, and its probably one of the few chances for prolonged engagement with Kierkegaard's thought. so think it over, if its been offered again.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class (or any other class taught by David Possen) to others. Kierkegaard is a difficult author to read, and getting something out of the class will require the expenditure of some intellectual energy. For that reason, this class is maybe not the best introduction to philosophy for those who have never taken a philosophy course. A little experience with any of Hegel, Schleiermacher, or Kant, will go a long way in preparing people for this course and giving them a background from which to approach the process of reading and appreciating Kierkegaard. For those who know they like philosophy, especially of the post-Enlightenment German continental flavor, take it! And if you do: GO TO LECTURE. That's the most important, and interesting, part.",
    "Take this course. It was light on assignments, just right on very difficult reading,and heavy on complicated ideas and general awesomeness. If you took DS, you'll feel right at home - if you didn't you will feel put-off, but don't let it discourage you! It was my first philosophy course, and the emphasis on Socrates in the first half is an excellent introduction.",
    "A very solid class that was a strong introduction to Kierkegaard, a writer who is very easy to misunderstand. The course was divided into two portions -- an orientation portion that was meant to impart a basic understanding of Kierkegaard's style of argument and his basic ideas, and then the substantive (for the lack of a better term) portion that was meant to really show how far Kierkegaard would take some of his ideas and how to read some of the more complicated and misunderstood texts.Dr. Possen is a brilliant and meticulous lecturer -- his lectures were frequently thought-provoking and challenging, and he really inspired me to engage with the texts and try to understand them in new ways. I really enjoyed his exegetical style in class, and he was simultaneously persuasive in pushing for his interpretations ofthe text and helpful for someone approaching Kierkegaard mostly for the first time.",
    "This is a great class to take IF you go into it with clear expectations. A student who has read Fear and Trembling and is expecting some clear, understandable explanation of an exciting philosophical worldview is in for a terrible surprise. Kierkegaard is HARD, (intentionally so), and while the entire course is interesting, it's not all as exciting as Fear and Trembling. The harder, what some might say duller, material is still great, and very very very important for a proper understanding of the thrilling stuff. Also, Kierkegaard is a philosopher who takes Christianity as his starting point, and while some of his philosophy is secularizable, much of it isn't. It's very interesting for non-Christians, like me, but I am someone interested in philosophy of religion at large. Possen is amazing. Go to his office hours AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.",
    "Absolutely. One of my favorite classes I've taken \u0096 really too bad that it's not being offered again. You learn things that make you think, that are actually relevant to your life. That's the point of philosophy, right -- \"still just\" a life? Professor and TA were great. Learned a lot, and learned a lot that's not going to leak out of my head after two weeks of vacation.",
    "Take it. It is a wonderful course and meaningful experience.",
    "This is a class which actually impacted the way I think about life.",
    "This class was a head-first dive into Kierkegaard's corpus. The texts were challenging but rewarding, though so much was thrown at one that it was often a little difficult to keep up with everything. I would recommend the course to someone dedicated to doing the readings.",
    "Kierkegaard and the Examined Life is like no other class you'll take at Yale. It is at once a philosophy course and a religion course, which exposes you to continental philosophy and challenges you to really think about your own life. Kierkegaard is a tremendously difficult philosopher and he cannot be understood by reading a random book written by him; indeed, as many of his books are written by pseudonymous authors, it would be conceptually difficult to understand Kierkegaard by reading a book in isolation. This course, under the tutelage of Professor Possen, allows you to really grasp the main thrust of all of Kierkegaards' works because you read a few key books and Possen's lecturing really helps. Although you don't read any of the famous novels (e.g. Either Or, Fear and Trembling), you read some of the foundations for Kierkegaard's thought.Consequently, if you are looking to understand a brilliant philosopher and in the meantime sharpen your critical thinking skills as well as begin really examining your own life (and your values, your religious convictions, etc.), I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. However, I would not recommend this course to someone who is only interested in analytical philosophy; Kierkegaard's writing is very indirect and wordy, to say the least.Professor Possen does a great job teaching the material: he is an engaging lecturer whose lectures are on point and informative. Moreover, Possen's teachings respect Kierkegaard's own desire for indirect teaching, for saying certain points directly defeats the whole purpose of Kierkegaards' arguments. Possen also encourages intellectual freedom and growth; he is a great guy to speak with at office hours.The TA, Asleigh Elser, is also fantastic. She gives great feedback on essays and she is a great person to talk to.There is a group midterm that allows you to really absorb the material in a non-imposing way; indeed, if you work with your partners, you will get a lot out of the midterm without doing a terrible amount of work. The final is very flexible and encourages free thought.In general, the course is not that much work: 50-100 pages of reading per week, a group midterm, and a final that they provide feedback on if you do ahead of time. The reading takes a long time if you really do it; also, while not everything is necessary, you should read most of the material, because you will be lost otherwise (indeed, a lot of the material is foundational material to help you understand how Kierkegaard conceptualizes the world and religion; you thus need to read most of it).If you spend time on the course and really process the material, you will not only understand Kierkegaard but you will be forced to think about your own life and religion. For that, the course is phenomenal.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in philosophy, questions of how we should live, or who just wants to take an interesting class with an incredible professor.",
    "An introduction to Kierkegaard, providing one with the basic tools for reading and understanding his work. An important course if you care to read Kierkegaard, though perhaps not worthwhile on its own for those with a passing interest in philosophy.",
    "Though this course focuses on Kierkegaard (with emphasis on his earlier writings in the first half of the semester), the class felt like more of an intellectual history course than a straight-up philosophy course. Professor Possen is a good lecturer and is very helpful; take if you have an interest in Kierkegaard.",
    "YES! It was a great class.",
    "If it's ever offered again, which it might not be depending on whether Possen gets a job here, you should take it.Things to know about it that you wouldn't get from the course description: it is an interpretive philosophy class. Don't take it expecting to write papers arguing back and forth on the merits of arguments per se. For that reason, it is a great complement to more standard evaluative philosophy classesand for more literature-oriented philosophers.It is primarily focused on philosophy of religion and theology. There is some amount of time spent on interpretations of Socrates and secular applications that don't have to do with religion per se, but religion is certainly the main thrust of the class.Possen is a clear, enthusiastic, and sometimes funny lecturer. The books are good, though sometimes difficult to get through. Possen does a good job of clearing things up, though. You may be confused at times but eventually you'll come out of it with a completely new understanding of Socrates, Kierkegaard, and Christianity.",
    "David Possen is phenomenal and his way of lecturing about Kierkegaard is riveting. When I'm reading Kierkegaard, I feel I'm discovering personal life answers... this class was rewarding on an intellectual and an emotional level. Even though it was 9 AM, I always bounced out of bed to go to it. Wow. Also the students in it were all so enthusiastic about the material and really wanted to figure Kierkegaard out. The atmosphere of curiosity was incredible, students stayed after class everyday to pepper Dr. Possen with questions. If Kierkegaard is still offered\/any class with Possen, TAKE IT WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT!",
    "A lot of reading! But really rewarding when you manage to get throughit.",
    "Kierkegaard is an intense experience, less due to the reading load, and more due to the subject matter. Kierkegaard is not the most approachable philosopher, but getting to know one thinker so well is a valuable experience. A great course, but best for those already familiar with philosophy.",
    "If you are interested in philosophy in general or existentialism specifically, I strongly urge you to take this course. The professor's among Yale's best and the material is fascinating and rewarding."
