   "comments": [
    "Through taking this course, I better developed my analytical skillset and my ability to think critically. I also bettered my reading and writing skills and my comfort in speaking in a group setting.",
    "Great insights and detailed analysis of key terrorism topics, as well as interesting case studies. Very relevant to any one studying global affairs or international relations.",
    "This course provided a great context for understanding various aspects of terrorism, terrorist organizations, and various techniques that states might use to interact with terrorist organizations.",
    "This course gives an excellent background in the theoretical side of studying terrorism. I gained a lot of knowledge in particular on Northern Ireland and the IRA, since that is Prof Weir's specialty, and it was incredibly fascinating.",
    "This is a fascinating course that provides an insight into the academic nuances and politics behind popular discussion of terrorism and counterterrorism. The most interesting aspects are Professor Weir's in-depth knowledge of the Northern Ireland conflict, her focus on the often ignored phenomenon of US domestic terrorism, and the great guest speakers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked how each week a student gave a presentation on the readings, summarizing the important points, but it should have been clearer what exactly was expected in a presentation, and the presentations often were overly long and detailed because of this ambiguity.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and learning about various aspects of terrorism. I think the presentations by the students were really interesting - especially Matt's. I also really enjoyed the majority of the readings and thought they were super relevant and interesting. The only thing I wish we did differently was focus slightly less on Northern Ireland because I felt like there were major terrorist groups that we didn't really focus on that we could have (e.g. ISIS).",
    "The readings and classroom discussions were all very interesting! Sometimes the presentations got a little too long, and there weren't enough questions or discussion happening. Perhaps having a more structured presentation format would help guide students. Assignments were all very interesting, and I'm glad we got to discuss them in class. Not sure how they were graded or factored into grading, though, and would have liked to receive some feedback on some of them throughout the semester.",
    "This is an exceptional course which uses case studies and relevant articles as effective tools to understand Terrorism. The guest speakers are phenomenal and the instruction is exceptional.",
    "This course could have benefitted from more specific case studies and analysis of actual government policies regarding terrorism. There were a lot of theoretical analyses that we looked at, but I felt like we could have gained more from applying those theories to actual terrorist groups\/actions\/individuals.",
    "The syllabus is excellent, a great combination of heavier academic papers, popular news articles and documentaries. The topic progression is logical and thoughtful. The background of students was relatively homogenous, although beliefs and opinions were pretty different. Prof Weir did a great job encouraging discussion and interjecting with opposing arguments\/counterpoints, but the class could have been geared more towards debate (i.e. the mock debate in the Clash of Civilizations week prompted more heated discussion than usual). It also would have been interesting if the class were more diverse, although that isn't in Prof Weir's hands. Also, like in a lot of classes the presentations can get long and boring, replacing interesting discussion - a time limit would be great."

   "comments": [
    "GLBL 274 is a solid seminar in which students engage with a great deal of academic literature on terrorism. The workload is pretty reasonable and much of the material is interesting, though some of it can get a bit dense. If you are very interested in terrorism you should take it, otherwise it is probably not worth your while.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in terrorism. I think this course is really well designed for students interested in the theoretical elements of terrorism as well as an academic perspective.",
    "Yes! This is an awesome seminar - take it if you can get in. Demand is high since terrorism is a hot topic right now. The weekly discussion topics are super interesting, and Professor Weir brings in her own perspective and experiences. The speakers who came in were also great and gave an interesting point of view on key topics.",
    "This is an exceptional course which provides context and a dose of reality to a very controversial topic.",
    "Yes absolutely. Bonnie Weir is great and the content is fascinating. Definitely a valuable class for every political science major.",
    "If you are looking for a good theoretical background in terrorism studies, this is the class for you! Highly recommend Prof Weir's extensive knowledge of Northern Irish paramilitary groups as a resource for learning about terrorist groups' organization and motivations.",
    "This course is fascinating and topical, providing a more varied perspective on terrorism than other classes\/popular discourse, which tends to focus solely on the Middle East. Professor Weir has a wealth of first-hand knowledge, as do the well-chosen and engaging guest speakers. The class would be particularly great with a diverse range of students - if most of them have a pretty US-centric security perspective, the discussion can drag a little."
