    "Yes, definitely. A great way to write your senior essay. I would take this option over all the other ones.",
    "If you're looking at taking this class, then I'm guessing you have to take it. It's not bad. Better than taking one of the upper level seminars. We only met about 5 times, and meetings typically weren't very helpful, but it's nice to have a little support group of students working on the same things. Be sure to meet with your advisor throughout the semester and write sections in chunks well ahead of the draft deadline, and your senior project can actually be pretty enjoyable.",
    "I mean.. you don't really have a choice.",
    "Yeah --advising is not what you think it is but its great and worth it!",
    "Write a thesis! You'll feel good about it if you take the process seriously.",
    "You gotta do what you gotta do. I'm glad I took this rather than doing my senior essay in a seminar, because I think that's a bit of a cop-out. You get the support you need in this class."
