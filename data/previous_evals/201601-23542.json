    "Great content info Final project is informative Good guest speakers",
    "The content was very useful, but the slide decks could use more text to point out the significant take-home points of each chart\/graph",
    "I really enjoyed all of it and learned a great deal.",
    "Class is a good overview of the healthcare industry, weakness is that the professor breezes over certain topics that he may not have much experience\/ or is interested in, and some students may find that frustrating because they would like to learn those topics",
    "Strengths--> a lot of learning happened Weakness--> need to do a lot of background research if no field experience",
    "I think more frequent tests\/quizzes would have been helpful in retaining\/practicing the information\/keeping up.",
    "strengths: Howie is very knowledgeable about the US healthcare system and has tons of anecdotes to support the points he is making; He also cares a lot about his students weaknesses: for someone who has minimal knowledge of US healthcare, the class felt unstructured at times and seemed to jump around between various very-detailed points - it was hard to form a cohesive narrative through the class lectures",
    "Strengths: Professor is very knowledgeable about the field. Weaknesses: Some of the early slide sets could be better organized, as well as the Medicare one. For the Medicare slide deck, a summary table would be very helpful.",
    "good: survey, material, howie knows his stuff weak: sometimes we get a little too off topic. the class is too big. I like that it is informal and we ask questions.. but sometimes its too informal. I am there to learn and I'd like to stay on topic more. Notes: Amanda Skinner should not be a guest speaker. Her callous lack of empathy is not an insight into healthcare, but rather a scary reality of someone who is now jaded. I do not think this is appropriate for a class of young professionals. She said \"we wanted to get good at readmissions, to avoid the penalties, but not so good, because readmissions are admissions, and heads and beds.\" This is not okay. This is grossly hypocritical to say and laugh about after you show a slide about the YNHH mission statement. I think it is cynical and not in a dose of reality, no margin to mission kind of way, but in a way that makes me worried about how YNHH views its patients. I hope leaders retain their empathy. I hope they remember who they are speaking to. I hope that even if the incentive scheme of healthcare is messed up and there are people who think patients are just money, that our selected leaders will lead and retain their empathy and not lose it or become jaded. It was sad to see.",
    "Excellent course. Extremely informative slides, engaging lectures and is the most effective class I've taken in ramping up on American healthcare.",
    "I think the final project could be improved. It seems like the majority of the presentations relied on the ability to understand the finances, although many of us could not. A greater focus on management, current events, industry analysis, policies, etc could have been more applicable. Or, a class to explain some of the finances...",
    "the course is taught with the assumption that you have a background in health care. For example, acronyms were used and it was assumed that we knew what they stood for.",
    "Good concept, tries too much"

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie's slide deck for this class should be a book. I deeply appreciate the broad perspective he offers and it's a pleasure to have access his encyclopedic knowledge of the healthcare landscape in an interactive classroom setting. The guest speakers were excellent.",

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Great feedback, fun, good lecturer, meanders a bit",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Absolutely a fantastic teacher, and a fantastic mentor.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is excellent. He clearly knows this industry like the back of his hand and can speak to any issue in great depth. He's funny, engaging, and responsive to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0AMAZING. Howie is an encyclopedia.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0he's great. He is honest about what he doesn't know. The slides could be improved since they are so detailed and its hard to pull the important points.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is an incredible lecturer and instructor - answers emails with lightning speed, is very knowledgeable and evidently cares very deeply about his students. Preferred the lectures to the guest lectures.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Good professor, maybe trim down material and go in depth"

    "Howie is amazing!",
    "This class is a solid introduction to the US healthcare system and is taught by someone incredibly knowledgeable about this topic. For a healthcare novice, lectures will sometimes feel too dense or detailed so I recommend reviewing the slides on your own separately since those decks often provide a more coherent narrative than class dicussions.",
    "its great. wish it was first semester. you might not have any new opinions about anything but you will learn about all the parts of healthcare broadly",
    "Great at covering the broad topics affecting the health care policy, econ and finance",
    "If you can get in the class and need to understand the underlying history, policy, finance, economics and sociology of American healthcare - there is not only no alternative to this class, but it efficiently prepares you to intelligently discuss and engage in healthcare environments.",
