    "Really interesting speakers. Awesome experience. I love this colloquium!",
    "I greatly enjoyed listening to the speakers throughout the semester and I look forward to hearing the rest next semester. It was a breath of fresh air to hear real-world people talking about their jobs in the healthcare industry. I cannot think of any way it can be improved.",
    "Strength: format of speaker series Weakness: highly unstructured, heterogeneous quality dependent on ability of speaker, areas of focus should be explored (e.g. career history and development, skills relevant for success in healthcare management)",
    "This class is excellent. The speakers are very well-known and interesting. I appreciate all the hard work that goes into bringing them here. There is always lively discussion.",
    "Helpful, could potentially include more direct health care industry knowledge through Howie and Ingrid to give first semester HCM students more health-related information that is severely lacking in first semester courses.",
    "It was fantastic being introduced to so many new topics in healthcare management. I enjoyed the talks and going out with the speakers. It was very rewarding and overall a very good time. Howie got phenomenal speakers this semester, and I feel enriched by the experience.",
    "I would like to see more women speakers, if possible!",
    "Strengths: structure of each lecture and the choices of leaders from diverse backgrounds and expertise. Weaknesses: scheduling more lectures during midterm week when we were very busy and less when we had free time such as the beginning of the semester or reading week.",
    "It is nice, but I think the room arrangement is a bit odd. The table setup is awkward at best and allows for seating of fewer people I think. The row seating setup, especially when the speaker has a presentation or wants to talk at the podium, is much better.",
    "Good",
    "I enjoyed the seminar. It was really great to be exposed to a number of speakers from differing backgrounds.",

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is great. He is funny and always keeps the course to an hour, which is great because he is mindful that students have other things to do.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Great.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Brilliant! Again, could add more health care industry specific lectures with information that could serve as a \"crash course\" for first semester HCM students. We're definitely lacking direct health care related information in the current first semester set up.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie Forman is a great host and finds very interesting people to speak during the colloquiums.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Good",

    "I think the course is great and I would certainly recommend it to another student because it will open his\/her mind to multiple aspects of the healthcare industry.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in healthcare. We all can learn from these leaders.",
    "Take this course if you want to be introduced to new topics in healthcare management that you haven't considered before. Additionally, you may know about some of these spaces, and you are encouraged to ask questions to the speakers and engage with them.",
    "Good",
    "executives from various healthcare backgrounds give seminars.",
    "Its hard to say what you get from this course. It is a series of experiential lectures from high achieving people with very varied backgrounds and experiences. It is a little disappointing that almost every speaker states that they became who they are because of serendipity or luck or having been in the right place at the right time rather than a calculated decision or choice. Still, it was educational to hear what they had to say.",
