   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to other students. This course greatly enhanced my understanding in the essence of chemistry reactions, which would be really useful for my further research.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in research that involves quantum chem of any form (which constitutes most forms of research in chem to some degree these days). I would note that there is an important distinction between quantum mechanics (as I imagine it to be taught in physics depts) and quantum chem, which we had here. This is very much a course for the quantum chemist.Again, I should mention how valuable the textbook (Levine) was in getting me through this course. It may not be a bad idea to recommend other texts for the course as supplemental help, but Levine's book is probably the best (especially the first half, where he develops the theorums of QM).",
    "Not a large time commitment, and not overly difficult. Cramming for the exams won't help. You need to be sure you fundamentally understand everything he discusses. Problem sets are much easier than exams. He is wonderful in answering questions one-on-one.",
    "The professor is very helpful. It is a great subject and a great class to take.",
    "I would summarize this class as the foundation needed for any student considering physical chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "To deepen the understanding of the nature of chemistry reactions in my field.",
    "I am a beginning student, and still have a lot to learn about quantum chem. Thus, it is too early to make a call about how well this course prepared me. Having said this, one big value I've taken from this course is that it helped to dispell my initial apprehensions about learning quantum chem. I think I can proceed with quantum chem with more confidence now.",
    "Good exposure to computational techniques.",
    "It gave me a deeper understanding of many of the concepts that I will use when conducting graduate level research.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the foundations of physical chemistry."
