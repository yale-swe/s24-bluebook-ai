   "comments": [
    "Blue offers so much beyond what a student might expect from an 'art seminar'. Basic skills in stop-motion animation, graphic design, collage, creative writing, et cetera are surveyed, but I believe the course offers concerns itself more with how we think and approach a certain topic or idea - in this case, blue - and apply that to a range of different artistic, practical, and conceptual mediums. Personally, I've been able to improve my presentational, written, and graphic skills the most, but I believe students get out of this course what they put the most work into.",
    "During this course, I learned to think more critically both about art and other academic areas. It lead me to explore different art mediums that I have not tried before including video editing and photoshop.",
    "- Challenging myself to unexpected and new things - Looking at objects, words or form in a different perspective - Writing personal content, thinking more deeply about how to respond to a prompt",
    "This course was incredibly fascinating. The professor really used this course as a way to get freshman acclimated to Yale and understand what resources are available to students.",
    "I learned problem solving and looking at a problem with an artists eye.",
    "By far the most valuable thing about this course was the exposure it gave me to Yale's academic resources like the Peabody Museum, the Haas Library, the Beinecke etc. I also appreciated the guest speakers very much, I was grateful to be exposed to them. I learned a lot about how to approach artistic discussion and critique, and how to think about art and design in the context of its creation.",
    "My ability to think and talk about abstract concepts was tremendously expanded. This course taught me to think about scientific facts and personal experiences in the context of larger questions of emotion, identity, and humanity. I also learned interesting snippets of science, English and math, and a plethora of blue-based fun-facts that I have been using to wow family and friends all semester.",
    "Before taking this class, I thought of blue as just a color. But now I know how blue is portrayed throughout history and how it plays a role in everyday life. Furthermore, I gained lots of skills on improving my artwork overall and becoming a better thinker.",
    "After I took Blue this term, I don't think I learned much compare to many other courses that I was taking. I have a general sense of visual language systems and the idea of \"translating something into something else\". But by writing short responses with scarce feedbacks and doing weekly art project without technical instructions and useful comment, I didn't gain any skill making art. This class exposes you to somewhat a wide range of ideas, but that's it.",
    "This class was an amazing introduction to the vast wealth of resources Yale has to offer. From renowned faculty to world class libraries and museums, we were able to utilize many resources that without this class I would have never found. It was a good exercise in writing visually, and an incredible taste of the world of graphic design."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The two most evident strengths of the course are its integration of Yale's vast resources and the in-class critiques. The former allows freshmen who may not be as knowledgeable about (or just have not have the exposure to) the plethora of rich resources Yale has to offer from libraries to ornithology collections. The latter allows students to develop in critical analysis of their own work and the work of their peers and also develop skills in presentation and concise and effective communication of ideas. One aspect the course may lack in is its concreteness in terms of the syllabus, which may be inconvenient for some, but I have found that to be the nature of the course and the flexibility of assignments to have shaped a more effective learning experience.",
    "The strengths of this course include the seminar style and small class size. Because of these two factors, everyone in the class had the chance to voice their opinion and present their work, allowing them to receive feedback not only from the professor but also from other students. Another strength was the differing backgrounds of the students in the class. Each person brought their own experiences to their work and it was fascinating seeing the different ways each person interpreted the same prompt. During the course, there were some projects that I felt a bit at a loss about how to approach. Some of the digital work required video or photo editing that I had never done before, and it was somewhat difficult to figure out. I",
    "Loved the course and the assignments Just some suggestions - for facilitating discussion: get people to discuss in pairs \/ small groups before discussing as a class, at least for the first few weeks, because it can be intimidating - would be nice if we could make sure that everyone could sits the table",
    "I loved how interactive and engaging this course was.",
    "I felt sometimes it was assumed that I already has the \"artist's\" eye which was difficult. But this course helped me improve my speaking and how I view an issue.",
    "STRENGTHS Variety of material covered Interesting assignments WEAKNESSES Vagueness of trajectory and feedback",
    "Strengths of this course were the amounts of outings and visitors. We learned from some of Yale's most interesting collections and a handful of earnest fascinating experts. The projects were fairly open-ended--something that was both a strength and a weakness. Often the assignments were so vague that we would all end up doing the wrong thing. It seemed like the deadlines and expectations were a bit haphazard, especially towards the end, which made the final project less successful for many people than it could have been.",
    "The strengths are that this course challenges all its students and makes them think outside the box. However, since I wasn't exposed to many art skills, it was a bit hard for me to get accustomed to this type of work. If there were a bit more explanations or introductions then it would be much more beneficial.",
    "We did all these cool things together at different places ( Cushing center, ornithology lab, Beinecke Lib, but some of them are remotely related to the color blue. Sometimes, the relationship between what we were doing and the purpose of this class is such a stretch. Also, there are a lot of technical problems during the class \/ after the class [ assignments that wasn't posted, projector that takes forever to set up]. Another major weakness is that the prof didn't give enough feedback, and even during the discussion, the feedback provided by students are rarely helpful with my writing or generating new ideas.",
    "Overall I loved this course and while I know some others did not the somewhat random nature was one of my favorite parts. We bounced around a lot topically, discussing, reading, and writing about anything and everything relating to blue. My only critique would be I think it could be more engaging if some of the earlier projects were more hands on, with perhaps a little less focus on photography. On the other hand, a more formal introduction to photography (very briefly) at the beginning of the course may have been beneficial."

    "Blue, or Art 003, isn't just a class for visual artists. It isn't a course about technical skill or artistic ability, but more about critical and creative thinking that I believe could and should be applied to any field of learning, including but not limited to the arts. I've had the joy of being in this class alongside peers with a variety of interests spanning from engineering to linguistics, and if anything, as an artist myself, I've learned so much from the interaction with these fields with the seemingly 'artistic' concept of blue. The concept of blue, as limiting as it seems, lends itself to far more than meets the eye. Starting with color theory, the course will take you through a myriad of applications of blue in our world, and though I'd like to elaborate, I don't want to spoil the course for the prospective student. Though the workload may seem a lot at times, it's also a course that what you get out of it depends on how much you're willing to put into it. Jessica and Stephanie are wonderful resources and general human beings and they are great guides into the world of art and world of Blue. One heads up is that the course is very 'flexible' and 'fluid' in terms of its syllabus - you won't know what your next assignment will be, so you can't prepare in advance. This is a great excretes in 'thinking of your feet', and has been really exciting for me, but if you aren't into surprise assignments, this course may cause you some stress. Jessica also tends to change and alter assignments on the spot. Again, I loved this, but you may not. TL;DR Blue is a class in which everyone will profit, and artistic prowess is not required. 10\/10 would recommend and was my favourite class all semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, even those without much a background in art. The course really teaches you to think about blue in broader terms and having an entire semester course on one color really allows you to dive deeply into the different meaning and uses of blue. The course covers a wide variety of topics with multiple trips to the different special collections and museums that Yale has to offer and definitely has something for everyone.",
    "This is one of the Yale courses that you hear about. Blue is delightfully strange; it covers so many topics, and the writing and visual assignments are so varied. There are visits to places and guests speakers. Helfand is passionate about blue and about teaching freshmen - this is the only undergrad class she teachers. One of the best parts is that grades are only based on participation \/ attendance, because Blue is about challenging yourself and changing the way you see or think about blue and broader concepts.",
    "Definitely. This course covers and expansive array of topics within the theme of \"blue\"; students can explore their interests in an entirely new context. You learn how to think about colour and its applications in ways you never thought of before-- why we feel\/say\/think\/see things the way we do. Art projects cover all sorts of unconventional media; don't expect to be drawing and painting like the average art class. If you like feeling \"intellectually uncomfortable\" and challenged in academic settings, expanding your understanding and analysis of new frontiers, this is the course for you.",
    "This course is a great learning experience for anyone, even if you are not particularly interested in the arts.",
    "Yes I would because it challenges how you approach problems and stretches how you think.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I didn't gain as much from the class as I had hoped to. A lot of the discussions consisted largely of intellectual grandstanding and the teachers and subject-matter did little to foster trust and cooperation between members of the seminar. The material was intriguing but not particularly engaging or fascinating and the course relies on a very solution-driven and confrontational approach to art and creation. The assignments were also far too large and lofty for the time given, so students were automatically in the \"half-assing\" mindset and found it difficult to fully commit to creative assignments.",
    "I would recommend this course. The ability to talk about art and science, as well as my increased confidence in creating conceptual work, let me be a better student in my other classes, especially other seminars.",
    "For a person like me who hasn't been exposed to fun and interesting courses, this course is very much a class to take because it challenges the mind.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend!",
    "Personally I wouldn't recommend people taking this class, since I don't feel like I learned a lot from it.",
    "This class was an amazing introduction to the vast wealth of resources Yale has to offer. From renowned faculty to world class libraries and museums, we were able to utilize many resources that without this class I would have never found. It was a good exercise in writing visually, and an incredible taste of the world of graphic design. There is nothing else like this class, and Professor H is fascinating and just a great instructor to learn from. Steph was also an amazing TA. Overall I would highly recommend this course."
