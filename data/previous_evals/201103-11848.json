   "comments": [
    "Honestly, I took this course because I needed a QR and haven't taken a Math class since I was 16 (basic algebra). That said, I would highly recommend this class to anyone seeking to do the same, but also to anyone remotely interested in how language works. This was almost certainly the most stimulating QR course I could have taken as a firmly humanities-y person, and was particularly interesting for me, as a foreign-language major. When I took the class, there was an interesting mix of Linguistics majors, grad students and QR-seekers, and everyone seemed to be benefiting from the class. Professor Deo is very passionate and engaging, and the workload is manageable.",
    "Semantics is a great QR option for English majors or people who like thinking about language. If you have experience with First-Order Logic, you will be very well off in Semantics. Steel yourself because the weekly problem sets take a good 3-4 hours each and get hard right around Halloween. There's lots of complex reading as well. I did all the reading until the last two weeks of class, my friend did none, and I can say that you can probably get by without doing any of the reading; the lecture handouts are pretty much comprehensive and much easier to understand. If you're still having trouble with the p-set, just email the TA\/Professor Deo or go to office hours.",
    "This is a really fascinating course if you are interested in how language works and havea mathematical mind. Ashwini is great at articulating the material clearly, and her handouts make the very dense reading possible to navigate. This isn't a \"gut\" QR, though, so tread carefully if you're just looking to get a QR."
