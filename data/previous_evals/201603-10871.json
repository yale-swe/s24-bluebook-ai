    "I actually learned grammar rules",
    "My command of the French language, especially grammar, was improved. We also learned a decent amount of vocabulary.",
    "I learned how to speak much faster and form sentences much better in French.",
    "This course gave me a strong foundation for most conversational grammar in the French language. My speaking greatly improved throughout this course as well.",
    "Comprehension of written and spoken French Idiomatic phrases and vocabulary",
    "In this course, I definitely developed my French language skills a lot more, and I saw an almost exponential improvement in the ways I communicate in this language. I found the course very interesting, and in retrospect I can honestly tell how much I really improved in my French. I was not very good at speaking French, but now I can say that I have definitely improved. The aspect that I think has improved the most is my auditory skills. This was my first time listening to someone speak French for the entire class period, and I know that this definitely helped me improve.",
    "My french speaking skills really improved in this course.",
    "I improved my grammar, expanded my vocabulary and am now able to speak and write more fluently. I am also very grateful to have been able to read a variety of texts from different francophone countries and gain insights into various relevant topics in French history (colonialism, immigration, WW2)."

   "comments": [
    "Some inconsistencies between what prof and course packet said",
    "My section was very well taught, and I'm not sure that I would suggest many\/any substantial improvements. More clear guidance on writing would be helpful - my understanding was that students were not allowed to work with departmental tutors on correcting essays. This means that, at least in my section, relatively low writing scores seemed to be the norm.",
    "I think that this course could have gone slower in some classes. Not meeting longer, but if we could just go over less in one session, it would be nice.",
    "I think the main strengths of this course come from the fact that the class is conducted entirely in French. On of the things I really liked about the class is how the curriculum involved readings from around the world and showed different cultures. It allowed for a more advanced use of the language because students needed to use French in a more abstract context. I think that the one thing I would want improved in the curriculum is making everything more standardized. I realize that language is definitely subjective, but grading between sections would make things more standardized so students know exactly what work deserves what grade.",
    "The class is run really well, and the professor was very engaging and understanding. He was very knowledgeable about the language.",
    "It would be helpful to write essays in class or have to turn essays in for homework more regularly. That would further improve students' abilities to write fluently. Other than that I was completely happy with the course. I really enjoyed the daily class discussions and the reflection on the texts we read. I also thought it was great that we got to do presentation in front of the class. That helped really improve my fluency."

    "Only if the student really wanted to take French, because it's definitely not easy",
    "Yes, I would. If they want to be better in French, then they need to take this course! It was amazing!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as a way to improve your French speaking and reading skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student especially because it definitely pushes you to use French in a different way. The class itself really challenges all of the aspects of learning a language: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I think the course curriculum is inclusive and shines a light on other Francophone countries, giving different perspectives in the ways we acknowledge the French language.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who really want to improve their French speaking and language knowledge.",
    "Yes! I really got to improve my French skills and I enjoyed the daily class discussions in French. I would definitely recommend it."
