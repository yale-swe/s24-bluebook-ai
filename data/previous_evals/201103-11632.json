   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It really applies the knowledge you learn in CHEM 333 to actual compounds. It is probably relevant mostly to inorganic chemistry, but I could see enjoying this course even if you wanted to be a physical chemist. This is definitely a very good option to the advanced organic courses for the fall semester.",
    "It's an interesting advanced inorganic class. Especially interesting is that you get to derive molecular orbital diagrams. Basically a good class, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If Nilay Hazari is teaching this course, it's the best 400-level chem you can take. Honestly though, make sure to take a class with Nilay before you graduate.The material is a pretty physical look at molecular symmetry and group theory, MOdiagrams, and metal-ligand bonding. Pretty foundational stuff, especially if you're interested in inorganic chemistry. If you liked 2nd semester pchem, this is a great follow-up.",
    "A moretraditional class that covers some deeper theory, while also covering the very basics of the subject matter. Strikes a good balance between quirky and go-figure-it's-useful math and straight-up chemical lore. Nilay is a good teacher, and while it doesn't cover much in the way of solid-state chemistry (i.e. any) neither does Yale in general, so go figure.Problem sets are well made and of a good length, probably shorter than any you've had in chemistry thus far. An incredible relief after the Pchem track.",
    "457 is a great upper-level chemistry course to take. The course covers a variety of topics and focuses on how to think about inorganic complexes and their characteristics. Nilay really cares about helping his students and is almost always available during the week to answer questions.",
    "Great class. Nilay is awesome.",
    "Higher level inorganic chemistry course. a large part of the course was point groups and symmetry applied to chemistry. Compared to 252b, there is little coverage of organometallic reactions and catalysis. but, it's not necessary to take 252b to understand this class.workload for the class was reasonable, and tests were fair."
