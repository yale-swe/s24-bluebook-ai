    "Critical analysis of literature and scholarship",
    "This course was most important in facilitating our question-asking skills, and gain a sense of the field as a whole.",
    "Having not studied the history of medicine and public health before, this course was an excellent introduction to the field. I learned a great deal about ongoing debates and changing paradigms in the study of the history of medicine and public health. Additionally, class discussions helped me learn to evaluate texts on the subject in constructive ways. Overall, this was an excellent course.",
    "I learned how to think about the choices historians make when structuring a book-length argument. It was a great opportunity to think in depth about audience, agency, use of sources, and other topics."

   "comments": [
    "Class was very must guided by student participation, which was wonderful; would not change a thing",
    "I appreciate the flexibility of this course--the unstructured nature of the discussion and assignment allowed us to build a good rapport among the students, and also to tailor our projects to suit our own interests.",
    "The small size of the class was definitely a major strength. This allowed for very productive and interesting group discussions and allowed everyone a chance to contribute to the conversation. The amount of reading was always manageable and fair and the texts were consistently engaging and challenging.",
    "This seminar produced, I thought, a particularly high level of discussion, facilitated as it was by Professor Warner's excellent and searching questions. The reading list was also excellent, naturally weighted towards recent work but also geared to provide a broader historiographical overview."

    "Yes-very multidisciplinary and wonderful opportunity",
    "Yes--a useful overview of interesting books in the field, as well as a sense of the questions that currently animate the discipline.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to others. It offered a unique look into the history of public health and medicine, as well as into larger trends in American cultural and social history.",
    "Yes, certainly, and not only to those in the HSHM track. I believe the class benefitted enormously from the interdisciplinary makeup of this year's group.",
    "Such a great chance to discuss medical historical works-- like a book club!"
