    "I would ask the new student to go to office hours if he\/she ha sa question. I would recommend it because it allows you to evaluate your high shool math class and where you need to improve before you move on to more difficult courses.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. I wish that someone, anyone had said this to me before I decided to take it. I didn't remember nearly as much from high school math as I thought I would, which proved to be problematic because I didn't learn a single thing in this class and was essentially unprepared for every exam (despite the days I would spend pouring through Kahn Academy videos in order to understand SOMETHING.) This class made me feel stupid and worthless, and these are feelings I would not wish upon anyone. Think twice before taking this.",
    "You'll learn if you have a good teacher but will be miserable if you don't. Shop around, don't settle if you want to survive.",
    "This is a basic math class and is essential for so many other subjects. The class requires some work and time but is beneficial in the end."
