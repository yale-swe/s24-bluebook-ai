   "comments": [
    "I improved my musical hearing, by practicing singing and dictations.",
    "My ability to sight sing and recognize melodic and harmonic patterns improved in this course.",
    "I improved my sightsinging abilities, especially in tenor and alto clef, which I hadn't used before. I'm most proud of my progress in keyboard lab, and am very excited to be able to use those skills.",
    "I learned how to perform chord analysis on western classical music and how to sight-read the other clefs besides treble and bass. I also improved my keyboard skills by solidifying my ability to realize a figured bass.",
    "Atonal sight-singing, chromatic listening skills, and reading in C clefs.",
    "In this class, I primarily learned to, and gained practice, developing my musical ear by singing and listening to music. Last semester (in Musi218) I learned how to sing on solfege; this semester I practiced solfege while reading soprano, alto, tenor, bass, and treble clefs, and learned the solfege system for atonal singing. I also learned a few new chords (including secondary dominants and the Neopolitan sixth) and practiced recognizing them in harmonic dictation exercises. I also learned how to practice and be more familiar with different types of rhythm, especially with two rhythmic voices going on at the same time.",
    "I improved my sight singing, dictation and analysis skills in class, as well as sight-reading and figured bass realization in the keyboard labs.",
    "My dictation and singing skills are greatly improved after taking this course!",
    "I improved my skills in solfege and atonal singing in various clefs, dictation, and figured bass realization. I learned about some functional chords, like the Augmented 6th and the Neapolitan."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was taught efficiently. Although many people take it just to be able to take lessons for credit, it was clear everyone thoroughly enjoyed the course. The keyboard labs were often tedious, though, and didn't really teach us anything.",
    "The keyboard lab was much too short. There were only 30 minutes for three of us to play and try out new things we were given. Aside from that, the class was thorough and very useful for performing musicians, and it fit easily into a busy schedule.",
    "I think capping the class at 12 or 15 could improve it's function.",
    "Strengths: The organization of the class gave me a lot of opportunities to practice the skills, which is primarily what I wanted. I thought assigning one lecture each week a singing day and the other a listening day made sure there was a balance of practicing both skills. The variety of exercises we did, including singing different scale patterns, singing a melody over a chord progression, singing chorales, etc. made practicing singing very fun. The dictations were also very interesting, and I thought the professor's emphasis on accuracy rather than speed caused me to gain a lot more from the class. I also thought the way he went over dictations afterwards was helpful for future exercises. Even though I was challenged during class, the midterm and final were very doable with effort. I also really enjoyed keyboard lab. I thought its emphases on figured bass and playing by ear really helped me gain both keyboard literacy and more confidence in my ability to analyze music using my ear. Weaknesses: I found 219 to be a rather sudden jump from 218 in terms of skill level expected, so it was a little difficult at times to keep up with the level of fluency expected, especially with reading alto clef, atonal singing and hearing chords\/inner voices during dictation. I wonder if more time could be added to the beginning of the curriculum to give us more adjustment time and practice with those entirely new skills. Also, I wonder if the department could design some online harmonic dictation exercises or find a way for students to practice--I thought it was a little difficult that I didn't have as much of an opportunity to get better at dictation as I wanted.",
    "The course is suited students with a variety of skill levels and different types of experience, so that everyone will feel comfortable and on the same page with the professor right from the start. However, some of the lessons get repetitive and I felt we could have covered more material in class. Also, the midterms and final included exercises in rhythm and atonal singing, which we hardly addressed in class during the semester.",
    "Prof. Adam did such a great job selecting exercises for us to go over in class. I am a little worried about my retention on more technical things we talked about (like the roman numerals for common chord progressions), but my comfort and ability in singing have increased since taking this course.",
    "The strengths are a variety of musical activities, and that a student improves greatly while preparing for the midterm and final. The course could theoretically be improved by more homework and more exams, but then it would no longer be a half-credit course, so I would keep it as it is."

   "comments": [
    "This class is very good at practicing musical dictation and sight singing, and so is a very valuable asset to all musicians and music-majors.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their musicianship ability, or to any music majors who need to fulfill this requirement.",
    "All musicians should absolutely take this class to solidify their aural music skills. From sight-reading to dictation to chord analysis, it was very practical and informative for a performing musician.",
    "Yes, this is a great way to improve your listening skill",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but only for students who are prepared for what it will be like. It is a big jump from Musi218. You will be required to develop the ability to identify chords and perhaps even hear inner voices, rather quickly. But the grading is fair and even pretty easy, and this class does offer a lot of good opportunities to practice singing, dictation, and piano.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning skills that will help them gain a better understanding of the music they hear and play, as long as they have some previous experience with sight singing and dictation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It has a very manageable workload, but I felt like I got a lot out of the course.",
    "Yes, it is a good course to improve one's musicianship skills."
