    "If you're already a linguistics person and you're interested in listening to Laurence Horn be a genius for around 3 hours a week, you should take this class. It's a lot of fun to watch someone at the top of his field do what he loves. But if you're not into a)rambling lectures b)linguistics c)courses graded almost entirely based on one final paper, do NOT take this class. It requires a LOT of self-direction and motivation to do the readings, because there's very little work during the term and a LOT of work at the end. Do not make the mistake I made and dodge all the reading. It will come back to bite you. But I definitely enjoyed this class a lot. It's one of those courses where it is 100% what you make of it."
