    "A lot of work but really great because you learn how to evaluate animation, moving image, and make your own animations! Programs can be annoying and tedious, but very rewarding once you make something you are proud of. Like any art class, you get as much out of you as you put into it, so if you want to learn a lot I'd suggest you have easier other classes or don't take five classes cause this takes a lot of time.",
    "Take this class. Go all out in 2D animation, but don't get too ambitious for the 3D (I mean, DO, but, you know, don't). You'll spend at least 10 hours watching tutorials for Maya, and still not know what you're doing.",
    "Great class but a HUGE time commitment... make sure you really have time to dedicate to the class",
    "I would recommend. Really good overview of 2d and 3d projection. Key word of overview.",
    "It is a great class, but be prepared to spend a lot of hours working.",
    "I would recommend the class to my fellow students.",
    "ONE HYPHENATED WORD: MIND-BLOWING. This is a great class, take it. You'll learn how to apply the idea of animation to situations and processes beyond an art class. At the end of it, I think of animation more as a mode of thought than anything. Unlike other classes offered by the art department, this class is not just about technical know-how (although you get a lot of that, too). Readings take you through the history of animation (and, inevitably, film too), and some of the theories driving its trajectory. You watch incredible examples of animation: everything from commercial, big-studio-industry ones to experimental art-house clips. Then you learn how they were done, and why. The professor is an astounding instructor and an amazing person: an encyclopedia of animation history and technique, who is always eager to help you, in or outside of class hours. The first half of the class is more assignment-driven, as you learn how to use the technology behind more traditional, 2D animation. The second half is completely 3D, as you work on an independent project. You will only get as much out of the class as you're willing to put into it--and it is so worth it. I have only fond memories of this class: walking back to my dorm at 4 in the morning with a vacuum cleaner (I had spilled a lot of glitter I was using in my animation), getting raw egg all over my shoe for another animation, sleeping 2 out of 24 hours to finish my final project and getting donuts at 5 in the morning with some people in my class. It's great; you learn a lot."
