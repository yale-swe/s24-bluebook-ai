   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to cogsci juniors! It's a great way to get introduced to some foundational works in cogsci as well as more recent research on a variety of interesting topics (which are chosen with a lot of input from students in the class). You can really broaden your perspective by learning about topics outside of your theme, and start thinking about potential senior projects.",
    "It's an overview of the largest topics in Cognitive Science. It's discussion based and great for Cognitive Science majors.",
    "Good course if you're a cog sci junior. Goes over major areas in cog sci, and gets you thinking about your project next year. Mark also makes sure that there's also a lot of flexibility if you really want to learn more about certain areas (e.g. pleasure, and behavioral economics) as a class. I felt like I got to know the other cog sci juniors, and this was a great plus. Also, for your final paper you can write on any topic that you want, and this is helpful as well since I think I pretty much wrote a less expanded version of my senior essay.",
    "The class was kind of a joke with reading responses you could do without doing the reading, an attempt at discussion where everyone was just on gchat, and then a final paper on literally whatever you want. Mark is a very nice guy but this class should really be taught by having different people from each area come in and discuss their work (like Perspectives on Science just for Cog Sci). Mark was really just familiar with philosophy and therefore it was hard to discuss other things in a very productive way. It is also very disappointing that they had a post-doc teach the one seminar for Cog Sci juniors instead of getting a full-professor to do it like are done for seminars in every other major.",
    "As is it now, I wouldn't recommend it. I don't think I learned that much at all. I learned much more in intro cog sci. This course is not a survey - it's an in depth look at 2 or 3 papers from several topics in cognitive science. I didn't find that very useful. The workload is minimal though.",
    "Take it, if just for the opportunity to talk brains with other cogsci majors whose focuses are different from yours.",
    "Definitely highly recommended to cogsci majors. You'll learn a lot about fields other than the one(s) in which you are focusing."
