    "How to do conduct original qualitative research through interviews",
    "Developed a sense of independence in how to take charge of my own interests, craft it into project, and hold myself accountable for doing the research in a timely manner and carrying out the finished project.",
    "Deep content knowledge in area of research Learn to write and conduct original research",
    "Doing personal research and understanding how to focus a large area of interest into one specific thing. Presentation skills.",
    "Working on my Education Studies Senior Project has been one of the highlights of my Yale experience. The independence and freedom we were granted in working on this project allowed me to craft an experience through which I grew as an artist, leader, and writer, and which allowed me to synthesize much of the work I had done thus far in the program.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the subject of my capstone, including how much I have still to learn! I also wrote the longest paper I have written yet, which involved developing skills in managing such a paper, as well as a lot of realizing how much I have still to learn on that front as well."

   "comments": [
    "They provide a lot of feedback throughout and really want you to succeed!",
    "Very independent with good support. Should have a full draft deadline before final draft.",
    "Strengths: really good at keeping us on top of our stuff with the check-in meetings with advisors and working groups; practice presentations were good help Weaknesses: Perhaps have the presentation after the paper is due. I feel like after finishing the papers, students have a better understanding of the intricacies of their projects and can explain them much better.",
    "Deadline was very late in the term, and students were all fairly burned out by that point, perhaps an earlier deadline, plus a full draft deadline would be helpful. More streamlined feedback system. Peer feedback was only minimally helpful. Would have liked an additional session on the presentation.",
    "Strengths are that there is as much or as little support as you need and everyone else topics are really cool to hear about .",
    "The \"capstone project\" as it is structured now fits a very specific project design - i.e. a lit review, or an academic research paper. My project did not fit into either of these categories, and therefore the assignments that I had to do for the colloquium often did not necessarily align with the tasks that I really needed to be completing for my project. One of the best parts of the capstone project is the freedom it allows each Ed Studies scholar to craft a project that will best summarize and enhance their interests in education. I think in order to fulfill this mission, the benchmarks\/expectations for the final project should be more flexible\/individualized as well.",
    "I think that having different types of meetings every week (sometimes with advisor, sometimes work group, sometimes advising group) was overall not very efficient. I struggled to feel as though I was on a linear path toward a single end (producing this big paper) and meeting with different groups each week contributed to the feeling of being scattered, and repeating things a lot without building. I also often felt that the tasks that we were set, such as having an outline by a certain date, or a power point presentation by a certain date, were also not always in line with what I needed to be doing at a given point in the timeline of writing the essay. I absolutely needed to have deadlines though... perhaps setting more individual deadlines with our advisors would have worked better."
