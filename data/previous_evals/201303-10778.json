   "comments": [
    "I feel like this is exactly what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for in a language class. A place where you can practice and improve but also where you are not constantly under unnecessary pressure. There will be days when you have a lot of work but also days when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much at all, and they all come in a clear and predictable rhythm so you are never caught off guard and always have a chance to do your best on things. The teachers genuinely care about the students and always put effort into making class worthwhile and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would! It balances out any non-language heavy course load in the sense that it is so unique.",
    "Honestly, only take this course if you are genuinely interested in using Chinese in the future. Like use it for real. For a job. This class is not for the faint-hearted, and I sucked it up because I never had any intention of going all the way to fluency.",
    "The course is a great continuation from L1& L2. It balances familiar vocabulary and grammar points with new ones very well. The homework is about the right amount and was always useful. While the class does require a lot of time, the workload is consistent and never becomes too much or overwhelming. The course expectations are very clear and teachers are friendly and helpful.In class, there is a lot of time spent repeating the lessons word-for-word several times which is hard for people who learn better by using the words in different ways than by parroting them back. Some of that time might be better spent finding new ways to practice new\/old grammar points. The professors could also let the class out on time. Most days it runs late and it is difficult to get to the next class on time.",
    "Chinese 130 is an intense language experience that combines excellent teachers with excellent methodology to improve your Chinese skills quickly and effectively. However, you only get out of this class what you put in. It is extremely important to be on point in class every day, and sometimes I would be tired and miss information and it would be very obvious on the next assessment. This is a great class to take if you want to learn Chinese, but not just because you think it would look cool on your resume.",
    "Great intermediate class. Appropriately paced-- not too much work. The teacher rotation helps keep the class interesting."
