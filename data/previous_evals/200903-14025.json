    "Weakness - having the seminar on a lunchtime schedule which for some people is the only time they can relax.",
    "great interdisciplinary exposure for students",
    "There were some incredible speakers. It was great to hear about a lot of different diseases. I actually really liked presentations by the faculty. It is great to see what people here at Yale are doing. The mathematical lectures were way over our heads and the one given by the past mph student was a complete waste of my time.",
    "This seminar was a wonderful opportunity to hear about current research. The speakers were diverse and interesting, and allowed me to apply what I had learned in other classes to the real world. For example, I understood how to apply statistical tests and study designs to research topics. It complemented the first-semester course load very well.",
    "very good to help students have a better understanding of what they can do with their degree, as well as for summer internships",
    "Your basic epi seminar.",
    "We need more food",
    "It was a good seminar and the majority of the talks were really informative and interesting. A few of them were not as good as others, but I suppose that is to be expected.",
    "The course was interesting in that it showed me some of the breath of the field. I especially enjoyed the HPV talk and the NYC needle exchange program discussionl.There are a few ways the program could be improved. 1) Get a bigger room. These seminars are just not as enjoyable when you have to stand through it or sit on the ground. There has to be a free room in one of the basement LEPH rooms. 2) Encourage the presenters to cut content. For some of the presenters, I felt that the content density and the amount of detail detracted from the presentation. We'd get so focussed on the leaves (that may be too technical for us to really get), that it was hard to see the tree, much less the forest. 3) More variety would be great. Dedicating one class per disease would be best, as it would let us see what else is out there. For this seminar, I think breath is better than depth.Overall, I really enjoyed the seminar and was glad I took it.",
    "Great seminar class.",
    "loved the seminars. great choices.",
    "It was helpful in bringing some of the latest topics in EMD into the limelight and giving students access to new research.",
    "The EMD seminar series was enjoyable and informative.",
    "Would enjoy more lectures on practical aspects, rather than research, of microbial epi",
    "Enjoyable",
    "It would be nice to have more tropical diseases discussed.Also, we should be fed since it falls during lunch, and the other departments always provide food for their seminars.",
    "the course was good. the speakers were interesting and the topics are current and relevant.",
    "I found the speakers to be very informative and knowledgable, and often were able to convey the topics clearly to students who may have been new to the topic.One drawback was that professors in the department often began asking questions before students finished applauding, and it was often difficult to ask a question once the professors began."

    "If you want to learn about current research in EMD, I would suggest taking this course.",
    "seminar. great exposure to multiple studies",
    "It is a weekly seminar...",
    "An epi seminar. Thats about it.",
    "The topics are varied and you are sure to find something that interests you during the semester (hopefully).",
    "Great if they provide lunch",
    "A series of lectures every Thursday regarding current research of infectious disease. I would definitely recommend it to students interested in infectious disease.",
    "The seminar is structured so that you hear one guest lecture per session. The seminar covers a wide range of topics. If you like the Discovery channel, I would recommend it. You go, you learn, you leave. It is pretty low-stress.",
    "Just go to class.",
    "very fun and informative",
    "A speaker series on current topics in epidemiology of microbial disease. This class was an interesting way to spend lunchtime once a week, though it would have been nice if lunch had been provided so we didn't have to run out afterward to try to quickly eat before our next class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "Overall, this course was great for getting general knowledge of a lot of topics in EMD.",
    "Interesting seminars about different researches and public health practice carried out by epidemiologist. Really good and informative. Sometimes the seminars tie in what is being taught in class which helps in the learning process.I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Every week there is a presentation by an expert in the field of epidemiology on an infectious disease topic. All students in EMD are required to take this course, but if other students are interested inapplied epidemiology, I would recommend the course.",
    "The seminar series was comprised of a great mix of professors and professional's in the arenas of public health research, medicine and community organization."
