   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the class to other graduate students (and I already have). It is necessary for all graduate students to think critically about their own discipline, and this class helps them do it through various sources and authors. The sorts of questions that are raised in class, like \"what is an author\" and \"what is the difference between text and context\" to use one very basic example, are questions that can be applied to all forms of literary study. Thus, I found the class enormously useful for raising provocative questions outside its own texts and discussion."

    "Yes, the course expanded my knowledge about semiotics, linguistics, and metapragmatics and exposed me to other forms of disciplinary inquiry, such as anthropology and media studies.",
    "excellent overview of canonical and non-canonical critical moves. only reservation: if we're going to bother to read the super-terminological and technical silverstein essay (blanking on the name--the sort of mission-statement one) we may as well take the time in class to parse it paragraph by paragraph."
