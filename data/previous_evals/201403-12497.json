    "Anyone who is interested in rock or jazz, or (as is often the case at Yale) doesn't know that much about rock music, should really take this class - it's so much fun, but also gets you thinking about the serious societal impact that musicians can have. There's a little too much reading, but you can get by with skipping one here and there.",
    "This class is a fast-paced over view of the lives and musical careers of Coltrane and Hendrix and the parallels that can be drawn between the two. It is very informative and thought-provoking, but a little bit hard to swallow if you do not come from musical back ground.",
    "Brilliant! Take this course! You'll love learning the biographies of these two musicians, and you'll love Professor Veals intelligent discourse on their interconnected lives and careers!",
    "Great, very interesting class! I took it cr\/d\/f though and regretted it... there are 5 papers throughout that aren't \"easy\" unless you really take COPIUS notes as you do the reading (I didn't find this helpful\/necessary.... just be aware you're gonna have to dig through readings to find info for each of the papers). So, deceptively a lot of work, but a really really interesting class."
