    "As with most seminars, the discussion could be slow at times but unlike most seminars, we were able to spend most of our time at the YUAG looking at objects.",
    "This class was pretty cool in the sense that we not only got to read about the objects, but we also got to see some of them at the YUAG. I liked it when Dr. Niu would give a brief overview of the history of a time-period at the beginning of class. It would be nice if she did that more."

    "I would recommend this class to another student. The discussions were interesting and the assignments were fun to do."
