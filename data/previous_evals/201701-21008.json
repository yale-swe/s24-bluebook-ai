   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of this class is that it is discussion based, yet Professor Knobe does a great job of keeping students on topic and engaged with each other's comments. It would be ideal if the class had more than one major assignment so that one's grade had more components and students had an opportunity to receive feedback on concrete work (rather than proposals) before the final. That said, it is great that students can really take the final assignment in any direction they choose and explore a subject that interests them deeply. Moreover, Professor Knobe d finitely makes himself available for meetings with students if they seek him out.",
    "Readings were super interesting and loved the discussion format of this class",
    "I wish we had talked more the first or second week about how all the classes were going to relate to one another and then recapped in that vein every week when we learned about a new theory.",
    "It is really awesome, not much room for improvement.",
    "The selection of readings for this course was excellent, and discussions were always lively. At times, however, discussions seemed tangential and overly speculative--i.e. students would just interject their own opinions about topics without making clear and concrete references to the assigned papers.",
    "I think the course could have benefited from a more systematic presentation of the development of ideas across the entire syllabus, rather han discrete topics that seemed to be themselves kind of scattered.",
    "The material is incredibly rich but this was even outpaced by the overall intellectual level of the students. Quite frankly the smartest group of kids I've been able to be a part of and Prof Knobe is able to give everyone time while being directed"

    "Absolutely",
    "This is a really good class and Knobe is a really good teacher. If you're not doing the reading then you really won't be able to participate, and that's a shame. This is a pretty fun class!",
    "Highly, highly recommend. An awesome course.",
    "If you can get into this class, take it. That's true no matter what you study.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has a sufficient grounding in either moral philosophy or contemporary cognitive science literature."
