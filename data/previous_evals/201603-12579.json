    "Basic concepts and experimental design in PET and fMRI.",
    "I was able to finally understand the basics of imaging and more specifically what to look for in assessing and understanding imaging-related papers.",
    "While I had little experience in imaging before the class, I definitely gained a better understanding of the PET and fMRI fields than I gained taking Biosensing. To the point that I might suggest making this class be required over Biosensing, or have Evan Morris teach the Biosensing class. Either way, Biosensing should be more like this one. I also got much better at reading research papers quickly and efficiently from writing synopses every week using their format. This has already helped me generally with my research.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze scientific papers regarding PET and fMRI studies. I also learned conceptually some of the research methodologies and technical detail behind each.",
    "By taking this course, I gained insight into how both PET and MRI imaging technologies can be used to investigate the underlying physiology of the human brain's response to drugs."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths:interaction between instructors and students",
    "The strengths of this course is that even though everyone is from diverse academic concentrations, the class started out from the basics, which made it understandable and engaging. Also, rather than just reading textbooks and learning about the technicalities of imaging, we read papers and analyzed them. I felt this was more relevant and an important part of learning science, especially as a graduate student.",
    "In terms of strengths, the course content was interesting. As a 1st year graduate student with limited research experience, it was helpful to take apart and analyze these relevant papers in a critical way. The synopses were a great way to really get the main idea of the papers. In terms of weaknesses, some of the papers werent always covered in class or there wasnt enough time dedicated to going over and analyzing the papers in class sometimes. Allotting more time for time would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: Included activities, like the design-a-thon and the debates"

    "Yes, this is a very fun and active course.",
    "I would recommend this course because I learned a lot and Evan, Michele, and Kelly were good, passionate, effective instructors.",
    "I would recommend this course. I felt that the input\/output of the course was optimized. I never felt stressed out yet I felt I learned a lot. It was also a fun class and a nice break from other courses and\/or research.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I learned a lot about how imaging methods are applied to study drug response and drug addiction.",
    "Yes! Appropriate workload and helpful content."
