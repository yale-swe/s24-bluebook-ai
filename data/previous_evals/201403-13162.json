   "comments": [
    "I would say that for the average student who likes fiction, this is a good entry into writing your own stories. However, if you intend to write seriously, this may not be the course for you. It seemed a bit too shallow and elementary to make a real leap forward in anyone's writing.",
    "When I see introductory courses, I always think it is a trick. But with Engl 134 I actually felt that despite the rigorous learning and the diverse students, the Professor guided us each step of the way. The readings are enjoyable (and diverse too), and I learnt so much about writing fiction that is captivating.",
    "Really great way to get into creative writing at Yale--there were writers of all different levels but everyone got the same amount of attention and care during workshops. Weekly reading and writing assignments were consistently great and fun to do as well. Workload wasn't bad at all and class itself was fun to go to every week.",
    "This is kind of like ENGL 120 part 2, in a good way. Reading Fiction for Craft is a class where you read the greats not to figure out what their deeper meanings are, but to figure out how the author engaged the reader so much that you spend so much time thinking about what the deeper meanings could be. It's a different way to think about reading and writing stories in an encouraging environment under the tutelage of a great professor (who also just happened to have written the book that we follow throughout the course).",
    "ENGL 134 is an introductory creative writing class in which you will learn the basics to creating a story. You will delve into the elements that make a story, read and absorb from masters of the craft, and create your own short story at the end of the course. I highly recommend this class, especially with Professor Sexton, for English and non-English majors alike. It was a class I looked forward to every week.",
    "I enjoyed ENGL 134. I think it gives students a great opportunity to try something new and share it in a relaxed environment. If you want to try writing fiction this a great way to do it. The professor is great and you get to read cool, interesting things.",
    "A great class if, as me, you've always dreamed of writing fiction but are only just now getting around to actually doing it. You can spend a lot of time on this class or a little. For me, the most important thing was that it got me writing, an ungraded exercise each week focusing on a different element of craft, then a 10 page draft and final story. Professor Sexton has clearly thought about the craft of fiction writing a lot. He's always helpful and informative, and also a nice, funny person to get to know who will encourage you on your way."
