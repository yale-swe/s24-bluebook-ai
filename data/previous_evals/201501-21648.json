    "This studio, unfortunately, was much more rough than Bimal's studio in the fall. The deliverables were often unreasonable and overlooked, and the expectation of the professors was for your to pull an all nighter -- in fact, they seemed disappointed if you HAD slept. I think the premise of the studio -- taking you from an abstract concept and carrying that through to a building -- is a strong one, but the way it was carried out was incredibly problematic and caused unnecessary anxiety and upset among the students.",
    "Brace. Your. Self. Take. Deep. Breaths. Don't. Lose. Perspective. It will be hard, but you will emerge. Don't miss Spring Fling because that's so normcore.",
    "You won't have this year's teaching combo, but if the next staff is anything alike this one get ready for sleepless nights and large periods of ambiguity. Hopefully in the end you look back on it with a smile on your face. Keep your head high and your eyes on the prize and you will be ok.",
    "ARCH 251 was a truly grueling experience. It was fast-paced and it did not go in depth nor did it satisfyingly answer real questions about architecture. I would 100% not recommend it, but since it is a required course I would recommend that a student taking it pace oneself and do what he \/ she thinks is best for their design process without getting too caught up in the unrealistic deliverables assigned.",
    "If you're a junior arch major, you're heading into this studio. Good luck, and don't get discouraged. I found this to be the most frustrating of the courses in architecture. Starting early isn't helpful advice for this studio, because the volume of work you will have makes it such that there is no other option other than to start immediately upon receiving a new project. If ever you feel like you can't finish the projects or you don't understand what you are working on, reach out to the TAs and to your studio leaders, the confusion in pedagogy and in actual project descriptions wasn't productive for anyone in our studio. Defend your ideas on your projects and if you produce something you are proud of, keep working on it until the end. Good luck.",
    "Welcome to hell."
