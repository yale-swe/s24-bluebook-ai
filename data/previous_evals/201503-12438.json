    "I would highly recommend this class. You get out of it what you put into it - so actually really read all of the papers. It's a rare opportunity to ask professors about their research.",
    "Good class",
    "A chill way to meet the upper level MB&B requirement. Guest lecture about a certain disease or disease-causing molecular problem on Monday, then individual or group quizzes on a handful (aka 3-6, usually pretty short) of relevant papers on Wednesday. Also a 10-page final paper on a disease of your choice. Loved this class, and loved getting to know my fellow MB&B folks better. Definitely recommend this course.",
    "An overall fairly good class. We met twice a week at the medical school - on Mondays a faculty member would give a lecture on some disease process studied through basic research. We were then assigned 2-3 review papers and 2-3 primary papers to read for Wednesday. On Wednesday we worked in groups of 3-4 to answer questions about the readings. The workload for the class is very reasonable - weekly readings, weekly group quizzes, two individual quizzes, one midterm mini-review paper (5 pages), and one final research proposal (12 pages). I think this is a n easy, low-stress MB&B elective. My favorite part of this class was finally having an opportunity to work with and get to know my MB&B classmates! The mini-review assignment and final research proposal definitely enhanced my scientific writing abilities.",
    "One of the best courses in the major. The emphasis is on basis science, not medicine, but you will emerge a stronger and more discerning scientist afterwards. I was surprised some of my peers opted not to take it, as the course features an array of extraordinary scientists and physicians as lecturers. Instructors are all highly accessible and eager to answer questions. Small group sessions on Wednesday evolved from stressful periods of time to actually very enjoyable shared moments of answering questions together. You realize that nine times out of ten, the answers you seek are likely brewing in the mind of one of your very talented peers. Make sure you have a solid 3-4 hours to read articles between Monday lecture and Wednesday session. If there were a continuation of this course, I would take it again any day.",
    "Take it. A solid, enjoyable senior elective.",
    "A very, very interesting course! I am glad I took this course because it teaches you something that I think all MB&B majors should know: how basic science research (the experiments and the science itself) contributes to our understanding of diseases and development of therapies. It is not as much as work as I thought it would be. You can get through the papers surprisingly quickly if you know what to skim and what to read closely. I recommend highlighting the papers beforehand -- definitely go to class prepared! This class relies on teamwork and it is a gift!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student - the way you will be challenged to think about and discuss scientific literature will help you in the lab and beyond. The workload is manageable and highly interesting if you're at all interested in the molecular basis of disease.",
    "Must-take.",
    "Because of this class, I know that I'm lucky to be alive. This class really does a good job of bringing together basic science and medicine as you discuss different diseases each week. You will become much better at reading scientific papers by the end of this class since you read about 3 primary literature pieces each week. I also really enjoyed writing the papers since they allow you to explore the science behind a disease. For the final paper, you get to propose a way of studying or treating a disease which gives you the opportunity to be creative and scientific. Definitely take this class!",
    "MBB449 is not the most difficult class you will take but can be one of the most influential classes you take as it teaches you to appreciate biological research and to understand the papers. Take it if you are interested in understanding more about the research process and not just the results of research.",
    "Take this class! By far the best class in the MB&B major so far (for reference, I am a senior with two more MB&B classes to go). If you are at all curious about how bench discoveries become reality, take this class. Just be prepared for not knowing where you stand in the class for a really long time.",
    "This class is basically a cool lecture series with problem solving sessions that get you to engage with the subject matter in a pretty low-stress way. Very refreshing for anyone like me - a science major but someone who learns better by working in small groups and talking through things. Would highly recommend this course to anyone in the MB&B major.",
    "You will get out of this class what you put into it. The structure of the class is such that if you never read a single paper, you can still do reasonably well (not encouraging this, just saying). Take it if you're serious about reading and taking the time to understand 2-4 research papers each week. Professor Steitz is a great teacher as always."
