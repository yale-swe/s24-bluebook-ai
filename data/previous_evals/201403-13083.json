    "Its a good class to take if you are looking to improve your academic writing skills. As an international student who had not been exposed to academic writing before, this course was very useful to me. Even if you have written papers at high school, I think the course provides useful insights on how to make strong claims and back them with appropriate evidence and analysis. My section was called Acting Globally and dealt with issues related to globalisation, cosmopolitanism and foreign aid. If you are at all interested in economics, politics or global affairs, I would highly recommend this section. Professor Gosselink is awesome too!",
    "YES! PLEASE TAKE IT! It's fantastic. Gosselink is fantastic. You too can be fantastic. ENGL really improved my writing and my confidence. Gosselink is so nice and supportive so there's really no way to lose.",
    "English 114 with Prof Gosselink is a hard course. You hav to put in the effort and time to do well. That said, you also learn a lot about streamlining academic writing and communicating ideas effectively.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's remotely interested in global affairs. Although the course seems to be more of humanity than social science, our discussions covered pretty much every facet about acting globally. The class can be slightly demanding at times but the work is totally manageable. The readings are well chosen: mostly counter-intuitive and really thought-provoking. And Professor Gosselink is simply amazing. She is quite open to opinions of all sorts but at the same time, she did a great job teasing out what mattered and leading the discussions to where they were supposed to go.",
    "Yes, if \"Acting Globally\" & the course description are attracting to you - this class will be to. Readings are interesting as well as informative. Professor is great. You will know from the first class during shopping period if this class if for you or not.",
    "Acting Globally focuses on what is means to be a global citizen. In addition, there is in-depth analysis of foreign aid intervention in underdeveloped countries. I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. The professor is amazing and the material opened my eyes to many new areas of study."
