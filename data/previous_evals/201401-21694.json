    "Health of the Public is a good introduction to public health, especially if you're more interested in social sciences than hard sciences. It's broad but interesting. The workload is not at all overwhelming, although the final (two 7-page papers) is tedious. There were two midterms and regular reading assignments that you really must do in order to do well on the exams, but they aren't unmanageable. I would recommend starting to course Cr\/D. Many people in my class started off the term with the impression that this class was a gut and then experiencing a rude awakening when we received our first midterms back (the average was an 84 and quite a few people failed).",
    "TAKE IT!!!!! It is so worth it. So many interesting topics and new ways to see health care, which is a topic that effects all of our lives intimately at one point or another. Christakis is awesome also.",
    "Make room in your schedule and take this class. If you can't then at least audit it.",
    "Very happy I took this course - I almost didn't because I didn't want a class with section senior year, but the material was worth it. It's everything I wanted to learn about medicine before medical school. Take it - it's not a terribly hard workload, and it will make you think about issues in ways you didn't before.",
    "credit\/d",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!! If you have any interest in public health and\/or medicine at all--it's so interesting!",
    "Definitely take this class. You learn a lot of new concepts and the workload is reasonable.",
    "Great class, fascinating material, well-presented. Professor Christakis is incredible.",
    "I recommend this class. Beware though, the final take home exam is much lengthier than it should be.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class. The stuff you will learn is incredibly relevant and it's taught in a way that is interesting and fun to learn. Professor Christakis is an incredible lecturer and you are missing out if you don't take this amazing class!",
    "I'd recommend it! Great intro into public health, not as sciency as you might anticipate. Makes you think about your life differently.",
    "Yes. Take it. And now: I was shocked at how many pre-meds were in this class; i didn't know that it was on some list of \"recommended pre-med sociology courses,\" since I'm about as far removed from pre-med life as they come. I took the class because I have a strong interest in public health (ok, so maybe i'm not that far removed) and I wanted to see what sociology would be like. This is in some ways a survey course on disease in America. In other ways, its a course about human nature, and how people interact with one another. Since I'm a super nerd, I particularly enjoyed the lecture on health insurance, but for people who like more drama and excitement, you will definitely get that out of this class. Take this class because you will learn. You will learn important information about world-wide health systems and the people they affect. Take it if you want to be a politician, or a doctor, or a lobbyist, or a good person who engages with the world and sees big problems in new and enlightening ways. Christakis is a phenomenal lecturer (also all the lectures are posted online...though there is major incentive to attend in person, since you can ask questions) who genuinely cares about the success of his students. You won't be sorry.",
    "A fantastic course. I highly recommend for anyone interested in sociology (understanding how human society works), public health, a medical career, or anyone else just interested in a great intro-level survey course taught by one of Yale's best professors. Professor Christakis is outstanding in every way - his lectures are riveting, and may change your opinions over the course of the semester. I expect that this course will grow in coming semesters, as it is a true gem.",
    "DEFINITELY take HLTH 140. The class is one of the best I've taken at Yale and Professor Christakis is AMAZING. He's a brilliant man and his lectures were extremely engaging, thought-provoking, and entertaining. Most importantly, he's unbelievably kind and caring: he always encouraged us to ask questions and attend office hours. Overall, the class was an incredible experience. I learned so many important lessons about public health and about life. I also had the once-in-a-lifetime privilege of learning from someone as insightful, passionate, and humble as Professor Christakis.",
    "Enjoyable course that I would recommend to other students. The material is very interesting for the most part and Christakis is a good lecturer. However, I wasn't nearly as enamored as other students with the course as I found Christakis to be a bit over-dramatic at times. I felt that he often emphasized the stats\/materials that helped support his point and could be quite biased. A sort of \"cult\" seemed to develop in the class of kids that worshiped Christakis and took what he said as the \"ultimate truth\" which could be frustrating and annoying.",
    "Good class; gives you a lot to think about. Christakis is a great professor! The two midterms were fair but the take-home final was a bit of a mouthful for those with many other exams during finals period. I'd recommend taking it Cr\/D\/Fail.",
    "Would potentially recommend to another student if they find the material worthwhile and interesting.",
    "Health of the Public is a course for anyone--not just global affairs majors. It is extremely relevant to our daily lives and you learn a lot about policy and its shortcomings. Basically, the class is just doing a bunch of readings, going to lecture and section, and taking the exams. There is no work to turn in throughout. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. It's not a ton of work, but super interesting.",
    "Great lecture, low workload as long as you pay attention in lecture, and hugely important ideas for real life. TAKE IT.",
    "This is a fascinating class, especially the sections about social networks (Professor Christakis' own research). Readings and exams are completely reasonable.",
    "Good course to take credit d",
    "This was the first year this class was taught, and I think it will become one of those \"famous\" classes that everyone takes. IT explores public health so broadly that even if you aren't particularly interested in one class, you'll love the next one. Look at the syllabus to see what I mean about the diversity of each class. The reading seems like a lot, but you can start to discern what readings to do (at least skim all of the books) and he talks about most of them in lecture. Everybody should at least shop this course; I looked forward to every class and left every class fascinated.",
    "This class is good for anyone interested in health because of the variety of topics that it covers. I would recommend this class to others.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I can say with confidence that this is my most favorite class that I have taken at Yale. If you have any interest in public health, are pre-med, or want to learn more about how your health is affected by things other than just big medicine, you should absolutely take this. I learned so much, and Professor Christakis is brilliant and a phenomenal lecturer. I really could not rave about this class enough.",
    "The final exam is ridiculous. Only take it if you no longer have a 40% take home, it is 2 essays!! The Professor is really full of himself, full of self-promotion and thinks he's a god. But class was well run and interesting, and he's a good lecturer, even if every class is a prepared speech he just reads",
    "I recommend this class to everyone I meet. I think it is one of the best courses that Yale has to offer. It is about a subject relevant to everyone and it takes and angle that people are rarely exposed to. Health of the Public is a class about the various factors affecting the overall health of our nation.",
    "Whether you are pre-med, interested in public health, or interested in public health, take this course, it will give you a whole new perspective on medicine that you may not have the opportunity to learn in the future. The course touches upon the shortcomings of medicine, how we can improve, and factors that influence health outcomes outside of biological influences. The course is very enlightening, and definitely worth taking.",
    "This class is pretty great. The class is built around a few really cool topics, one of which is Christakis' own research on how social networks affect health. Being able to hear about that research (which really is cutting edge) from the man who is conducting it is really great. There are a couple other topics that are truly fascinating, but then some filler topics in between that are very straight forward and boring (e.g. tobacco use in the US, obesity in the US etc.). The reading for the course isn't terrible and is actually pretty interesting in general. There are two tests during the semester, both of which are very reasonable and easy to study for. The only other assignment is a take-home final, which required 16 pages of writing in about 10 days. I anticipated the final being a much bigger annoyance than it ended up being. The prompts were pretty interesting and the essays ended up being bearable to right, but it takes some time (definitely much more than studying for a standard sit-down final). Christakis is a good lecturer and going to class is interesting in general.",
    "This is by far one of the best classes at Yale. If you don't take it, you are truly missing out. This class made my entire semester. I learned so much I will be using in everyday life and in my career in the future.",
    "Would definitely recommend the course if you have an interest in better understanding the factors that determine good health.",
    "I came into this class with almost no background in public policy and can now have an intelligent conversation on the social structures that shape health on the individual and population level. Nick is a charismatic lecturer as well!",
    "The perfect class.",
    "A lot of work, but the information you gain out of it along with an engaging professor makes it well worth it",
    "Yes. Take it if you are interested in Public Health. Take it if you aren't. This class is a must take for everyone.",
    "I think SOCY 126 was a very interesting course. The materials presented were highly relevant and interconnected very well. I would recommend this course to anyone considering medicine, public health, or curious about sociology.",
    "Anyone who wants to be a clinician or wants to go into public health should absolutely take this course! Although the actual science matters in these fields, Professor Christakis will also prove to you how important the social aspects are in health as well. Take this course!",
    "Definitely take this class, even if you're not remotely interested in public health. I was not, and I took the class and am now considering a career in the field. Professor Christakis is brilliant and he's an amazing lecturer. Attend class just to hear him share his passion. Do the readings--it may not seem like during the class that that is necessary but you'll thank me when it comes to the final. TAKE THE CLASS",
    "I would recommend this course. Definitely makes you rethink the way that medicine works today. The work is manageable and the expectations are more or less clear. Lectures being online is a plus.",
    "Health of the Public is one of the best courses at Yale, taught by one of the best professors at Yale. To take this course is to seize an education. Nicholas Christakis is truly one of a kind. He is the epitome of a professor. He is a phenomenal lecturer, he cares tremendously about his students, and he is brilliant. Yale is extraordinarily fortunate to have him.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "HLTH 140 was a fantastic course. Professor Christakis is a wonderful professor! He was very engaging and open to meeting with students or answering questions in a non-intimidating fashion. He added fun things and made jokes about the content too. Very enthused an a great lecturer. The only downside was the take-home final, which was extremely lengthy. Also, there is lots of reading, so make sure that you read all of it because it will be necessary to stay on top of things to do well on the midterms and final.",
    "No, thought some of the material is interesting, there are better sociology classes out there. Lots of work, ridiculous expectations for participation and attendance, the head TA keeps tabs on students and professor is not willing to work with students.",
    "A fairly easy course, if you keep up with the readings. Professor Christakis is definitely stronger on teaching some subjects than others (and on some he tends to be very opinionated)-- but overall, a good introduction to public health from a sociological perspective.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn a lot of things and actually remember them. Great lectures, fair tests, take-home final was a little too long though",
    "You would be a fool not to take this class. Professor Christakis is an incredibly engaging, charismatic, and informative lecturer. Whether or not you are planning to be a doctor, this class will revolutionize the way you think about medicine and public health. TAKE IT RIGHT NOW!",
    "Definitely take SOCY 126 if you have any interest in public health or healthcare in general. It's a great class whether you think you know a lot about health or if you think you know nothing. Prof. Christakis is an incredible lecturer, and he is willing to help anyone with a question about the course or about things not covered in the course. It's a fabulous class that I would recommend to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is interesting, fun and you take away a lot of relevant information about networks and how people interact that is applicable to all fields. Only problem is there is a lot of reading outside of class and it\u2019s hard to keep up with. Overall though, take this course.",
    "This class is great, especially for premeds because it allows you to view medicine from a different angle than usual. It makes you think about the world around you differently and is definitely worth taking.",
    "This course really makes you think about whether you want to pursue a health profession or not. I would highly recommend anyone who is considering a career in medicine or public health to take this course.",
    "SOCY 126 is a fantastic, fantastic course and I would absolutely recommend it. The class focuses mostly on the socioeconomic aspects of health--how things like our neighborhoods, our social networks, etc. impact our health in ways far deeper and more complicated than we typically consider. I walked away from each lecture wowed by what I had learned, and I walked away from the course really feeling that I had a new understanding of the world and of the health of the public. I was interested in public health before, but taking this class has solidified my desire to work in that type of field. Considering that it is only a semester-long course, I felt that I learned an incredible amount. Each lecture was centered on a different theme\/topic, but they meshed together really well. It was clear that Prof Christakis and the TAs put a lot of thought and effort into developing the course\/readings\/sequence. Prof Christakis is really great, as are the TAs, and it really felt that they were invested in the class and wanted us to truly learn and interact with what we were learning. This gave the class an interesting atmosphere that most lectures don't have--Prof Christakis encouraged us to talk during lecture, and section frequently asked us to think about how our own lives intersect with what we learned. There are ~100 pages of reading a week, which are pretty much always very interesting and always highly relevant to the course. There are 2 midterms and a take-home final (pick 2 out of 4 essay questions, 8 pages each). These definitely required a knowledge of the texts and a good grasp of the class, as they asked us to interpret\/interact with what we learned rather than simply reiterate it. SOCY 126 is a very unique course and something I would recommend to anyone (especially anyone looking for something a bit different). It is certainly not just for pre-meds (which I am not). I ended the semester feeling that I truly had a new perspective and knowing that I had much to think about\/consider.",
    "Yes!! This was an awesome class! The material is really interesting and ties together nicely, even though we talk about a lot of different things. Christakis is an amazing lecturer too. He's actually just a great professor too, seriously. He loves talking to students and honestly cares about us. He's open to meeting and has office hours where even if you don't have anything to ask, he'll talk about something or the other that'll keep your interest. I also really enjoyed his modern references and little tidbits during lecture too. There's a fair bit of reading and for the first midterm, I didn't think they explained very clearly what they wanted us to write, so it was harder than I thought. However, they definitely made sure we understood the second time so it was fine. The final was really long, but I think everyone gave that as feedback so hopefully they'll change it for next year\/semester.",
    "This class is a MUST-TAKE, regardless of the major! The each course in the curriculum was well-packaged and well-delivered. Christakis is passionate, articulate, dedicated, and has a great sense of humor. I loved that he valued student interaction during the classes themselves. His group office hours are incredible, and he is not afraid to voice his opinions on personal (relationships, college, etc) and professional (career choices, course material)matters. The TAs are handpicked and AMAZING. If given the choice, I'd go to section over not going to section any day. Every class blew my mind. TAKE IT.",
    "Take this class. Take it. It is fun, engaging, and you'll learn a whole lot that is relevant to whatever you are studying. Professor Christakis is absolutely fantastic. I want him to teach all of my classes!",
    "This is an excellent course, with really interesting and relevant material presented in an organized and logical way. I would easily consider it the best course I've taken at Yale. I would recommend the course to anyone, not just premed or socy majors. It's fascinating and Prof. Christakis is engaging and funny. The readings are reasonable, but you defiantly have to do them to keep up in class\/for the exams. Don't get too behind or the work might become overwhelming.",
    "Take it! It is great for anyone wondering how medicine plays a role in society and for anyone wondering about the effect of our social settings on our health (like how having friends can affect your ability to fight a cold)",
    "Health of the Public was, overall, a very interesting class, and I would recommend it to another student. The tests are reasonable. The final paper was actually quite interesting to write. And the class, overall, provides a perspective on the health system that many have probably not encountered before. Professor Christakis is an engaging lecture and very interested in his students and his teaching. Overall: Recommended.",
    "It was a very good class for anyone, not just Pre-Med students. It really opens your eyes to how the health care system really works and that there needs to be improvement. It is a little difficult if you are used to mainly science classes, but it is very interesting. It also allows a lot of room for forming your own opinions.",
    "Excellent course. The ideal college lecture.",
    "Great class! Grades are not clear until the end so that could be stressful",
    "TAKE IT! YOU WILL THANK YOURSELF FOREVER",
    "i would recommend this for anyone interested in medicine\/social justice. lecture is pretty fun and most of the topics feel truly important\/timely",
    "100% RECOMMEND. But take it Credit\/D if you're taking it as a 5th class. It's a GREAT lecture with an INCREDIBLE professor and a very very interesting topic that makes you question all you've thought about modern medicine before. Christakis isn't biased and tries to always give both sides of an argument with equal weight and equal facts. Take it, take it, take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. There was a lot of reading but the topics were interesting and you get a low out of the class.",
    "Take it! Do the readings--they're interesting!",
    "Health of the Public is a class that talks about how medicine helps and hurts the public, and what other methods might better work for improving health. (Like how stopping people from smoking is a better method than treating lung cancer for example). It's a really cool class and the lectures on how social networks affect our lives are SO interesting, but Professor Christakis is what makes the class great. He's so enthusiastic about the material and he clearly cares about his students a lot. Even if you're not totally interested in the subject I would recommend at least shopping this class - Christakis makes it very interesting. That being said, I would definitely not recommend this class as your first sociology class. I spoke with a lot of other students in the class and everyone who had taken sociology classes before had a significantly easier time with the readings and tests.",
    "Health of the Public is a fantastic course. Take it for Professor Christakis- a phenomenal lecturer and an equally invested and engaging teacher to meet with during his open office hour sessions. As a premedical science major, I was initially drawn to his background as a terminal care doctor, but then found myself growing increasingly interested in the world of network science. Prof. Christakis conveys information with an infectious enthusiasm, but never forces you to accept his beliefs as truth. This course is a survey (not an in depth exploration of diet, epigenetics, or population science), so it does generalize. However, it is a class we were all sorry to see end - the readings are very interesting, the section leaders are top-notch in their own ways, and Prof. Christakis is a gem.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material was eye-opening in that it illuminated how big of a role social factors play in our health. It was also particularly intriguing to me as a psychology major, since psychologists normally focus internally, but sociologists focus outwardly on what factors may be affecting people's health. Christakis is also great!",
    "Yes because it gives you a better perspective on health.",
    "if you're interested in networks \/ network theory, do it. i had done a lot of public health stuff before and the majority of the class felt somewhat repetitive, but the networks stuff was new and totally fascinating",
    "Awful course, awful professor. If you are genuinely interested in public health, get ready for some incredibly biased opinions. If you are taking this course for pure enjoyment - don't. The lectures are not entertaining, the readings are too much to be enjoyable, and the \"take home final\" is actually 16 pages. The grading of the midterms was unfair (if you answered the question correctly but failed to do more than what the question asked you got a 16 or 15 out of 20, mind you they never asked us prior to the midterm to do more than just what the question asked). Christakis is not a helpful or understanding man."
