    "The class is about exactly what it sounds like it's about: The Ottoman Empire. Class covers the Empire from 1299 to its demise in the 1920s. The readings are often fascinating, covering topics not usually discussed in history classes (coffee culture, tobacco use, et cetera.) Gives a great overview of Ottoman political and social history. Take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "The Ottoman Empire is really fascinating to study, although I'm not sure this seminar is the best way to do it. The scope is obviously enormous, which I think is a weakness, because each week you're focusing on some political or social aspect of a different time period, and you end up just skimming the surface of each. The class veered away from discussions of the very specific readings to extremely general and normative questions of empire, which really isn't my style. The workload, in terms of both readings and assignments is very light for a junior seminar. I'd recommend you shop the class, albeit with some reservations. It wouldn't be bad for a fifth class or humanities credit if you need one.",
    "Take it. It's great.",
    "Yes! Great way to get a rest of the world or seminar (or both) credit.",
    "Great course.",
    "Yes, I would. The material is fascinating and it's a great way of fulfilling one's \"rest of the world credit.\"",
    "How much you enjoy the class will depend on how much you enjoy studying primary sources to learn about daily life rather than discussing macro-political events.",
    "Take it. If you think you are even remotelt interested in it, you should take it.",
    "Definitely. Take this class!"
