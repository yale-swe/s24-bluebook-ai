   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend HIST 264 to another student, but I would let them know that it is sooooooooo much work.",
    "If you're interested in fairly modern European history (like me), then this is a great class to take. Snyder is excellent, and you come out of lecture feeling like you've learnt a huge amount. It's especially great because there are no papers to write, only section, a midterm, and a final. There is a lot of reading to do (possibly an excessive amount), but most of it is pretty interesting.",
    "I felt as though this has been one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. I would, beyond a shadow of a doubt, recommend this course to another student. This class goes over the areas in Europe in-between the larger powers (Russia, Germany, France) and focuses on their development from the end of WWI to the present day. I would rate this class a 6\/5 if possible.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Highly recommended! A course about a very important region in the world at a very important time in history.",
    "Yes. Yes yes yes. Tim Snyder is brilliant, and the fact that you probably don't have much knowledge about the subject of the course (knowing what the Holocaust is doesn't count) makes it all the more valuable. And going to his office hours is just a treat. He can speak at length about minute details of history. I wished the course included more dissenting views and that Snyder occasionally broke out of his habit of presenting history as a deterministic series of event with only one explanation, but he's so captivating I didn't really care.A lot of the readings felt somewhat mundane, but do yourself a favor and at least read Snyder's book.",
    "This class is amazing. I looked forward eagerly to every single lecture. Snyder is a fantastic lecturer and his lectures are filled not only with the basic history but funny\/interesting\/amazing\/etc anecdotes. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. Note that there is a CONSIDERABLE amount of reading over the semester, on the order of 1000's of pages. If I had readall of them I definitely would have been spending 6-8 hours a week on this class. However, I didn't in fact read all the pages, I skimmed many and attended section every week and I both felt able to participate there and felt prepared for the tests so that's something to consider.",
    "Yes definitely, it's an excellent lecture, especially if you're interested in the material (and it's good even if you're only a little interested). It's a lot of reading but you can get away with just doing the big ones - I never bought the course packet. The books were interesting and accessible. There's only a map-and-treaty quiz, a midterm, and a final, none of which are particularly challenging. Make sure you choose your TA wisely.",
    "Yeah, take it. You need to take it.",
    "This is a fantastic course. My only criticism is that Snyder does not allow computers in class, so you cannot type your notes and he speaks very quickly. But his lectures are engaging, he makes brilliant arguments, he is quirky and nerdy and his book, Bloodlands (which you have to read for the class) is gripping. Great course about an area I knew nothing about going into this class. He shows you how the whole idea of Eastern Europe was created by and during the Cold War and why we should care about its history.",
    "Take. This. Class. Probably in my top 5 favorite classes taken at Yale as a graduating senior. Workload is extremely manageable, and you will learn an enormous amount of information about a subject area that is often not given proper attention.",
    "Yes. Even if you are not interested in that part of the world, there is a lot more interesting history than one would think.",
    "A good survey course. Don't expect to go to in depth into anything. If you can accept that, it is a fun tour of recent Eastern European history",
    "Great class ... I took it Credit\/D which made it even MORE awesome because it meant I spent less time trying to write EVERYTHING down and instead just enjoyed his AWESOME lectures (they are the best lectures you will ever hear).",
    "I'd recommend it (although I do think that it's a little overrated) if you're interested in this time period. I think the first half was way more interesting than the second and you should be aware that section was a LOT of work.",
    "Take this class. The lectures are interesting, plus Snyder is a excellent lecturer with a great sense of humor. Furthermore, the class is just easy, and you don't have to write any essay.Also, if you have every vacationed in the Croatian countryside, make sure to tell Snyder. He loves that.",
    "It's an amazing class--you have to take it. It really opens up your mind to a new perspective on European history beyond the America-is-right-and-saves-the-world view.As for workload, it depends how much of the reading you do. You could easily get a B+ without doing the reading, in which case this class is almost no work; otherwise, there is a lot of reading, but it's actually all very interesting.",
    "Definitely",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of reading (a full course packet and 6 books). For those who are less historically inclined, this is a pretty difficult course. For those types I would definitely suggest CR\/D. Overall, though, it covers material that I personally knew little about and am now glad to have a basic grasp of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the fate of an entire people throughout the century, including some major injustices and brutalities and hardships. The legacy of communism and Stalin... etc...",
    "Apparently Snyder is a national hero in Poland or something, he really knows the material, and his energy leaks through his lectures. If you're incapable of taking notes by hand, don't take the course, because his lectures are pretty mandatory in terms of doing well in the class, and he doesn't allow laptops. The class is not much work at all, and it's really interesting. Take it.",
    "Yes, no matter what.",
    "This is a fascinating course for any students looking to get a good overview for Eastern Europe since WWI. Highly recommended.",
    "Sometimes, you walk into a final exam and say to yourself: \"wow! I didn't realize so many people were in this class, because nobody ever shows up!\" This is not one of those classes. It's so awesome that the whole class showed up to basically every lecture, even though it was a large one. Professor Snyder is an AMAZING lecturer and has a really good presence while lecturing--he doesn't allow laptops and calls people out for texting when he sees them. The laptops rule was a bit annoying at first; the public shaming of texters was simultaneously hilarious and terrifying, but ultimately I really appreciated him doing that. The whole class was VERY attuned to his lectures, which were themselves amazing. I learned an immense amount about a region whose history is so often downplayed in discussion of European history and Western Civliization. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE. Also, don't worry about doing all of the reading, because there's a lot. If you focus on Snyder's book and the Simons reading, you'll basically know everything.",
    "The class is very good and interesting. However, it is overrated.",
    "TAKE. IT.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale this guy is smart and funny. Shoot for 30% of the reading and if you do 20% you'll be fine.",
    "Fascinating course. A must take. Lecture is very interesting and section is often very enjoyable. Good course readings as well.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about a part of the world that is little discussed nowadays but was of great relevance to our parents and grandparents. Professor Snyder gives enjoyable lectures and the workload is moderate. A very solid choice for anyone, whether you know nothing or a lot about the time period. Also, no need to have taken Hist 263 (pre-1914 EE history).",
    "Solid course. Some of the readings can be a little dry and overly detailed, but it's worth it just to hear Snyder lecture and learn about the period with this specific regional focus. Take it.",
    "Take this class even if you know nothing about Eastern Europe. Personally, I thought of the region as a giant blob before enrolling in this course, but there's so much to learn! Professor Snyder presents all of the material in a very accessible way and the graded assignments are really not that difficult.",
    "Take this class!! It doesn't matter if you're a history major or have never taken a history class ever, take the class. Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer and every single one of his lectures is interesting and engaging. There is a lot of reading to get through, but as long as youdo some of it, you'll be fine. Make sure to get a good TF (get Rachel White if she is a TF again) and the class is has a manageable workload and is very rewarding.",
    "The best reason to take this course is for Prof. Snyder's lectures. In addition to learning about an interesting time period, Snyder includes discussion of historical and political themes that can be applied to general analysis of history. The teaching fellows for this course are also excellent. The reading for this course is extensive, so it is necessary to approach them strategically because it is not realistically to complete them all and get a lot out of them. At the same time, it is possible to read certain texts in depth and still do well in the class. Overall, a great class.",
    "I would recommend it 100% \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0probably my favorite class at Yale. The lectures are fascinating, most of the reading is really interesting and, to top it all off, there are no papers in the class (just a map quiz - easy, a midterm and a final - reasonable, and section participation). Great class, but not a gut by any means.",
    "Definitely worth taking for someone who is willing to do the readings, whether or not you've every done history before. Don't take it if you want an easy class! You can't use your laptop in class, so you have to concentrate and learn, but if you do, you'll benefit a lot.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS OH MY GOD. DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. Tim Snyder is the greatest lecturer I've ever had, and the source material will change the way you look at European history, and history in general. 10\/10, A+, all the thumbs up.",
    "One of the best classes I've ever taken. Everyone at Yale should take this class. The lectures only get better, the tests are not bad at all, and I have never take a class that was changed my perspective more. Professor Snyder and the TFs are incredible.",
    "TAKE IT, you won't regret it. No papers, midterm, exam, map quiz - you learn so much and it is not difficult to get a good grade.",
    "Most definitely take this course! There is too much reading, but you can get by with just doing a portion of it. The grading seems fair (although not too sure because haven't seen the final grade). Timothy Snyder is basically a god, and I can't actually think of any teachers I'd rather listen to lecture for 50 minutes. He's REALLY good at making his subject interesting and relevant. I feel lucky to have gotten the opportunity to take his class while I was at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Yes! This is an area of the world that is so critical to our understanding of modern politics, but gets totally left out from the regular history curriculum. The nuanced perspective that Snyder provides will change your understanding of the region as well as the forces of history. Plus, no papers, so very doable (although I'd recommend Credit\/D).",
    "Eastern Europe since 1914 is an extremely important, nuanced, fast-paced and interesting lecture course. Professor Snyder is absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend it (Yale bucket list: Must take course with T-Snyd).However, if you are going to take just one Snyder course or just one history course, I would much more recommend Eastern Europe to 1914 (the fall course) -- Prof Snyder appears much more in his element in that course (smaller) and the TAs are often much more steeped in the region and its history, a course which has not been topped in my Yale career.",
    "The absolute best class I have taken at Yale. It changed my life. Snyder can lecture. The lectures are so interesting, the readings are fantastic (and if you're pressed for time not necessary to do all of them) and section was very interesting. I've learned more in this class than I have in any class at Yale. There's just one map test, a midterm and final that isn't cumulative. The map test was very simple and the exams were super fair and well graded. Honestly cannot say enough about how much I loved this class. All my classmates felt the same way, I haven't met one person that regretted taking the class. I looked forward to going to Snyder's lectures. You walk out with a whole new perspective of history. Such a great class! If you don't take this class before you graduate, you've missed a gem.",
    "YES. JUST DO IT.",
    "Take it, take it, take it. Professor Snyder is NOT to be missed by anyone even marginally interested in the course.",
    "Great course that will give you an understanding of the Eastern European region since 1914",
    "Sure. Eastern Europe is a great history class. One of the best parts is the smaller workload- just two exams and a quiz, and pretty simple section assignments. There is a lot of reading to the class, but a lot of it is actually super interesting and you will want to read it (a lot of it can also be skimmed and read really quickly for exams). Be sure to write quickly during exams! Lectures with Snyder are pretty entertaining.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 264. Took it as a 4th course as an engineering major. While there is a lot of reading, many of the themes overlap with lecture and most of them are engaging (especially bloodlands and taste of ashes). If you have a good TA, he\/she will tell you what to focus on when the readings get overwhelming. Exams are pretty straightforward, so don't be too intimidated about taking it!",
    "Eastern European History Since 1914 is one of those must take classes. Professor Snyder is incredible and you'll really just learn an unbelievable amount about the region from WWI to present day. Your grade is pretty much just your midterm and final so be sure to prepare well for those. The only actual work each week is reading, but it really is an overwhelming amount of reading. Also, Professor Snyder doesn't let you use laptops during lecture to take notes, which I found to be extremely inconvenient. Try to get Kate for your TF! She's actually the best. So sweet and so helpful.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. Professor Snyder is a legend. He is the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far. I left almost every lecture thinking \"wow\". Expect hand cramps though, because you cannot use your laptop to take notes. Don't be scared off by this. I almost didn't take this class because of that, but I'm so glad I did. Don't worry about all the reading. Its interesting so read what you can. Overall, I highly recommend this class.",
    "This is an amazing class!! Professor Snyder is a wonderful lecturer, and understanding Eastern European history is so important for understanding the political atmosphere in the region today, as well as current and historical events for Europe as a whole. This is one of the best classes I have ever taken, and if you have a chance you should definitely try it out.",
    "History 264 is the history of Eastern Europe since 1914. Topics covered include world war one and the fall of empires, the rise of radicalism, WWII, communism, and the emergence of the European Union. The teaching staff is amazing and I loved every minute of this class. I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Take it! History major or not, this class is worth it. You will not regret it.",
    "I would definitley recommend this class to another student. History 264 is an incredible course that really provides you with a great understanding of Eastern Europe. You do not have to have any prior knowledge of Eastern Europe to enjoy the course, but if you do, the class will augment your knowledge. Even though the class covers a lot of information, it is really great because Snyder and the TAs allow you to focus on what you find most interesting.",
    "Take this course! Incredible lectures, fascinating material, and not that difficult.",
    "History 264 is an overview of Eastern Europe between the beginning of the first world war and present. Topics covered include World War I (and why it started in Eastern Europe), the Interwar Period, World War II, the Soviet period, and recent events. It is a great class because the countries studied are not often studied in typical Yale courses, and Professor Snyder is an expert. His lectures are INCREDIBLE, but the course reading is challenging. Be prepared to spend time studying and doing readings.",
    "Take it. Snyder is the best.",
    "A great class, a good overview of several East and Central European countries after 1914. Professor Snyder is a renowned lecturer and it is a great pleasure to sit in his classes. Many don't do the readings, which is deplorable, since I got so much more out of readings and they were just fascinating.",
    "TAKE IT!!!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. Incredibly interesting, the work load is manageable and you will learn about an area of the world that not many people focus on anymore.",
    "absolutely a must take at Yale. it's really unfortunate how little the average person knows about Eastern Europe but there is so much that has happened there that is really relevant to our understanding of the world. the readings are interesting, the lectures are really engaging. Snyder is incredible. definitely take it!",
    "Eastern Europe since 1914 is one of the best classes at Yale. I had never taken a big lecture at Yale and strongly feel that I made the right choice in taking this. The material was so interesting because it had never really been covered in depth in any of my other history courses. Professor Snyder makes this class as amazing as it is.",
    "Take this class! But know that you will have to show up to lectures. But you will want to because they're really great. Not a lot of work, the reading is interesting and there's just a midterm and a final.",
    "As a science major I was skeptical about taking the class but am so happy I did. Snyder is a fantastic lecturer and the material is extremely interesting. Put in the time to do the reading throughout the semester and anybody can do well.",
    "Take this course.",
    "definitely recommend it",
    "A great lecture on a topic of history you may not know a lot about. Take it!! It is kind of hard but Professor Snyder is really funny.",
    "If you are really interested in the History of Eastern Europe from 1914 to the present then yes, I totally recommend this class. However, if you are looking for a gut, this isn't it. As a history class, it has tons of eastern european names and dates and jumps between different countries and regions so make sure you keep up with the material. Also, computers are not allowed in class so if you take the class make sure you take detailed notes otherwise, you're going to have problems.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in 20th century history, or anyone just looking for a good history lecture. This class (along with the companion fall semester course, Eastern Europe to 1914) completely reframed my perspective on European history (particularly the history of WWII and the Holocaust). In terms of workload, there is a lot of reading if you try to read everything on the syllabus, but it's quite manageable if you're more selective - some of the readings do add depth to Snyder's excellent lectures, while others only really add detail. Overall, highly recommended (along with the companion course, if you have a chance!).",
    "I took this course as one that was completely out of my field. Word of advice: TAKE THIS COURSE, but only if your plate isn't full. I made the mistake of taking the course as a \"5th\" class, and the thing is, it is definitely not a gut. You will learn A LOT, but again, just make sure you are not pairing this class up with many other time-consuming courses.",
    "History 264 is overall and excellent course that I would recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in history. Professor Snyder is an excellent lecturer with a lot of great ideas, and each class hits the right note. I've never found myself dreading going to class, and it always proved extremely interesting. There will be a lot of reading, but it's all worth it. The readings are well-chosen, relevant, and extremely interesting, and none of them drag much. Professor Snyder's book Bloodlands is itself particularly interesting. You should absolutely take the course.",
    "It's a good history class to take if you've never taken a history class at Yale. There aren't any essays; the only essays are part of the tests. It involves a lot of reading that aren't really necessary to earn a good grade, but it would help immensely if you did all the readings. I'd recommend it as a Cr\/D\/F if you don't plan on putting much work in it and are just interested in the subject. Take it for a grade if you're willing to put a lot of effort into it.",
    "Amazing class, amazing lecturer, not too much work and fascinating material. Not a history major but totally manageable."
