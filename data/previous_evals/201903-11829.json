   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I got better at Spanish.",
    "Developed Spanish skills in past tense, future, subjunctive, ect both in writing and speaking",
    "Definitely developed my ability to use the preterite and imperfect tenses",
    "I learned how to speak more tenses in Spanish, along with more words. We also did a lot of reading and speaking, which helped with comprehension.",
    "My conversational skills and confidence with the language improved over the semester. At first, I was hesitant to speak up in group conversations, but soon, conversation felt natural and fun. By the end of the semester, I was able to have a 30 minute conversation with a classmate for the oral evaluation, and I felt comfortable speaking. Moreover, I learned much more about subjunctive verb usage and more high-level vocabulary.",
    "I worked heavily on my basic Spanish skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I will say that this class includes many written exams, which was one of the single greatest ways I developed my Spanish throughout this course. I started properly treating Spanish as a language.",
    "In this class, I learned more about Spanish language and culture. In addition to improving my skills in grammar and vocabulary, I also improved in my reading comprehension and communication skills. The consistent conversation every day allowed me to become more comfortable with my ability to communicate and speak in Spanish. Furthermore, we studied an array of novels, art, music, and current events to expose us to current issues and ideas in Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "I was able to improve my Spanish a lot."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course was Giseli.",
    "A big weakness: class everyday, homework everyday. It's a lot. At times, to really understand the material, it can take 1-2 hours every night. Strength: lots of talking in class helps with speaking skill.",
    "The course moves through so many different grammatical topics so quickly that it's hard to keep up. Some people don't have hours on end to try to figure out the slight sentence tendencies that make a sentence lean towards preterite or imperfect, and memorizing the amount of vocab we needed to know was heinous. The professor was definitely a strength of this course as she made sure she talked to individuals about what they needed to understand more completely (during the course).",
    "I feel like the homework was terrible. The syllabus gave a lot of homework and then in addition, my teacher enjoyed giving us more on top of that. Also, the grading system wasnt that good. Especially for participation. If Im speaking each session, I shouldnt lose points on that.",
    "Reading Relato de un Naufrago the week before Thanksgiving break was not the greatest because it's in the middle of midterms and once you get behind, it's really hard to catch up in the book you have to read more in less time. Overall I really liked this course because of the way it helped me learn how to read, write, and speak more fluently in Spanish. I also really liked how much we were allowed to engage with our classmates.",
    "I enjoyed the conversational elements of the class about the course material. I liked the way the quizzes, exams, and writing assignments were weighed, and I felt the grading was fair. However, the course material was extremely expensive, and quite frankly, the textbook and online were not particularly helpful.",
    "I think the pace of the vocabulary was unjustifiably quick, but I also understand that the aim of the vocabulary was to expand the tools that we had on essays and exams.",
    "The strength of this course is how it teaches you a language in a very straightforward way. Every homework assignment, discussion, and the exam was critical in improving my skills and I feel that this course does a good job of giving meaningful assignments to improve your understanding. One of the weaknesses of the course was the timing of some of the later assignments, like with reading an entire novel in a short amount of time. Overall, the course is structured well and makes learning straightforward.",
    "I really liked this course. The lessons were interesting and engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Not really unless they need the requirement.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend Spanish to anyone else because dealing with so many different grammatical aspects of the language, on top of how things were graded (very harshly), I don't think it's something I'd recommend to someone else.",
    "Yes because Giseli is the best",
    "I wouldnt, but it is a distributional requirement, so you are kind of stuck with it unless you want to take 3 semesters of another language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other Yale students, especially if it is taught by Professor Tordin. It gives students the opportunity to improve their skills in a non-judgmental environment and pick up skills in more advanced Spanish language constructions.",
    "Yes, take this course if you are serious about learning Spanish. If not, Spanish L3 will be a struggle.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It greatly improved my Spanish skills without overwhelming me. Every assignment is useful in your understanding and improvement and the course is fair in its evaluations and expectations.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone hoping to improve on Spanish."
