   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved this class. The language is really interesting, and it's taught really well. Unlike most beginning languages you don't get ridiculous amounts of homework, but we still learned so much. Mwalimu Kiarie is great, as are the TAs. I highly recommend taking this class!",
    "Intro Swahili is a great class. The language itself is very logical and straightforward, making learning it easier than expected. The professors are great and work is minimal. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely take Swahili! It's a light course load and an extremely fun class. The language itself isn't too difficult, so with a little bit of effort, it should come naturally.",
    "Swahili 110 was great for me. Challenging enough to be interesting, but also really fun, and I feel like I already have learned a lot in just one semester.",
    "Beginning Kiswahili is a fun and engaging course. You learn a lot in a short amount of time and it's quite fast-paced, but mwalimu makes the class enjoyable. The material you learn is useful and easily applicable, I would recommend it!",
    "Swahili is a great class especially for those who have had a hard time learning languages in the past. The professors are amazing and always so positive and happy. I was always annoyed that there was a language requirement at Yale, but now I'm actually glad or else I would have missed out on this great class. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes. Swahili is a fun language to learn if you're interested in East African Studies, Linguistics, or you just want to start a new language at Yale. It's a manageable workload, an engaging professor, helpful TFs, and a very small class size that leads to great discussions and friendships."
