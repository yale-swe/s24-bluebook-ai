    "I really enjoyed this class. Prof Lamoreaux is incredibly smart and very approachable. Overall, a lot of fun.",
    "Physics 342 is a stress-free science course in which you will learn a LOT in class from interactions with Lamoreaux in addition to a fascinating intersection of physics,geophysics, and envir studies. Ask questions. Take the opportunity to interact with a truly extraordinary professor. A few prob. sets, midterm, final paper.",
    "This is a very good class that for environmental analysis. The small class size allowed for a lot of interaction with Prof. Lamoreaux. The material was always interesting. Many of the topics we talked about were prominent issues in the media. Looking at the actual science and mathematics behind these issues gave me a much wider perspective on how environmental problems are addressed.",
    "Very stress free course, Prof cares more about students learning and enjoying the material than grades, which is a relief.",
    "This is a broad survey course in many topics related to earth and environmental physics -- the carbon cycle, the earth-moon system, alternative energy sources, and others. The work consists of a few reasonable homework assignments, 1-2 midterms, and a final paper on a completely open topic. The class is not difficult and covers many interesting subjects. Prof. Lamoreaux can be difficult to follow in lecture, but he is easy to talk to and always helpful.",
