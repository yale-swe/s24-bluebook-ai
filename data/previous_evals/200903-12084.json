   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a view of Economics from the real world perspective. I would recommend this class to anyone because it teaches you what you need to know in the real world, but also because it is an experience to have Koker as an instructor.",
    "I recommend this class to another student. Take it. Take it. Take it. It's the best QR on campus. It's fun and you get that requirement out of the way. Tolga's one of the best professor's I've ever had.",
    "TAKE IT. People say the Econ seminar is a lot harder than the lecture but that is not true at all. With Tolga, it is impossible to fail this course, and even better, you won't be miserable like those who chose ECON 115. Plus, I for one think everyone should know a bit about microecon. It's a building block for life.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get into this pretty exclusive seminar, go for it. It'll be one of the best courses you'll take at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It was my favorite this semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. If you like math, a lot of the class is math based, and the math is fairly simple. Tolgga Koker is the man too.",
    "Beware of the curve. Just because Tolga is the man, doesnt mean that the Econ department doesnt curve the class.",
    "If you are interested in taking an econ course, or even just a QR course, TAKE ECON 108 WITH TOLGA! Seriously (and I am 110% serious when i say this) there is no better way to do it. I was pretty hesitant about taking econ (I am NOT a math person, and I had never taken any sort of econ in my life prior to this course), but Tolga made it interesting, easy, fun, and definitely do-able, and I far surpassed my expectations in the class.",
    "This is the best course to take if you want to understand basic microeconomics (supply, demand, labor, production, etc.) If you need econ for your major, or you just want to know why we're in a recession, take this class.",
    "a great introduction to concepts further explored in more advanced econ courses."
