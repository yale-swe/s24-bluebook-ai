   "comments": [
    "It's a very difficult class with difficult reading.",
    "If you are interested in map theory and its history, the course is excellent for you.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class. The readings are fascinating, and you learn an entirely different way of looking at history and at historical sources.",
    "This course is a hard-core jump into the literature about cartography. It's pretty cool because it's the only course about maps that's been offered in the past 2 years. I always like a class incorporates the Yale Map Department, which is really awesome. There's a map design project which is pretty cool. Most of the course is like a literature survey. There's a lot of difficult reading that Professor Rankin demands you understand. You do walk away with a pretty sophisticated understanding of your subject matter. I felt the other students were competitive and spoke more to the professor than to each other. Professor Rankin is brilliant and is clearly going far.",
    "This is a wonderful seminar that engages students in really interesting discussions of cartography which cover diverse discussions that permeate history of science, politics, and social theory. DEFINITELY take this course if you can. It changed the way I think about maps and history of science in general.",
    "Though I was not expecting it, I really appreciated how the course taught me to integrate theory into my own research\/understanding of history. Professor Rankin has designed the course to do a great job teaching you to read academic articles and boil them down to \"what are the important questions?\" and \"how does this enter into a dialogue with other articles we've read?\" Those things are all valuable skills, as are the presentation assignments. I think the course is incredible well organized. I felt at times that the readings and discussion dragged because we were constantly asking the same questions and coming to the same conclusions.",
    "Definitely. A challenging class: Professor Rankin will expect thorough reading, interesting questions, good research and writing. But it's definitely worth it. Know that a lot of the reading is theory-heavy and often more anthropology\/geography than history per se, but this is by no means a bad thing. Also, critical cartography is a niche enough field that by the end of the class you'll have read most of the major works in it. Discussions were great, and I'll never think about maps, borders, or territory in quite the same way again.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is VERY interested in cartography theory and does not mind reading tons of HIGHLY specific readings. Although I think there were people in the class who really enjoyed the readings and discussions, I was extremely bored. If you think you just really like maps, please do not take this class. If you think that you LOVE everything about maps and would like to have long discussions on complicated readings, then this may be the class for you. If you are a history major, you should really consider if you are actually interested in a history of science seminar (it is a much more different subject than you think). Professor Rankin, however, is extremely nice, helpful, and engaged with the class. He does a great job at facilitating discussions.",
    "This is a wonderful class, covering the last thirty years of post-modern scholarship of maps and geographic knowledge. It both forces you to challenge assumptions, whether on the classical side (a map is an objective representation of space) or on the post-modern Marxist side (a map is a projection of power from above). All of the assignments are difficult and worth doing.",
    "It's a fantastic class and I'd thoroughly recommend it to someone who has an interest in the subject, can handle reading two-three books or 20-40 page articles each week, can write a 8-10 page and 15-20 page paper as well as create a map, will go to class and is dedicated to writing a couple of response questions each week.",
    "It was interesting, but a lot of work."
