    "Lots of work. You have to actually be interested in bugs in order to survive.",
    "There are a handful of classes at Yale that could be considered \"life-changers.\" This is one of them. If you're a non-science major, this class will make you fall in love with science and want to become an entomologist. If you are a science major, then this class will rekindle the curiosity and excitement that probably brought you to science in the first place, and it will make you want to become an entomologist. The subject itself is fascinating (there isn't a single lecture in which you won't be utterly shocked and awestruck at the amazing diversity of arthropod life), and Professor Wells is super enthusiastic and makes everything even more exciting. It's a decent amount of material, but getting a good grade is very doable. The grading of exams, for the most part, is quite lenient. In short, TAKE THIS CLASS! It's pure awesome packed into two 75 minute lectures per week and a couple tests. You won't regret it!",
    "E&EB 250 is an awesome class and I recommend it to everyone whether you are interested in biology or not. If you have ever even been mildly interested in bugs, take this class! The professor is amazing and lectures are incredibly fun to attend. You also have the opportunity to do some independent research about insects and delve into a topic that you are particularly interested in beyond the more overarching ideas presented in lecture.",
    "Good class even for non-majors. You won't learn anything useful as a non-EEB major but marta is great and you get to watch lots of cool\/gross videos.",
    "This class is an in-depth exploration of arthropod life. It really depends on how interested you are in the subject matter whether or not this is the class for you. I am an English major and although I loved the class, I can't pretend it was easy. I put in more time than I expected and did pretty well, but if you are a humanities person looking for a relaxing science credit, this is not it. However, if you are a humanities person looking for a fascinating science credit even if it will be challenging, TAKE IT.",
    "This class is interesting, and Professor Wells is incredible. The workload is fairly high, though, and the grading is tough. Three midterms, two papers, and a final will be time consuming to complete. The curve on the exams is also extremely difficult, so you'll need to study hard to do well. If you are a non-science major who hasn't studied biology in a while, this class will be a challenge and will require a lot of memorization. If you're up for it, though, the class is great. Professor Wells is one of the most engaged, caring professors I've ever had. After I bombed the first midterm, she met with me for almost an hour to go over the material. She offered- I didn't even ask- to keep meeting with me, and we even skyped over Thanksgiving break to review the recent lectures. She really wants her students to do well, and she enjoys teaching this class, which makes it extremely engaging and worthwhile!",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course. The material is fascinating, and the professor's passion and energy make lectures very rewarding and engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Marta is great and SO excited about insects, which are actually a really interesting subject. As an EEB major I sometimes wished the class went into more depth, and if you really want to learn about arthropods I would definitely recommend taking the lab alongside it. In the lab you actually go through each taxonomic group and learn details about them (plus you spend all semester collecting bugs and it's just a lot of fun). In the lecture you talk about broader concepts and get random examples for each one. There are kind of a lot of assignments (3 midterms, two 3-page papers, and a final) but none of them are too hard and overall the class is fun.",
    "This is a great class, especially if you need a SC credit! I'm a non-science major and thought this class was super interesting and fun. There are 4 tests and each require a lot of memorization, but you'll learn a lot of fun facts. Also, no need to be a bug-lover. I'm terrified of bugs and had no problem completing this course.",
    "3 exams, 2 3-pg papers, 1 final",
    "Yes if you like bugs! The professor is really nice and the videos are very funny!",
    "I came away from the semester feeling much more informed about not only terrestrial arthropods but biology as a whole, and I always looked forward to the lectures which often featured David Attenborough. Marta was an great professor who made me interested in a subject that I didn't expect to like. To be fair, bugs are often gross but mostly really cool.",
    "I thought this class was a bit overrated - the lectures are rather disorganized, and the material involves a lot of basic rote memorization. Nothing in the class truly widened my eyes. That said, there are few compelling SC credits out there, so it may be better than most of the others.",
    "TAKE IT! So amazing! One of my favorite classes at Yale! A class that appeals to science and non-science majors that delves deeply into the study of anthropoids. From learning about the evolution of spider webs to exoskeletons, the class was never dull! I did not take the lab (conflict with another class), but Prof Wells is truly the best and I really wish that I had. PLEASE at least shop it! Not much work. Three midterms, two short (easy to write) papers, and one final. Well balanced and fairly graded. Prof Wells is very accessible and easy to meet with in person and via email.",
    "A fascinating introduction to entomology. Good science credit for people without quantitative skills, like me. Memorization-based. Will give you a good appreciation for the crazy awesome world of insects and other arthropods. Professor Wells is an attentive and knowledgeable professor and always happy to help if you're behind.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to both science and non-science majors. It is always engaging and fun, and the work is manageable. Pr. Wells makes sure her students have all the resources to succeed.",
    "A wonderful class with a top notch specialist professor teaching fascinating material, but don't be fooled--it's a lot of work, too!",
    "This is not a \"gut!\" It requires time and effort, but the material is definitely interesting and worth exploring.",
    "a must take class surveying bugs, its really interesting and the teacher is great",
    "If you are interested in the subject, it's a great class. I definitely learned a lot about arthropods and the class was very interesting. That being said, I don't imagine I will ever use the information again, so I'd suggest only taking it if you are very interested.",
    "Yes, this course is fantastic! Know that Professor Wells' sometimes rushes to get through all the material, but that you will end up learning a ton. You can't help but be swept up by Professor Wells' incredible enthusiasm for bugs.",
    "Great course if you are at all interested in biological diversity in general, or arthropods specifically. I'm the kind of person who read animal encyclopedias for fun when I was a kid, and I still learned a ton in this class, in a very low-key way. There is not much work other than showing up to lecture and reading a few assigned articles; we also had to write two short papers, which were not difficult. Marta also shows lots of really cool video clips during the lectures, and she is very passionate about the subject.",
    "Appeals great to both scientists and non-scientists.",
    "Great SC credit. Professor Wells is really amazing, and her enthusiasm makes you want to go to class and do well. At the same time, she wants you to do well, and will do anything in her power to make sure you do. And the course material itself is really fascinating!",
    "I would recommend the course to another student based on the instructor and the material covered in the course. It provided a great introduction to arthropods and their great diversity.",
    "holy cow what a cool class. really really interesting and even kind of fun to study for. it's a lot of exams but you kind of get in the rhythm of it and it's not that bad, and marta is the absolute best. I'm a non-science major and totally loved it, don't waste you're science credits on a stupid gut!",
    "An excellent course for non-science majors! A good amount of work (three tests, a final, two short papers) but totally doable in terms of content. Marta is really wonderful. I would definitely take the class with friends in order to have people to study with etc."
