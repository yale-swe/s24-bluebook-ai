   "comments": [
    "Exposure to a form of history I was not super familiar with, the way the course is structured you see many examples which can later inform your own writing. It is also cool to hear insights from classmates across a variety of fields and specialties.",
    "-Knowledge of how microhistory developed as a historical genre, and varied examples of microhistories",
    "This course introduces students to an entirely new historical methodology: microhistories. I found the immersive readings helpful for understanding the different ways one can write a microhistory, and the class discussions were useful for hearing other students' reactions to the assigned microhistories. Ultimately, it was rewarding to culminate the semester by preparing our own microhistories (which we presented in class).",
    "The course gave us a deep introduction into the micro-historical method. We first read a number of model micro-histories and discussed questions of using sources and writing narratives. In the latter half of the course we had the chance to write our own micro-histories, and presented our work-in-progress to the class and received feedback.",
    "I learned a great deal about the intellectual origins of and variations on 'Microhistory'. I also improved my research and writing skills, especially considering the focus of the course is on student research.",
    "I learned the various ways a microhistory can be completed, the sources it can utilize, the forms it can take, and more. I also learned how to complete one myself.",
    "I learned how to begin to write a microhistory and what it takes to write a good one."

   "comments": [
    "I love the structure, I think the diversity of readings kept each week interesting. It was also helpful to have your classmates explain the books they chose, giving insight into how others interpret readings.",
    "reading four books at a time was difficult for discussion. it was great to hear about other books, but it made discussion uninteresting if you hadn't engaged with the other literature",
    "The course has many strengths: illuminating readings, highly supportive instructor, engaging class discussions, exciting research opportunities. I do not feel the class had any weaknesses, and I therefore have no suggestions.",
    "The opportunity to write a full-length micro-historical narrative was a wonderful experience. The course offered a lovely environment for producing research and Prof. Wrightson was always available to share his experience and give us support. I felt course could be improved, however, by diversifying the readings we had to include a wider variety of topic areas and approaches. A large focus was given to early modern Europe (which is Wrightson's area of expertise), but as someone with little background in the area the books were sometimes not very engaging.",
    "There are no weaknesses, and I mean that. The structure of this course is exactly how graduate courses should be: laying the groundwork and then being able to focus on applying the project and learning from others. So many classes require the quality of the final project to be brushed aside by the pressures of classwork.",
    "Great discussion platform.",
    "One of the strengths of the course was the connection between the lectures and the readings. The selection of readings was one of the best I have had in a very long time. My only wish was that the discussions were guided better and that the segments were shorter."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, very much worth the reading and time, even if you are not an early modernist. It was really wonderful to end the course with presentations, it built a communal scholarship and was downright fascinating.",
    "Definitely! Especially if he\/she\/they is passionate about learning how to view history through a different lens. Microhistories have a lot to add to the macro narratives that tend to dominate historical discourse.",
    "Yes! I hear Prof. Wrightson is retiring but if he ever comes back again to offer this course don't miss out on it! I really enjoyed the chance to work on a research project and think about different ways of writing history.",
    "If this class were ever offered again, I would highly recommend it. I will never forget many of the valuable lessons and discussions had in this class.",
    "Without reservation, for the above-stated reasons. Any student who wants to improve as a historian or to learn historiography skills to apply them in their own field can benefit from this course.",
    "This course was very informative and engaging. The discussions and lectures were the best parts of my week. The course truly taught me how to engage with the style of microhistory."
