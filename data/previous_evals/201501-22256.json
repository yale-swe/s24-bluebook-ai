   "comments": [
    "Do you like Canada? Do you hate Canada? Doesn't matter, just take this class. Professor Gitlin and Dean B are so great and enthusiastic that you can't help but love the material. This is without a doubt one of the best classes I've taken here.",
    "The class is great, and while there may be a bit too much reading at some points and the class gets off-topic at times, the overall experience is highly rewarding. From learning about North American history from a new perspective to going to a French-Canadian diner with your class, students have fun and gain a lot from the course.",
    "It's a class unlike any other you've taken - unless you're from French Canada. But seriously, this is such a unique seminar. Taught by two absolutely amazing professors with a ton of reading that you've never been exposed to, this class is a journey through the history of Francophones in Canada and their relationship to the land, its indigenous population, the United States, Europe, the American south, and the rest of the world. I don't even know how to describe it because it's so vast in its material, but if you're at all interested in challenging yourself and immersing yourself in a subject that you've never studied, this is the class you want to take. It's difficult but manageable, and the professors will guide you through every step of the way. Prof. G is the man and super smart, and Dean B is hilarious and very knowledgable of the subject. There's nothing to lose. Take this if you can.",
    "I liked how much the professors clearly loved the material they were teaching. The workload was manageable (if you did a bit of reading here and there because if you actually read everything it's too much. the reading is quite interesting, but i think it would be better to give less reading so that students can focus their attention on an individual few) The weakness of the class was organization. Professor Gitlin has no sense of time (often letting us out late) and spends too much time on irrelevant and small activities, which often takes away from the actual material. I think it would be better if he structured the lectures and discussions better instead of just throwing a ton of terms out on the board. Though I know he does it just out of love for the material, the fact that he had us do four hours of class in addition to a four hour field trip during reading week was ridiculous. For students with over three finals and even more final papers, I simply did not have the time for that. Lastly, the syllabus didn't even tell us how much our participation and papers were worth! All we were told was that it matters and will affect it (at least a little). Considering I wrote a 20 page paper, I would like to know how much that will effect my grade. Again, ORGANIZATION and CLARIFICATION! I think this course needs some serious tweaking in terms of organization. The material and enthusiasm is great but its all a bit jumbled and sometimes is pretty confusing. its nice to only have papers (one five page and one 15-20 page paper) because it makes the class low work since there are no midterms or finals",
    "This course is something between a survey seminar of Quebec and a complete obsession with French North America. You'll learn more about America's northern neighbor than you ever thought you wanted to know, but will be at the edge of your proverbial seat each week. These professors are the best in the business and really know their Canadian history (and can contextualize things in a way that will make you rethink everything you know about North America). In other words, you'll be left with the opening line that Professor Gitlin used to sell the class day one: \"Canada, who knew!\" Very highly recommended.",
    "I would summarize HIST 168J as a seminar covering French North America, focusing mostly on Quebec and Canada. The course begins in the 17th century and moves up to present day Canada, learning about the politics, religion and culture of Canada and how it has influenced regions of America, including New Orleans. Professor Gitlin runs the seminar a little bit like a lecture, but there is room for participation and there are fun engaging activities like a couple of debates about political issues in Canada. I would recommend this class to anyone. It is a unique experience and very worthwhile, despite the sometimes large time commitment.",
    "If you can get in, take this class. You will learn a lot about Quebec and Canada. Don't take it if you don't care about the subject, you won't get anything out of it and will dread coming to class weekly. You need to be enthusiastic and look forward to class field trips and debates and such activities.",
    "Loved this class! Take it if you can. It's probably a little more fun if you can speak French, but either way it's a really interesting topic and a lot of potential ways to go for the final paper. Professor Gitlin is amazing and super fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class is you are interested in Quebec and Canada or the time period. Be prepared to cover a lot and jump around--but don't worry it's fun!"
