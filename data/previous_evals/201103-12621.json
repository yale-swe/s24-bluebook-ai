   "comments": [
    "Do it if you have to. It really wasn't too bad if you can handle two labs a week and a lot of writing afterward. I enjoyed the actual labs, but the lectures and quizzes were all over the place.",
    "Not bad for a lab course. Taking it first half helps",
    "Recommended (though you probably have to take it anyway). Not at all the time killer that it's rumored to be.",
    "This lab meets twice a week for half a semester for 2-4 hours each time. There's very little homework outside of lab.",
    "Only if you have to take it....it's not the worst lab I've taken and I had fun during lab time but the lab reports are a whole other story. I got pretty delirious during both of them because I'd spend 10 hours on excel making ridiculous graphs and color-coded charts that were used to prove something we already knew. Pre-lab lectures are sooo boring and everyone falls asleep.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major, otherwise it's a difficult lab course as compared to other biology labs. Do not underestimate the time commitment.",
    "Take it only if you have to take it. The labs and daily quizzes are really annoying but in lab, it's not too stressful. But, be sure to start your lab early because it tends to drag on!",
    "Take it if you have to. It's 2x a week for half a semester, so it can get intense. Also, expect to write 50 pages in lab reports.",
    "Well, if you have to take it, just try to take the first half when your semester is less busy. Taking is during second half could be rather troublesome, with all assignments due for other classes and TWO labs per week, your life might just be wasted away in academics. But fear not, suppose you are already pre-med, so you should already know how it feels to have too much work.",
    "Not worth it. The labwork itself is actually pretty interesting with a decent project but the lectures are absurdly boring. Quizzes are not too bad. The first lab report is a ridiculous amount of work and the grading is untransparent and inconsistent. The second lab report was more reasonable. If you take this class, start on the first lab report as soon as possible. At least it's only half a semester (take the first half if possible for more time to do your lab reports). Way more than half a credit of work.",
    "Take this lab! It's fun and involves only weekly quizzes and two reports.",
    "MB&B 251L is a good lab course. I feel that I developed a lot of helpful lab skills. Even with no background in biochemistry (I plan to take the course next semester), I felt that the course was very manageable. There are two projects, each of which is accompanied by a lab report. I liked the continuity and the feeling that you were working toward a specific goal rather than starting a new project every week. While lab twice a week is really time consuming, it's nice to be free the other half of the semester. Overall, I would recommend the course to someone looking to develop their lab skills.",
    "This lab is required for an MB&B major (if you don't want a B.S. or have the research reqs to get out of the other lab) and the easier of the two pre-med required Biochem labs (the other one meets twice a week for the whole semester). If you have to take it, take it. If you don't need to, then don't.",
    "Intense but only half a semester. Overall good lab. I learned a lot.",
    "This lab was pretty standard intro biochem stuff. I took it before biochem the class and found that the protocols were fine, but that when it came time to write the lab report I wished I'd had a bit more background.Above all, start the lab reports early!!! Even if you're fine with staying up all night, there's a good chance you still won't be able to finish in a single day or so. Outside of the two lab reports, there's little work.",
    "Quizzes every class = argh. Lab reports were the most painful things I had to do this semester. Class itself is all right. Some experiments were tedious. Instructors are nice. Did not feel like I got much out of this course, substance\/knowledge\/concept-wise, but had to take it. You probably do too."
