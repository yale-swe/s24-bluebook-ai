    "The experience is all about the client: the responsiveness of the client, the interst of the client in the project, the client's willingness to work to the student team, and vice versa. If the client is engaged, excited, and available, this is a great, practical course."

Being a part of making regulatory change. Learning from the experience of Kit Kennedy. Playing the classroom games as a taste of the experience of law school. Working with a client and developing my professional style. Everything. This class is excellent.",
    "The breadth of the projects to choose from, the expertise of the instructors, and the variability of the in-class experiences all add up to a very worthwhile course in and out of the classroom. Just the right amount of reading for the lecture component of the course, too. The games\/exercises were also a great touch."

The best group work experience thus far (personally) at Yale.Disadvantages: none, really. This was the best group work experience I've had in graduate school to date. It beat many professional group work experiences I've had, too."
