   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Intro Graphic Design to another student. I had been wanting to take this class ever since arriving at Yale, and it definitely met my expectations. It taught me to think in a new way and I enjoyed getting to know my classmates; I found their comments during critique to be very insightful, more so than during discussions in some of my humanities classes. I think that it would be easy, however, for someone who is not at all interested in design and visual thinking to become bored in this class and it is probably too much work for someone who is just looking to fulfill a requirement. The class as it is now is a lot of cutting and pasting, so be prepared to use scissors and glue sticks, not only computer programs (which are only used for the very last assignments).",
    "Yes! It's a challenge to get into but well worth pursuing. The assignments range from cutting and pasting to redesigning a poster using a Zerox machine to working with Photoshop and InDesign. The work load is reasonable but heavy so be prepared to commit some time to this.",
    "No. Unless you want to be an art major and enjoy wasting your time talking about minor details - just learn the programs by yourself",
    "This class is a great way to learn to think about composition, type and presentation. You won't learn much Photoshop\/InDesign if that's what you're expecting because it's not about computer programs. It really is a class where you think visually, execute with your hands and talk about work.",
    "Although this is a graphic design course, you don't actually start working on a computer until the second half of the semester. The first part of the course is devoted to working on basics and developing abstract-thinking. Although this is quite work-heavy, it's definitely worth it if you're looking to get a more in-depth look into graphic design. Just be patient and enjoy. Art should not be overwhelmingly stressful; make it enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone who's looking into giving art a try. The way you think and approach projects will certainly become more refined.",
    "This class is an awkward mix of graphic design and compositional exercises. If you're looking for a class that will teach you the basics of Photoshop and InDesign this is not it, if you have experience and would like to go back to aesthetic basics this could be potentially be beneficial. There is a lot of work and cutting out paper for the first half but the final project is very cool.",
    "In this class you learn the basics of graphic design, from the computer software involved to how to capture ideas or emotions and communicate in a visual language. I would definitely reccomend the class to anyone interested in design or art in general. This is a really enjoyable and informative class that teaches you to look at many things around you in a different way.",
    "Really really fantastic introduction to graphic design. Even if you have already had experience in the technical aspects graphic design, this class will make you better able to discuss and understand your work, which of course leads to a better finished product. And if you're not interested in going into graphic design, that's fine, it's still a fantastic class that gets you to think about the visual world you inhabit in a more constructive way. This class will teach you to see more than you realized was there in every day life. Really cannot say anything better about it.",
    "Intro Graphic Design was a lot of work but it challenged me to think differently about the way I approach graphic design projects and come up with a systematic creative method. I took the course to improve my graphic design skills and have fun, and I achieved both of those aims in the course. However - be warned that the workload is heavy, especially when working in analog. In the first 2\/3 of the course, there is about 1 assignment per week, which is completed using analog tools (x-acto knife, glue, paper, xerox machine). Only in the last third of the course is the switch to digital tools (InDesign, Photoshop) made. When the switch to digital is made, all coursework and assignments shift focus to the final project - a coffee-table type book that contains image representations of items you collect.In general, one of the two class sessions per week is devoted to explanation of a concept or technique and the project for the week, and the other session is devoted to an in-class critique of student work. Sometimes class time is allocated to demos or in-class work\/instruction on assignments."
