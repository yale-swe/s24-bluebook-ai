   "comments": [
    "It is what it is. It doesn't make a ton of sense to take it if it's outside your major. If Professor Chalioti is teaching it again, I would definitely recommend to take it with her. She's an incredibly nice professor, and she really does care about your success in her course, which I don't think can be said for every Yale economics professor.",
    "Take it for Prof. Chalioti!",
    "This class is no doubt a grind. If you are an econ major, you obviously must take it. If you are not an econ major, it is not worth the struggle. Either way, if you do decide to take it, go full force with it; being half in \/ half out will make it miserable. 8 psets (~ 4 hours each) 2 midterms 1 final Overall workload is not awful, but it is hard.",
    "I've heard horror stories about this class, but thanks to Professor Chalioti, it was both interesting and fairly easy. This course covers all of the topics of Intro Micro but combines them with calculus. I would NOT take this class without having at least taken Math 115 (and understanding basic multivariable calculus makes everything easier). Overall not too hard of a class if you attend lecture and do the psets.",
    "Probably wouldn't recommend this people who aren't majoring in economics or some kind of mathematics but if you like this kinda stuff, I thought it was pretty interesting.",
    "Only take this class if you need to, and if you need to take it, take it after 115 (even if you took AP micro). The class is a combination of theories in 115 and multivariable calculus--so you need a bit of problem solving skills.",
    "Professor Chalioti is the best! Micro is no one's favorite class, but you probably have to take it, so take it with her if at all possible!!",
    "I would not recommend that you take this class \"for fun.\" Take a more interesting class if you don't need to take this class.",
    "Challenging yet rewarding for anyone really interested in economics, particularly Econ majors.",
    "It's really tough material and a lot of work. However, take with Prof. Chalioti if possible. She gives thorough information regarding grading and assessments and her lectures are helpful, and if you don't end up going to lecture one day she uploads complete lecture slides - that is really great. Put aside a good amount of time for the psets or else you will be unhappy on Tuesday nights.",
    "A number of majors outside of the economics major require at least one course in the intermediate sequence. I have not taken intermediate macroeconomics yet, so I cannot comment on how it compares, but I would strongly recommend that another student take this class if he or she needs an intermediate class or if he or she simply has an interest in economics. The concepts that are covered are extremely useful--not just in the realm of economics, but in general--and I did not find the workload to be too difficult. There was a fair amount of work--expect to spend a decent amount of time on each problem set, although there were only 8--but office hours, section, and general cooperation made them pretty easy to get through, I thought.",
    "Only take this class if you have to for your major. If you take this class, I recommend taking it with Eva, as she is nice, has good notes, and gives fair tests.",
    "I highly recommend this class - please take it with Eva, she's one of the best professors I've had so far at Yale. Yale needs more professors like here. She makes such an effort to engage with the students in the class and is incredibly responsive to emails, despite the large class size. I took this class for fun (not an econ major), and I thought it was very enjoyable, the material is interesting if you try and always think of the bigger picture.",
    "You know the deal if you're an econ major. If not, why in the world would you consider this course? All of the other evaluations say the same thing for a reason.",
    "Tough but not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.",
    "If you need this class for a requirement, take it because it's not terrible and you can get through it. You'll have to work hard on the PSETs and the tests are difficult.",
    "Intro to micro with calculus, essentially.",
    "I would strongly NOT recommend intermediate micro to anyone who doesn't have to take it for their major. I'm EPE so I took it, and I took it for a grade (not credit D) and I kind of regret that. But definitely don't take it unless you have to, I'd say! It's almost as bad as everyone says it is. Problem sets take a lot of time, studying for the exams takes a lot of time, and it is all very hard and unenjoyable.",
    "Its a necessary course. Try to take it with Evangelia.",
    "A requirement for the ECON major, so if you're doing that, this feedback doesn't apply to you because you have to take it sometime. Ideally, take this after you have a strong grasp of calculus as this will make the course so much easier and bearable. Nevertheless, if you like math and econ, this is a good course to take to really solidify the intuition behind the microeconomics.",
    "Intermediate Micro is a difficult class. If you're not an economics major, I'd stay away. That said, it is a satisfying class. The problem sets are a pain, but do really help in solidifying understanding of the material. Professor Chalioti's exam were fair, but be ready to put in a lot of time studying. I'd advise doing as many problems sets and old exams as possible.",
    "Professor Chalioti was amazing, and I came out of the course feeling extremely satisfied with all the material that had been covered. The grading and exams were more than fair, and the problem sets were actually useful in mastering what was taught in class. The only suggestion I have is to take this class with friends- studying and finishing the problem sets get a little tedious if you're doing it alone, but with friends, it's a good time.",
    "Most people take this class to either fulfill their Economics or EP&E requirements. Yet, this class is more than a requirement; it is a must-take for everyone who wants to develop a deeper and more systematized understanding of economics. I truly recommend it.",
    "Yes. Definitely take it with Chalioti. Honestly the best economics professor I've had so far. Not to mention she is super nice.",
    "If you're an econ major and you need to take it, I highly recommend professor Chalioti. If your not an econ major, I would credit\/d\/fail the class. Some of the material is interesting, but the exams are hard.",
    "Econ 121 is an alright course, but a lot of students struggled because they did not have a sufficient math background. What ended up happening is that some of the students ended up just trying to memorize algorithms of problems, which is frustrating and unconstructive for both the students without the sufficient math background and for the students who understand the material and want it to be more of an applications-based class than stalled in a memorization phase.",
    "It was tough. Don't take it unless you need to. It gave me nothing more practical than I got out of intro micro.",
    "Only take this class if you are an Econ major.",
    "Difficult course, but the curve is good. Just try your hardest, go to lecture, start on your problem sets early, go to office hours as much as you can, and you'll be fine.",
    "I would: interesting theories with relevant applications.",
    "ECON 121 very much is the next logical step for ECON 115: Introductory Microeconomics. It takes all the theory from that class and concretizes it with mathematical and computational components. The course moves quickly through the theory, so I would advise taking it directly after 115 if possible so the theory will not be new to you. The course technically can be taken after MATH 112 or 115\/116, but I definitely would not take this class unless you've taken MATH 118\/120 or ENAS 151. The theory requires a familiarity with Lagrange multipliers and derivations that is best found in a Multivariable calculus sequence, although you will almost certainly not use integration. Wouldn't recommend taking this with other p-set heavy courses as the problem sets from this class take significant time to master. Assuming you are EPE, Econ, Econ&Math, Applied Math on the Econ track, or Global-Development, you have to take this class or an equivalent anyway, so might as well enjoy it. If you're applied math however, ECON 125: Microeconomic Theory is a better bet for you.",
    "If you are econ or other related majors, then you will have to take it as this is one of the requirements. If not, take the class at your discretion.",
    "Brilliant, clear professor for a challenging and often unnecessary requirement for multiple majors. Take it with Professor Evangelia Chalioti and her lectures will save your life.",
    "An extension of what we learned in in intro micro, but with a lot more math. The first 2-3 weeks of this class (and the first midterm) is a real struggle, but afterwards it gets better because the techniques you learned then continue through the whole semester. Knowing multi is nice but not necessary. Psets took forever, but there are lots of resources like office hours (mostly held at CSSI Library, possibly the farthest I've ever traveled on Yale's campus), piazza (an online question-asking forum where the TFs and professor respond fairly quickly), and section (which was extremely helpful). I thought the \"real-life applications\" were too basic\/ we spent too much time on them for an intermediate micro class, at the expense of the harder stuff at the end. And, the final was quite nit-picky, but the curve seems to not be terrible. I think it is virtually impossible to get below a B-. Not as bad as it's made out to be, and I definitely enjoyed going more in-depth into the theory and fundamentals of microeconomics.",
    "I would summarize it as a very math and calculus based economics course that's pretty tedious. I mean I would recommend taking Prof. Chalioti's iteration of the class to people who need to take it but I certainly wouldn't recommend the class to non-econ majors who don't have to take it.",
    "An easy class if you're good at math with a really tough curve if you're shooting for an A. Nothing extraordinary when it comes to material.",
    "If you have to take ECON121 and you actually want to learn some econ take it with Samuelson in the fall. This time around the course was disorganized, lectures were slow, confusing and concepts were poorly explained. Problem sets were written by the TAs and were thus often too difficult and tedious (about 5-10 hours a week) and bore little relation to material covered in lecture. The only saving grace is that they were graded (mainly) on completion. Save yourself the trouble and just get your answers from a TA at office hours. Two midterms that were both pretty easy if you kept up with the class (on the second midterm the median was 89 and average 78, go figure) but they made the final surprisingly tough. Only reason why you should take this class is either you don't want to wake up at 9am or because the curve is supposedly easier given that people taking micro in the spring are Not As Smart (think athletes, EP&E majors needing to fulfil their requirements and taking it Cr\/D etc.). However this year the class also saw a surprisingly large number of overeager freshmen who were pretty irritating and messed up the curve. And ultimately I'm not so sure what I took away from the whole semester apart from how to do a Lagrangian and lots of Very Tedious Algebra.",
    "Good straight forward class with Prof Chalioti. The Psets were usually fair and the exams were very reflective of the material presented in class.",
    "Having read previous years evaluations, I can assert that ECON 121 is a worthwhile and manageable class specifically with Professor Chalioti. She cares tremendously about the students and that the crucial concepts are sufficiently covered in lecture, and, at least for Benjamin Schickner's section, a more rigorous mathematical approach fills in any gaps left in lecture due to time constraints. The midterms were, as she said, \"fair\" and objectively easier than the problem sets, though the final was a bit surprising.",
    "This is a difficult course with a big focus on math and mathematical concepts. However, it is interesting and challenging, and the exams are very fair.",
    "Fantastic class. The lectures were clear and organized, and the problem sets were appropriately challenging and really reinforced the concepts we learned. Professor Chalioti is wonderful -- she really wants the best for all her students. Her exams were very fair, and she was always so patient and helpful during office hours. I feel like I walked away from this class with a very solid understanding of basic microeconomics. I definitely recommend taking this class with Professor Chalioti!",
    "Econ 121 is probably a requirement you can't avoid if you're reading this, but taking the course with Eva would probably be the best choice.",
    "Yeah I mean only take it if you have to.",
    "An interesting course with much more math rigor than macro.",
    "It is not an easy course, but it is not bad at all if you put in the work.",
    "Gut class. Take as 7th course",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. Eva is an amazing professor and her classes are always very enjoyable and interesting.",
    "it basically applies calc to intro micro. I would recommend it. It's interesting.",
    "A bit tough, necessary econ requirement. Good course overall.",
    "You probably should not be taking this class unless its a requirement because the content is not particularly engaging. Take it with Eva Chalioti if you have to because she genuinely cares for her students and makes the class a lot more bearable.",
    "Challenging but rewarding course. A much more theoreticaland mathematical approach to micro, but still definitely doable. The class material is actually very interesting and it is rewarding being able to grasp the subjects. Chalioti is a great professor, definitely try and take it with her. Problem sets are long and are very difficult to solve on your own towrds the end of the semester; definitely go to office hours. This is an overall time consuming and mentally challenging class but I would definitely recommend it. It presents essential microeconomic theory, teaches many different forms of utility maximization and cost minimization and applies mathematics to real life economics problems.",
    "I would summarize ECON 121 as a course that follows a similar pattern of topics as ECON 115 but covers them in much more mathematical depth. I would recommend ECON 121 to another student who is interested in gaining a thorough mathematical and theoretical foundation in microeconomics. It helps to have a basic familiarity with multivariable calculus, such as partial derivatives, but is not necessary.",
    "Stellar.",
    "Econ 121 is a class that I would recommend to econ and non-econ majors alike. It does require work, but its well worth it.",
    "Yes, if you can do and enjoy math, I would recommend this class.",
    "Most difficult econ major requirement. Only take it if you intend to major in econ. Be ready to spend a lot of time on the weekly psets that are very useful for test preparation though.",
    "Would only recommend it to ECON majors and people with a decent mathematical background.",
    "hard material and lecture can be boring, but you probably need to take this class and from what I've heard from others this semester went better than others. be prepared to put in work, and go to class even if it's not exciting. the psets are hard and take time, so start them early and definitely go see the TAs.",
    "Econ 121 introduces the mathematics behind microeconomics. It helps significantly if you have a strong math background before entering the course. The length of the problem sets varied greatly from week to week, but in general, they were of about average length. Despite the emphasis on mathematics, I would say this course still emphasizes applications rather than theory.",
    "Dry material, but it is a great challenge to overcome. Take it with Prof. Chalioti if possible."
