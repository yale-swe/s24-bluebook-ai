    "This class is a thought-provoking study of the relationship between the black body and the state, specifically regarding health access and care. I would absolutely recommend this class because it presents information in a new and very interesting manner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The small setting, good reading, a professor that cares... makes for a great seminar!",
    "This class explores race and health in new and creative ways. Much of the information taught in this class I'd never heard of before. Take this course was Prof. Ivy. She is amazing and allows her student to actually discuss th material that is read at home! The work isn't too much that you cannot complete it. And each class is a new experience!"
