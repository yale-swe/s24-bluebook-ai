   "comments": [
    "I would say \"Don't get into Slanski's section. Otherwise you'll be fine.\"I would not recommend this class in itself, but as part of DS it is worth it.",
    "Historical and Political Thought is a bit of a nebulous concept, but I found reading the historians, in particular, intriguing. I would suggest Directed Studies to students who want a full picture of the Western tradition and are willing to work hard for that end.",
    "Kathryn Slanski is a very rigorous instructor. I found her course very challenging, oftentimes overwhelming, but I emerged with a complete knowledge of the works studied. Though we never discussed current events (or Hitler or Stalin), I have the next three and a half years for those conversations. Professor Slanski did her job very well and very thoroughly. Do not expect an A.",
    "Great professor, but consider taking the class Cr\/D.",
    "I would recommend this class, although it was hard to fall into the swing of things for a while. I would be wary of it if you know you won't do most of the readings; first of all, I'm sure Prof Slanski would suss it out pretty quickly, and second of all, the class won't be nearly as meaningful or fun.",
    "Directed Studies Historical and Political Thought is a survey course of Western historical and political thinkers. By reading great historians and political theorists, students in the course gain a deeper understanding of the ideas that underlie modern jurisprudence, diplomacy, politics, and history-writing. I would recommend DS H&P, especially if you are interested in history or politics. Although the course can occasionally seem a bit incoherent because of the numerous themes that it seeks to cover and its sheer scope in trying to cover history, historiography, politics, and political theory, it is well worth it.",
    "H&P has some hilarious or at least fascinating historical texts (Herodotus' dolphin-riding Arion is my homeboy), but some of the others are pretty dry. I'd certainly recommend DS in general, though, and Professor Slanski definitely makes this class worthwhile. More than any other H&P instructor, Professor Slanski understands the texts, and she expects a similarly careful and thoughtful reading from her students. It's often intimidating at first, but I found that I always left the class with a different--and inevitably more nuanced--understanding of the text. Her critiques of your papers are incredibly helpful, and she really takes the time to make you a more logical, organized, and effective writer. You'll be asked to substantiate your claims with text, to look at political motivations and political thought. You'll definitely come out of the class a better writer and a better thinker. Also, Professor Slanski feeds you fairly frequently and is the mother of the cutest kid ever. Take this class with her if you get the chance.",
    "Take DS, and if you get Professor Slanski, consider it a blessing! She is a strict grader but it will help you and really push you to be the best you can be. She will make you think harder than you've ever thought before, and she will push you to write like you've ever written before. Looking back, the hard work and stressful sections will be worth it! Do not shy away from this challenge.",
    "Unfortunately, you cannot opt out of one section of DS. This class was sometimes only worth the trouble because of the other two sections, Literature and Philosophy. I did, however, gain what I feel is vital knowledge through some choice texts (Treatise on Law, Aristotle's Politics, The Republic).",
    "The class sets out to explore the changes and development in historical writing by reading and analyzing the major works in the Western Canon. We focus more on the manner in which the events are relayed more than the actual historical events themselves. I would definitely recommend this class because the works are very difficult to decipher without the help of someone who already has a great knowledge of them, but they are very important and interesting works.",
    "This is the only course of the three in DS that has a dual nature, as about half the readings were more historical in nature and half were more focused on political thought and philosophy. Thatmakes it more difficult to summarize the course as a whole. But I would say that the course tries to present these subjects as two sides of the same coin, as each affects the other. For me, the most interesting aspect of this course was having the chance to discover how applicable the books of this course were to the historical and political thought of our day. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to acquire this perspective."
