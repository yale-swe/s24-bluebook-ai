    "Take this class if it seems interesting. I took it as a Linguistics major with little interest in Semantics but needing a QR, and I found the material interesting, the workload manageable, and the concepts well explained. Absolutely no math background is required, but a little Linguistics background could be helpful. The lecture could be dull and too slow\/repetitive, and there was a lot of terminology that seemed to be assumed that we knew and I never understood. Still, I could do all the assignments without knowing some of the stuff in lecture I didn't grasp, so it worked out alright. There are just about four problem sets over the semester and short mini-assignments (actually very short), and you can get help if you need it. I'd say the reading is optional, and it was simply too difficult for me to understand.",
    "Yes, because it is interesting and a QR.",
    "This is a great course. Semantics is really interesting stuff, and you learn a lot of cool ideas about formal systems and meaning. Though it has no prerequisites, it is definitely helpful to have some familiarity with syntax (drawing trees, e.g.) and logic\/math notation and ideas. However, if you don't mind a bootcamp for that stuff in the first few weeks, you will definitely get a lot out of this course (regardless of your background)."
