   "comments": [
    "It was hard to take much away from this class. Lectures were a little unorganized and politicized the point where I thought I was taking in a slanted view of propaganda, ideology, and democracy. Professor Stanley often said that he tries to not make the class political, yet he offered no other viewpoint that could challenge his own. For someone who is teaching a class about propaganda, it very much felt that he was propagandizing as well. I also took the class to get the opportunity to read some Nazi philosophy and propaganda, which was around a third of the reading materials. I was frustrated to find a week before we were meant to start covering the material that Professor Stanley had dropped the entire section.",
    "I gained a lot of insight and knowledge on various historical uses of propaganda in creating ideologies and social milieu's effect on how people see the world and therefore treat others.",
    "We read so much about propaganda and government structures! it was great",
    "Learned about underlying causes of various societal regimes and behaviors, racism, fascism, etc",
    "The class was a bit lackadaisical in both its content and form, though not in an exciting way. It seemed unfocused and haphazard. I did not gain any particular insights which I found particularly nuanced or anything but hackneyed. Anyone who has read the tiniest smidge of critical theory would have a better grasp on the meaning of ideology or propaganda than someone who has taken this class.",
    "The course is as much a historical overview of oppressive ideology as it is a philosophical exploration. I gained a general understating of the contexts of propaganda and totalitarianism as they have pervaded society in the past and today.",
    "critical thinking, considering and exposing ourselves to country viewpoints, writing",
    "I learned how to connect philosophical concepts to current events",
    "I gained knowledge about and experience in applied philosophical thought.",
    "I learned about how to identify the strategies that propaganda uses, and this was really helping thinking about the political climate of America and the world right now.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of what propaganda, ideology, and democracy are as well as how they intersect in the 2019 political landscape",
    "Understanding the importance of and impact of ideologies which enables me to more critically evaluate the world around me.",
    "I learned in depth what ideology is, what it does, and how it can be a threat to democracy through the use of propaganda. I also learned about the various uses of propaganda and how it relates to art.",
    "Not many.",
    "I have a completely new understanding of the power of speech to change minds, influence behavior, and even incite violence. I was exposed to a new array of readings, and I found the essay prompts quite engaging.",
    "I learned a lot about the complexities and depth of ideology and the way it is mobilized through propaganda.",
    "This course aided in deeper understanding of philosophy behind ideology, democracy, and propaganda. The three essays all helped in learning how to better use sources in my own arguments.",
    "Learned how to examine ideological trends and propaganda associated, particularly as they relate to government or modes of thinking.",
    "How to think critically about ideology and propaganda, especially in terms of how our life has \"always already\" been restricted to and founded upon some form of ideology and how we have been contributing to the prolonging of such an ideology",
    "This was my first philosophy class so I learned how to read philosophical texts and analyse them. I also learned how to connect diverse schools of thought \/ theories to each other and apply these theories to contemporary problems.",
    "I learned how to think more intellectually about a host of issues and interrogate my assumptions from far more angles.",
    "I gained insight into how to confront the seemingly natural and permanent aspects of society with a critical lens. I came to understand the ways in which ideologies and the structures that are created by them reinforce one another and how they work to create a habitus that can serve to keep oppressed groups complacent in their oppression. I would say, above all, I learned how to question my environment and the ways in which world views have influenced and continue to influence subtle aspects of it."

   "comments": [
    "The topic is naturally very interesting. The Russian propaganda section I thought was taught very well. However, the rest of the class I found to be frustrating. I can't stress enough how political the class was and how unwelcoming it may be for someone of different political opinions to that of Professor Stanley. I know it is hard to remove political feelings from a class about philosophy and its application to politics, but surely there is a more dispassionate way to go about things.",
    "Strengths include some really fascinating readings from a diverse array of authors. Cons were general disorganization of the course.",
    "Strengths: good readings Weaknesses: lecture style, mixed section involvement, so much reading and sometimes at the last minute",
    "I think perhaps there could be a chunk of the grade assigned to some other type of assignment, like 500 word essays or something because if you do poorly on any essay(the first, for example if it is your first philosophy paper) it is hard to still do well in the class",
    "The course was a little all over the place in terms of scheduling. Professor Stanley had a lot he wanted to teach us, more than he could fit into a semester. He ended up making some changes throughout the term which made the readings and schedule of what we would learn a bit confusing.",
    "The themes for the class were disorganized and it felt like no coherent narrative was formed around the topics covered. In part this had to do with Professor Stanley's utter unpreparedness. He continually showed up to class 10-15 minutes late (the class is only 50 minutes) without notes or without even having done the readings recently -- it seemed like he only had the most basic knowledge of them from reading them in graduate school. He then went on to put forth simplistic and deeply flawed readings of texts which he passed off as truth, in turn leaning on comments from the TAs who would trouble his proclamations about complex readings in such an overtly problematic way. His insertion of the political into the theoretical also was disturbing to say the least. He would continually allude to conclusions about a theoretical or ideological identity between fascism in Germany and the politics of the contemporary United States. Clearly there are similarities, but the way in which he would cite them was vastly over simplified and at times quite crude; the level of tact he had in dealing with these questions was low. To improve the course, he should definitely prepare his lectures ahead of time, or at the very least, have done a more thorough reading of the texts that we cover in lecture. He should also attempt to (if possible) draw more complex narratives around the texts, forming connections and points of continuity; right now, it seemed a bit like an incoherent hodge podge centered around grandiose claims without any grounding -- claims like: propaganda takes a concept like freedom and articulates a contradictory version of it. Certainly this statement might have some validity, but the particularities of something like 'freedom' or 'truth' were unqualified and rendered those claims meaningless and inane.",
    "The readings were interesting and the sections were very helpful but I found the lectures disorganized and somewhat random. They covered the readings but lacked a central theme\/takeaway\/narrative.",
    "strengths: interesting content, mind-opening, challenging, support, welcoming environment weaknesses: organization",
    "The syllabus definitely needs to be revised so that we know in January what we will be reading in February",
    "The lecture style of the course sometimes made discussing a specific idea or topic difficult because there wasn't enough time to talk about everything. Usually the weekly section made up for this by allowing for more specific discussions.",
    "It would benefit from being a little more organized and being clear where to find all the readings \/ when the readings are due, but other than that it was very strong in reading choices and materials and topics!",
    "Strength: Stanley is THE expert and is a joy to learn from; Weakness: Lectures range in how much information is packed in, sometimes he can go off-topic (which is fine by me given how relevant the material is today)",
    "I bought the all the books for this class but he ended up uploading all the chapters to canvas anyways - please either do this in advance or don't to this at all to prevent low-income students from wasting money!",
    "We were talking about and listening to someone so knowledgeable about such important topics which was really cool. On the downside, Professor Stanley was very disorganized which made it really hard to plan when to do the long and dense readings.",
    "The texts we read in this course was probably the best part of the course. The lectures were also very good for the majority of the time as professor Stanley synthesis the readings and explains the difficult concepts to us in it. Sometimes however, the lectures could go a little bit off topic but that was never a problem.",
    "I'm not a fan of Prof Stanley's performative wokeness. I don't like paper prompts that ask you to just mirror an argument of a paper you've read instead of asking you to be remotely creative.",
    "I love the lectures. Sometimes the readings are challenging on their own, but lecture and section really aid understanding.",
    "Professor Stanley is a wonderful Professor and makes this class an incredibly engaging lecture. It fills in some glaring gaps in the philosophy department's material and perspective.",
    "Stanley can get away with rambling because hes brilliant, but a bit more structure would have made it a better class",
    "The strengths of the course are the readings, which are extremely well thought out. The weaknesses of the course are the lectures, which are usually haphazard.",
    "The readings, lectures, and section were all interesting, but they felt disjointed at times. The readings were much more philosophical than our lectures or sections. That being said, I enjoyed all three and found the material very engaging.",
    "This course exhibits authors that are often neglected in the field of philosophy and puts them to good use. It was insightful and thrilling.",
    "Various materials (not only philosophical reading materials, but also poli-sci papers, magazine articles, and videos) to think about the impact of ideology\/propaganda",
    "This course is designed for all majors, not solely Philosophy or Education Studies scholars. Many of the assigned readings were often dense texts, however, I learned how to skim them and the weekly discussion sections and weekly reading responses also helped me to further analyse and parse apart these texts with my peers. Although it was designed for all students, I would have appreciated more information on how to properly read dense texts because I felt like I often did not read them correctly.",
    "I thought the readings of the class as well as the essay topics were challenging, informative, and exciting. I think one potential weakness of the course would have been the class' timing(a large portion of the class did not wake up for the 9am start time).",
    "The reading material that was discussed was very well selected. I believe that it served well to emphasize many of the topics in a didactic way and introduced complex philosophical topics in a manner that really forced students to think critically about their role in certain structures of domination. However, I think that in exploring many of the racial aspects of philosophical theory, I do not think that enough emphasis was placed on how ways to address unequal structures or discussion on solutions to them."

   "comments": [
    "I heard great things about this class before I took it. It seems that it varies a lot from year to year. I would recommend shopping the class simply because of the subject matter, but I would say be careful. It can backfire and feel like you're taking a class without learning anything.",
    "I think the topic is really interesting and and it's a worthwhile course, however it can feel disorganized at times and lectures aren't based on slides or super organized.",
    "Prof. Stanley brings in some great resources and the topics themselves are absolutely worth studying but be prepared to record or otherwise slog through lectures",
    "I would",
    "Yes! As a non-philosophy major, I found this course super interesting and very accessible. I wanted to read some famous philosophers without having to take boring into courses, and this class is perfect for that. You read DuBois, Arendt, Bourdieu, Mills, and others and get to talk about them in terms of interesting modern applications. The assignments are only 3 papers (5-7 pages) so not that bad, and section was usually really interesting. Definitely worth it and super timely, I see propaganda everywhere now.",
    "No I would not recommend this course; it was fudged a lot of the important content which supposedly propelled the class' instantiation. It did not give an adequate account of the reasons for revolution or for mass discontent, and was an almost incoherent set of equivalences between histories and political agendas.",
    "If you are interested in historical philosophy and the underpinnings of oppression, then yes. I found the material engaging despite my limited background in philosophy, although there was a lot of reading.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, its very good and Stanley is an interesting professor",
    "Yes, the content was amazing",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with any level of experience with philosophy. This is a great introductory course into applied philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend! exciting class with exciting topics, and definitely makes you think about the ways propaganda affects you.",
    "Definitely! Stanley is amazing and the content is extremely relevant. We all need to apply a philosophical lens to the issues of our time.",
    "Yes! It's a good course to take in conjunction with The Harlem Renaissance or another AfAm class.",
    "Yes because we were thinking about such important things. No because it was so disorganized and a lot of reading BUT you are able to get through it just fine by skimming readings and just doing the most important ones.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I believe this course is extremely important as propaganda has grown in use in the recent years.",
    "Only if you need a fifth class.",
    "Yes; will totally change how you think about speech and ideology. Very relevant to the political landscape of today.",
    "It was very interesting, though lectures were often disorganized and discussion sections werent that conducive to rich conversation.",
    "Yes!",
    "No. The readings will be done throughout other classes as well, and nothing really ties the ideas of propaganda, ideology, and democracy together.",
    "Yes! But doing the readings is important, even though youre not graded on doing so.",
    "Yes, we tend to treat propaganda\/ideology as an anomaly-like Nazism or Stalinism-which took place in the past, in far-away countries, by the initiative of some crazy politicians. However, this course urges us to change our too shallow understanding of ideology\/propaganda. This course provides a philosophical way to realise that we are living in and creating ideology\/propaganda, and how we can recognise and challenge our narrow-mindedness and arbitrariness, formed by the ideologised worldview that we have internalised through our social life",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any other student. This course explicitly challenged the traditional canon of philosophy by including works that address systematic structures of racism, imperialism, and colonialism through the works of W. E. B. Du Bois, Jane Addams, Charles Mills, and Hannah Arendt. This course taught me basic theoretical principles of ideology, democracy, and propaganda upon which I can build in my future studies.",
    "Yes I certainly would-the class is a great introduction to thinking philosophically for students of any year.",
    "This was a very enlightening course. It introduced me to the different ways in which I can analyze my environment and instructed me in how to pull apart the shrouds that hide the truth to the structure of my society. In doing so, I believe that I have grown tremendously and that anyone who takes this course will come to better understand their specific role in their society."
