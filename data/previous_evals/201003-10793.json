    "Yes, you must take it. Wonderful opportunity to discuss cutting-edge research with professors, post-docs, graduate students, and chipper undergrads. A trivial amount of work (responsibility for leading a discussion of one paper and work on a team to design a space mission).",

    "This course helped give me a better understand of what scientific questions are currently considered most interesting. It would have been much more useful if it were longer and more intense. Even the people who desperately wanted to contribute in seminar often didn't have time to share everything they wanted during the meager 1 hour\/week allocated for this class."
