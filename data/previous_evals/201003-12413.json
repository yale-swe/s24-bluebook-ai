    "I would recommend this course. It is an excellent seminar that gives the student a better understanding of epidemiology past, present, and future.",
    "Take it. It is an interesting class with a great and easy-going professor. There is not very much homework, although occasionally there will be a large reading due. It is also possible to avoid some of the reading as long as you are still able to participate in class. The only graded assignments are a midterm paper (5-7 pages) and a final paper (3000 words), so the workload is very easily managed.",
    "DEFINITELY. YOU'RE AN IDIOT IF YOU DON'T TAKE THIS.",
    "Epidemics in Global Perspective surprised me as I was expecting a scientific diagnosis of epidemics. Instead, the course communicated the facts about epidemics through literature (The Plague, The Band Played On, The Immoralist, etc). This led to some good class discussions but sometimes our class had a hard time sustaining an engaging hour and 15 minute discussion about tuberculosis. This class is truly what you make of it. Unfortunately I was stuck on the shore of \"I already know this\" since my mother is an epidemiologist. Thus, I never had any questions. But if you can bring interesting questions, you will have a great experience with this class.",
    "Humanities 076 is a survey course of the impacts of many different global epidemics. Yes, i would absolutely recommend it.",
    "This class offers a broad analysis of the history of specific epidemics, and tries to examine the greater implications of those epidemics on society. I feel like I was exposed to a lot of great literature and information, but it didn't intensify my love of the subject, and may have actually decreased it. More focused activities might be better to expand information vertically to get a deeper understanding of the actual societal implications.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I'm really glad I was able to have the freshman seminar experience in a low-stress way. The readings are interesting and not too difficult. Discussions are generally lively and pleasant. There is a NY trip that's a good bonding experience for the class. Bill is friendly and is clearly very knowledgeable aboutthe topic and in general.",
    "I do not recommend this class. The books we read can be very interesting, but discussion is often very dry, and you can get by doing very little work. And honestly, you can read book by yourself, so taking this class is not necessary. Find a better freshman seminar!",
    "I would recommend the class to another freshman, it is a good starting class since it is mostly reading and 2 fun writing assignments. To summarize it, the class had reading then a discussion on the reading. The reading was tied to a certain epidemic's time period and we discussed how the epidemic affected social, economic, and political systems during that time period, and how that time period's social, economic, and political systems either helped humans combat the epidemic or more likely exacerbated the situation. The only thing I would say to another student is to read ahead.",
    "I would, but you have to be interested in such a topic first.",
    "Yes; great material and not too stressful",
    "The readings for this course are very interesting, but the course itself does not seem very beneficial. This class was fine as a 5th course, but I would not choose to take this class if I could go back to the beginning of the semester knowing what I know now."
