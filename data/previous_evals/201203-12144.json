    "Great, practical course. i would definitely take it",
    "It's pretty boring and you don't learn how to implement any of the stuff. Everything happens in Excel which is a black box.",
    "yes, if you're willing to make an effort to read the textbook.you could get by just reading enough to do the problem sets, but if you don't read the book beginning to end, you won't really leave the course having a full understanding of Linear Programming and Generalizations (Optimization)",
    "This class was guh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6guh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6guh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6great! Just kidding, I barely went. Look, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a course on how to use Excel Solver that tries to be a math course and fails. The material is not generally hard, but Prof. Denardo has a knack of skimming the non-trivial portions and spending inordinate amounts of time on those parts that you could teach your dog (and not just those brainy Australian Shepherd types). A few die-hard Denardo fans consistently went to class, captivated both by his stories of the good old days when the RAND Corporation actually did things and by the challenge of answering his frequent fuh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6fuh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6ful\u00e2\u0080\u00a6fill in the blank questions, but I suspect most other people skipped like me and just read the textbook. As past reviewers have noted, the textbook is Denardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, complete with all his delightful obfuscations, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all that easy to follow, though you are able to go at your own pace. The exercises were especially unclear and most of the points I got off throughout the term were because I ended up answering what turned out not to be the actual question posed. Maybe if I attended class I would have been more familiar with Denardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s odd phraseology, but I did work with a couple hardcore Denardans and they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much less bewildered.Tests are all take home and you have around 4 days to complete them. Midterm was pretty easy. Final was confusing. The first problem on the final was, as Denardo revealed to me after I begged him for a hint, apparently impossible to do using the methods we knew and were advised to use. This was not purposeful on his part. So yeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even Denardo doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always understand Denardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions.That said, Eric Denardo is a lovely, friendly, grandpa-like personality who is always willing to help and he looks pretty dapper in his Gant shirts and straw hat.",
    "This is an interesting course with useful information and cool applications. The work is a bit difficult, in my opinion, so if you can take this Credit\/D I would. The midterm wasn't too hard, the final was very difficult. Weekly problem sets are manageable, and there are plenty of resources available for help. It can be difficult to motivate oneself to attend lecture given that most of what is covered is in the book, but the professor is so sweet, and attendance is worth it just for his stories about life in the RAND Corporation during its heyday.",
    "Yeah, it's actually a really interesting course and the applications are really wide. You don't really need anything except a good grasp of calculus and a basic familiarity with linear algebra\/matrices. Professor Denardo has universal office hours so you can go talk to him for help anytime he is in office. Homework doesn't take very long at all. Midterm was easy, but the final was pretty hard. Good class to take Cr\/D",
    "A good course to learn about optimization techniques. Very application based, which is nice if you've taken many theoretical classes with no applications.",
    "AMTH 235\/OPRS 235 is a good course in optimization theory and application that, to an extent, overlaps material taught in linear algebra and economic theory courses, but goes well beyond these courses to teach the main results of mathematical optimization in linear programming, its applications, and nonlinear programming. While the course may initially seem intimidating since operations research is not popular at Yale, this course combines math and economics with operations research to study the theory of optimization and to show students how this theory can be applied in decision-making. The workload for the course is average compared to other Yale classes, but is lighter in requirements than most mathematics and economic theory courses. The class\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workload consisted of weekly problem sets (3-5 questions), a take-home midterm examination (a Thursday through Tuesday in October), and a take-home final examination (any 96-hour period between the last day of classes and the last day of exams). Overall, the exams were very fair and, while they took a considerable amount of time and effort, were not exceedingly difficult. Additionally, the exams were very instructive and often highlighted some interesting nuance of optimization. I would recommend AMTH 235\/OPRS 235 to students who are economics majors, economics and mathematics majors, applied mathematics majors, or students who are looking for an intermediate level QR credit or a math course with good applications. I would not, however, recommend it to pure mathematics majors since it is mainly application-based and the mathematics is not particularly rigorous. Taking this class and having the tools of optimization taught in this class under one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belt can only enhance and improve the learning experience in many of Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advanced undergraduate economics courses, especially since this course yields a perspective on economic equilibrium, game theory, and opportunity cost."
