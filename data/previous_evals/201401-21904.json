   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommended. The subject matter is fascinating- you'll want to engage in all 2+ hours of the class. Workload is super manageable, especially compared to other senior seminars.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "great class. you learn a lot about babies. super chill and professor is really nice.",
    "You sit around a table and talk about the readings, how the experiments could have been improved, alternatives to the experiments in the readings, and how they are\/are not effective.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are interested in understanding babies' minds and development! This is a great seminar to take, even if you aren't a senior. It's a very low-stress class but you really get a lot out of it if you do the weekly readings and participate in class discussions.",
    "Once a week seminar with weekly response papers (9 total or 4 and a longer paper) and two debates. The work load and reading loads aren't too heavy, and seminar is fun -- you get to talk about the research and any interesting related topics or questions people come up with.",
    "A fascinating exploration of infant and child development. I would recommend this course to any student interested in psychology! As opposed to the breadth of material explored in lectures, this course delves deep into a series of fascinating questions involving the development of morality, selfishness, altruism, in-group\/out-group, etc. It will make you think!",
    "This class is an extremely detailed look at one area of infant cognition. Many of the papers cite each other or overlap, so you get a good opportunity to really understand the area that is being discussed. That said, if you are not interested in the area it could be extremely tedious. Many people taking this class for the senior requirement did not have to write a full length paper as the 10 reading responses (2 pages each) could count for the requirement. Over-all I recommend this class, obviously depending on the exact topic and whether or not you find it interesting.",
    "The course is an amazing overview on some of the most pertinent topics in the field. You are given the option of doing 9 reaction papers (they're like reading responses) or 5 of them + a term paper, and especially if you do the first option you will end up actually reading most of the papers and so you learn a lot. The strength is definitely in the breath and depth of the material, but the weakness is often in class discussion. Most of the discussion is actually quite good, but since it's a 2 hour seminar right after lunch people are going to get tired and sleepy and as the semester goes on people lose steam. If you take it, it's important to note that initially doing 9 reading responses makes more sense since you don't have to write a final paper, but it actually for me probably ended up being more work since you HAD to do the reading each week, versus if you wrote a paper you could just crank it out in one night and be done with it. But then again if you had many term papers doing 9 might end up being a good choice.",
    "This is a good class and Professor Wynn is great. You'll read some interesting papers and have some good discussions. Also, if you plan well, you can space your writing evenly throughout the semester and not have to write a final paper. The one drawback was that to me, discussions started to seem a little repetitive by the end."
