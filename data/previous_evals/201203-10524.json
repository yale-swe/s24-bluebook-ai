    "Dave Johnson will teach you the basics of machining: milling, turning (lathe), etc. The central project to the course is a model steam engine, which each student in this course will produce. I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone who enjoys hands-on work and is interested in better understanding the nature of machining. Students are taught how to operate lathes, mills, and other tools by hand, but some CNC is taught as well.",
    "Must take class!",
    "A great class. Dave really knows his stuff and will teach so everyone can understand.",
    "There is literally no reason you should not take this class. The course teaches you your way around various shop machines, with an overall goal of building an adorable and incredible steam engine. Regardless of your shop background, you'll learn something new from Dave Johnson, and you'll have a great time doing it to boot. Take it take it take it take it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Laid back, fun, and you learn a ton of very useful stuff.",
    "If you want to learn machining, this is the perfect class to start.",
    "I would recommend this class to any other student who is mechanically minded. It is fun and would serve as an important skill set to have if one is to pursue a career in engineering or applied science."

   "comments": [
    "I now have vastly improved prototyping\/production capability, and a firmer intuition of both what can be done to stock metal to fabricate a part and how long it should take.",
    "It was just a fun class with steam engines!",
    "I am positive that the skills that I developed in this course will come in very handy as I continue my research and eventually have to fabricate parts for myself. Extremely, extremely useful course.",
    "Working as a graduate student in an engineering-based lab, machining is inevitable. Have the right mind set as well as knowing what to do and being able to do it yourself is always a plus."
