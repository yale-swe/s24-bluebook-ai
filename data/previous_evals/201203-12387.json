    "This class! Yes! Just take it even if you think you will never write well ever. Because Deb will actually make you believe that that doesn't matter and that you should just write. Take this class take this class. It will feel so good even if you think you stink or think you will never do this with life. Take it especially if you think you stink.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Deb is the best, and you will be so glad you took this class. She helps people write the plays they should be writing. She's amazing. Take it.",
    "SO GREAT. TAKE THIS CLASS. What an exciting, supportive way to enter the complicated, challenging, beautiful world of playwriting.",
    "Take this course! Your understanding of your writing, yourself, and the way you interact with the world around you will grow tenfold! You will have transcendent experiences. You will laugh, you will cry, you will understand, you will fail to understand (and you will learn from that, too), you will speak, you will listen, you will engage fully, you will grow together as a supportive community of writers, and you will be thankful. Take this course.",
    "A creative environment for a classroom. Writing exercises that culminate in the writing of a play. If you want to write a play, yes, take this class.",
    "ITs a great class. If you want to write a play, take it. If you have no idea what you want to write on, that's okay. If you do have an idea, thats great too! You learn a lot about yourself and your potential rather than specific writing methods or structures.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. You don't have to have any experience in playwriting. Take it.",
    "If you have any interest in writing a play in any form take this class. It's a great experience!",
    "It's a wonderful introduction to the art of playwriting. I would most definitely recommend it to someone who has any interest in playwriting or theatre.",
    "Take this class if you want to write a play. It will force you to actually put something down on paper and be productive about making new work. Deb is an absolute joy and will teach you things about playwriting and yourself."
