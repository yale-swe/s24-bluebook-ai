    "David Kneas is an amaaaaaazing TF!!!",
    "Great class, but at times difficult to relate how topics and tensions discussed inform policy work (in other words, brought many questions to surface, but very few answers, so hard to contextualize).",
    "The instructor gives lectures that are very well thought and very valuable, but the way he talks is a little plain so it's easy to feel sleepy...",
    "I would consider seriously, if asked, to permit the possibility that Professor Dove is from the future, traveling backward through time Merlin Style, to help the people of the present prepare their thought for the problems of tomorrow.It is a privilege to hear his incisive questions, which have expanded my understanding of knowledge, power, and development.This class, although slow at times, was a tour of a remarkable array of historical and contemporary thought on the politics of development and knowledge of the environment.I am personally more interested in epistemology than international development, and feel that the course could have been focused even more towards this side. It did not necessarily provide a cohesive history of anthropological thought on environmental issues.the readings were fascinating, although often too substantial and numerous to be practical.The format for the class was partially great and partially challenging. See more below.",
    "Question 7) There were no field trips. Field trips could have been an interesting addition to the learning process--for me variety in learning material, variety in class structure and variety in environment can all serve to spark creativity in thought and process. That would be my main recommendation for future classes--seek to integrate just a little more variety and experimentation into these 3 areas...I'm not suggesting that there wasn't variety--there was for sure, but maybe we just needed 10% more--especially with class structure--it seemed like students needed a little more prompting to feel comfortable to experiment and take ownership over seminar and to feel comfortable in structuring it in less conventional ways.It seemed like seminar could have been more productive if it were structured differently at times; perhaps smaller groups so that more people felt comfortable talking and sharing--especially the international students. There were fellow classmates who I barely heard from all semester. It might be nice if 2 or 3 seminars over the course of the semester were deliberately structured very differently from the rest. Also, it might be interesting to experiment with having 2 seminar sessions per week---perhaps shorter in length, but just as a test run to see if students like having a little more time for processing and reflecting on the material together.Perhaps at the beginning of the semester there could be a little bit of time for students to go around the room and share ideas for how to structure seminar--preferences, ideas, expectations. This might provide the impetus for student-initiated experimentation and seminar leadership later on in the semester. It seems important that students know they are encouraged to be creative and take ownership over their learning experience.Overall, great class.",
    "Question 3 and 4: The workload (ie - the readings) were sometimes heavy making the following week's lecture seem to go by very quickly if one did not thoroughly read all the material. In one or two lectures I felt a bit lost but not because of the instructor's teaching style but because I could not complete all the readings or look through the supplemental material.",
    "This is a foundation course and the best experience to be in Prof. Dove's class",
    "Question 1: The readings certainly represent a heavy workload, and I know no one who actually read all of them - which is a pity. Would omitting certain extraneous chapters from some of the longer readings (books) be an option? This would ensure students are actually reading the most important parts of the assigned works...Question 2: There should be more clarity on the demands for the commentaries. That was unclear, especially since the guidelines in the syllabus weren't followed by fellow students, and there seemed to be no repercussions of that. Further, there should be clearer guidelines about student discussion leaders and expectations for discussion portions of class.Question 10: I wished for more conceptual explanations. I thought the texts were seminal works for reasons that weren't quite emphasized or explained enough in class. I felt it was easy for us to \"gloss over\" important concepts especially in class discussions.Question 11: The instructor errs on the side of being TOO responsive to student comments, especially ones that detract from or derail the discussion. He's the expert, so I wanted more decisive treatment of class discussion for optimal mastery of the concepts."

I love having his thoughts bounced back at me when I have questions.",

    "Great material, great people, great ideas.",
    "The selected readings provided a thorough introduction for understanding the intersection between anthropolgy and environmental issues.",
    "1) professor Dove's teachings through his practitioner stories and careful listening to student's questions.2) David's availability at any time via email or office hours2.5) The readings are an amazing resource and are all very interesting.3) Commentaries on ClassesV2 for everyone to read.",
    "The student-led presentations about the material, e.g. when commentators made powerpoints about their material. These were a good way to make the oftentimes dense and confusing reading material more approachable and understandable.",
    "The interpretative thinking of the professor was unlike any other. It helped me look what otherwise would look common knowledge and information through a completely different lens.",
    "The course provides an excellent overview of basic concepts in social science, which is essential to deal with many environmental problems.",
    "Lecture. I definitely enjoyed and learned most from the lecture portions. Also, the weeks I was assigned a commentary I did a much better job synthesizing and learning the material, and found that I actually enjoyed doing them. (So perhaps a move to commentaries due every week would encourage better universal mastery of the concepts?)"

    "More time needed for discussion. Also, clearer expectations on the style and substance of the writing assignments and discussion format would be helpful up front.Perhaps have more built-in assignments related to the term paper, such as an outline deadline, peer-review process, and outside group discussions. This would have helped my thinking and writing processes, as I struggled to tie everything together in a meaningful way.",
    "Instructions to the readings... Readings are too much and too difficult for a beginner, so if there is any short introduction to each class's readings it would be great.",
    "Slow....sometimes. While the pace was a nice counterpoint to the frantic scramble, it was sometimes dreary: Professor Dove reading a lecture sitting down, people just typing on their computers, or playing on facebook, lights off...etc. at the end of a full day, I wanted to run and jump and argue. The lectures themselves were amazing, but the format was sometimes hard for me to physically be fully present for.Luckily, I did get to do this occasionally in the discussions, which followed the lectures.I think the discussion leader format could be improved. People were sometimes confused, and we often reverted to the TA or Professor moderating.",
    "See question 15",
    "Maybe streamline the reading list for each week. Personally I rather thoroughly read fewer papers each week than glance at a couple more in preparation for each lecture.",
    "The lecture part. This part of the class would often run over time, leaving less time for discussion.",
    "The course is foundational and mainly relies of unique reading materials which are a bit outdated. Integrating new thoughts through up to date materials would add more value to the course",
    "Reading load could be reduced little bit.",
    "Student-led discussions. I found them generally to be a waste of time, since they were easily derailed and generally dominated by the same few individuals. Mechanisms should be implemented to minimize that, and ensure that we stay on the topic and are actually getting a deeper understanding of the material in the discussions. Otherwise, the discussions are a pointless aspect of the course."

    "I'm not very sure the way to be a commentator, and the discussion is often dominated by few people...If more instruction could be put into how to write and organize the commentaries and discussions it will be better.",
    "I would say for discussion that fewer discussants taking a more lead role in moderating would be ideal. It would also be great if people actually read the material and had strong opinions about it, but what can you do....I think to this end, slightly fewer readings, or even more prioritization, with required responses weekly from everyone with less polish would be more suitable to engaging people in the discussions.",
    "See question 15",
    "Very effective! Could be improve by having the commentators for each week ask the questions and let the class discuss possible answers. It seemed to me that in a lot of cases the commentators would simply talk about their point of view and since there were 5 to 8 commentators each week then the discussion period would just fly by without many other comments from the class.At some point a few students were talking about the idea of having a couple more discussion groups given that the class is so large and there are many commentators. More groups may mean smaller sizes and more opportunity for every student to voice an opinion or comment.",

There was a slight reliance on pop culture references towards the beginning of the class that I was n't totally into. Also, he maintains an awareness of class dynamics, but I would love to see much more emphasis in general, for everyone, placed on facilitation, and hearing multiple perspectives. Sometimes voices were overshadowed in practice, and I think David or Professor Dove could do more to set some precedent for totally inclusive discussions.",
