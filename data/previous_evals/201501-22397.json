   "comments": [
    "This class is about what we can learn about human nature through language, which is one of the defining characteristics of humankind. There are several different units, such as perception and learning, and their implications all extend beyond language to the essence of the human mind. There are endless conjectures, supported or refuted, and endless case studies, some of which are interesting and some of which are boring. It's important to keep the big picture in mind--that is, we don't really know what's going on, but we're certainly getting there.",
    "Good course if you're interested in linguistics. You'll get a good sense of the major questions of the field as well as some more technical stuff. Workload is very manageable (readings which I mostly used to supplement things I didn't fully understand in the lecture notes, 4 homework assignments).",
    "yes.",
    "A fairly laid back but fascinating class. You are exposed to breadth of topics in the cognitive science of language, comprising both technical and less technical aspects. Prof. Frank is a great lecturer, was always enthusiastic about the material, and always had time to answer the questions of students during class. The exams were a bit tricky, but fair and well designed. The workload is on the low side, especially if you don't care much about doing the readings (most of which are useful but not essential to doing well on exams). I think it's a great way to satisfy the SO requirement for more analytically-inclined people, because linguistics is one of the more mathematical subjects in the social sciences.",
    "Very interesting course that is kind of a slog at the beginning but picks up quickly- requires a wide range of skills, from analytical math to sociological analysis.",
    "It was fine. Pretty straightforward--three exams, four homework assignments. The final was just the third of the three exams, which was nice.",
    "Some readings, biweekly psets, 2 midterms, and final. Really lowkey. The midterms can be tricky though.",
    "Interesting class with minimal workload.",
    "This class is good for students interested mostly in linguistics, and also cognitive science. It is interesting for the most part. Not much work besides the readings and a few problem sets.",
    "If you've already taken intro psych or intro cog sci, this course will be 40% review for you (new topics include phonology, syntax, connectionist networks for language). Otherwise, it's a great way to get introduced to a bunch of cool research in the field(s).",
    "Very cool lecture. Can get by without doing the readings but you will learn more with the readings and the readings are so very cool. Very amazing introduction into CogSci of Lang. Good example of instinct blindness. We learn so much about what we already know, concerning language- syllabification, pluralizing, types of sounds... I missed this class once because i was sick and I was so bummed. In short, I do recommend.",
    "This course is really interesting in its material, but it becomes extremely technical at certain points. The problem sets are quite difficult--it would have been nice to know beforehand that we would need knowledge of Microsoft Excel to run a surprising amount of math--and take a while to do. The best thing is that the three tests are not cumulative.",
    "Great class in the cognitive science department, also great if you're interested in linguistics at all (or not). I highly recommend it.",
    "The course is first and foremost a linguistics course; only about 1\/4 of the course is cognitive science, so I would only recommend taking it if talking about syntax for weeks is something that gladdens your heart. That being said, lecturers are interesting and Professor Frank is very enthusiastic. Exams are very challenging.",
    "If you want to get a basic understanding of linguistics, this is a great class!",
    "Cog Sci of Language was a pretty niche course. I found it interesting in some aspects (language in the deaf, number systems) but I was less interested in the hard core linguistics aspects. I would recommend shopping the class and getting a feel for how much you enjoy the material. Workload-wise it was very manageable.",
    "I would only recommend LING 116 to a student who needs to take a linguistics class to fulfill a distribution for the CogSci major or for another similar requirement. While I appreciated many of the things that I learned in the Cognitive Science of Language, there certainly wasn't anything in the class that made it a must-take.",
    "I would recommend this course only for those sure about an interest in Cognitive Science or some part of this course. It is not for the faint-hearted. The homework could be truly overwhelming feats.",
    "This is a great course, highly recommended! It wasn't that hard, and the work was mostly fairly easy and fun to do. Readings are interesting. The lectures were very engaging. It gives you a great introduction to a lot of really cool topics.",
    "A broad but intensive survey of the cogsci behind language and the theories regarding language that have developed over the years. I would recommend this course to any student interested in semantics, color, math, or linguistics as the course touches on all of these topics.",
    "I would not recommend this class. While it could be very interesting, the way it was organized made it instead boring and confusing. As someone interested in linguistics, I thought it was too heavy on the cog sci, but my friend who does cog sci thought it was too heavy on linguistics. If you've taken any linguistics classes before, you will be bored for the first few weeks, while he explains what a phoneme is, universal grammar, and other things like that.",
    "In this class you will learn basics of cognitive science and linguistics and how they intersect. Tops such as syntax, the language of colors and numbers, and how these things affect world perception are covered. I would recommend this course.",
    "Be careful with this class. I took it after taking intro cogsci and intro linguistics, and found that it was kind of a weird mix between really basic concepts and really complicated ideas that seemed beyond my level. I would actually recommend you don't take this if you're looking to get an introduction to linguistics (take the regular intro class it's so much better), and honestly I doubt they'll ever turn this into an upper level class but I'd only really recommend this to people if they've at least taken intro cogsci or intro linguistics.",
    "You'll learn a ton of fascinating stuff if you take this class. Language is nuts, and it's mostly just entertaining to learn a bunch of examples regarding why. Some parts of the class are a little unclear, or a little slow (mostly the middle section), but I think it's generally worth it if you're interested in language and what makes it unique.",
    "Great, interesting class. Not too much work but the tests can be tricky and are a huge part of the grade (pretty much all of it).",
    "Excellent course! The homework assignments were interesting and fun, the lectures were always engaging. Exams are fair. Bob Frank is an amazing professor. Definitely take this class if you're looking for a fun 5th class. The content is so cool and Professor Frank's enthusiasm makes it impossible not to have a good time in class.",
    "Highly recommend to anyone interested in linguistics and\/or cogsci. You'll learn a lot of interesting material, lectures are enjoyable, and the workload is very low pressure.",
    "Interesting topic that loses momentum as the semester goes on. Requires more than a passing interest in linguistics",
    "A good 5th credit. Not too much work but you need to study for midterms."
