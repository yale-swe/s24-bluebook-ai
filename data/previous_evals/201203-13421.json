    "This is a great section. The readings can be a little dense, but they spark interesting discussion. The written assignments are very manageable, and you have a lot of freedom to choose your topics. If you like psychology and\/or writing, take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend Professor Yost's English 114. She was a terrific instructor and I believe my academic writing has improved significantly over the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "English 114 with Julia Yost is the best course I have taken this semester. What makes it special is certainly the instructor, who is amazingly articulate and extremely interesting.",
    "It's a good class and interesting if you enjoy the topic of madness and civilization.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially for those interested in psychology or mental illness specifically. The discussions in class were interesting; the topics were thought provoking. Sometimes the readings were lengthy\/dense. The atmosphere of the class was nice and energetic though. The work load is very manageable. The rough drafts, peer revisions, and feedback from Julia are very helpful.",
    "i would recommend this course to a fellow student. This class will introduce you to college level writing and strengthen you intellectually.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a basic course to improve your writing. However, if you feel that you already have a strong writing background from high school, it's not really necessary that you take 114.",
    "I would highly discourage students from taking a course tought by this instructor.",
    "I would recommend English 114 to another student because the seminar style is very engaging and if you are someone who likes discussions then class is enjoyable."
