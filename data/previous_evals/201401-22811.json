   "comments": [
    "Absolute must-take if you get in. Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Highly recommended. Life changing course.",
    "Definitely recommend it. If there's one class you should aim to take at Yale this is it.",
    "At 6.15 a.m. the mist hangs low over the Gettysburg battlefield. It is empty, much like it must have been before the soldiers started shooting over those fateful three days. The silence is broken only by a thoughtful reflection from a exemplary General. Your classmates - no, that's not the right term. They are your friends. You've spent so many hours and had so many nights with them that you know them like brothers and sisters - your friends listen intently. And then you turn and run, moving on to another part of the Union line.Sound dramatic? It is. This course draws together all of your life lessons and school lessons and lives up to the hype. Put your back into it and relish the work and the social aspects, and you will gain friends and lessons for life.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this class, do! You will have deep discussions about leadership not only as it appears in the readings, but also as it appears in your life. Stan is a great teacher and mentor, and makes a personal effort to transform the class into a team. The result is incredibly rewarding, and different from any other experience you can have at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course those who want to learn the fundamentals of decision-makings.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of public or private sector orientation. Don't expect to discover the silver bullet of leadership--it doesn't exist. Do expect to explore the topic deeply and see it modeled by the professor. Also expect to be challenged and held to an unusually high standard of preparation and engagement.",
    "Highly recommended. Students, instructors and guest speakers are highly dedicated to produce a stimulating learning experience.",
    "Take this class! Not only a great opportunity to work with General McChrystal but the community he creates with the other students is a unique experience. Probably one of my favorite classes but it does meet at odd times and have an odd flow (some weeks you might have a ton of reading, other weeks you will have nothing).",
    "Highly recommended",
    "Global Affairs is one of my \"real life\" classes at Yale. While the readings were excellent, the course was fundamentally about people and life--and how we interact.I would highly recommend this course to another student because it is an excellent opportunity to study leadership under one of our great leaders, an opportunity to engage with other students interested in leadership today, and an unparalleled chance to learn about ourselves.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would, with absolutely no hesitation and with a significant amount of enthusiasm, recommend it to another student. The class could otherwise be titled \"McChrystal's practical guide to leadership in the real world\"",
    "Absolutely. It makes you a better person.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. It is an experience that shouldn't be missed at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "The course does not give easy answers and theories regarding leadership issues. The courses does not do that because there is no easy answers at all, and it is not the aim of the course to just providing information, but rather build together.I believe the course raises the right questions, the biggest challenges faced by leaders today. The course is very successful in generating discussion and bringing real world leaders to the class to debate those issues with their own experiences.The course will certainly contribute to my future professional career in a long-term perspective.",
    "The diverse perspectives in this class were incredibly enriching. I felt fortunate to be sitting around a table with promising leaders in business, education, law, international politics, and military affairs. The lessons from this course are applicable to all fields, and I was certainly able to draw many parallels between the topics and my personal experiences.",
    "Deepened the knowledge in leadership.",
    "While I didn't learn anything earth-shattering about leadership, I did see it modeled in every seminar by the professor.",
    "Expanded effective tools for leadership",
    "Leadership is a key function everywhere in the work environment and absolutely essential to understand. Too many people believe that just by being good or hard working will result in success. In fact, leadership is something which must constantly be striven for and improved. This course is a first step in the right direction toward a path of a inspirational and dynamic leadership.",
    "It wasn't really relevant to my dissertation but it certainly taught me a great deal about the personal elements of the international relations\/political and even business worlds."
