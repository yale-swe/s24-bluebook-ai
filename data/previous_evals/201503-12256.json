    "It's a requirement but a super exciting and fulfilling opportunity if the topic and advisor are as great as mine are! :)",

    "Great",
    "must do it",
    "My understanding is that this process will change dramatically next year, but if students are considering writing yearlong theses, I would recommend it. It's been a valuable experience for me.",
    "Next year, seniors will have the option to skip the two-semester, independent senior essay. Some advice: go for the full year! It's an incredible process to be able to capstone your study of history with such an in-depth, rigorous course of research and writing--and don't be intimidated; you'll have lots of help. The full-year senior essay is one of the things that sets Yale's History Department apart, so seize the opportunity. That said, the small assignments and internal deadlines seem like ill-spaced busy-work sometimes, and, on the other hand, the amount of attention you'll pay to the senior essay ebbs and flows at different points in the semester.",
    "It's required.",
    "I would say the most important thing to do for this course is start thinking about your senior essay BEFORE senior year. Otherwise, it will be overwhelming.",
    "Start working on your essay as early as possible.The senior essay is the best part of the history major, so pick a topic you love and enjoy!",
    "It's a senior essay",
    "It's unclear why the first semester course puts so little trust in our advisors to guide us through the process that it loads us up with arbitrary assignments.",
    "The deadlines are kind of weird and random. Make sure you have an advisor who keeps you on top of things or otherwise it will feel pretty useless.",
    "Very helpful course to keep you on track towards your thesis",
    "Well, if you're a history major you have to take it ..."
