    "I really developed my Spanish grammar and oral speaking abilities",
    "This course was amazing. My knowledge of Spanish improved dramatically!",
    "I vastly improved my ability to speak, write, and read in Spanish. Specifically, I improved complex grammar skills, ability to read in between text, and communicate various ideas and concepts.",
    "I definitely expanded my knowledge of Spanish as a language by being introduced to many new grammar topics and new vocab. I think this course also helped me better learn to time manage because if its workload.",
    "I learnt how to speak Spanish",
    "I improved my abilities to speak, write, and listen to Spanish immensely over the span of this course. Communicating and conversing in Spanish every day in this setting allowed me to improve my skills with every class. The fast pace of the course kept me engaged and allowed me to develop a better understanding of grammar structures. Overall, this course provided nonstop learning opportunities.",
    "This course helped me to become more confident in speaking Spanish.",
    "I learned how to effectively and efficiently work on Spanish vocabulary and grammar as a habit, transitioning from trying to translate phrases in English to eventually thinking in Spanish as I worked on my homework or studied for exams.",
    "My Spanish expanded immensely through this class I can't believe how much my skills have expanded in just one year of the intensive sequence.",
    "Speaking, writing, and listening in Spanish. We truly covered it all."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is a very strong course -- it's biggest strength is the amount of time spent in class. Also the diversity of activities. This course needs an update in curriculum, some of the activities (textbook, in class and readings) are offensive and uplift colonialism.",
    "This course was very engaging and fun. There was a lot of variety in the literary texts and movies that we discussed. I looked forward to this class every morning.",
    "The strengths relied on the fact that we got to meet every day for an elongated time which really helped me grasp the language. I liked the variety of activities such as listening to songs, partner conversations, games, and other workshops. A weakness might be just the amount of work that we had to do, and the constant quizzes and tests. However, this was to be expected.",
    "This course is strong in its width and weak in its depth. While you go over everything in the textbook, I did not feel I was learning everything in the textbook. Lecture time is not used efficiently and not enough time\/resources is given for the grammar topics.",
    "Strengths are the teaching and texts. The supersite was too expensive and not worth it.",
    "While there is a lot of work required to keep up with the class, most of the work assigned genuinely helped me improve my understanding and knowledge of the material. I also enjoyed the small class size, which allowed me to engage with others. The textbook used for the course could be improved. Although most of the grammatical lessons were formatted well, the chapter topics\/vocabulary lists often did not pertain to useful\/daily language that would be typical in a Spanish-speaking country. Having vocabulary lists that better correspond to genuine conversations would improve this course.",
    "It was challenging even to get up every day and go to a 2-hour long class every day of the week...besides that it was alright.",
    "Strengths: the constant encouragement to speak with our fellow students, the variety of homework assignments that stretched us on all areas of language acquisition, and the wonderful Prof. Valle herself, who was instrumental to making this class the community that it was. No weaknesses, other than maybe the 9:25 start time."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to improve your Spanish skills -- take this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! only if the student is ready to put in a lot of work. It tremendously improved my skills and also my confidence to use a different language.",
    "yes! Definitely practice your spanish outside of class though",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who had previously learned or at least been introduced to more advanced Spanish material as it is hard to learn so much so fast. This student would have to be dedicated and actively interested in Spanish.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys learning a language and becoming more comfortable with it.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but only if you have a genuine interest in Spanish! The course will be a drag otherwise.",
    "Take it if you want to get seriously good at this language very quickly but don't expect that road to be an easy one! You truly get out of this class what you put into it."
