   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analyze and interpret a variety of philosophical texts and integrate components and ideas from several authors into writing. I furthered my ability to come to ideas through writing and expand upon a small idea into a developed essay.",
    "Lots of philosophy and intense discussions",
    "This class on authenticity really broadens one's idea of what it means to be authentic and what authenticity, in and of itself, really is. It is a thought provoking, discussion based class that leaves one more informed about what the authentic, natural, innate, pure, etc. is and more confused at the same. Though this is paradoxical, the confusion or ambiguity raised in discussion is exactly the enlightenment gained regarding what authenticity true means.",
    "I developed my critical reading and writing abilities. I also furthered my own reflections about authenticity, a subject of personal interest to me.",
    "Other than learning an immense amount about the subject of the course and the reading material we covered, I learned to think on a completely different intellectual level then I ever had before in a classroom environment. The level of thought Professor Khawaja operates on in this course is formidable, and it takes a real intensity of analytical thinking just to keep up, let alone add something insightful into the classroom discussion. I also think the kind of essay Professor Khawaja wanted us to write (essentially, no B.S. allowed) really helped me recognize what is superfluous or out-of-place in my writing.",
    "I learned how to write philosophy papers at a collegiate level. I learned a deeper understand of myself, as well as ideas about the self\/authenticity\/sincerity throughout history. The course was a wonderful overview of humanity's long struggle to understand authenticity.",
    "Critical thinking and drawing connections between different sources; always looking one level deeper, pushing myself to refine and improve my writing",
    "I really learned how to read in between the lines. This is the first course I ever took that went this in depth into texts or focused on one topic so deeply. I learned how to look at a concept from different viewpoints. This course taught me how to \"think in a new way\", i.e. analyzing the tensions in texts and thinking from the author's perspective. I learned how to be a valuable participant in a discussion and I gained knowledge through discussion and hearing the viewpoints of my classmates.",
    "my writing skills improved greatly. professor Khawaja is extremely helpful in helping me build my logic of argument. the class material is also very provoking in critical thinking overall.",
    "This course opened my eyes to the way humans interact both truthfully and not. I learned to push past my initial understandings of texts in order to grasp a new meaning.",
    "The main skill this course developed was an ability to recognise tensions and comparisons between seemingly very different texts. Because of the variation in texts studied, from fiction to academic journal articles, the task of creating a cohesive appreciation of ideas around \"authenticity\" led to deep analysis on very specific parts of the text, different from the broad, holistic analysis of which I was previously mainly used to.",
    "Knowledge of the goffmanian way of approaching sociology, and that the consistent character is a construct are the most profound things. Also appreciation and knowledge of different philosophical traditions in western thought"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Reading the texts is necessary for discussion, but everyone was very engaged so the discussions generally went very well. The student-led discussions were also very good to set up and encourage participation.",
    "Strengths - texts range from very interesting to nearly incomprehensible, discussion was interesting and challenging, papers helped me synthesize my thoughts from the course. The discussions and the papers were very open-ended, which often worked very well, but other times seemed to want for a bit of structure.",
    "The strengths of this course are numerous: the reading list, the dynamic of classroom discussion, Professor Khawaja's teaching style, etc. The one thing I would say could improve this course is an increased emphasis on the overall framework or arc of the course. I never really felt like I had a formal understanding of what the overarching questions we were supposed to be thinking about were. Some emerged naturally in discussion, which I think was the goal, but often I felt a little untethered form the subject of the course when discussing the subtleties of a particular text. One way to help with this issue would be to have more short writing assignments about readings due in class that probed a particular aspect of the text that is related to a broader theme of the class.",
    "There were a lot of readings, but all were interesting and rewarding. Class discussions were lively and spiritedthe group really bonded over the semester. I disliked how much the papers were weighted for the final grade, as I felt that even if I completed all the readings and contributed greatly to class discussions, I could still do poorly if I struggled with my paper.",
    "I wished there was a little more structure during class and felt that it would be better with less students",
    "A lot of times I would spend hours carefully reading the text assigned for the next discussion, but in the section I would have difficulty keeping up with the conversation or adding on to the discussion. It might have been helpful if the readings were more chronological, or if I had taken some philosophy prior to this course. I did not realize that the course would focus more on readings than on exploring the self. Every student in the section seemed very engaged in the conversation and the class grew very close, so the format of the class was a definite strength. The papers were assigned well in advanced and allowed students to be creative, although sometimes this made it hard to narrow down all the topics into one. I found that the papers were not very representative of my growth in the course; I had difficulty putting my ideas into words.",
    "strength: variety of material, development of timeline",
    "A strength of the course is definitely the variety of texts studied. This helped to break down the idea of a singular, simple definition of \"authenticity\", \"identity\", \"self\" etc., as each text presented a new and nuanced idea of what these terms involved. Also, I enjoyed the way the essays we wrote were focused on a specific issue of our choosing; it meant that the deep analysis required by Professor Khawaja was enjoyable and engaging to do, as I was able to choose a specific aspect of the texts that most interested me. A weakness is that the course lacks chances to recap what was already discussed. Since so much of the course is about synthesizing and using ideas from some texts to understand those of another, it would have been useful to have maybe two or three lessons which were there just to solidify and go over past texts and ideas. Alternatively, this could have been done through some short assignments, which could be like the essays in that the students choose their topic, but have to write maybe one or two paragraphs for a few more of the texts along the way.",
    "Strengths: a lot of the material is very engaging, particularly as none were things I knew much about beforehand. The essays give you great freedom to expire your ideas Weaknesses: class discussions didn't really flow, class was probably too big,"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the seminar was interesting and all students were engaged with the material. Seminars always included amazing discussions that analyzed the works read and connecting them to daily life.",
    "YES",
    "Yes! this course raises many, many intriguing questions that result in very satisfying discussions that are always cut short by the amount of time allotted for the class. Professor Khawaja is amazing and shares many great perspectives and points during the class discussions. If you like speaking in discussions or simply listening to interesting points, this class is great! There's always something more to be said about the readings discussed in class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this if you want to take a freshman seminar and you enjoy philosophical discussion and introspection.",
    "YES. TAKE IT if you get in. An intense and important intellectual experience without an overload of work to go along with it. Professor Khawaja is approximately the smartest person I've ever met.",
    "Highly highly recommend with Prof. Khawaja! It was wonderful to take this course as a 1st-semester freshman with virtually no experience in philosophy or religious studies. The class has wonderful discussions about great readingsand as a result, as all grow close as a seminar. Prof. K gives great feedback on all the papers, and is always available to help or just to chat. I learned so much about the ramifications of 'authenticity,' but I also learned much about myself, and how I view the self I am\/want to be. Readings are long, but interesting. The course has 3 total papers, none of which are too bad.",
    "Good course but a lot of reading, and it's hard to stay engaged sometimes if you don't click with the thread of conversation that's going.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think the ideas that I was forced to talked about for the first time formed a really good base for my years at Yale. This course was far outside of my comfort zone and didn't necessarily count towards my major, but it was vital to my personal growth.",
    "definitely recommend. moves beyond the boundaries of existentialism, a much more intellectually challenging analysis of human living",
    "Yes, I would. The course was really interesting, and Professor Khawaja's incredibly engaging seminars helped to explain the more complex readings and provide new insights and interpretations to the simpler ones.",
    "Yes, with caveats"
