    "The pace was a little too fast but it allowed us to cover a lot of material, and studying for the quiz each week helped solidify the material a little better.",
    "This class was challenging and engaging, and although it demanded a lot, it never felt like tedious work. Dr. Anisfeld's readings, quizzes, and lectures were well organized and interesting, and he was very attentive to answering students' questions and generally fostering discussions about unclear topics. I really enjoyed this class-definitely my favorite of the semester.",
    "The workload was fair given that the class was 4 units. Shimi is a wonderful instructor and very thoughtful about what readings he assigns. The majority of the time the reading assignments were well-picked---for both quantity and quality. Loved having the field trips, but a few of them could be improved by more hands-on activities, worksheets, or problem solving. (The phytoplankton lab was an exception to this).",
    "Shimi was very receptive to student feedback, made himself extremely available to students outside of class, and was very knowledgeable about the material. It was a lot of work, but I got out what I put it. He is a very dedicated and effective instructor!",
    "Q3 course load was a bit heavier, but it was a 4 credit course so that is understandable\/needed Q12 coastal ecosystems is not in my core curriculum so it wouldn't be 100% useful for people in my field however I would recommend this course without hesitation to people with a variety of interests. This was without a doubt one of the best courses I have ever taken. Shimi is an impeccable instructor that can explain difficult concepts in an accessible way. He expects a lot but also puts so much effort in himself that putting in the work feels more like holding up your end up in a team effort than a chore. If you'd press me to find something in the class to improve I'd say students could do more presentation type application of their knowledge for example applying what we learned ourselves on other ecosystems (worldwide?) but that would simply be an extension of the last assignment. I'd give this course without a doubt a 100\/100.",
    "I loved this course! The 5 hour meeting times were daunting; but I got so much out of the lectures, guest speakers, and field trips. I feel really well-grounded in the current literature, and have been taught by Shimi how to read scientific publications with skepticism and ask questions. Would recommend 100%.",
    "Question 10: I thought SA did an absolutely incredible job teaching this course. His commitment to each and every student was amazing. I have never had a professor as attentive to student questions or who took more time in an out of class to explain concepts both directly pertaining to the course or outside of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Shimi puts a number of coastal ecosystem and science issues into context, effectively communicating the nuance and uncertainty in the science. You'll walk away from the course informed on the obstacles that scientists face, ecosystems face, and we as a whole face due to degrading coastal ecosystems. You will learn a lot I also enjoyed the class discussions of the readings and in class materials.",
    "Small class format, lots of discussion and participation by students, great to be able to have a dialogue during lectures",
    "Breaking up class time with speakers, field trips, and presentations was helpful. I liked that the field trips did not have a requirement to fill out a worksheet or write a paragraph about the trip. This allowed me to relax and learn through observation without focusing on completing a worksheet.",
    "I really enjoyed the discussions that we had about primary literature, especially comparing articles that produced contradicting conclusions. I think a tendency that many students develop (myself included) is to read peer-reviewed studies and take them at face-value, but this course showed me how to critically analyze scientific research and more closely evaluate methods, data analysis, and overall study design.",
    "The quality and organization of the instruction. The size of the class, the subject of the course.",
    "Shimi's instruction was really excellent. He made all of the material as clear as it possibly could be in order for us to have the most fully engaged conversation. I have never enjoyed class discussion as much as I did in this class -- everyone participated in equal amounts and I felt like I learned so much from this aspect of the course.",
    "Field trips, readings, instructions",
    "Shimi is by far the most prepared lecturer I have had at FES; the detail with which he explains material is excellent and he knows how to ensure that people are absorbing concepts.",
    "The field trips were super interesting and helpful.",
    "I though this was an amazing course. The material was incredibly in-depth but broad in scope. While much of the course focuses on salt marshes, I thought that this was an advantage as it allowed as in-depth examination that carried over in many ways to the other ecosystems examined. SA was one of the best professors that I've taken a course with. Amazed that he took the time to answer and integrate each and every students reading questions into lecture each week."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings I found to be a bit burdensome. Particularly the chapter readings on a given topic. Most of the scientific papers chosen were worthwhile reads, but the chapters were often not. I'm not sure how to strike the right balance between coming into class with a base knowledge of a given topic versus how much of it can be effectively covered in class. Maybe instead of devoting each class period to a given topic, the basic critical information on a given topic can be covered at the end of one class period, allowing students to then synthesize more nuanced\/complex papers on the topic before the following class, and then these papers can be discussed in that following class.",
    "It was hard to get a lot out of the problem sets when we did them at the end of class when my brain was turning into mush.",
    "Sometimes I would have preferred if we reviewed the last week's quiz after taking the current week's quiz. For me it was hard to switch gears so quickly between quiz review, quiz-taking and catching up on old lecture material, then starting new lecture material.",
    "The task for the paper\/presentation assignment might be refined in order to make more use of this time.",
    "I did not find the problem sets particularly useful (too in-the-weeds for my purposes) and I think 2-3 field trips would have sufficed in terms of learning opportunities, although everyone enjoyed the field trips and opportunities to get out into the field are fairly hard to come by at FES.",
    "It is hard for me to say anything that needs improvement with this course. One thing that I would say is that I would have appreciated a bit more stability in the reading load week to week. Some weeks the reading would be really light, while other weeks completely overwhelming. On the same note, I was a bit confused by what \"skim\" meant for some readings, as often these readings that would be the main focus of discussion."

    "Great! The field trips fit in so well with the lecture -- it might be nice to go on a field trip that is to a system other than salt marsh, or to go somewhere with an interactive component - run an experiment, collect some specimens or something like that.",
    "Very effective.",

    "I have always had an interest in coastal ecosystems and I wanted to learn more about them so I can better manage them.",

    "Take it, but be prepared to put in the work. You'll be rewarded.",
    "Take it. If it seems too technical at first, hang in there, because it's still important background information and ultimately it's up to you how much of that detail you want to take in.",
