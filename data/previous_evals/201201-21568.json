   "comments": [
    "take this class if you love film, it opens your eyes to the myopic view of film society has. Take this class if you're an artist, because you really watch art. Do not take this class if you are a workhorse or expect a ton of work.",
    "Wonderful and easy class. Make sure you have some appreciation for weird things, or else some of the films will be unbearable. Many of them are hilarious and amazing.",
    "Definitely take the class. It was a very relaxed introduction to a wealth of films that don't get discussed at all in other film classes. A must if you're a film studies major, though anyone could learn from the class.",
    "Exposure to what has been considered 'avant garde' in film in the United States. Recommended to film studies majors or students interested in an interesting fifth class.",
    "Really easygoing. The conversation was casual and often authentic, rather than forced. Professor Francis is great, nice, mellow and pretty funny once you get to know her. Screenings vary in length from 45 minutes to two and a half hours, so make room in your schedule for them to go a bit over sometimes. Only assignments was a project (fairly low time commitment) and a open-ended paper at the end of the course. A good way to see some really fascinating, sometimes inspiring, sometimes influential, sometimes horribly slow\/painful (and at times both simultaneously) films",
    "Absolutely. A fascinating class that exposed us to films that are normally hard to access or even come across. It offers insights that are as much about film as they are about the culture of the avant-garde, and, by extension, American arts culture.That said, be prepared to watch some very challenging\/difficult films."
