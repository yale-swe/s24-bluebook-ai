   "comments": [
    "It's not bad! It teaches you basic techniques in a non-stressful environment.",
    "Chem 222L is a lot better than general chemistry lab and usually pretty enjoyable. It is low-key, while at the same time taught me lots of valuable lab skills.",
    "Best part about this class is the fact that how well you do on an experiment does not matter AT ALL. like wow. 15% yield? no problem! breathed in toxic chemical fumes? also no problem! in this class, you learn EXTREMELY valuable skills, like how to synthesize camphor. you know that stuff that smells really good and relieves nasal congestion? incredible stuff right there. yes, you learn to make it in CHEM222L. honestly what more could you want? and the grading in this class? eh its alright. BUT DAT CAMPHOR DOE",
    "Yes. It is a great class that teaches great lab techniques.",
    "Just a regular lab. You won't do a lot of fun things until second semester. You are mostly learning techniques.",
    "Less work then GenChem lab, but enough to make sure you understand the material thoroughly and take away the skills you need to at the end of the semester.",
    "Great- no reason to shy away from it. Dimeglio gives As if u ace the final even if your TA is anal and takes points from every stupid thing, so don't stress. Final is easy.",
    "Lots of work for only a 1\/2 credit course, but it was not a panful experience like other labs are known to be.",
    "Take it if you have to. If you do, it's not that bad, but it is a lab.",
    "This is a great intro orgo lab that will teach you a variety of techniques. It's pretty laid-back and even though the lab is four hours long, it usually only takes three at most. Be careful you don't make any careless mistakes in your lab reports and EPs. Just a heads up though: you work alone without a lab partner for the most part.",
    "I would summarize the course as an overview of the lab techniques required for the first semester of organic chemistry, with individual labs. I would recommend it to a student taking Organic chemistry, because it provides a practical application for what we are learning and allows you to become very familiar with many standard organic chemistry lab techniques.",
    "no, labs are brutal",
    "A required lab for many science majors and premeds. Can be pretty fun -- you make lots of crystals -- and the workload corresponds to the courses' half-credit status. Having experimental plans due every week is a little rough though. The lab exam is all multiple choice, and is kind of stressful because it's a large part of the grade and the questions are sort of designed to trick you. Dr.DiMeglio and the TA's are all great and always willing to answer questions. If your high school didn't really have much of a lab beyond a few dusty beakers and this is your first lab course at Yale, you will be pretty behind for the first month or so, but it all evens out. No quizzes, unlike the gen chem lab, which is nice.",
    "I think it's a good course that will definitely teach you what you need to know about organic chemistry lab work. If you need to take a lab course, this is a good one to take.",
    "This lab is like other lab courses at yale in that I do not feel like it should be a requirement as it does not teach Organic chemistry material well. The lab courses only seem helpful to improve laboratory procedure skills. I would not recommend this lab.",
    "Awful. I loved labs until I tried this one out. This is the first lab I take at Yale and I am thouroughly dissappointed. Not only by the easy content and uninteresting labs, but by assignments mostly. It is unacceptable for one to be able to get through a lab class without having to actually have done the experiments. If you have taken genchem lab, expect a workload of 2-3 pages of EP's and about 3 post lab assignments. Not hard, not where it matters. It is only meticulous there it should not be. Disgusting, hope next semester is better.",
    "Yes, would recommend. Successfully learned the organic chemistry lab techniques in a more relaxed environment, and it really clarifies the principles and materials learned in lectures.",
    "A great lab course to go along with CHEM 174 or 220! For a lab, there is not that much outside work involved, with only three post-lab assignments and a weekly short experimental procedure that is nothing compared to the reports assigned in Gen Chem lab. You learn many important techniques in this course that are extremely valuable for syntheses and product separation. Dr. DiMeglio is not only knowledgeable but also very friendly. Lab sessions barely go past 4 p.m. (only once or twice), with one or two ending as early as 3:15 p.m., depending on when you finish. An excellent pre-med course with a great professor and indispensable TAs!",
    "CHEM 222L is a solid organic chemistry lab. The course requires a lot of work before each lab and the occasional post lab assignments require a lot of thought, but Professor DiMeglio is amazing and is genuinely invested in learning about each student and making sure that everyone learns about organic chemistry lab techniques and experiments from the course.",
    "I recommend taking it especially after gen chem it is such a relief.",
    "I thought 222L was a good lab. The work required was clearly useful to developing our skills of synthesis and other lab techniques, and our understanding of the chemical processes at play, and not just a mountain of busy work. The overall time demands of the course I thought were manageable and fair.",
    "The lab is a great introduction to pertinent chemical synthesis techniques. The workload is not too heavy, but you need to be able to follow directions well. The grading is pretty fair, but as mentioned before, I believe the lab exam can be greatly improved (it seemed to be purposefully tricky on questions that didn't test us on our knowledge of lab techniques or other information we were told to know for the exam).",
    "For an organic chemistry lab, this was not terrible but I still wouldn't take this if I wasn't required to.",
    "Doesn't really provide any useful skills since all the techniques used are straightforward",
    "I would recommend this course because it is useful in developing lab and research skills while solidifying organic chemistry knowledge.",
    "This course is challenging and requires a lot of time prepping outside of lab, but you learn an incredible amount. You are given the tools to become competent working in an organic chemistry lab. Dr. DiMeglio is an amazing professor!",
    "It is half credit, and I actually think it's worth half a credit. There isn't a lot of work every week (just that the weekly experimental plan gets a bit annoying sometimes, but after writing a few the format becomes the same and you can just copy and paste.) If you are fast, you can get out well before 5pm. It is a very good introduction to various lab techniques. Read up on lab techniques and have a mental plan on what you're going to do beforehand, it will make your life in lab a lot easier (and faster) and less stressful.",
    "A much better experience compared to gen chem lab! Experiments are typically over by 4pm, and were generally more relaxed and unrushed. It was satisfying to synthesize products in lab. There were only 3 post lab assignments over the semester (compared to weekly gen chem lab reports), though there were weekly experimental plans (pre-labs) that can be more time consuming than they seem. There's a multiple choice final exam instead of a practical. Formatting for all written assignments is extremely important, so read through the course packet thoroughly as you write your EPs and post lab assignments.",
    "This was a really laid back lab environment. As long as you get assignments in on time and make sure you really understand the concepts behind what you do in lab, you should be fine.",
    "Chances are you have to take this class (premed), but it's really not that bad. Dr. DiMeglio and the TAs really make the experience as painless as possible. I really was not looking forward to lab at all because of my previous experiences with Gen Chem Lab, but this is SO much better. There's no pre-lab tests, the final is multiple choice, the post-lab write-ups are nowhere near as bad as gen chem lab's, and the experiments are actually pretty interesting.",
    "This is an introduction to the laboratory techniques used in organic chemistry. I would recommended it to another student because the class is both engaging and informative.",
    "well i mean you're taking this as a requirement but as far as labs go, it really isnt too bad and unlike gen chem lab, doesn't take very much time out of lab during the week to complete assignments.",
    "Best lab course I've taken so far at Yale. Labs were straight forward. There were 9-10 labs and we didn't have to write lab reports after each lab. Instead we had to prepare a short pre-lab before each lab (which I preferred) and after 3 labs we had to write a lab report-type paper just answering some questions. Professor DiMeglio was a great lab instructor - very kind and patient and explains everything perfectly.",
    "Don't take this lab course unless you HAVE to. It's seriously not worth the 4 hour block of time once a week, plus the lab reports IN ADDITION TO weekly experimental procedures, for only half a credit. It's less horrible than general chemistry lab, but you could be taking a life-changing humanities course, worth a whole credit, for the same amount of weekly work.",
    "A thousand times better than inorganic chemistry lab.",
    "Definitely recommend this lab. The professors and the TAs are great, and the course is very enjoyable. This lab was a great first lab course for me.",
    "Chem 222L was a course that is necessary if one plans to enter the field of Chemistry. However, it is also a great help for many other fields, such as medicine, engineering, the arts, etc. Organic Chemistry has tremendous applications to the real world, and this course helped me realize the extent of this field. Learning these techniques proved enjoyable experiences, and I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was definitely useful, relevant, and fun.",
    "You're probably not taking Orgo lab just for fun.... So if you have to take it, take it. But rest assured that this lab is actually a pretty fun and painless way to learn relevant organic chemistry techniques in a minimally stressful environment. Dr. DiMeglio is very helpful and knowledgeable, and there are only ~3 lab reports (so put your time in for those three, and relax). Make sure to study for the lab final -- it's a written exam, and you will be tested on the experiments in some detail. If you know the major steps, reasoning, and mechanisms, you'll be more than fine. The course is also curved.",
    "If you're taking this, it's probably required, but fear not. It's pretty fun and teaches useful lab techniques. It's also not too stressful.",
    "This was a great course. All of the experiments were really interesting and exciting to carry out, and I really felt that I understood exactly what was happening in each experiment. It was an appropriate amount of work for half a credit, and I learned a lot from the course. It also really helped reinforce what we were learning in the organic chemistry lecture class.",
    "Lab is time consuming but it is a lot of fun and you learn a lot.",
    "Just do the labs, be there, and don't blow yourself up. Great class!",
    "A decent introduction to laboratory science and organic chemistry techniques. If someone has never had any lab background, I'd recommend it, but if they had and it wasn't required for their major, I would not, it would just be a bore.",
    "I would only recommend the course if it is a requirement. The class, as with other lab courses that I've taken at Yale, is a lot more work than one would expect from a half credit.",
    "A very straightforward orgo 1 lab",
    "A brief survey in basic organic chemistry lab techniques. I wouldn't recommend the lab to any student who didn't need to take it to fulfill any requirements. I didn't find the lab particularly enjoyable or educational. The techniques were rather uninteresting, and I don't believe these procedures are incredibly useful in current labs, given that most of them are automated or even out of date.",
    "CHEM 222L 01 is the lab course that accompanies organic chemistry. I would recommend it if a student needs to take it because it is a prerequisite to many majors and premed coursework. It is tedious but one learns some lab skills.",
    "CHEM 222L is a solid lab course. It tracks along well with the CHEM 220 lecture. I'd recommend it for all chemistry majors and\/or those on the pre-med track.",
    "It is a great lab, less tedious than General Chemistry Lab. However, there are many less class lectures and opportunities. Make sure you do the EP's and pre-lab work more thoroughly than pre-lab-work than general chemistry, but there are many fewer post lab assignments. Be prepared to learn cool techniques, and make some awesome white crystals.",
    "Prepare a pre-lab every week, perform an experiment every week, write up a post-lab every several weeks. I would recommend the course to another student interested in pursuing chemistry or medicine.",
    "It's an okay class.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend the course. It was really helpful for me, as someone who hasn't been in a lab much before, to learn all the lab techniques. The workload is reasonable, just sometimes a little harder when a post-lab assignment and a pre-lab assignment are due on the same day. Grading on post-lab assignments can be a bit tough. Professor DiMeglio is very helpful and approachable for help, though, as are the TAs.",
    "Seems easy, but workload is heavy and your grade will be 80% determined by the difficulty of your TA.",
    "An interesting and useful lab class. A decent amount of work, but worth it, especially for prospective science majors.",
    "If you're taking this it's because you have to. But it's really a pretty enjoyable lab and not nearly as bad as gen chem - DiMeglio is awesome, the labs are generally pretty short and the workload isn't that bad. As far as labs go, it's not bad at all.",
    "This is an excellent course. It is best if taken with organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Good lab course and not too rigorous. Make sure to arrive early\/on time because some of the labs can be pretty long. Normally, though, most of the lab group was done after approx 3 hours.",
    "This is a really great lab. It's so much better than the Gen Chem labs, so if you struggled through those, you'll be fine in organic chemistry lab. Dr. DiMeglio is great and really helpful. It works well with what you'll be learning in class so definitely take them at the same time.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone taking organic chemistry!",
    "It's a good course. It depends on your TA on how your lab experience is, but I didn't learn as much as I wanted to. There were some days when I went into lab and had no idea what was going on. The class doesn't align with the lab very well either. It's a chill class but I (surprisingly) liked gen chem lab better. Grading is harsh and the final is hard, so prepare for that.",
    "If you're looking at Orgo Lab 1, chances are you have to take it. It's not fun, but it's not terrible, and it does teach you the lab techniques.",
    "As far as chemistry labs go, this is a relatively enjoyable lab course. Be sure to come to class as well-prepared as possible, as that will make a huge difference in your productivity once in lab.",
    "CHEM 222L does everything it should do. It's a great introduction to lab techniques, and if you're looking to do research, you'll need those skills.",
    "Such a welcoming lab compared to Gen Chem lab. The lab reports were very reasonable and took an appropriate amount of time to complete compared to the 12+ hours needed for every gen chem report.",
    "Fun",
    "Intro to orgo lab",
    "Am actually fun lab. Pretty chill and helpful to understand the lecture",
    "Super laid back lab, I would definitely recommend it if you need it for your major\/pre-professional schools.",
    "fun lab, do stuff, nice equipment",
    "I really didn't enjoy Chem 222L. It was my least favorite part of the week. It felt like a grueling 4 hours of tedious work that I didn't really understand. I would not recommend it to another student, but most students take it not out of choice but as a requirement. Also, it was way too much work to only count as a half credit. The prelabs and postlabs were very tedious and time-consuming, as much as or more than work for full credit classes.",
    "Yes, this lab is a must for Organic Chemistry students.",
    "This was a very organized course with a well thought out curriculum. The experiments never went over the allotted time and the pre lab assignments and lab reports were reasonable and did not require an excessive amount of time. For these reasons, I found the course to be rather enjoyable.",
    "Yes, if you have to take this lab then take it. I don't think any chemistry lab is better than orgo lab with prof. Dimeglio. She is so nice and helpful. Most labs only take 2-3 hours. The workload is not too horriblea lab prep sheet before every lab and a post lab assignment with a lot of questions after every couple weeks. The lab final is a multiple choice test.",
    "Its way more fun and chill than Gen Chem. It goes really well with the orgo lecture too. Would definitely recommend any day!",
    "A fantastic and not too taxing introduction to organic chemistry methods in the lab. Be ready for a good amount of weekly work (a pre-lab and post-lab assignment) and to be productive on lab days to ensure you finish the experiments.",
    "Chem 222L is not too much work, only 3 major lab reports, and is much more interesting than general chemistry lab.",
    "doesn't enhance learning organic chemistry but is a good lab experience",
    "Chem 222L is a very manageable lab course that pairs well with the lecture. Low work load and fair assessments."
