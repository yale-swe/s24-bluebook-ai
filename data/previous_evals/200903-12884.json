   "comments": [
    "You learn grammar; better be ready to work.",
    "Yes if you are willing to put the time in to learn the grammar. there is a lot of tedious work.",
    "It's a lot more busy work and a lot harder graded than any other Spanish class I've taken (L1-L4 and Advanced Conversational), but I think my Spanish did get better. It was a great credit\/d\/fail.",
    "Definitely. I would strongly suggest you make sure you have the time to put into it though, as your learning and grade will probably be a lot better if you keep up with the work. It's really not that much work when you put in a little time every or every other day.",
    "I took this class to prepare for upper-level courses in Spanish literature, and looking back, I'm not sure that was the best move.Grammar really is the primary focus of this course, and you will improve by the end of the semester, guaranteed. Though there are a lot of small workbook assignments due every week, only a few tests, a grammar presentation and a final exam, in addition to written compositions, the workload is manageable.Take it Cr\/D\/F if you don't need the credits for the language requirement but you want to tune up your grammar before tackling academic Spanish.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class. I took it because I hadn't taken a Spanish class since sophomore year of high school, so I wanted to be sure that I was solid on grammar before moving onto another language, and after having taken this class I feel much more comfortable speaking, reading and writing. The topics are organized well, and they're not taught like most grammar classes - the book incorporates short stories and a wide variety of exercises, and our professor frequently used songs to give us a better understanding of the specifics. If you decide to take the class, definitely try to get Professor Seymour - she's very approachable, and always seemed most concerned about whether or not we understood the material. The workload isn't small, but I never felt like any of it was busy work."
