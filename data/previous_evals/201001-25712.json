    "Overall, I thought this course was well taught and the material was interesting to discuss.",
    "Great course! The energy and enthusiam of the professor was unprecedented in my experience at SOM. I learned so much from the student presentations and class discussion. Very effective seminar format. I would have liked it if we had reached climate treaties, but that is my only critique.",
    "10: I had taken The New Corporate Social Responsibility and there was some overlap. But as Matt had indicated, the perspective here was economic rather than political science."

    "I enjoyed the small class size and how it was entirely discussion based.",

    "The wide range of issues discussed at class.",
    "The directed seminar format",
    "I liked that we had time to really discuss issues brought up in the assigned articles.",
    "The subject matter was cutting edge",
    "The willingness of the professor to engage with students. The openness and dialogue.",
    "Behavioral economics and Professor Kotchen's clear explanations.",
    "Great discussion among students. Only possible with a small number of students.",
    "The discussion format, giving the possibility to participate with total freedom on every subject. Also, the contents of the reading posed relevant subjects to be analyzed from a theorethical and practical approach."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings were not very exciting, a bit too much overlap with some of the studies and the lengthiness and academic approach made the readings tedious at times.Because they were long it would have helped to have a little more structure and review of the readings. It may be better to have 2 shorter classes or not so early in morning.",
    "It felt like we just learned the same point over and over again. Really dull by the end. No incentive to do the reading.",
    "People need to come on time :)",
    "I would prefer more teaching from the instructor instead of just discussion.",
    "I would have liked to see more active professor facilitation to help get the conversation going amongst the students.",
    "Discussions were a little disjointed. It might be helpful to lump together all of the presentations at the beginning of class and then have a discussion of all of them simultaneously. Students presenting on the same day should meet to discuss the papers first and come up with a few overarching questions to kick things off. It might also be helpful to require that students submit a sentence summarizing each article to make sure students have internalized the information before coming to class.",
    "Could use more formal explanation of complex concepts and underlying theory."
