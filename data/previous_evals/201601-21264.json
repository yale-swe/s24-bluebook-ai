   "comments": [
    "Financial Markets was a very worthwhile introduction to the major asset classes and topics of finance. The readings from Foundations of Financial Institutions (Fabozzi et al.) were fantastic. The lectures were mostly life lessons from Shiller, but I recommend going as he has some awesome ideas to share. The problem sets and the midterms were pretty much a walk in the park if you can do arithmetic and understand the main ideas. Overall I feel much more confident about my general understanding of financial markets after this course.",
    "Think this class got revamped a little from before and was definitely a lot better. According to TFs the curve should be pretty lenient. Also, definitely take it if Ahsan is still a TF (probably the best TF Ive had a Yale). Questions on tests can be a bit arbitrary and there really is a LOT of material (about 2 normal classes' worth). But all in all i felt it was a very worthwhile experience.",
    "Really good course for anyone who doesn't know much about finance but wants a basic overview. For those going into banking or another finance-related career and have a bit more pre-existing knowledge of finance, the concepts and math for the class will be a bit easier to understand.",
    "The course has a lot of reading from the main textbook, as well as some from other supplementary texts. Go to lecture and take good notes and go to section to learn the mathematics for the problem sets. Study early for the exams.",
    "Not an easy course because of the broad range of topics covered, but very useful material",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. There are other courses available at Yale that provide a better overview of the material covered in this course.",
    "Take this class credit D. The midterms and Final test ridiculously specefic details in the reading. Lectures are useless don't go.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in career in finance. It is a great general overview and also teaches the history and meaning behind various financial policies and instruments.",
    "Great class to learn more about the financial world.",
    "Meh. Take it, can be an easy A. Shiller is a cool guy to be around. But its not that fun\/interesting",
    "It is a good course for anyone wanting to go into finance and starting from scratch almost. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the topic because if not, the course is quite heavy on material covered.",
    "yes",
    "Yes if interested in fianance No if if looking for an intellectually simulating course",
    "Good course if you want to learn basic finance.",
    "Take this course if you have a general interest in finance, but don't necessarily want a career in the field. You'll learn a lot and the course isn't too difficult either. Shiller is great too.",
    "very helpful",
    "If you are at all intending to pursue a career in anything related to finance, economics, business or politics, you MUST take this class. It will give you a profound understanding of how the world we live in today is increasingly a financial one. It will teach you how finance developed and how it can be used to do good in the world. What more could you ask for in a class?",
    "Students who would like to know basics of financial market would find this course helpful and can get a sense of how financial world is running.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, however, I would stress that it was very important to stay on top of the material presented in the book for the class and to make sure that they practice the class's math thoroughly. The exams are part theory and part math, so know both!"
