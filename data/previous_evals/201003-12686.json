   "comments": [
    "Take it. It is not as difficult as the syllabus initially indicates.",
    "Take this course if you can. An eye-opener.",
    "Great seminar with not too much work, but you learn so much. Take if interested in anything related to food policy.",
    "Class was only an hour a week, but your also expected to do 3-4hrs\/wk of research. Class was really discussion based, mostly just read recent articles on different food policies. Interesting, but not a lot of instruction from Prof Brownell.",
    "Take it if you want to be completely immersed in the world of nutrition, and if you're a self-starter.",
    "This class is INCREDIBLE. It consists of a seminar once a week and independent research. This course got me into an incredible lab doing food policy research, which is what I've always wanted to do at Yale and want to do in the future. Kelly Brownell is an absolutely incredible professor, and a leading expert in the field of obesity and public health. This was definitely the best class I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Great course that gives you an overview of the current dynamics of food policy and psychology surrounding it. Very broad ranging from obesity to soda tax issues, etc. However, it wasn't capped when I took it, so the class was almost the size of 30. Still, good discussion, good professor, minimal work. Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Kelly Brownell is very passionate about his field, and he really wants to enact change in the world to help overcome the obseity epidemic. There isn't a lot of weekly work - just some seminars you have to attend or watch later (but he makes up for this by cutting the class time down). There's also an independent research project on the side which contributes to most of your work for the class. I really enjoyed my research and the class certainly opened my eyes to many food-related issues. If you can find someone to supervise your research, take it!",
    "Yes I would recommend it to any student who is interested in the current work and developments in the field of food and nutrition policy. A wide variety of topics were discussed.",
    "This was the first time this class has been taught; the seeds for a great class are there but it was a bit underdeveloped for this first go-around. That said, I definitely learned a lot, and particularly enjoyed the independent research experience (he allows for a wide range of topics so feel free to pick something of interest to you). I also liked the speaker series, but I think the syllabus needs tobe revised to incorporate more intensive policy and history reading assignments, rather than just Rudd Center-produced research summaries.",
    "Definitely! I never really knew much about food policy until I took the class, and I find it absolutely fascinating. Professor Brownell is a really engaging professor, and I hope to take his lecture course next semester, too. The course is not that much work, especially if you are already working at the Rudd Center or a food-related lab at the medical school.",
    "Fun and interesting course with a light work load. Especially if you have never taken a class relating to food, if you put in the work this will open up your eyes to a whole new range of issues relating to food and psychology. Professor Brownell is also a good professor, very open and earnest.",
    "It was an easy class. The shortened seminar model is nice because you spend less time in class, but you also don't get that much from the discussions, and the readings are so short as to be nonexistent but also not informative. The research component was interesting, but only because I was working with a great member of the Rudd Center. And she was really stressed because she had been asked to work with so many students. Shop it if you're interested in the material and in an easy class, but don't expect to get much more from it than you would from reading news articles on your own. Professor Brownell knows a lot but does not put much effort into the course; he might be better in a lecture. And don't take it unless he caps it. With 40 people or so, discussions are impossible and there is little chance to do anything significant work-wise. Interesting but unfulfilling.",
    "This class is great, though it really depends on your independent research. The weekly discussions were interesting while not demanding a lot of your time.",
    "It all depends on what research project you get. Make sure you like your advisor because some people wound up doing really interesting work and others wound up doing nothing. Also - make sure you get someone who will give you a good review because that is basically what determines your grade in the class."
