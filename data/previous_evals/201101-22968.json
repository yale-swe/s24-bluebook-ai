    "I would absolutely would recommend this class to a fellow student. Fun class and clearly beneficial in various ways. You watch movies, talk about them, and then write a little bit about them. I took it to help me decide whether or not I would be a film major, and it definitely helped me to figure it out.",
    "Overview of war films from WWI to today. Interesting subject matter, but definitely don't take it unless Murray Biggs is doing the majority of the teaching.",
    "good class, very interesting",
    "final is pretty lax, but beware, this class in a major time commitment",
    "If you are interested in the films offered, take the class. Be prepared to attend all of the screenings and be attentive, as this class requires a huge amount of self-motivation. If you miss a film, you'll be lost in lecture and section. Definitely not worth it unless you are truly interested in the material. Having guest lecturers makes the class hard to follow, and the sessions hit or miss, depending on who is speaking. The final is very easy, if you pay attention in class it is very broad and basic, meant to test that you have simply seen a majority of the films.",
    "It's a great opportunity to watch a ton of movies about war and learn about them. Awesome.",
    "Tons of movies (2 a week for the entire semester) and not much writing (3 papers).",
    "I thought that this was a great course. The films were very interesting. Professor Biggs only lectured twice, and every other lecture we had guest lecturers. They were all knowledgable and interesting. The format, however, makes the course a bit inconsistant. Also, what we were graded on (the papers and final) had little to do with what actually went on in class. Rather, it was on your personal take on the movies.",
    "Excellent class, yet I would choose another film class over this one.",
    "Absolutely take this class. The films are great, the work is manageable, and Murray Biggs is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. He's incredibly dedicated to his teaching, and he makes an effort to get to know each student individually at the personal level. I took this class on a whim, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made at Yale.",
    "Good cr\/d\/f class, the films are good, but know that its a speaker series murray never lectures. NO READING.",
    "I would recommend this class. Sometimes it's hard to determine the overall theme of the class but the lectures are really interesting and there is no reading which is nice.",
    "This is a wonderful course! Many great war films, shown 2 times a week. There were many many guest lecturers, which varied in their level of awesomeness, but Professor Biggs was always great (sometimes I wished there were less guests and more Murray Biggs). This class offers a great opportunity to reflect seriously on war and film and their relationship. A totally worthwhile class.",
    "No reading. Learned nothing from lecture. Section annoying. Good movies (the ones I watched). Perfect for a Credit\/D that you don't want to care about at all.",
    "I would definitely recomment this course to someone, especially if you've never taken a film class before. I took it as senior and credit\/d so it was really for fun-- and I really did enjoy it a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It was great that the only work was watching films -- no real reading! Most of the films were really interesting too.",
    "Good 5th class. Professor Biggs is great and the movies are really good. Just make sure you keep up with the films.",
    "Highly recommend this course as a low-pressure introduction to film studies, and as a different way to understand war, history, humanity."
