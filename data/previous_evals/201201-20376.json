    "Yeah, it absolutely is a great course to give you some basic idea on enkaryotic biology and would help your own research.",
    "It's a great class that you should definitely take. The professors run it like a well-oiled machine.",
    "learning biological pathways and molecular biology experimental design. Recommended: yes. learned a lot about biological pathways and potential ways of asking questions, which may or may not be relavant.",
    "Yes, because it's cell bio and we all need a little cell bio in our lives. It was actually quite helpful because it's been a while since I've taken a course focused on eukaryotic biology.",
    "Of course. As I mentioned it was a great in-depth course on Eukaryotic biochemistry.",
    "It is a comprehensive overview of the genetic system in eukaryotes from transcription to translation and its regulatory mechanisms involving DNA, RNA, and proteins.",
    "I would describe this course as a comprehensive analysis of everything from transcription to translation and protein degradation. I would recommend this to a friend because I have learned a great amount during this course.",
    "Helpful, but a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to students because you learn quite a lot! I would have appreciated a lot more comparisons to prokaryotic genetics because I study bacteria. There were some hints of this throughout the course, and I understand that this is not a comparative genetics course."

    "Provide a background knowledge.Practice proposal writing.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot more about eukaryotes, which is great since my background is in bacteria!",
    "good class and molecular biology background.",
    "It's always good to know where your work fits in to the larger biology of the cell, otherwise there's not much context for it.",
    "It helped with understanding many methods used in biochemistry that I might used someday for my own research.",
    "This course broadened my knowledge to encompass more transcriptional understanding that I previously lacked.",
    "To write the proposal is very helpful.",
    "Because I do not study eukaryotes, I gained an appreciation for eukaryotic genetics in this course but not a lot of it was purely applicable to prokaryotes. I appreciated the opportunities to read lots of great primary literature and explore biochemical techniques for understanding genetics."
