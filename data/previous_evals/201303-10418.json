    "This was by far the best class I have taken at Yale to date, and I'm a junior anthropology major. Professor Brotherton worked hard to make it a space where people felt comfortable grappling with new, contentious topics. I came into it never taking a medical anthropology course, but did not feel like I was at a disadvantage at any point. Overall, a wonderfully conceived course that's very effective.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class if the readings don't change.",
    "Worthwhile reading list, very solid professor, slightly boring seminar format.",
    "anthro of the body is a fantastic course with a great syllabus; prof brotherton is sharp, funny, and a great instructor. take it!",
    "Great anthro course! Anthropology of the body is fascinating, and touches on everything from medical anthro to bdsm and plastic surgery. definitely challenges you to think about the way you relate to your own body and how the body is represented in contemporary culture, media, etc. There were a lot of grad students, which was annoying, and the class was a little bit bigger than would be ideal, but overall a really great anthro course."
