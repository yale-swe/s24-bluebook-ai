   "comments": [
    "The Misanthrope is an exploration of Moliere's theater. Being a part of the production and the class ensemble was a wonderful experience.",
    "A class that will give you a lot and will make you want to give a lot back.Work on comedia del arte, one short paper, one long paper, two scenes to prepare, and the production of a play. I also took two dancing classes for my part. Reading is almost weekly.Moli\u00c3\u00a8re is a fabulous figure to study, and professor Dorfman has aptly managed to bring him and his work to life. We read a lot of his plays, and studied his life and XVII century France intensely. I walked away from this class with the feeling I had met Moli\u00c3\u00a8re.",
    "This is a class you come to excited, and leave more excited.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student interested in receiving classical theater training as an actor. We started out with reading texts by Moliere and other playwrights influenced by Moliere. We did scene work throughout the semester (two with re-workings) and ended the semester with rehearsing for a production and writing a performance research paper.",
    "Though this precise course might not re-occur, taking a Production Seminar with Toni is a very rewarding experience. You get to be part of a richly realized show, and also delve into the literary and historic context of the production with your fellow actors\/classmates.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to work with Toni Dorfman, who loves French lit\/theater, or who wants to do classical theater outside Shakespeare.",
    "Production seminars are wonderful acting experiences, especially if you are excited by the show and\/or role you are offered."
