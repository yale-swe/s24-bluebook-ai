    "In this course, I learned about the history of American folk music and revival. In addition to learning how to read texts critically, I learned how to ask and consider questions about complications in the way that we approach history. In each class, I learned how to express my opinions thoughtfully and how to use the comments of my fellow classmates and teacher to further my understanding of the material. After taking this class, I now know how to express myself and speak in matters outside of an academic setting. Furthermore, I understand how to think critically about modern issues.",
    "The history folk music in the US, as well as different US folk movements throughout history",
    "I developed the ability to explore music in the past and how music influences history and vice versa. I also learned how to dissect music in a more scholastic way.",
    "This course provided me with a thorough understanding of the American folk revival in its many forms. In class, we discussed a myriad of complex and multifaceted concepts, like cultural ownership, appropriation, genre, and narrative.",
    "I've developed the ability to close read, cross analyze historical accounts, and build a research paper from the foundation up."

   "comments": [
    "The fact that this course was a freshman seminar aided in its effectiveness. Although at times the readings appeared overwhelming, the teacher did an excellent job of breaking down the work and preparation into a comprehensive, efficient discussion in class. One of the biggest strengths of the course was how it encouraged students to engage in the surrounding New Haven community. Two of the assignments involved finding a pocket of art and culture in the surrounding community and this encouraged me to explore the area and find groups of people I would have never met otherwise. The teacher helped to balance the necessity of thinking critically on difficult issues with the necessity of students to find their own unique place in the class, and the experiences outside of it.",
    "The readings were very dense but interesting. The discussion during class could be improved, but mainly because it was a small class and often you could tell that other students didn't do the readings.",
    "I appreciated how the course was small with great discussion every class time. Our professor would give us readings to do before class and we would just discuss the readings in a very interesting fashion. One weakness of the course could possibly be the lack of feedback early on. The feedback I did receive was very helpful, I just wish I had some in the first month in the course so I could know what I needed to do to improve.",
    "One strength of this course was its small class size. Our discussions were nuanced, intimate, and productive.",
    "Strengths: the topic material is extremely interesting and worth explaining. Weaknesses: while promising to be an analyzation of folk music in America, this course failed to look at several other topics that I felt like were worthy of examination such as native folk music, even though it had an entire chapter in one of the textbooks we were required to have. I think it would really enhance the course to look into this topic as well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Though it was difficult for me to adjust from not ever taking a seminar course before, the course pushes you to express yourself and your opinions concisely. Furthermore, I learned skills in research and how to prepare readings for discussion. Beyond that, the course has a variety of unique elements like culture shares and explorations into the surrounding community that keeps the course always engaging.",
    "Yes, but only if you are truly interested in the subject matter. If not, you are taking away from the learning and enjoyment of other students.",
    "I would. This course was very interesting and I learned a lot about folk music in American history and what it means to be considered folk music. I loved how this course had an emphasis on learning about the subject matter.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Angharad is a wonderful, organized, thoughtful professor, and I would certainly take one of her courses again if I had the chance. The course material is interesting, important, and thought-provoking.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a strong affinity to the subject material, are extremely self-driven in your studies\/reading, and have the time to read a significant amount in between each class."
