    "During Intermediate Italian, I was able to grow as both an italian student and speaker. This class challenged me a lot, but it forced me to be disciplined. Not only did I learn a lot of Italian and improve my speaking, I also developed good study habits, which I am sure will help me in the future.",
    "We developed our writing, conversation, and reading skills in Italian, building on previous Italian knowledge to reach a new level of fluency.",
    "During this course I regained my proficiency in Italian and gained a good overall understanding of Italian grammar as well as improving my speaking skills. I also enjoyed learning about some of Italy's culture within our textbook."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The greatest strengths of the class are the amount of speaking we do during the lesson and also the small class size. Since we had to always speak in Italian, I found that over the semester I grew more and more comfortable speaking a foreign (and difficult) language. Also, I appreciate the small class size because it gives everyone ample opportunity to speak and participate and it also creates a certain camaraderie among classmates.",
    "In the course, we had the opportunity to engage with current issues, which was a major strength of the curriculum. It was rewarding to learn the vocabulary to discuss matters beyond cursory information. The amount of writing we did was also very beneficial to developing fluency, although it would have been nice to have more opportunities to write informally. As in any language course, developing conversational fluency was difficult because that skill requires many hours of speaking.",
    "The high level of daily engagement and the amount of time spent in conversation with the class and within groups was the best way to improve our oral Italian at a fast pace. The online workbook was also a helpful tool for studying grammar. The one out of class trip we did to the art gallery was a great experience and I would have enjoyed to have done more trips during the semester. However, there was a lot to do within the department with weekly screenings and cultural events."
