    "I learned the most in this course than in any other course in my life so far. What I loved about the curriculum is that it was designed to look at history as literature and politics and sometimes the politics of literature. So meta. But concrete because Herodotus, Thucydides, and so many other narrative histories pin down political phenomena in colorful stories that stick with us. I could've used more instruction with my essays, but am very satisfied with the amount and quality of feedback I received with my work. Slanski is the WOMAN. She is so cool and my favorite ever. At first I was scared shitless by her authority, but in time I came to give myself more credit and realize that poignant pauses can be just as important as the verbal discussion. Think critically and answer things like you're answering for yourself and you'll do great. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS.",
    "This is a history course that will leave you with impressive knowledge about the past and how it is significant to today's Western society. The atmosphere may initially be intimidating, but in the end the course is rewarding, and Professor Slanski tries her best to make it so. I would recommend this to another student, because it challenges the student to delve into the classics in unique ways.",
    "Everyone should take DS!",
    "The class overall is too big, but if you have the right teacher (Slanski), it makes everything better. I'm sure that there are other teachers who are just as good, but I'm telling you that she's one of the best.",
    "DS H&P is the best history course I've taken; the attention not only to history but to the art of the creation\/manipulation of history was an enlightening perspective. Professor Slanski is unequivocally the best section leader ever. She was intimidating at the beginning of the semester, but her no-BS guidance of discussion led us through really enlightening exploration of the texts. The reading is a lot, but you want to do it so you can get more out of section. Also she brought us cider and doughnuts on Halloween and at the end of the semester we had dinner at her house (she's an amazing cook, and her son is way too adorable). If you get assigned Slanski, don't switch out. If you don't, mess up your schedule and switch in.",
    "A very excellent text-based course, which sharpened my reading and particularly my writing skills. It was difficult to cover all the ground we covered, but we somehow did, and with relative depth. What DS does to accomplish this is, first, leave out much in the way of historical context (our readings are only primary sources), and, second, concentrate on a relatively select number of themes--the ones which one can find in all of the texts we read.This is NOT a history course; rather, it is a history writing course: a study of how political identity emerges from the writing of history, and howauthors establish authority and communicate political ideas through the writings of their work (that is, structure and form, not simply content). You will emerge, however, with a general sense of Western history since the Persian War. It'll be passable until Late Antiquity, when the leaps between authors become larger.",
    "People say Professor Slanski is intimidating. She's definitely tough, and she has high intellectual standards, but she's also super nice. We laughed a lot in section, and a lot of my best friends in DS are in that section. Slanski also reached out to me about personal issues and went out of her way to support me, as she does for all of her students. Plus, she's an absolutely phenomenal teacher - incredibly insightful and attentive to details. Take her class!",
    "From Herodotus to Aquinas, we traced major themes in historiography and how people have views the forces behind history and politics as empires rise and fall. I loved this class and would absolutely recommend it. It changed the way I thought about historians and why they wrote and what they wrote about."
