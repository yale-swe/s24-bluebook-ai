   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a great class! It's the Holocaust from so many angles that you've never heard\/considered before. A very academic class and NOT depressing, also the work is very light.",
    "This class is a great survey course about the Holocaust. Although the focus is very heavy on Judaism, compared to other aspects of the Holocaust, by the end of the course you develop an overall great understanding of the Holocaust. The readings are great, although a little heavy, and the expecatations are high in the sense that you are expected to know all of the readings very very well. Otherwise, 2 papers and a final is very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student, but this course would probably be best for someone with an interest in history. The course involves a midterm paper, final paper, and final exam, so it's not that much work throughout the year but a lot of weight is put on a few assignments. You should take this class if you have a relatively good ability to research, write, and make arguments. Also, do the readings. This course definitely achieved its learning objectives and helped me understand the Holocaust on a deep level.",
    "An overview of the Holocaust as an event, focusing on an understanding of how the Holocaust took place and how the world has responded to it. If you are looking for a course that will give you a better understandingof the Holocaust, take this, but expect more breadth than depth.",
    "Professor Hyman took a bit of time to really shine with her lectures during shopping period, but once the class shrank a bit, she was brilliant. With only 15 of us, Professor Hyman would make eye contact and talk to each of us during the lecture. While this information might not seem new to some of us, but it was presented very uniquely. Take this class if you can.",
    "This course felt more like a seminar than a lecture course because there were so few people in it. My section had only four people. It wasn't until I was making my review guide for the final that I appreciated how well this course describes the experience of the Holocaust. Professor Hyman isn't the best lecturer and she tends to start a sentence, then wander a bit, and then maybe come back to her original point. This can make note taking a bit of a pain. Most of your grade is determined within the last week, which can be stressful. But for the final you either need to have gone to all the lectures or done most of the reading, but you don't need to do both. The history offered in this course was more social than anything else.",
    "It's a really in-depth and interesting look at the Holocaust. Lectures are engaging and while at times there can be semi-dense reading, it is very enlightening. These readings are also usually discussed in lecture and definitely in section which helps as a debriefing. The final paper is open topic so you can really choose what aspect of the Holocaust you're interested in. If you're at all interested in the Holocaust I'd say take it, or at least shop it to see if it's what you'd like."
