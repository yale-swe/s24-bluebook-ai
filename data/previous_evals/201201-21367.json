    "The Senior Essay is a great experience. It was awesome to explore a topic so in depth -- it's something you can't get in other courses. It is also not a ton of work, especially if you start your research early. I'd recommend all Econ majors to write a senior essay.",
    "Great course, very rewarding! I would recommend it to any\/all Econ majors, regardless of post-grad plans.",
    "Take it if you're interested in research\/think you may want to go to econ grad school\/have a topic you're really interested in. If not, don't bother.",
    "Great experience, and got to do research on a topic I was passionate about. Do it!",
    "Writing a senior essay was great in being able to apply concepts learned in the Economics department to conduct original research. It was frustrating because working with data can be tedious and we haven't all been properly trained in doing so, but it was interesting and I learned a lot from the process.",
    "Do it!",
    "This was probably one of the most enriching and satisfactory experiences I've had at Yale. It won't drive you crazy. I had a lot of fun using what I've learned in the last four years to create something original.",
    "I think students should understand that it's driven by much independent research and initiative, so there's a need to be very proactive even though advisers after all provide guidance and direction.",
    "Even though the essay is optional, I highly recommend it. You get to know a topic in economics extremely well, and the chance to find your own results. It's very fulfilling.",
    "Worth it if you are a serious economics student, strong analytically, and have a nice advisor.",
    "recommend if you are willing to put in the work. you get out of the senior essay what you put in.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in doing your own research, and especially if you want to go to graduate school. That was my initial reason for taking it, but I'm not going to grad school next year and I think the fact that I did my own data analysis and research helped me to find the job in economic development that I'll be doing when I graduate. Even though it's optional, it's a pretty cool experience, plus you'll be done with a class at the beginning of April, which is nice.",
    "It depends if you're really invested in your project. If you are passionate about a topic and think you could spend a year researching it, I definitely recommend doing a senior thesis. It is an incredibly rewarding experience, but you'll drive yourself crazy (and potentially drop it) if you aren't enthusiastic from the start.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Independent research was the best part of my Yale education!",
    "I would recommend it only if you are interested in graduate work. Otherwise it is a time consuming and stressful waste of time. Writing the essay is a lot harder and more time consuming than a regular class and often advisors are not as helpful as you would hope them to be. You have to figure out a lot of stuff for yourself, including data collection and analysis, which can take a long time.Also, pick your advisor and topic carefully. I would HIGHLY recommend writing the essay in conjunction with a seminar which is a lot easier than doing it on your own. The class provides some structure and background to help with the essay.",
    "Yes, I would very much recommend this course because it polishes the skills you learn throughout your economics studies at Yale.",
    "Interesting experience",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. It was a great experience. Just make sure you have a good topic and advisor.",
    "Do it if there's a topic you're interested in and you wanna research, but don't expect to receive much help...",
    "Make sure you get a good adviser who is willing to meet with you weekly or bi-weekly. Have a good outline by the end of the first semester. Don't think of this as some mammoth project- be realistic. Then, it will be a good experience!",
    "Yes, if you have an advisor and topic you really like."
