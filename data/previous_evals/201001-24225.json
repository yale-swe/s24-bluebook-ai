   "comments": [
    "Easther is fantastic, particularly when the class turns toward cosmology. He keeps the topics relevant, and teaches only as much of the mathematical detail as is necessary to honestly represent the underlying physics.",
    "Good introduction to a beautiful subject. The cosmology part is fun if you don't know anything about cosmology going in, but probably a repeat if you've taken some astro classes.",
    "Recommended.",
    "I was very lucky to have had the opportunity to take this course as an undergraduate. Usually, the only way to do a serious GR course is to take a graduate course. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in GR and who might not be expecting to study it later. Richard Easther is a good lecturer, but is sometimes detached as a teacher. If you aren't familiar with his teaching style, I would highly recommend shopping the class first to determine if you like him. Bottom line: if you're into physics take it, but with caution.",
    "If you are an undergraduate with an interest in learning about general relativity, one of the coolest and most elegant scientific theories ever developed, then you should definitely take this course. Familiarity with basic concepts in physics is of course very useful, and I would mostly recommend this class to physics majors who have taken some or all of the five core intensive physics major courses, those with a mathematical bent should be fine. The beginning, in particular, is fairly formal.",
    "It depends. If you want a very rigorous mathematical introduction to GR, then no. If you want to bypass the details of the mathematics and get on to physical results (black holes, gravitational waves, cosmology, etc.), then this is a good class. Prof Easther lectures too fast, so I would advise reading the textbook to keep yourself up to speed. Overall, the class is a good intro to GR - you'll want to take more in grad school.",
    "If you have taken 430 and it went smoothly, then take it."
