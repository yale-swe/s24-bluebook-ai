    "It is a lot of little work, four essays with pretty open prompts, lots of reading and looking at artworks.",
    "This was such a wonderful class! I was definitely extremely apprehensive coming into the class. The coursework touches on topics of beauty, aesthetics, philosophy, and a lot of art, and because they seemed to foreign to me, I was afraid of the class being really tough. As it turns out, Professor Jones conducts this class in such a casual way. Going to class always felt like hanging around a table chatting about some art or philosophy pieces. I never felt intimidated the way I expected to be by the topics of beauty. There are 4 papers for the class, the first is a close reading of an argument, the second is a definition of beauty (sounds daunting but we're provided with all the sources we need through class readings), the third is the big research paper on any topic related to beauty, and the fourth is a meditation between two pieces of art. We spent a lot of time practicing our writing, workshopping, etc., and I feel like I came out of the class a better writer.",
    "Take this class as a Freshman to gain experience with writing academic essays. If you already feel confident with your writing skills, this class might be too easy or boring for you. Try to take this class with an interesting and energetic professor or it could be very tedious.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Your writing will be fine-tuned and you will partake in very engaging discussions. Your work will involve pieces of art that you choose to discuss and you can write about topics that you are passionate about. It is a great course!",
    "This is your classic intro writing course, although be warned that the topic of beauty can get very wishy washy, and we do discuss many readings that are more philosophical (only in the beginning of the year - by the end things get more concrete). Be prepared to analyze art, as that is a big part of the class. I went to the Yale Art Gallery probably around 5 or 6 times in the semester. Ms. Jones is a tough grader, but also recognizes hard work. This class was definitely difficult, but I definitely am proud of the 4 writing pieces I produced this semester.",
    "I was actually very nervous about taking this course because I wouldn't consider myself the most artsy person, but I really, really enjoyed it! Professor Jones is also a gem!",
    "It is a good class to take and sometimes it moves a little bit too fast. But if you have an opportunity to take it please take it, especially with Rosemary Jones.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While there was a lot of reading assignments, it was all very do-able and I thought very interesting. For needing a writing requirement, it course was very helpful.",
    "Four papers, very reasonable reading, and very artsy.",
    "A great college intro English course that will try to develop academic writing skills. I would recommend it because I feel all students would benefit from a class like this that builds on skills and lets you know what kind of writing is expected of you in college."
