   "comments": [
    "It's a good class to take if you need a pre-1800 for the English major.",
    "Take this class, guys! It's a good one if you enjoyed reading Paradise Lost, and if you want to understand the man behind the poem. The class covers a lot of other poetry by Milton too (both the good and the bad, lol)",
    "Take this class, for sure, if you want to do more in-depth work on Milton. It's an amazing lecture. (It is, though, fundamentally a lecture, so if you want a seminar, find a different class.)",
    "Take this course! It is fantastic. John Rogers is brilliant and funny and you will learn a lot about a fascinating author.",
    "If you take one English class at Yale, it should probably be this one. An overall excellent lecture course on the most important English poet (and the one you're probably least likely to read and understand on your own). Rogers really makes the material (even the drier prose stuff) sing, and the TFs seem to be uniformly excellent, which is pretty rare in such a big class. Take it.",
    "This is the best lecture I've taken at Yale. Milton is the kind of author who really rewards intense and prolonged study, as his life and works all revolve around the same themes and events, and Professor Rogers is brilliant and engaging. Great class, take it!",
    "This class is just beautiful. (Yes, yes of course you have to like Milton.) The prose is just as difficult and enjoyable as the poetry, and at every step of the way Professor Rogers makes fresh, compelling arguments about this author, whom he knows inside and out. Very little writing for a WR credit (2 short papers and final exam).",
    "The best English lecture class.... Rogers is brilliant, the reading is worthwhile, there's not a crushing amount of work. Basically, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any English major or anyone with a strong interest in Milton. The workload is not significant, though the difficulty of the grading will depend more on your TF than anything else.",
    "YESYESYES",
    "Great professor, interesting subject. Workload is decent.",
    "A good overview of Milton, though Professor Rogers doesn't quite make up for the fact that Milton is just downright painful to read.",
    "Even if you don't like Milton, I highly recommend this course. Particularly if you're an English major and into more contemporary work, John Rogers makes Milton really accessible and interesting. Plus, there are only two short papers and a final.",
    "Certainly. Great great course. So well organized and thought out.",
    "it's a lot of Milton, but not a bad way to fulfill a pre-1800 requirement.",
    "Yes, I would and do recommend this class. Everyone always says their favorite class in college was a Milton class - no joke - and this fits the bill. Paradise Lost is the most fascinating and beautiful of all poems, and it is really wonderful to read it in the context of Milton's oeuvre (although to tell the truth, I wonder if reading a bit more theology might be more worthwhile thanreading, say, On the Crucifixion, however interesting Roger's comments on that were, insofar as historical context has more influence perhaps than early work on the late work). Professor Rogers is a fascinating lecturer.I would advise reading PL once before taking the class if you haven't already, but it's not necessary.",
    "I absolutely loved this class, and I didn't expect to. A must-take for English majors. John Rogers is amazing, you only have 2 papers and a final, and you read some of the most beautiful and provocative poetry in the English canon. Milton is quite a character, and you get so much more background info taking this class than you would reading his poetry alone. I looked forward to lectures and sections. Take it!",
    "If you took ENG 126 and loved MIlton, take this class. After a whole semester of Milton, I got a little sick of his style, but his character is enthralling...what a crazy, arrogant mofo! I want to make a drama about his life! Oh, and John Rogers is absolutely fabulous. It was so obvious that after how ever many years he's been studying Milton, the literature and the man are still greatly fascinating to him. Lectures were always fantastic and made me think during my lunch right after...wish I had gotten to know him! He seems great! One thing, though: it is a lot of reading...don't let the syllabus fool you: some of those prose tracts are 50+ pages of DENSE writing. I wish I had read more earlier in the semester, but I caught up on the important stuff by the final (which is not bad: 10 IDs and one thematic essay).",
    "I would if you are an english major.",
    "Yes, it\u0092s essential. Milton is mind-boggling and fascinating, and while the course felt overwhelming at times, I\u0092m very glad I took it.",
    "This is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. I'm a non-English major and I had never read Milton before this class. Professor Rogers' enthusiasm for Milton is infectious, the reading is excellent (there's a reason why Paradise Lost is so famous), the syllabus is carefully constructed, and the lectures are not to be missed. Fantastic.",
    "This is a wonderful class! Professor Roger's lectures are interesting and keep your attention. It is a lot of Milton, and only him, so make sure you really like Milton before taking the class.",
    "Be sure that you really like Milton. Really, really, like Milton. 2 short 6-8 page papers, final with IDs and one essay.",
    "A lot of Milton's work is actually really boring. However, Prof. Rogers manages to make all his lectures engaging, and Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes are great. Take the class if you like Paradise Lost, or if you need a pre-1800.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Rogers is an amazing lecturer and his passion for the subject was evident. He balanced close reading with Milton's biography and historical context. I had read Paradise Lost twice before but this course was like reading it for the first time thanks to all the nuance Professor Rogers was able to extract.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. This, in my mind, is a class that justifies Yale's reputation.",
    "Yes! definitely take it if you have any interest in Milton",
    "Take this class if you're interested in learning about one of the greatest poets of the English language and a key link in the Western tradition. The reading is intense but not at all overwhelming.",
    "At the end of John Rogers' course you will be able to say that you are very familiar withone of the greatest English poets. I found some of the poems to be beautiful in themselves, and even more so with the information we learned in lecture. If you won't go to lecture you really won't get that much out of this course because reading by yourself doesn't give all the information about the text. John Rogers is amazing. Take advantage of him. Papers aren't that hard to write. Final wasn't that difficult.",
    "I would summarize the course as a tracing of Milton's major prose and poetry works and of their positions within or against 17th century religion and politics. I would recommend it to English majors and to anyone interested in literature or the power of text to convey or transform meaning and engage societal questions."
