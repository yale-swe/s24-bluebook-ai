   "comments": [
    "A thorough summary of Aristotle's Poetics and its applications to modern screenwriting theories, the ability to analyze movies and screenplays for key structural points, the process of creating a screenplay from the logline to revisions, how to critique others' work and receive criticism for your own.",
    "I developed my ability to write screenplays and to successfully develop characters, dialogue, and setting.",
    "how to write a feature length screenplay, details on the screenwriting business",
    "The ins and outs of writing a screenplay.",
    "I got a very thorough sense of the key components of story telling, and an awesome overview\/ writers workshop of how to write a screenplay. This class has changed the way I watch movies and think about the way we tell stories.",
    "This is an excellent class for learning the basics of screenwriting and so much more. I watch movies in a completely different way now: I look for structural elements, cringe at the dialogue, and notice extraneous scenes. It's really cool being able to tell why a movie does or doesn't work. I've always been interested in creative writing, but this class taught me so much about plot that I feel far better prepared to tackle any projects I have.",
    "This course taught me about basic story structure in screenwriting and how to go from idea to script. The process, which includes loglines, beatsheets, outlines, and drafts, is the most important part of screenwriting. Screenplays are not written, they are re-written.",
    "I learned about Aristotle's theories of story-telling, how to structure an outline of a screenplay and then structure a screenplay, how to analyze a film based off story elements, as well as small tips\/tricks to succeeding in the industry.",
    "Elements that make up a story, and therefore a movie; the steps of writing a screenplay and how to take them.",
    "We discussed the structure of story and screenplays. We learned how to break down any movie, and how to outline and begin the process of writing a full-length screenplay.",
    "A better understanding of the structure of storytelling and how universal rules of storytelling apply to modern screenwriting.",
    "Without a doubt one of the most worthwhile classes at Yale for the aspiring writer. Teaches the structure, process, and essentials of writing a screenplay, then sets you on the path to writing one yourself."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very informative, interesting material, exposure to a lot of movies, combination of both lecture and workshopping Weaknesses: No diversity in class structure or activities, could have been more engaging (most of it was lectures), not a lot of opportunity to meet with the professor outside of class",
    "I think the roundtable format worked well for me, I felt like reading through everyone else's work was also super helpful, though we could've done more of that in the end.",
    "This was my absolute favorite class at Yale. Brian Price is fantastic and everyone should take this course if you are even remotely interested in writing or film. Non-film people should take this. Film people should take this. I feel so lucky to have gotten to take it. Brian Price gave excellent feedback on our writing. I wish it met more than once a week! There was not really enough time to go over everyone's final screenplays and I would have liked to read everyone's final drafts.",
    "The one weakness is not being able to workshop screenplays sooner, but I think everything we cover is necessary.",
    "Its very informative in terms of the structure of screenwriting story beats, etc. I honestly wish there was more things to do\/ work for the course. The final assignment was 15 pages and I honestly wish that it was 30. I really enjoyed when work was read aloud and getting group feedback. I wish we could have been assigned more viewing maybe rather then spending class time on it, although I do see the value in being able to pause the movie frequently and discuss the events.",
    "This course is just excellent. It is well-structured and engaging. I learned a ton about how to craft a proper story and feel like a much better writer as a whole. The one weakness of this course is that we did spend two classes watching Some Like It Hot. I feel like it would have been a better use of time to watch it outside of class and then discuss it during class. It's a great movie and very instructive, but I was a bit disappointed that we spent two classes doing something we could have done outside of it.",
    "This course is strict with deadlines for drafts, which is one of the best parts of the course. Not making excuses and getting the writing done is an important part of becoming a screenwriter if that is your goal. I would recommend coming into the course with an idea or two that you are interested in. You hit the ground running once the outlining starts and you will commit to this idea for the rest of the semester. Brian has a lot of experience and knowledge, all of which he brought to each class. I only wish we had more time to workshop some of these initial ideas.",
    "Very fun class and teaches you about story-telling and screenplay writing structure\/set-up very well. Could be a little better to do small writing exercises to get things like voice\/character down other than just the big picture of outlining.",
    "Strengths: Pretty much everything. Prof. Price has the class organized down pat, and in the most fun way possible the 1hr50mins always flew by.",
    "I wish we could have had more time to get deeper into feedback. One or two of the assignments (an essay about a screenplay you read) could be skipped in favor of getting more feedback on actual pages.",
    "Professor Price is a huge strength in himself. Hilarious and easy-going, but unafraid to roast you. Great, lively classroom discussion, lots of good film examples. I actually have nothing less than positive to say about the joy that is Prof Price and this class, other than that I wish wed written even more of the screenplay as part of class assignments."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "For students looking for an overview of storytelling and the basics of screenwriting, yes. For students looking for a more in-depth screenwriting course, no.",
    "If you're at all interested in creative writing, I would. I think it helps you really think through an entire story idea, and helps you mature as a creator.",
    "Yes!!!! everyone should take this class!!! Manageable workload, super interesting seminars, a wide variety of students from different majors, and genuinely fun.",
    "Yes, you will learn how to write for feature films, have a writing workshop-like classroom experience, and watch a few movies in class!",
    "Yes. Take it! I learned a lot about screenwriting, including that I do not enjoy screenwriting as much as I thought I did. This class helped me see how much I had fantasized the film industry to something that is not.",
    "I would highly recommend this to any student who is interested in writing, movies, or honestly just looking for a fun class that will teach you palpable skills.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. I looked forward to class every week and loved doing the assignments because they were so fun. Class discussions are exciting. Analyzing movies is a blast. Reading other people's work is great. You'll get real, honest feedback, but turning in something imperfect isn't going to negatively impact your grade. It's instructive, of course, but it's also a ton of fun. The weekly assignments aren't too bad. They never take a TON of time, but you have to be prepared to do something every single week.",
    "If you are interested in screenwriting to any degree, this will be a useful and insightful class.",
    "Yes absolutely, very fun course and Brian is a great prof.",
    "YES! So fun. So different than other courses I've taken. It's so amazing to be able to be so creative for a grade.",
    "If you are at all interested in screenwriting, this course was both fun and thoughtful, providing tools that will be incredibly helpful to later developing a screenplay.",
    "Absolutely! This is a great way to delve into screenwriting from any major, and the way Prof Price uses concepts from the Poetics and applies them to today's world of screenwriting is a really helpful, fresh perspective. It often feels like with screenwriting and writing classes that \"you either have it or you don't\", and I felt like Prof Price really challenged that mentality in a way that made non-film majors less daunted by trying to write. He also gave us a ton of insights into the industry on the last day. I honestly expected it to be advice I had heard before or be kind of cliche, but the things he told us were enormously helpful, especially about re-writing your work which is something I have struggled with in the past.",
    "Literally this class is both so well-graded and fun. It surrounds you with other aspiring writers, often first-timers to the world of screenwriting and Professor Price, the savage gem that he is might roast you in his commentary but he has a heart of GOLD. This man was exceptionally kind to all of us this semester but also made the seminar one of the most engaging and creatively stimulating classes I have ever taken."
