    "Reasonable workload (readings for the next class announced consistently 24 hours or less after the previous class, and she made sure it was always a reasonable amount for a given week); opportunity to improve valuable skills of abstract writing and giving a conference paper; good variety of reading, listening, and watching films\/documentaries\/operas\/etc. Relatively small detail, but the PDFs for readings could be \"fixed\" in the sense that they are occasionally rotated in strange ways, and it takes some time to go through and fix this."

    "This was a wonderful class! Very relevant topics for the current political climate. Course work for the seminar was well planned and balanced, and though each week was different, the readings informed each other as a whole."
