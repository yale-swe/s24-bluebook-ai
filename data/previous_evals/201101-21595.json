   "comments": [
    "Take the class if your interested in Europe. Lecture might be a bit boring but the readings are interesting.",
    "Extremely interesting course that covers a lot of material and aspects of European political history. Definitely worth taking if you're interested in European politics!",
    "Interesting class IF you like Europe.",
    "Great polisci class to take credit-d as you just have to take a midterm and final without mandatory section, would not recommend this course for a grade however.",
    "An excellent, rigorous political science lecture course. Professor Cameron's lectures tend to be 95% historical in order to fill in the gaps in our theoretical reading. There is a lot to learn but the material is very important. One midterm and one final, with an optional section and an optional paper. I highly recommend taking the section - my TF was the best I've ever had at Yale and it was really necessary todissect some of the more complex readings.",
    "The New Europe gives you a strong introduction to the history of the development of the EU. It also highlights some of the issues affecting the EU today. I would definitely recommend this course, though the lecture is a little dry.",
    "This is a good class and I would recommend it, but it is a very history-heavy class and the political science aspect is not always entirely obvious. If you're interested in Europe, particularly in the EU, Eastern Europe during and after the Cold War, and the rise of post-Communist democracies, then take it.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. Professor Cameron is warm, intelligent, and I learned quite a lot in his course. I would not recommend taking section. I think that Cameron does more than an adequate job of explaining the material, and section is just an addedand unnecessary hassle.",
    "Yes! Nice professor, minimal work",
    "If you can't take Professor Cameron's PLSC284 \"European Union\" seminar in the fall, PLSC166 is your next best choice to learn about the politics of the old continent.This truly is Professor Cameron at his best.",
    "I would take this course if you are interested in Europe and care about the future of the EU. If not, it's hard to engage in the material because the lectures are boring and the reading is dense.",
    "PLSC 166 is a fantastic course if you are interested in the creation and evolution of the EU and the fall of the USSR. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, good easy class.",
    "The New Europe was a wonderful class that provided a lot of insight about why the EU exists, how it was created and how it works, and a section on more contemporary challenges to the EU. It gives a very deep understanding thanks to the historical emphasis and the great readings. Lectures can be a little dry, so only take this class if you are really interested in the EU. While the class focuses a lot on history, contemporary challenges, etc, it also discusses a lot of political science theory, which I imagine can be helpful in many other poli sci classes.",
    "It's not the best course ever, if you are super interested in learning facts about the Soviet Union and the historical development of Europe that lead to the current stage, then go ahead.",
    "I recommend the class to anyone who has or will spend any time in Europe, or is planning on doing any kind of international law or business. Knowing how the EU was developed and continues to change is incredibly important and interesting.",
    "Definitely a great class to take if you are interested in gaining an overview about Europe and the European Union. By far one of the best Political Science courses! Definitely a lot of history, and no political theory!"
