    "This course is essential.",
    "An interesting class that you should be prepared to put in a lot of work toward! Grading is harsh.",
    "A class that is a necessary evil considering all the majors it is a prereq for. In terms of grading, there is a problem set every week, two midterms, and a final exam. The course has an excellent (if very strict) course director in Miki but You Qi, for me, was a subpar instructor. It was often unclear how all the material fit together until the other instructors were forced to actually be clear and concise during the review sessions. Qi is very funny, but he relies on analogies and visualizations that rarely make sense during the lectures. In addition, this course moves very quickly and the curve is awful. You'd be best taking this grueling introductory math course with another instructor."
