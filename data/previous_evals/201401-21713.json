    "If you want to understand what is causing conflict in current East Asian politics, this is a good course to learn what the problems are now, and why they are happening. It gives useful nuance to the current debates. If you are not East Asian Studies or Political Science, this may be difficult, as EAS majors have the advantage of knowing the history, while PS majors will quickly grasp the political implications of conflicts.",
