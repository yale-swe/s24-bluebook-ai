    "If you took AP Phys C, don't take this class. Way too easy. It's a decent introductory course to physics.",
    "A basic review of physics. I had already take AP Physics in high school, so I'd recommend it because it was relatively easy for me. However, I know people with less experience had a harder time and probably would say enter with caution.",
    "I enjoyed Prof. Krusberg's class a lot. I found her to be a wonderful professor--knowledgeable, approachable, and with a sense of humor. People thought this section was the \"easier\" of the two, but I'm not sure if that's really the case, since both sections more or less do the same problem sets and tests. Office hours can be crowded and if you're looking to have personal time with her, you should probably email her and see if you could set up a time in advance. However, it still helped to go to her office hours and do problems in groups, and she's really helpful about going over tests. Problems sets are hard (do them at study hall and save yourself some time), and tests are pretty hard too, but you can get half credit on all the points you miss by turning in corrections (a lifesaver).",
    "Yes! It's an interesting and very fair class.",
    "I would definitely recommend physics with Professor Krusberg to another student. Overall I think it was a really educational and enjoyable class.",
    "Pretty hard if you haven't taken AP Phys. The class is very interesting though, even if you do get destroyed at times. Take it with friends and you'll do fine.",
    "Physics 180 is a good introduction to kinematics, rotation, gravity and some other concepts in physics. The workload is relatively high because problem sets can take some time, and learning some concepts is outside of class is necessary.",
    "It's fine. Not a class to take for fun, but pretty solid. Psets can be tedious, but if you leave them for the night before, it really is your fault. Tons of people will have taken Physics before, where AP Physics B or C in high school, and if you haven't, be prepared to work harder than most. A solid single variable calculus background is helpful, though sequences and series are only just touched on in class.",
    "Standard physics course covering all of mechanics (with thermodynamics taken off the syllabus midway through because of time constraints). Professor Krusberg is terrific and understanding. Weekly homework took a moderate amount of time, but was manageable.",
    "I'm glad I took the interactive version of Physics 180 with Professor Krusberg. The clicker questions in class were fun and helpful and a nice break from monotonous lecture. Although the problem sets and exams were very difficult, I always had a lot of fun in class and actually found myself looking forward to it every Monday and Wednesday. Great experience!",
    "If you have to take it, seriously consider yourself blessed because the Physics Department actually decided to fix this class and make it better this semester and it is not just bearable, it is almost enjoyable. So, I would say that the flipped class is the way to go, if you are shopping sections. Two reasons. One, Professor Krusberg is a goddess. She is amazing. You will love her. She's smart, good at explaining concepts, kind, and very approachable. You'll want her to be your best friend. Second, the flipped class distills the most important concepts from the reading in a simple, non-intimidating way, and then forces you to do clicker questions and solve-multistep problems with your table. It's actually totally fine. It's cute - it's a low-pressure setting conducive to learning. It's like high school again. You'll basically cover all of classical mechanics. This is basically your equivalent of a AP Physics C course in high school. If you took an honors physics course, you might have missed out on cross-product, torque, angular moment, rotation, etc., in which case, this is probably a good level for you. Did you take Physics C already? Or are you a math whiz and you want to take the 200 sequence or maybe even 260? A word of advice: The 200 sequence is poorly taught, so it's not worth taking it just to feel like you placed into the \"more advanced level\". Seriously. No one cares. You will probably get less out of it and hate yourself more. This isn't high school. You don't get \"extra GPA points\" for taking \"higher level classes\". So, I honestly would not recommend it. The 260 sequences is really well taught, but is basically made for people who want to major in physics. If you don't care that much about physics, don't be silly and take that class. Are you pre-med? Deciding between PHYS 170 and 180? Just take 180. I had so many friends in 170 that hated it because it was poorly taught. 170 is some weird physics course with \"biological applications\" but you'll come out of it wondering what you learned. Physics 180 is your classical mechanics class. You will learn the real foundations of physics. It's a good way to go. I would highly recommend PHYS 180 if you're being weaseled into taking Physics. I'm not a STEM major, but I made it out alive and happy enough to write a positive evaluation.",
    "Overall, this course was much better than I expected with very dedicated professors, good teaching philosophy and reasonable expectations. STRENGTHS: -Professor Krusberg just came in from Vassar, a liberal arts college with professors actually dedicated to teaching (unlike half of Yales faculty who find their globally irrelevant research more important). She is principled, systematic and dedicated. Other than a PhD in Physics, she has an Education degree from Harvard so she is very educated in the art and skill of education. Many professors at Yale need to educate themselves before they can educate us. Professor Krusberg is part of an emerging exception to that rule because she knows tried and tested pedagogy. A few things she did: diagnostic tests at the beginning and end to assess changes\/learning, no work during breaks, long office hours held closer to main campus rather than Science Hill, a common, structured problem-solving strategy, opportunity to regain 50% of lost marks in exams by submitting corrections, constant feedback about her teaching, reasonable flexibility with deadlines. -Very reasonable workload even though it looks intimidating: reading quizzes most Mondays (except ones around exams or breaks), problem set every week (12 in total but only 10 graded), two midterms and a final. The problem sets varied vastly in length and difficulty. The first two and the one on gravitation were short and easy. Professor Krusberg would also advocate for doing fewer questions better rather than doing too many questions and would reduce our questions to around 7. The average number of questions was probably 9. The average time to complete them was about 4-5 hours and was greatly facilitated by Study Hall every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursdays (3 hours each!); you could probably go to one Study Hall for the entire time and wipe out a problem set. -Slowly decreasing exam difficulty (except the final); the testing becomes easier as the semester progresses this is partly because you understand things better but (I feel) largely because exams and problem sets become less challenging -Collaborative classroom and Study Hall environment. The HLH17 TEAL room does nothing special, I feel. Its probably a poor investment but the round tables are somewhat better than a lecture style classroom setup. I made several friends at my table, debated Physics here and there and could easily participate in class. Clicker questions are always fun. -Study Hall is the foundation of this course. There are normally ~4 TAs there (not very helpful), a lot of equally exasperated and willing-to-help peers and a professor, Professor P! (side note: Professor Ps commitment is unparalleled; he came to every Study Hall 9 hours of the week beyond the classroom time, office hours etc.) I went to Study Hall once most weeks and even the day before the final exam. Side note: problem sets were sometimes quite entertaining with questions about fake koala bears, situations from movies like Gravity\/The Martian, airplane landings. WEAKNESSES: -It may challenge you at times but there is no point if youve overdone these topics in high school. If youve done A Level or AP Physics, I strongly encourage you to do 200 (or 260 but well, thats a stretch). -Thermodynamics skipped -This was Professor Krusbergs first semester and there were many mess-ups. There was a 5% assignment Physics and Society that was never mentioned; it became extra credit in the end. The final diagnostic test didnt actually happen. Scheduled reading quizzes sometimes wouldnt happen. The grading wasnt as transparent and clear as it could have been and most of us worried that either 60% of the class would end up with As or just 10%. Class time management was also a weakness; we couldve done a lot more in the semester. -The final exam was ridiculously hard. It was 3.5 hours and no one left before the end of the exam time it was too long and every single question was unforgiving.",
    "Take it if you need a physics credit for your major. Take it if you don't need a physics credit for your major (the class appeared to be very accessible to nonmajors).",
    "Great class, but also really difficult. Zosia is an AMAZING professor. She really cared about us, and even had a Holiday Party for us at the end of the semester. But only take the class if you have to, because it's still a hassle.",
    "Only take this class if you need to because it's a lot of work and material. Also-the TAs were sort of a hit or miss in helpfulness.",
    "Hard work with people in the class who know everything already.",
    "I would recommend it to another student and would describe it as an in depth foundation in mechanics.",
    "This is just the right workload and depth for someone who has not studied Physics in high school and is looking for an introductory course into Physics.",
    "I would suggest any student take this course.",
    "This is a fantastic introductory physics course. Professor Krusberg is amazing and very responsive to feedback. The content of the lectures is based off of weekly class polls that highlight what people struggled most with in the reading. There are reading quizzes, but they barely factor into your grade, and the majority of points come from the three tests, two of which you are able to revise and the third is scaled. The psets aren't too bad, and the study halls are very helpful. Overall, I was very happy with this class and look would definitely recommend to anyone seeking a solid into physics class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is looking for a general introductory course to physics at the college level. However, if a student has a strong physics background prior to taking this course, I would recommend taking the higher level physics program.",
    "Very difficult course that covers a lot of material.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially to students with very little physics background (like myself) or students who did not have good experiences with science in the past. I will say though that many of my friends who have taken higher level physics in high school such as AP physics C found the course much less challenging than I did, so perhaps students with better backgrounds might opt to take a higher level course than this.",
    "Would definitely recommend. This is pretty much intro physics at Yale, so you probably have to take it. But even if you despised physics in high school, don't be afraid the 180 professors will make sure you have a great time and learn a lot.",
    "This class covers basic mechanics. Nothing too strange or extraordinary about it. Now it's true that for certain people physics may seem incomprehensible but if you stick with it and break things down into the simplest pictures and pieces of information then one should do okay. Special note: we dabbled into Taylor series, differential equations and setting up one dimensional integrals for 2 and 3 dimensional shapes so there's some extra math stuff that it would probably help to have seen once before.",
    "Poorly taught class. Take it if you have to. Krusberg is super sweet but hard to learn from in the classroom because she just doesn't cover that much material in class. The good thing is she is super flexible and willing to change the grading scale, deadlines, etc. based on the pace of the class. The readings are essential for the quizzes but outside of that not that useful for the exams and problem sets. The Psets are hard and require a lot of time at office hours or study hall with the TAs.",
    "Sure. Even if one is not a stem major, one can still benefit a great deal from the problem solving skills developed through approaching physics problems",
    "From what I understand, it is comparable (maybe somewhat tougher, not sure) than AP physics. It is comprised of all introductory topics, but psets and exams can be pretty tricky.",
    "I would recommend taking the section of this class that isn't the lecture (with Professor Krusberg), though the lecture of Professor P is also apparently good. The problem sets are difficult and take some time, but if you go to study halls and\/or office hours you should be able to finish them and master the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who needs a really solid understanding of the basic concepts of physics. I learned a lot in this course. Even though I had already taken advanced placement physics in high school a couple years ago, I really appreciated learning the material in new and challenging ways. I thought the many different approaches\/methods we learned for each type of problem was very useful.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 180 02 for students majoring in STEM who have to take physics and have had some previous experience with the subject. I'd also recommend the class for students who learn more interactively and enjoy discussing things over rather than just listening to a lecture.",
    "Solid physics course with a great professor! Professor Krusberg is awesome, and she is supremely helpful in office hours. Take advantage of office hours and be proactive in learning the material and you will do fine!",
    "Take Phys 180 with Prof. Krusberg. She is an awesome lecturer, and I recommend her especially for anyone who is new to physics or shaky on their physics skills (heads up, AP Physics B is not enough to automatically do well in this class). She uses a mixture of lecture and classwork to go through the concepts, and even if you're somebody who thinks that in class group problems could never work for you shop this class. You would be surprised at how much better the concepts sink in with her methods and at how much happier you'll be when you're not lost in the difficulty of the material within the first five minutes of lecture (a problem that most people who've taken math-intensive or science-intensive courses at Yale have experienced). I really enjoyed physics and the improvement in my thinking skills that I gained with this course, and I am very happy I took it.",
    "Unless you need to take physics or have an incredible interest in it, I wouldn't recommend it. While it is an interesting course and you learn a lot, there would be a lot of unnecessary stress that would come with this class.",
    "I got much better at physics, I would recommend it."
