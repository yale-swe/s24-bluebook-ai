    "I know it's a requirement for the MCDB major, so there's no avoiding it, and it's really important to understand the material, so I wouldn't recommended skipping it and opting for the other MCDB option (Dev Bio), but if you don't have to take it and you're looking for just an interesting bio class, DON'T TAKE THIS! It's brutal, it will murder your Monday nights, and while the material is relevant, unless you're interested in research as a career, you're going to be bored silly with all the technicalities and confused silly by the eighty million names of proteins that all sound the same.",
    "You'll learn a ton. The grading structure is great because the weekly quizzes ensure that you stay on top of the material, especially nice since you get to drop 3 of 11. Read the handouts beforehandand it will make lecture much more interesting.",
    "If you want to understand cell bio, then yes. Simply for fun? Maybe less so.",
    "This class is well taught, although lectures can be a bit boring. There are no midterms, but with a quiz every Tuesday, your Monday nights will be ruined.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it for bio majors! If you're not a bio major, I'd still recommend it because it's a great class but it IS a lot of work so that's something to consider.",
    "depends on whether the person is intellectually and emotionally prepared for the amount of material",
    "The quality of instruction is excellent and the format of the course is optimal. Not to mention that the material is extremely important. The workload is huge, but manageable.",
    "A biology course that disappointed me. Cell bio covers a lot of material. Too much material. Some of it is very interesting but there's just no time to really learn any of it since you just speed on through. Gives you a good understanding of basic cell bio, but it was a truly boring class. The professors make the best of it though, and it's a worthwhile credit. Just painfully boring since you just skim through topic after topic. Quizes only require you to read the packets, and are not graded harshly. Low workload and easy, if you're worried.",
    "Very useful, very interesting.",
    "I mean, I didn't take Dev Bio, but you have to choose between this and that, right? This wasn't bad, and probably is more useful in the majority of other bio courses you'll take than something focused on developmental biology would be.",
    "YES! It is a lot a lot of work but so worth it. The professors are amazing !",
    "This class is a lot of work but you will learn so much and gain a greater appreciation for biology at the cellular level. You definitely need to stay on top of the lecture materials, but the weekly quizzes help you to keep up. I really don't think that the discussion section or lectures were helpful, so I would say you don't have to go. A lot of students only read the handouts and say that reading the textbook is confusing, but I strongly suggest reading the textbook and using the handouts and lectures as guides to show you what to study and what you can skip. The textbook is for the most part well-written and well-illustrated after chapter 6, a good resource in general.",
    "You have to take this as an MCDB major. If you don't have a super strong background in biology, you should definitely take another Yale biology course before this one. It's a lot of work, and your Mondays will be entirely consumed by studying for these quizzes. However, you learn a lot.",
    "Only if you are interested in Cell Biology and are willing to give up Monday Nights to quiz studying.",
    "Cell Biology is one of those classes that you put so much effort into, and in the end you actually feel like you've learned something! It's very much a memorization and comprehensive material class as opposed to more pset related questions. We have weekly quizzes, which I like because that at least makes sure that I keep up with the material relatively on time.",
    "So this or Developmental is a requirement for the MCDB major. I was seriously considering between the two, but I'm truly glad I took Cell Bio over Devo. (As far as I could tell from my suitemate, Devo had only about 7-10 kids in the class, so I can only imagine what the curve is like. Cell Bio was relatively large.) This is definitely a demanding course since there is just so much information to absorb. But Pollard has set up an ingenious system with study packets for each section of the textbook (and believe me, you go through nearly all of the 900+ pages). The professors for the most part are helpful and clear in what you need to know and the TAs are very encouraging (Elise is probably the best TA I've ever had. You have 12 weekly quizzes, of which 9 count and a final. I was petrified of the final since there was just so much information (I keep repeating this because I mean it). The final, however, was extremely fair and not nit picky or detail-oriented at all. All in all, I generally enjoy cell biology and this class did not disappoint. Definitely consider this over Developmental, but keep this amount of work in mind though when you are planning out the rest of your semester.",
    "This class was not as terrible as everyone made it seem. The weekly quizzes were annoying and a lot to study for every week, but going into the final I was so thankful we had weekly quizzes all along. The pure amount of the material we need to master is just daunting.",
    "Yes. You learn SO MUCH and the fact that all the material you learn pertains to one tiny tiny cell is so fascinating. The class leaves you with a great foundation of cell biology and gives you no surprises. Although, the final can creep up on you so definitely start studying the material WAY ahead of time since there are no midterms to keep you in check. Use the packets to study for quizzes and supplement with the book for when you need to visualize something or understand it better (book has great figures and more detailed explanations).",
    "It's a tough class but it's all fundamental stuff for any biology major. Even MBB students should take the class. It's hard but worth it.",
    "Both an introduction and foray into to cell biology, huge amount of information but great way to be immersed in it, time-consuming quiz preparation each week, but so much learning if you put in the effort",
    "Take it. You might regret it later if you don't stay on top of your work. But take it. Amazing class. All three lecturers are very competent at what they do and have a lot of knowledge on the topics they are presenting. Quizzes are a good study motivator, otherwise it's easy to neglect the readings and handouts. You might be able to get away with skimming the readings if you don't have the time to read. The handouts they provide for each lecture are a lifesaver. FORM A STUDY GROUP. Conventional wisdom says don't take this class with other intense classes but it's manageable if you keep up with the work (e.g. cell bio + orgo II is doable, you could even throw in another science\/QR if necessary). Also sometimes Pollard gets really excited about things and it's wonderful.",
    "A lot of work, but definitely useful information. Studying for quizzes each week often takes 7 to 8 hours. One of the quiz questions (you're given a choice between two) tends to come from each of the two lectures being tested. No midterms but a final at the end.",
    "Either this class got easier, or people really overhyped how difficult it is. Going over the handouts on Sunday and Monday night is enough to do well on the quizzes, and reading the textbook is a total waste of time. I found weekly quizzes to be a lot more chill than having midterms. Overall, the subject material was really interesting and you should do well if you dedicate the few hours it takes to go over the handouts. The class quiz average was around a 9\/10 (after dropping the lowest three quizzes), so I'm not alone in this.",
    "A lot of work but you learn so much",
    "YES! It's an amazing class, one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you plan on doing research, this class really helps you understand what you do in lab. It's tons of material, but it's very interesting and concept based, so it is not that difficult to learn and memorize.",
    "Take it because it's interesting, but be warned. It's a LOT of information, and the weekly quizzes can be overwhelming. The problem is that you have to learn how to study for this class--what method worst best for you-- and use that to do well. Hopefully you figure that out sooner than I did!",
    "I liked this class because it was organized. The book corresponded with the lectures, I never had any doubts about what material we were supposed to know, and the lecturing was decent.Lots of people complain about the quizzes, but I liked them because it forced me to learn the material. That way when the final came around, it was easy to study. Also, if you've taken MB&B biochem (300& 301) before this, the class will be a breeze.",
    "You probably do have to take this, but if you put in the time the material is very interesting. The lectures are pretty boring and are really early in the morning, so not particularly worth going since everything you need are on the powerpoints and handouts. The class is pretty fair, but you do have to devote a chunk of time. Ask around and try to get a good TA. It's very well organized and you know what you're gonna get on the final because they are the same as the quizzes. As long as you put the time in it should be fine.",
    "Cell is necessary if you want to go further in bio, either as a doctor or as a researcher. This is the class that will make you feel like you can read whatever journal articles come your way or understand the work of different labs around Yale. It is definitely a lot of work but once you get into a weekly rhythm, it should be manageable. During the semester, I had a love-hate relationship with the class, but I am now extremely glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend Cell Biology, aka Packet Memorization 101. This class is a good overview of cell biology. To succeed, all you must be able to do is memorize and understand the packets (\"CB's) that are handed out each week. Don't worry about the lectures, and don't bother with the textbook. Just learn the packet and all will be well, and you will learn a great deal.",
    "Cell Biology is one of the best courses I have taken here at Yale, and the first \u00e2\u0080\u009cprereq\u00e2\u0080\u009d for my major that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve truly enjoyed. Be warned though, it is a LOT of work. You have a quiz every week, and you cover enough material that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effectively a miniature midterm every Tuesday (you usually cover about 2-3 chapters of the textbook each week). The good thing about this is that you know your grade almost immediately (oh and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no curve). Nevertheless, you will find that by the end of the semester you know SO MUCH about the cell. I think this is the only (science) course that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve takenthat literally covers the entire book, cover to cover. Not only that, Prof. Pollard is absolutely amazing (and he literally wrote the book on cell bio). Just as an FYI though, sit really close (like first row close) or you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to hear anything, as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit soft spoken. The other professors (King and Horsley) are also very good as well, and they present a nice mixup, if that makes sense.Overall, this was a great class. I would heartily recommend it to any science major.One last thing: google \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Inner Life of the Cell\u00e2\u0080\u009d and watch it. After taking this course, you will be able to identify and explain everything in that video.",
    "This course is very comprehensive, and the weekly quizzes are fair. It's important to be on top of your stuff, since there is no midterm and only a final.",
    "Great class take it",
    "I only got a lot out of the second half, where I basically gave up Sunday nights and Mondays to cell bio studying. Stuff comes together in the second half, but the first half seems very disjointed.I honestly don't know if I would recommend it to another classmate. Take it if you're up for a challenge, but don't expect it to be 100% engaging or fun.",
    "I think the makeup of this class definitely changed this year now that the freshmen all have to take the intro bio sequence. I.e. far fewer clueless freshmen in the class, mostly sophomores.I was a junior, and had already taken two semesters of biochemistry so there was a lot of overlap in the material. Overall, just prepare for the quizes, remember everything. Know everything.",
    "Having taken BIOL 102, I felt very prepared for this class. I learned a ton and it was totally worth it. Advice: even if you're doing well on the quizes, don't blow off studying for the final.",
    "Definitely. The material may be a lot, but you learn so much by the end. If you want to find a course where you really engage biology in-depth, this is the course.",
    "It's not that bad, really! There's a ton of material, but studying for the weekly quizzes and slowly digesting the material is much more manageable (and seems like a more organic way to learn) than cramming for one midterm in the middle of the semester. The professors present the class as a chance to immerse yourself in cell biology, and realistically, it's almost impossible to learn and retain every single thing that's taught. But it's the overarching concepts that really matter the most, so try to focus on those, because they'll be the most useful anyway in future classes.",
    "Yes definitely take it! This will hands down be one of the most useful classes you'll take at Yale if you are a bio major. Try to avoid frantic note taking- listening to lectures will be more useful, and the book\/lecture notes are more than enough for reading purposes. Keep going to class and section- you should hear the material before you start to study.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It's too much material and not interesting enough.",
    "This was a solid class that I would recommend to any bio major. The only problem is that there is A LOT of material, so you have to plan your schedule so that you can devote enough time to the class. Once you've completed the course, though, you'll be amazed by how much you've learned.",
    "I don't know what other people may have told you about cell bio, but I'm going to tell you this: CELL BIO IS A LOT MORE WORK THAN YOU THINK IT IS. The professors in this class are great, and lectures are well organized. The entire course is very precisely structured, with outlines and study guides provided for each lecture. That being said, the independent reading that you will have to do in this class is mind-bogglingly overwhelming. Do not take this class unless you will have a good 6 hours a week to get through the necessary readings and another couple hours to study for the quiz every Tuesday. You will be tempted to fall behind in the reading and simply go off of the lecture outlines. Don't do it. You won't learn a single thing, and you won't remember anything when the exam (worth 40% of your grade) rolls around. All this is not to detract, however, from the fact that cell bio is on the whole a good class. The material is engaging, the professors charismatic, and the assessments well planned and organized. This class, however, is very, very hard. If you're thinking about taking it... consider who else is going to be taking it: every other premed at Yale. The average on the quizzes is supposedly a 9\/10. Get stuck with a tough TA and you're suddenly waaaay below the curve.",
    "A class every bio major should take. Pollard is an amazing, walking encyclopedia. The class is incredibly well-organized. Don't let the weekly quizzes put you off: there are 12 of them, you drop the worst 3, and they're worth 60% of the grade. So they're worth the effort, and less painful than midterms. After cell bio you'll feel like you know a ton about biology!",
    "This class is all about the basics of cell biology covering everything from DNA to cellular movement and it does a great job connecting it all together. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in biology, as it is a great intro course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was a little worried going into it that it might be too much for me, but it was very manageable and I learned so much. It really reminded me why I love biology.",
    "MCDB 205 is a solid intermediate course and I recommend it to all Bio majors. MCDB 205 teaches you how to think like a scientist, even though you won't remember more than half of the material covered in lecture.",
    "This a great class and you will learn so much, but be prepared for some serious work and stress. After taking it, I feel like a true biology major.",
    "One of the most organized science courses; approachable, engaging professors; a lot of material, but course does a great job of giving a bigger picture;I would suggest staying on top of material because it adds up quickly, but does come together at end of course; although Pollard mumbles a bit, he gives very clear and concise explanations - he makes sure to engage students with real-world applications, his experiences as a doctor\/researcher, and questions for the classroom; Pollard, Horsley, and King are all passionate about what they teach and it definitely comes across in their lectures with student engagement both during and outside of class"
