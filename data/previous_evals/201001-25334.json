    "This course really helps improve your abilities to read and write in Kiswahili. We wrote a longer composition than we ever did in first semester, and I found it much easier to write after learning about noun classes. The layout is very similar to first semester. Take it!",
    "Take it-it's a lot of fun, and not too hard. Just be aware of not challenging authority at all, as it upsets the professors, and could change your experience.",
    "Swahili is a great language to take. It's a lot less work than other language classes at Yale (from what I've heard), but you still learn a lot. The language itself isn't all that difficult, and Yale has good resources for summer work in East Africa. I definitely recommend considering Swahili.",
    "In L2 you learn a lot of new grammatical structures, but my speaking barely improved from L1. I would try to find a language partner to get anything out of the course.",
    "Don't take this unless you really want to learn Swahili... if you're just hoping for an easy language this is not the class for you."
