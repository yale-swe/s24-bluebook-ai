    "One of the most valuable in the HMP concentration. Would like to have seen more quantskills integrated (ROIs, NPVs, financials, advertising spend - things we've learned and should be integrating at this point). Decent mix of non-hospital cases, better than expected. Maybe in the future add cases on physician group practices, more non-profits or government.",
    "The course covered a variety of topics that we had not seen elsewhere at YSPH or SOM (innovation, HR) and did so in settings other than delivery. The two presentations were great in that they encompassed group work, powerpoint skills and content. I wish we had gotten opportunities such as these earlier in our time at YSPH.",
    "Strength = student involvement and presentationsWeakness= too much of class discussion seemed like regurgitation of cases. wish we had spent more time talking about the stuff on dr. nembhard's slides (i would have learned more)",
    "Good class, good instructor. Not enough concrete skills were taught.",
    "Great course - I really took a lot from the case-study pedagogy. You learn about a lot of interesting organizational issues across different aspects of health care. Ingrid does a good job of trying to hit lots of different sub-industries: pharmaceuticals, hospital admin, global health delivery, medical technology etc. It's really impressive.One suggestion I'd make (which would not be well received among my peers) is to have a quiz or two. Ingrid assigns great readings, that we never really discuss in detail or use so there is little incentive to do the reading.Group projects were great and I thought the Board Presentation was EXTREMELY helpful. I think I was in the minority that thought the dramatic interruptions etc. were appropriate and good ways to prepare for worst case scenario.",
    "the case study format is very practical",
    "A few lecture-based classes would be nice.",
    "very good info and pertinant skills gained",
    "the course might been interesting had i not taken Ingrid's course last year, leadership and organizational behavior. the two classes were really similar in the subjects covered and the way the course was conducted. since this is a course to integrate all of the material we learned over the course of this MPH program, i think that more of the techniques we learned should be employed, rather than relying more broadly on critical thinking.",
    "Great",
    "Strengths: I like that it was case-based (more health classes should be) and the instructor is knowledgeable in health management concepts. It was just the right size of people and the workload was fair.Weaknesses: There was nothing fantastic about the class and it should not be from 5-7pm."

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0I never knew her middle name! Anyway, Ingrid is without a doubt the best professor in YSPH. Extremely responsive to students, answers emails quickly and is genuinely invested in our development. A caring, brilliant individual. LOVE case based learning - please tell me why all YSPH classes are not also delivered in this format???",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid knows her stuff and teaches with cases. She makes students participate while keeping the discussion on track. I wish she would make us defend ourselves a bit more when making assertions though, sometimes things just got into making lists out of the case and not providing insights.I wish she incorporated more lecture material into the course. We typically spent 100 minutes on thecase and 10 on the readings\/lecture. I would like to see a bit more of a balance which could be driven by cutting down on listing facts from the case.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Only positive things can be said about Ingrid. She's very interested in getting everyone involved and interested and is extremely receptive to student feedback, comments, and discussion.",

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0interesting discussions and teaching points",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0she is great. she brings a good energy to the conversations.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0She knows her health management concepts and can answer questions. She's welcoming and respectful of students. I think she should toughen up on us a bit, though."

   "comments": [
    "A fitting cap to the HMP track. A bit of overlap with the leadership and org behavior course from last year, but I understand the circumstances. Lacking in quant requirements, which would have been nice to reinforce.The board presentations are key! Please don't take them away just because students find them unpleasant. The degree is already too easy and to eliminate this would really water down the depth and quality of the capstone.",
    "This course is more of what you picture when you say you are doing a program in health management. More should be like it.",
    "This is a strong course taught by a strong professor. I think the content of the course, both readings and assignments, is well-designed. Ingrid does a good job making students feel comfortable participating. The only real weakness was the lack of focus\/rigor in looking at some of the concepts, which I think will always happen at times in seminar classes. I would have liked to see Ingrid push a little harder to concepts proposed by students, rather than simply writing them on the board as part of an expanding paradigm for the given topic (that, by the end of a class, would sometimes be too broad and full of business lingo generally). Despite this criticism though, the course was generally strong, and I enjoyed it almost every week.",
    "Excellent class.",
    "very applicable to my future career goals.",
    "its a required course for everyone in HMP so i would recommend it.",
    "Great",
    "It's a case-based class that spends a lot of time investigating different management concepts. There are readings for each class. It's a great size for the format and you will feel comfortable participating. The group projects are helpful, but there arealso two independent write-ups."
