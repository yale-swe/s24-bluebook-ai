    "I would recommend this class, with the caveat to make sure to check in on the first day of shopping week. Professor Zarin has a very idiomatic teaching style and I'm sure that she'd agree that it's not for everyone. That said, I took the class, worked hard on each essay, and loved it!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "English 466 offers a good excuse to write \u00e2\u0080\u0093 five essays of increasing length and an edited version of one at the end. I found the requirement to write to word counts quite restricting, but maybe you would like that. Professor Zarin's comments are pretty vague and she is pushy one-on-one, both conditions which I found to be frustrating. Other people seemed not to mind as much. Discussion is lively \u00e2\u0080\u0093 expect to be cold called \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0which is nice, and class feedback on students' essays was well-balanced.",
    "An opportunity to learn from a thoughtful and talented writing professor. The class suffers sometimes from lack of structure, but there are many valuable opportunities to learn one-on-one with Prof Zarin."
