   "comments": [
    "Take it. took this class credit\/D and should have switched it. Not too much work and very interesting.",
    "Absolutely recommended. You won't regret it!",
    "Yes! Take this class! Sure, the TFs may have no more knowledge of the material than you will if you do the readings, but Prof. Kim is an absolutely delightful lecturer, the material is wonderfully engaging, and the workload\/memorization is minimal. I emerged with a clearer understanding of one of the world's largest religions and how that religiosity manifested in art, and I loved it you will too.",
    "Great class. Worth it. Go to lecture, but the readings are optional. Exams are really doable if you go to class, and section is great, definitely take it.",
    "This class is excellent. Take it if you're interested in Buddhism, the histories of East and Southeast Asia, stunning religious art, sculpture, cosmology...or if you're just looking for a cool class. Professor Kim is wonderful - always approachable and an engaging lecturer. The reading is light and the exams are straightforward\/not bad. The course ends with a paper on the artwork of your choice, which was a fun exercise.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students as an introduction to art and history in Asia or art historical techniques in general. The class focuses on iconography and is very unsatisfying for anyone looking for a deeper understanding of any period or country that the class covers. There was no explanation of how Buddhism worked within the societies it developed in - no explanation of social division (class, religious, ethnic, gender) and how that might have influenced the religious forms that developed in various places and times. Professor Kim and the TAs were wonderful and I often felt happy in class. Most of the semester had a light workload but watch out for the final and research paper at the end.",
    "This is a really fun class to take and learn about something most people probably don't know much about. I found it really interesting and I plan on taking more similar classes later on.",
    "Absolutely absolutely take this course! Interesting and fun in a low-stress and academic environment.",
    "Yes, take Buddhism Art class if you're interested!",
    "HSAR 142 is a rewarding class-- you come out of it knowing a lot about Buddhist art, and I think the best part of it is visiting the Yale Art Gallery during sections.",
    "A great introduction to Buddhist Art History and buddhist religion. Not to hard, the reading and work was very manageable. Take this class.",
    "Recommended. Pretty light workload and still interesting. I took this class because I wanted to learn about a totally new area of art history, and this was good.",
    "A good, interesting, low stress course which was really fun and a great intro to buddhist art and art history as a whole.",
    "Chill class, look at Buddhist art. Not much work involved, but I learned plenty.",
    "Same answer I gave to question 1, but additionally would recommend to anyone who has never taken an art history course and has interest in Buddhism.",
    "This was an amazing class. You learn so much by the end of it, but it isn't stressful at all. It was enjoyable and fun but seriously cool. The lessons have a lot of structure to them, which is helpful especially when you have a lot of classes that are seminars. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND, even if you never found yourself wondering about Buddhist art, it is super interesting and not overwhelming. Professor Youn-mi Kim is my favorite professor! She is attentive, sweet, extremely knowledgeable, and overall amazing. She carefully structures lessons to have as much information as possible each day, but it is never overwhelming or difficult to follow. She is extremely passionate about the subject and never fails to show it. The TAs were wonderful, and the work was not demanding, but very helpful in gaining a holistic knowledge of classic Buddhist artwork.",
    "A fun, easier class to take. Highly recommend it, because you do learn a lot about other religions and where they stem from.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Every lecture with Prof. Kim felt like a storytelling session. I learned so much and see Buddhist art in a new light.",
    "Wonderful introduction into Buddhist Art. It is not esoteric or heavy, but a great way to discovery the beauty and history of this type of art."
