   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course was fine.",
    "The course should be excellent, because the topics are great and its our only chance at YSPH to learn this stuff. The lectures themselves are a bit tedious and could be more compelling and engaging.",
    "My overall feelings are mixed.Even though it's an HPA course that supposed to examine policies affecting women and children, for the first half of the semester it was more of a clinical midwifery\/ maternal health course. Mary Alice was very knowledgeable about these topics, but more time on the policy components would improve the class.Also, maybe allow students to pick their own topics for the second paper rather than be assigned one of the existing topics. (And allow the topic to be about the health of women AND CHILDREN, not just women).",
    "This course is horrible. While the syllabus appeared interesting, the professor really did nothing to try to engage us in discussion.",
    "I think this course did a relatively good job providing an introduction to policies impacting women and children. I think it may function better by organizing around particular policy strategies vs. particular diseases. The section on Emergency medicine was extremely interesting, however, so I would certainly keep that section in the course. Perhaps there could also be sections lumping acute then chronic conditions.In terms of the workload, this course is very back heavy with most of our work being done toward the end of the course. We have both a 20 page paper and a final exam a week apart, while in the beginning of the semester we also had a time-consuming assignment. I would definitely recommend keeping the first assignment on different countries, but only having a final paper at the end of the course, or a take-home final. I think this class is not designed to have an in-class test because the purpose is to learn policy approaches to address the health of women and children, which can be more thoughtfully articulated in a paper format.",
    "This is a very basic, introductory class. The info is sort of interesting but is presented in a sort of undifferentiated stream of powerpoint slides. The interactive classes were a bit better, especially as a number of the students had related work experiences. Mainly it seemed like a recitation of facts. Would have been much more interesting as a policy (or epi, or. . .) class.",
    "There were some lectures in this class that were really informative, interesting, and important (e.g., Medicaid, health care reform, reproductive health), but then there were others that I felt like could have easily been combined (e.g., oral health, pediatric asthma). I feel like there could have been so many other topics that could have been addressed that weren't, and it felt like Dr. Lee didn't know what other material (if any) to include. A few public health schools have concentrations in Maternal Child Health (I know that Boston University has one) -- I think it would be helpful to look at some of those course descriptions and incorporate some other things.Additionally, the major projects were not well-timed. Having a final paper AND final exam is too much, particularly when the only other assignment of the semester was the fact sheet (which took forever, and was interesting for a couple of hours and then got tedious). I would consider breaking the class into thirds; make the fact sheet due after the first third, the paper due after the second third, and then the final exam at the end.",
    "seemed a little too wide-scoped and disjointed. The topic was not presented in a way that made it interesting to me, even though I am interested in the topic. I was unclear of the expectations for the assignments and was not sure what I was expected to take away from the class. The assignments were not explained well before hand and I found it difficult to prepare for the final without sample questions or some kind of study guide.",
    "Strengths: I liked the real-world applicability of this course with regard to the assignments. It is really helpful to hear and learn about what is typically expected in health policy briefs, etc.Weaknesses: It would be good to be more selective with the readings, choosing only those that are really helpful and relevant.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course and the lectures. I learned a lot about public health policies specifically for women and children and expounded on knowledge I had gained from previous work and internship experiences in that field. I did feel that the expectations for the two large assignments and the final exam were not entirely clear. I felt like I learned the material well, but when it came to the assignments, I just don't have a policy mindset, so I didn't do very well on them. So, if you are not a health policy person, this course might be VERY demanding for you.",
    "The wealth of information delivered in the lectures is at times overwhelming and being a two hour course there needs to be a break. Also, there are ways to make the material more interactive because some of it is a little dry. The course would benefit from having a midterm and a final instead of a final exam that encompasses the entire course. The midterm could focus on the first half of the class and be multiple choice\/short answer. The final could be more thought provoking and essay format. It is also overwhelming to have 80% of the grade be based on two reports that are so different from one another. It was difficult to apply the comments\/feedback since the reports were very different and the expectations were not as clear for the first report as to who the audience was. If given the chance to participate more, the class grade can incorporate that and it would be great to have a debate\/discussion of the health reform issues.",
    "More discussion, more inclusion of readings",
    "The course material covers a wide variety of topics that are important for anyone considering a career in maternal and child health.However, the course structure could be improved. We had a 10 page single-spaced paper due during reading week. In my experience, other courses only have papers due during reading week if they are a take-home final exam. However, we had a final exam a week later.",
    "The class provided a comprehensive assessment of programs for women and children, and the history of the programs and policies. It also provided an opportunity to create products like policy papers and fact reports that students would be expected to produce in real world settings, which was helpful. I wish that there was a strong focus on local program efforts, in addition to federal programs. I felt as that the course was very federally focused."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Professor Lee was very enthusiastic and responsive.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Very organized instructor. Very good at getting feedback to you promptly. Knows her subject inside and out.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice Lee has about the worst delivery of any professor I've taken classes with at EPH; she cannot facilitate discussion. She seems uncomfortable in front of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She is definitely knowledgeable on the subject. Did not provide much feedback on the first assignments and did not provide much preparation around the exam. I appreciate that she always comes prepared with class notes and handouts to demonstrate different points. She also gave great strategies for researching policy issues. I would recommend that she section the class into an hour of lecture and an hour of discussion. I think that this would make people pay more attention to the readings, as well as give us an opportunity to start to think critically about these issues. The two hour lecture also is a lot to absorb when there is no time or space to discuss and frame our own thinking on the topic. People also had some great in-class questions that could have lead to discussion, but most of the time the Professor would answer the question then move on with the slides instead of dwelling more on individual contributions.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Is clearly not a professor. Occasionally, her extensive experience in the area shone through, but mainly it seemed like a recitation of facts.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She's clearly very knowledgeable, and knows the area very well. Personality-wise, though, I had some issues. Before the final exam, she talked about our final papers and some general comments she had, and she called out certain people for doing particularly good jobs. That's kind of a lose-lose situation -- if you get named, you feel really awkward, and if you don't, you feel like you screwed something up. Not a good way to go into an exam.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Very nice and approachable. Would have been nice if she would provide previous work examples for the assignments; her expectations for what she wanted was a little unclear.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Dr. Lee was incredibly knowledgeable about health policy of women and children and brought a lot of good examples from her own experience as a nurse-midwife and child health advocate. The lectures were very interesting, but she didn't leave very much room for discussion, which I expected there to be in a small seminar class like this one. I would have liked to have more direction in how to do the big assignments before they were due, like having an outline due beforehand where she can give us some direction for the assignment because I felt that the expectations were somewhat unclear.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0The instructor was thorough and always well prepared.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Very enthusiastic, inspires interest in material",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice is a very nice and knowledgeable professor. She knows all the material very well. She explained each topic thoroughly and responded well to student questions.However, her grading for papers was largely unfair and unexpected. The second paper assigned health topics to the class and asked each student to cover a large span of information on each topic (which would be reasonable except for the fact that there was not information available on all of the assigned topics). It seems unfair to assign topics where a dearth of information is available and have the student's grade suffer as a result.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Dr. Lee's knowledge and experience in MCH policy as well as her obvious heart for Connecticut's underserved women and children made this course both very stimulating and very enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0It was very clear that Professor Lee was extremely passionate about the health of women and children; this passion really was apparent in all of her lectures. Professor Lee was also very encouraging of class participation and professional development.It would have been helpful if Professor Lee provided more detailed expectations of what she wanted of final projects, especially pertaining to grammar and writing style. It also would have been nice to have examples offinal products posted on the class website."

If you are looking for a discussion or deeper understanding of specific policy strategies or ways of thinking about these issues than I would suggest finding another course.",
    "easy; won't learn much unless you're seriously motivated.",
    "Not a ton of work, somewhat interesting. Learned some, but perhaps not quite as much as I have in other classes at YSPH.",
    "I think this is a great course for anyone even remotely interested in maternal and child health, but I think it is a much more difficult course for those who are not health policy-minded (like myself). I am grateful for the knowledge I gained from this course, but it kind of turned me off from taking any more health policy courses. So, I would recommend this course, but would do so with the disclamer that it might not align exactly with your interests and expertise.",
    "This is an intensive policy course looking at issues for women and children in the US.",
    "The course was very good. I would recommend it to students interested in maternal and child health.",
    "Excellent review of the history and current state of MCH-related policy in the U.S.",
    "This course provides a very detailed overview of the history and current reform of health policies and programs specifically relating to women and children. The course also provides a clinical perspective on health issues that are relevant to this particular patient population.You will have the opportunity to create professional products that you would be expected to produce in a real life health organization or policy advocacy center. It is predominately lecture and paper based with extensive readings."
