   "comments": [
    "This course is poorly taught. It is a flipped classroom so most instruction is expected to come through the online videos, however these videos are not nearly as thorough as they should be--they barely teach what is necessary to get through the homework (or the online quizzes that are due each class session). There is no reinforcement of the material \"learned\" and class time is spent on example problems where Professor Rosenthal often got confused or did incorrectly. If at all possible, I would avoid taking this course. Unfortunately, it's required for the Economics and EP&E majors.",
    "I literally don't even know what I learned, but I also suck at math.",
    "Better understanding of calculus, a lot of practice with series..",
    "From the course I able to improve my understanding of basic calculus and explore new concepts in single variable calculus.",
    "Not a lot.",
    "I built a very solid foundation in Calc!",
    "I learned what calculus can be applied to in life, and... calculus.",
    "This course provided me with a ride range of new mathematical skills, reinforced and improved my understanding of skills gained in lower-level math classes, and generally strengthened my appreciation for mathematics and it's applications."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are no strengths to the format of this course. The flipped classroom is the weakness.",
    "The quizzes sucked, the videos were good. The questions with the check boxes, and it was like, check multiple, but then it wouldn't tell you which were right and which were wrong? Baddd :( Also, sometimes on the tests questions were structured such that you ahd to get the first part right to answer the following portions, and I'd not know how to do the first part, but know how to do the next part, and it made me sad. Aren't you not supposed to write tests like that? D:",
    "I don't think reverse classroom is an effective way to teach this course because learning the initial information through a video as opposed to an in-person instructor discourages students from asking questions. While the first half of the course was fine, learning sequences and series was a bit difficult to grasp conceptually because it is something that we have to learn through working through problems. I don't think the videos built a solid enough foundation for that, so the cycle of confusion just gets exacerbated in class.",
    "The structure of the math department is truly ridiculous. Five section with different professors take the same exams. While the class is not that difficult, the professor you have determines a lot of whether you sink or swim. If you are here, you probably have to take the course and it's not bad, but definitely could be better. The videos are very helpful and so a great job of introducing the material. The class focuses on conceptually teaching you calculus rather than just throwing difficult problems at you which I appreciated.",
    "Strengths: the videos definitely helped me understand the material Weaknesses: practice problems assigned were fairly easy and straightforward, but problems on tests were super difficult and didn't resemble anything done in class",
    "There was a lot of focus on series, while not that much focus on integration, and other aspects like polar coordinates, or parametrics. I think that integration is more helpful for engineering.",
    "The reverse classroom technique made it easier to learn the concepts by giving you exposure to them beforehand and using class time to clarify and answer questions, making class time more productive. However, the course did not offer enough practice problems that that matched the level of difficulty of those on midterms and on the final.",
    "Not a well taught course. They expected you to already know the material without teaching it.",
    "A major weakness is the flipped classroom style. Didn't learn anything in the class because of it. Thank god I took calculus in high school.",
    "Sometimes the teaching felt as though it could be improved itself. Mistakes were made that at times confused us all further.",
    "The videos are somewhat helpful but do not match the difficulty of the class which can be frustrating at times.",
    "The videos were helpful and I thought that the combination of videos, online homework, problem sets, and class lessons was well organizaed. I also appreciated the multiple tries allowed for online homework questions because it makes sense that not all new lessons will be immediately understood, so these questions allow an opportunity for learning and practice without the pressure of needing to get them right on the first try. Meanwhile, the weekly problem sets were an opportunity to show mastery of the same topics. A weakness is that the exams, particularly the second midterm and final, included questions that were very difficult compared to some of the other work done during the course. I understand the need for a level of difficulty, but I know that many students who worked hard throughout the semester felt extremely stressed about these exams.",
    "The math videos were helpful, but the professor was horrible.",
    "The exams are much harder than any of the problems done in class or on homework assignments."

   "comments": [
    "I certainly would not recommend this course to another student. It is not conducive to learning the material. The material is poorly taught and there is no sympathy for your grade even when the entire class is doing poorly.",
    "I've you've taken AP calc in high school, you, along with 90% of your peers, will likely be fine. If not, hold onto your panties because life is about to be R O U G H. Yale just can't teach math, not sure why :( This class sucked though. Maybe take calc at a community college over the summer or something? I didn't take calc in high school, started in 112 here, got wrecked by all the kids who took AB, then tried to take 115 and got wrecked by all the kids who took BC. Nobody wants to take 120 because it sucks, and Yale doesn't incetivize use of AP credits, so the math sequence is forever doomed to screw the little guy (aka the kid who didn't know to take calc in high school). Maybe you'll be fine if you're really good at math. I hope you will be. That just wasn't my experience.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is a requirement or a necessary prerequisite. Otherwise, no.",
    "Avoid if you can",
    "No I would not. Do not take it unless you need to.",
    "Yes",
    "It's required for somethings, and useful in life, so the subject material is something I would recommend to students for the sake of that knowledge.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone unless they had to take the course. Many of the students in the course have already taken similar courses in high school, which leaves students like myself, who were not lucky enough to have those opportunities, behind the curve. The peer tutors are helpful, but the classes are not helpful to help close the gap between students familiar with the material and those who are actually learning Calc II for the first time.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in mathematics of any form, but only if they were serious about putting in the necessary effort.",
    "If you do not have to take this class, I would not take it. It is very difficult and the exams are much harder than the homework."
