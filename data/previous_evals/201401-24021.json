There are justice implications in every decision made in any field so it is crucial for people to be aware of EJ in their own work!1,2,3--the readings were perfect and really helped show many components of EJ. the reading responses were great to have us do so we could reflect on the readings and get more out of them and make connections. And the student presentations were an excellent additions. Everything felt very equal--not a professor giving us lectures but rather everyone was able and comfortable to talk about what their thoughts and interpretations. Great class!!!"

    "I thought our class formed a great discussion group, which was facilitated well by Prof. Doolittle. We were able to be honest about the challenges and contradictions of understanding and acting on issues of environmental justice. Furthermore, we were able to develop our knowledge into a disseminate-able form through the class website that was our collective final project.",
    "It was a rigorous exploration of topics I had come across but not delved into. It was also focused on communicating the questions, principles, and solutions to a non-justice-focused audience, which I think is really important.",
    "The lively discussions and response papers stimulate students to get deeper into the subjects.",
    "Perspectives on Environmental Injustices helped me learn so much about environmental justice movements and issues nationally and internationally. The theory was very rich and to me revelatory. Yet we also read about research and learned about many lived experiences that illustrated the concepts we worked on. This is an incredibly important and well-rounded class. Class discussions were all at a high level and provided an environment that was challenging and safe for participants.",
    "How equal it was--not just a professor giving lecturesI really appreciated how everyone had done the readings and then contributed to discussion. It was never forced or lacking in conversation. We had great dialogue!"

    "It would have been great to have interacted with more EJ activists, and to have had field trips to interact with actual EJ groups. This might be overloading the course (and be too much for it to do), but it would also be great to be able to do some skills training around how to incorporate justice concerns into environmental impact assessments, or to learn more concrete methods about community-based participatory research.",
    "This course was all-around excellent! This year was the first that students created a website as a final project, so I predict that in the future that project will be even more smooth.",
    "None--other than how to get more people interested."

    "I am really focused on environmental justice issues internationally, so it gave me a space to explore those more rigorously, as well as to learn more about the domestic EJ considerations.",
    "I think this course is essential for me as a student who plans on working in an environmental field. For me it serves as a way to learn about how environmentalism plays out in people's lives; it describes many key issues and also little-discussed struggles of populations who are not always given enough time in discussions.",
    "EJ is relevant to absolutely every field of study and area of work! More people without previous work and interest in the topic need to take the course, especially!"
