   "comments": [
    "Bien sur! Prenez-le!",
    "FREN 140 is a lot of work, but it's really worthwhile. Skorupa is a great instructor, and I highly recommend continuing your studies with her!",
    "Definitely! The material is great; L4 is where you make the big leap, don't hesitate!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course for someone who is interesting in continuing their French skills. You have the opportunity to read some great stories and books as well as improve your grammar and writing skills.",
    "It's an average Yale language class.",
    "This is the perfect class for a student whose French proficiency is decent and who is looking for an introduction to more advanced grammatical concepts. It is also good for people interested in francophone cultures around the world, particularly in Africa. I would say this class is a great transition between basic French and more advanced literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course! Yale's French Department is known as one of the best, and this course seems to exemplify that. I heard wonderful things about all the professors who taught this course, and I can say that Professor Skorupa was absolutely amazing -accessible, quick to understand student questions, kind, and extremely encouraging. There is a constant (but by no means overwhelming) workload, but this constancy is necessary to promote practice and reinforce the material. It was a wonderful experience, and I'll certainly be continuing with French in the future.",
    "This course will help in all areas of French, particularly in writing. You will learn a lot more grammar than in French 130.",
    "If you are trying to improve your level of French, Take 140. The class is worth it",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The material is very interesting and the vocabulary and grammar is very helpful. There is a decent amount of new material and it is important to stay on top of the reading, but the demands of the class are very reasonable and if you work hard you can definitely get a lot out of it."
