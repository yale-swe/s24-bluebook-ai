   "comments": [
    "This course was overall good, but with unequal parts.First the bad: Ach taught this course seminar-style, every Tue from 5-8pm. The pace was excruciatingly slow at times, making it very difficult for me to keep my concentration. He may have spent up to 20 mins per slide, because he took unlimited questions and tried to discuss every issue with the students. Whilst some students had interesting things to say, that was too tiring for some of us. In such a large group, I think Ach should be teaching lecture-style, i.e. go over his topics and have some discussion at the end.The good aspects: the guest lectures were very interesting, the topics Ach covered were interesting too (as long as I could keep my eyes open because of the slow pace). I enjoyed very much the case studies and I believe by discussing the issues with my group, I learned a lot during them.Overall, I think this was a good course, but it can definitely be improved in some parts.",
    "The course left a lot to be desired.Lectures were a bit dry.I wish there was more integration of interesting class discussions, current event case studies, (all the case studies given to us seemed to be the same thing over and over again), movies, maybe a field trip.. etc. I also think there is too much of an economic focus. There should be more exploration of comparative global health systems (policy, stats, social issues, etc), and not only an economic focus.It would also be nice for there to be more sharing between students of their international experiences, lessons learned, etc.",
    "I really appreciated being able to do a lot of our work in-class. It probably would have been more valuable if the class was a bit smaller, encouraged better class discussion.",
    "Too many students for a discussion-style class.",
    "The course seemed like it was being taught at the high-school level. I can honestly say it was a waste of my time and I'm personally upset that I wasted time and money on this course. The material was not at all challenging, we had no chance to debate any of the critical issues facing global health practitioners today and I gained very little new knowledge on global health systems.",
    "Class not challenging and not very linked to reality of developing countries. Mainly presented economic theories that do not take into account of context. Focused on one small part of Africa over and over again. Class was too easy, with case studies not teaching anything",
    "This course is effective in providing students with an introduction to key concerns in global health delivery.Strengths include the case-study approach to implementing what we learnt in the first part of the course. One caveat here is that the second case-study is less well-designed than the others and was somewhat confusing.It might also be worth considering a way of improving participation in the class discussions. It seems that the vast majority of comments and questions came from a core of 5-10 people, in a class of 40-50. It might be possible to do this by more strictly enforcing the mechanism Prof Adhvaryu introduced at the beginning of the course: random selection of 'discussion leaders'. It seemed clear from some of the questions asked in some classes that people had not done the reading - some way of militating against this tendency might be helpful.",
    "The course was well structured however I didn't find it particularly engaging or interesting.",
    "The class has a good framework but has a lot to improve upon. First and foremost, the class was too large for the design. A smaller class would have stimulated better discussion and held students accountable for the work. Second, the feedback was inadequate. Greater discussion regarding assignments\/lessons learned would have been useful.",
    "Good course, sort of boring. Wish we had learned more, and discussed the articles less.",
    "Confusing. I feel like I didn't learn anything in this class at all.",
    "Course needs to be shorter.",
    "The course seemed disconnected. Subjects from class to class did not flow, and we didn't really learn about global health systems in an organized way. Not sure what to take from the course.",
    "I thought the subject matter was very interesting. The actual lectures were too long (it should be a twice a week class) and the actual lecture was slightly disorganized.",
    "It's ok.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Ach is a great professor and the material was very interesting. The course reading was very very good: most of them were not very long (and the one 200 page assignment no one honestly read) and they gave good examples of the concepts discussed (e.g. health insurance, user fees). I admit I did not always go in to class having full understanding of them, but lecture was an excellent complement to go over some of the more intricate details of the correlations, methods, and data results.The Case Studies and group projects were a lot of fun. They brought up important issues that, I imagine, are really important when designing global health interventions.I think the class should be renamed to something like \"Economic Perspectives in Global Health\" and have a little more structure in how each week's concept tie together. Maybe a case simulation or bigger case study or paper, or just a summarizing final class that focuses on how user fees, insurance, social externalities etc. can all go together.Pogge's guest lecture was interesting but WAY TOO LONG (i.e. it took him WAY to long to get the the point about HIP).Leslie's guest lecture was really cool - enjoyed it very much and it was actually a little inspiration (it made me go back to my room and start looking up different global health studies and projects).Class time should definitely be moved: 5-7:30 on weekends is just awful. People are hungry, tired, and class is long. I realize that it's hard to find a time that works for people but this is pretty much the worst time ever. Except maybe 8am. If that's the only other option, keep it at dinner time.",
    "I hope this course could cover a global picture for health systems rather than focus on a specific region in Africa.",
    "It would be helpful to focus on specific areas of the world, and global health challenges specific to those areas. It is difficult to discuss an element of global health without a specific context in which to analyze it. Though the case studies did provide a more concrete context, they were all in the same location.",
    "This course should be a bit more generalist focused and a bit less econ focused. It is the intro Global Health class overall.",
    "I think this course would benefit from a clearer focus. I was not really sure what I was supposed to be getting out of it. However, the guest lecturers we're useful to getting different perspectives on the issues. Also, I think the there should have been some prior evaluation of where the students were at so that the class could better reflect that.",
    "The concept of the course is good but the number of students made it difficult to hold productive discussions. The case-study element of the course was helpful in that regard but it would have been better if the case studies were spaced out over the course of the semester.",
    "While the topic of the course is great, the class is too large to facilitate a discussion. Most of the time, the material was not covered in length during class and a lot of outside work was required to really understand the material.",
    "I think this course would have been better run if it were smaller because when there was class discussion it was overrun by the students. It would have been more interesting to get real-world examples and more of the professor's experiences.",
    "Interesting material, could be taught in a better, more interesting way.",
    "This is an economics course. It is also way to long! All my other one day a week classes were around 2 hours, not 3. This class is not interesting unless you are interested in economics and health policy. Other divisions should have other global health requirements.",
    "This is not a good class. It feels very unpolished and today, at the end of the semester, I can genuinely say that I have gained almost nothing from having taken it. Having heard similar stories from friends who took this class last year, I was expecting things to have improved more than they did. Granted, certain things (like shortening the midterm) were a step in the right direction, but the class itself doesn't seem to do anything to really educate on what 'global health systems' are or how they operate. The lectures were long (3 hours), during dinner time (5-8pm), and frequently disjointed and lacking cohesion or a sense of methodological approach.Some positive notes of the class were that the group work for case studies and the final was fun. I think that many times people tried to 'discuss' their ideas during lecture, which lead to tangential conversations occurring among the same few people, while the rest of the class either didn't know or particularly care about their ideas. Lecture would be better suited as more of a 'traditional' lecture, with discussion possibly being saved for a separate discussion section for the class.Overall, I think this class needs to be majorly reworked. I feel somewhat angry at this point that a core class for global health is so poorly designed.",
    "This class was just too large and the title is a misnomer - it should be GH Economics. In saying that, though, I liked the content. I would highly recommend limiting the number of students, allowing Ach to focus on economics (which he has more experience with than GH Systems), and using legitimate case studies (not just ones made up by the professor).Also - NO class should be from 5-8! What time are we supposed to eat dinner?",
    "This course would have worked well in a seminar format. As a lecture with about 50 students it wasn't very engaging. I don't think there is any reason why this course should be mandatory for the global health concentration and if other options were offered, there would probably not be so many students enrolled in it.I enjoyed the guest lectures, which mixed things up a bit and offered different perspectives on global health issues.",
    "The class has so much potential. That being said, I don't necessarily think it was a bad course but I think it could definitely be improved based on factors that were out of Atch's control.",
    "Great",
    "Strengths: Covered a variety of topics; allowed for group collaboration in case studiesWeaknesses: No clear direction for the course; heavy economics, without solid application; focussed too much on one part of the world instead of surveying other examples; the class was way too big.",
    "I really liked the case studies. I think it would have been better to have them start earlier in the semester. It was a lot to complete them during the weeks approching the mid term due date.",
    "It was a class that was too big in size for its purpose. I felt like it would have been a great discussion class but there is no cap on the number of students that take it which then makes it cumbersome to have a discssion with 50 students in the class.I was overall happy with the material that was gone over in the class.",
    "I think the class could use a more rigorous and challenging approach."

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach is very nice and friendly, but I did have some trouble with his teaching style, in particular the very slow pace of the lectures. Given that the course was in the evening (5-8pm), when most people are tired, I think he has to keep the pace up a little. I appreciate his friendliness and eagerness to help during the case studies.",

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I think that he could have done a better job facilitating discussion.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Despite his best efforts, Ach had very poor control of the classroom. People asked completely irrelevant questions or make inane comments and he spent valuable class-time entertaining the most specific comments that nobody but the questioner was interested in hearing the answer to. We spent the entire class examining one small district in Tanzania that Ach happened to have been to and really learned very little about global health systems. I don't think we spent more than 10 minutes the entire semester talking about the WHO, PEPFAR, or The Global Fund, which to me is the definition of global health systems.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He is engaging, but some times his style of lecture is not. It may help if he tried to interact with the class more (though clearly the students should be trying harder themselves to interact).",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Prof. Ach is very inexperienced, and has done no development work. It is very hard to lean from someone with no personal connection to this subject, and who has only studies econ theory regarding \"developing nations.\" Many article 10+ years old, so the language was still all about teaching and 'helping' poor nations, rather than the mutual cooperation that is now taking place.Class would be much improved if a practitioner at least co-taught it, and different regions were studies, rather than the one small part Ach has done his work in.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Prof Adhvaryu's delivery in class is clear and informative.Some of the lectures might be improved by making more of an assumption that people have done the reading, and focusing more on the knotty issues presented by the readings, rather than taking a large chunk of time summarizing. This tactic would of course rely for its effectiveness on this assumption being accurate, which might be a problem.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The instructor is good at describing articles however he didn't incorporate many of his own insights into the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He did a good job considering the circumstances. I do feel, however, that questions could have been followed up better and more direct feedback could have been provided.",

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Not a good teacher. Nice guy, but doesn't know how to teach,",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He was well prepared for class, tried very hard to keep us engaged, but could not reign students in. Discussion was often driven in many directions, and he was unable to redirect it back to the topic of discussion.He would make a great discussion leader. And perhaps he would be better teaching a smaller course on a more specific topic, but for such a broad topic, information wasn't organized well.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach is very kind and helpful. You can tell that he has a lot of experience and knows what he's talking about. With a class that is three hours long it is difficult to keep the attention of the class, but if the lectures were a little more organized and\/or diverse the class would have been better.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He's interesting in his way of teaching. Though his case studies are good.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach is the man. He was very kind, funny, intelligent, and warm. He made class really enjoyable. I think the class was very well put together, he was available to students, and is a very approachable professor.Sometimes when he wears jeans, it is hard to tell him from other students.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The professor was knowledgeable. It would be helpful for the lectures to focus on less on reviewing tables within the assigned articles, as those are skills we also learn in Epi and in other classes.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Although he is extremely respectful of the students and their opinions, it might be beneficial to offer more evaluation of responses given in class. Also, his lectures might benefit from focusing less on the numbers from the papers and more on the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Good lecturer but relied too much on discussion in a course that was too big for discussions to run smoothly.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I would have liked more feedback on my midterm paper (we still haven't gotten the hard copies handed back). The topic was very broad and unfocused and while I enjoyed the classes in which he spoke of his direct experiences and work, the class overall was disappointing.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Although the material is interesting, I found the instructor and his method of teaching very dry and unengaging. He was also not very attentive to the students.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Dr. Adhvaryu is a great guy but is still new to teaching.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Dr. Adhvaryu is a nice guy, who seems like he truly means well for the class and is very knowledgeable. However, he wasn't able to moderate discussion very well or really impart knowledge of what global health systems are. I understand and sympathize with his position as new faculty being given a large, difficult class to teach. If perhaps this class were co-taught with another faculty member it might help improve it.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He's pleasant and was trying to make the class interesting, but I think he wasn't able to fully utilize his training\/ experience because he had to teach System instead of Economics and because the class was too large. All in all, though, a nice guy - and especially interesting one-on-one.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Professor Adhvaryu's lectures were well-organized and easy to follow. However, they essentially summarized the readings, so there was little incentive to do the readings.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I think that he has incredible potential but that his limited experience and the size of the class definitely impede that. The class would be much better run if it were smaller and allowed discussion about the papers and the topics being presented. The case studies helped but i think they were a bit redundant. Discussion seemed to turn into people sharing what they've done and not necessarily discussing what was being presented. So, while I don't think I gained much from the course, I wouldn't blame Ach. I think he is capable of being a really great professor.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Great instructor",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach got more comfortable with his role as the semester progressed.",

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He was young and excited to teach and tried to strike a balance between lecturing at us and asking questions of us. I felt the class was particularly well led towards the end of the semester when case studies allowed us to break apart.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I think the instructor could be a bit more demanding in terms of the quality of work from students - and could really do more in making the class more challenging."
