    "Good comprehensive course that has energetic discussions. I would highly recommend.",
    "The course covers Islam in America from like, forever ago, to now. It's actually quite a bit of theory, which can be a bit overwhelming at times, but there is also a lot of fun reading too - we read a couple of novels which was nice. Grewal is great and class was always interesting, thoughtful, and fun.",
    "Take it! I learned so much, and it really gave me an important new perspective.",
    "Yes! So relevant to American society today.",
    "This class is amazing--everyone should take it. It is a seminar on the meaning of diaspora and the history\/politics of Islam in America, and especially what this means and looks like today, in our own post-9\/11 moment. It will change how you think about Islam in America and prove to be an intellectually delightful experience. Professor Grewal is amazing, the workload is manageable, and the readings are very fun. I would highly, highly recommend!",
    "YESSSS!",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. You learn a lot about Muslims in America and a lot of the information is really surprising and valuable to know. It's a lot of work but she's a generous grader."
