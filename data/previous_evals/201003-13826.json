   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My expectation is to learn how a parametric methodology can be applied in designing all scales of architecture, the course is completely fit my expectations.",
    "I think it was a strong studio with a serious experimental component, investigating the role of the cutting-edge software in the design process.Till the very end I didn\u0092t know where the process would lead us. That was a certain stress, but at the same time a great value of departing from the conventional intuitive way.There was another thing, besides what I have already mentioned, which I didn\u0092t expect to practice in this studio, but it was also a very valuable part of my study.It was an opportunity to learn how to express the idea clearly both verbally and in diagrams. Failure to do so would absolutely not be accepted by our critics.This important part of profession is lacking in my education back home, where evaluation and reviews are done behind closed doors, and students\u0092 verbal explanation is never as important as the drawings.",
    "My expectation for the studio was that it would be similar to Alejandro's work - cutting edge, yet grounded in the influences of the discipline. I was not disappointed. I think the studio was easily the most cutting edge studio available to me at Yale. I grew as an architect more than I could have ever expected. I am taking away not only a final product, but a facility with new tools and concepts.",
    "The brief and ambition of the studio was vague to begin with. In the end I was very satisfied with the breadth of work that the studio accomplished. The studio demanded exploration in many areas that are not readily encouraged in the core curriculum of the school (i.e. experimental software, computer programming, using a blog as a forum for each students work andcommunication with the professor, etc.). I felt so refreshed that the studio did not adhere to the conservative status quo that earlier core studios stringently followed. Deliverables and progess checks were tailored by the students, a method that was very refreshing.",
    "Due to the experimental character of this studio, the expectations I had for it were more than satisfied, leading my fellow students and I to learn beyond what was required by the syllabus. I have to admit that I prefer working alone and that working in teams proved to be difficult at some points, especially when reaching moments in which the project demanded partial or total change. I believe my partner and I succeded this semester in the sense that as independent as we bothare, we were able to produce together a project that we feel satisfied every single aspect that we set to ourselves."

   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. - adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "They are available and helpful, especially the software.",
    "softwares are not well prepared for the class",
    "All the hardware and software resources were sufficient for fulfillment of the assignments.The only thing to revisit is that in such technically-based studio it\u0092s probably important to have greater time devoted to sessions, that provide hands-on for software tools.We did have Maider and William Martin consult us regularly, but I think in terms of time it should be more than what we had.Close to what is done in Mark Gage\u0092s studio where they devote quite a lot of time learning to use Maya.",
    "The scheduling for the 3d printers was BADLY BADLY mismanaged by the in-house faculty at Yale. The 1st and 2nd years used the 3d printers much more extensively than any year before them. In certain studios in the 2nd year critics recommended this usage. Because these studios presented before us - there was an enormous queue for the 3d printer. I had my 3d model ready to print a WEEK AND A HALF BEFORE my pinup and was only able to print by luck and some wheeling and dealing with other students.If you are going to push for 3dprints - notice needs to be given or the schedule changed. What ended up saving me from not having a print was simple - COMMUNICATION. I spoke with a student who was presenting after me with two 12 hour jobs. His job would have ended right at 2am essentially losing 8 hours of 3dprint time (because no one would be there to start the next one). My TALKING to him I was able to assure that the maximum capacity of the machine was met by avoiding late night turnover. Not to mention that 3dprinter was not even scheduled for sunday usage until students complained.Overall, much more thought and strategy needs to be given to maximizing our school's amazing resources.Also - if advanced studios are truly a showcase - then you need to give them priority instead of 1st and 2nd year critics pushing a technology that is overkill for core projects.",
    "most all resources were very available.the fact that the large CNC mill was down the majority of the semester was very disappointing.and the classes folder drive space was simply not large enough to accommodate a studio that required extensive file sharing.finally,The 3d printer policy needs to be revised, advanced studios are penalized for having final reviews late in the week. Most if not all the 3d printers were booked out by the second years a week and a half before our final review meaning many students had to spend upwards of $1000 dollars to outsource final models. If you are going to encourage an advanced studio that requires contemporary fabrication techniques such as 3d printing (models, processes, and designs that legitimately warrant 3d printing) then those studios should be given priority or at the very least adequate time to sign up.",
    "All resources are available upon student\u0092s responsibility to schedule on time. Yet, it would be critical if some of these machines were limited to only advanced studios like ours. It was disappointing to plan ahead and then realize that all specialized machines, like the 3d printers were already used by 1st and 2nd year studios, which really don\u0092t deal with the level of fabrication complexity that advanced studios do.In addition, some of the environmental analysis software available is a dated and this should be revised, since it can dramatically limit the performance of certain aspects of the project that apparently were very important for the critics."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "All are valuable to build my knowledge.",
    "pin-ups and outside experts",
    "In terms of the way the consultations were set up, it was extremely effective.Beyond regular studio consultations, I was allowed to e-mail sketches, and almost immediately received a feedback, even early in the morning. That let me keep the work flow going at all times.",
    "Overall, I think the scheduling and simple organization of the studio needs improved upon. I do not think it is appropriate to have video conference calls on non-studio days that require students to talk late into the evenings.And it is very disturbing to know that your out of town critic scheduled one of his visits during the thanksgiving break (a holiday that is on the calendar before school starts) and then is confused as to why people will be away and unable to meet.",
    "The possibility of sharing a variety of thoughts on the discourse of contemporary architecture with someone who has been in the same position than us at a point of his career was perhaps the most valuable aspect of the studio. For this reason, all desk-crits in which Alejandro participated in person had an immense value. Through these meetings I felt my knowledge has greatly expanded, since we engaged into discussions that covered many different issues that currently affect our discipline. As a student who is about to graduate in a moment of great uncertainty, I consider that experiences like this are the ones that will have great influence in my career and the questions we will pose in the future.The second most valuable aspect of the studio was being able to share these discussions with our jurors, since many of these share some of our doubts. The diversity of jurors also adds into the flavor of the discussions. I strongly believe thatif all jurors were thinking within the same lines; the conversations wouldn\u0092t be as interesting as they were. There is a value in oppositions that should be remembered at all times. I hope that future classes have the same opportunity we had.Among other positive values was the fact that Maider was always keeping an eye on us and provided not less than three desk-crits per week. If it wasn\u0092t for this constant push we wouldn\u0092t have been able to take our projects up the level of development we did. To me, this level of project development in which we carried an urban masterplan all the way to the functional level of detail of a fa\u00e7ade is unprecedented; makes me wonder how the future of education will be and if all studios should be as comprehensive.Nontheless, I would strongly recommend the following:1. The need of outside experts as consultants: environmental, social, engineering. Some comprehensive studios at Upenn had at least 3 and the projects were not that rigorous as the ones from our class. This maybe something to consider, as it may raise the level of expertise in students through guidance.2. If the emphasis on computation is to be kept, the studio needs a \u0093troubleshooter\u0094. Studios like Greg Lynn\u0092s or Mark Gage\u0092s count with one that specializes in Maya, aside from their TF. More than giving tutorials, this is the person that helps hands-on when students are stuck or take longer than usual to move forward.3. Although the skype meetings were to some extent useful, I believe that more than half of them were not because of lack of clarity due to noise. These should happen on a meeting room without background voices from loud people that really don\u0092t know there\u0092s a serious meeting going on.4. As much as the blog was a great source of communication with Alejandro, at some point it became somewhat dangerous and uncomfortable to use it. The problem of posting information to the web is that it can be also reproduced very easily by other people -even within class- in different manners. Even though this is not different from the professional world, this might be a point to consider."
