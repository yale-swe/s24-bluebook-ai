   "comments": [
    "It is a course on Benjamin's Arcades Project. I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely recommend! Benjamin & Baudelaire what more could you want?",
    "The course seeks to pursue an anatomization of modernity (in basically all its dimensions) by way of a close reading of Walter Benjamin's incredible treatment of the modernization of Paris in the 19th Century. In doing so, the course invites students to ask what it means to write history in the wake of the catastrophes of the mid-twentieth-century, to which Benjamin was so clearly attuned. I would recommend the course to other students without reservation; it is rare to find a course that invites students not only to master a given author or discourse but to find inspiration for their own projects in the materials. Students will leave the course not only with a better understanding of Benjamin and of modernity but with ample ideas for their own work.",
    "An indispensable course for Benjamin. anyone interested in urban studies, Marxist thought, critical theory should enroll in this course.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants a rundown on THE prevalent tropes of 19th c Paris that have dominated European cultural history, media, and film theory. I would not recommend it to someone who learns best through discussion."

   "comments": [
    "It deepens my knowledge of Benjamin's philosophy and materialist orientation.",
    "The course gave us the crucial element of time to sit with one text albeit a very large and imposing one that is at the heart of comparative literature as a discipline. Very happy I had the chance to immerse myself in it.",
    "As I noted in Question 3, the course was a very effective invitation to consider the ramifications of Benjamin's reading of modernity for one's own work. It has certainly shaped my thinking in ways I am sure I'm unable to fully appreciate so close to the end of term.",
    "the course establishes some of the key connections between social\/political theories and literary studies.",
    "The modern city as space of fantasy is one that prevails throughout much of my work, so I found this course very useful."
