   "comments": [
    "Despite the vastness of the North America being studied and the distinct arts, styles, and histories of Native communities, I learned a great deal about each community and artistic tradition we studied. I gained insight about the land on which Yale stands and that we take for granted but is in fact the historic territory of the Quinnipiac people and how the history of visibility and invisibility has played out across art and academic institutions.",
    "I learned so much about Native American art, but also Native American history, issues, and also about the museum sector and the historiography of the discpline.",
    "Professor Ruth Phillips brought in a kind of knowledge and expertise, that is sadly under-taught and discussed by the Yale History of Art department. Learning approaches to Native North American Art has already began to shape the rest of my coursework and methodology for the rest of my time here at Yale. Ruth introduced varied approaches not only to Native North American Art, but also to museology and history. Her voice was only supplemented further by her various guests that also made the class a true joy to take.",
    "Native North American Art was a very interdisciplinary approach to art history. I was made more aware of the resources available to students in terms of collections at the YUAG and Peabody. Phillips did an amazing job of utilizing every possible resource, bringing in several Native artists and curators and others who work with Native art for guest discussions, bringing out art pieces from the Art Gallery and the Peabody Museums for us to see objects that we were studying in person, and taking us on a trip to the Pequot and Mohegan Museums. The final presentation with critique was great practice for presenting academic work.",
    "I learned about categories placed on Native art, the changes in Native art forms over time, and contributions of Native artist to what people call \"American\" and \"contemporary\" and \"modern\" arts.",
    "Native American art traditions; history of anthropology with Native art; critical examination of museum collecting and display practices; indigenous insight into Native art; MANY opportunities to learn from professionals working in Native art. This was an exception class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course came from the guest lecturers and visiting artists who were able to give great insight onto the material being studied. The readings were intriguing and gave a balance of varying fields of study and perspectives. Professor Phillips expertise on many subject and background in museum and academia made the material have a presence. Future iterations could have even more engagement with Yale's own history with indigenous collections and communities.",
    "Strengths: Covered a vast area in a well-paced and timed manner, the guests added greatly, taught with great expertise that showed throughout the course, felt recognized and always appreciated in class Weakness: This is the only course on Native North American Art I have seen taught at Yale, was only 2 hours a week",
    "Phillips did an amazing job of utilizing every possible resource, bringing in several Native artists and curators and others who work with Native art for guest discussions, bringing out art pieces from the Art Gallery and the Peabody Museums for us to see objects that we were studying in person, and taking us on a trip to the Pequot and Mohegan Museums. Strength in interdisciplinary approaches in that different styles of art were looked at in sociohistorical, formal, anthropological approaches.",
    "This class, though outside my field, was hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. A few are the highlights of the course were: the knowledge of the Dr. Phillips, the opportunity to meet Indigenous art professionals, the opportunity to engage with Yale's own collections, and exceptional course content."
