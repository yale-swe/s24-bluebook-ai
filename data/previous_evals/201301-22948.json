   "comments": [
    "Lots of reading and writing. No exams.",
    "Take it if you don't mind writing about weird scientific concepts you don't actually understand at all.",
    "Don't take this class as a gut. You have to actually do the work. I enjoyed it greatly when I came, and I got a lot out of it.",
    "You leave this class with a greater understanding about water and how it's related to everything. The first half of the course was more about water and its relation to planets, and the second focused on water and it's relation to agriculture, waste, energy, and security.",
    "This is a good science class for non-majors--the weekly reading responses and presentation, etc are very manageable. That being said, the material is sometimes not necessarily engaging.",
    "The class is a little hard if you are a non-science major. If you want to spend a lot of time looking up extra material to understand one reading and get up even earlier to attend class go for it! The only perk, which was a blessing and a curse, is that you only have a final paper and the draft is a midterm.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course, I like geology and I thought it would be a nice way to get a science credit but I was wrong. Each week is a new topic, you have to read some papers and write a summary of them, the prof does one lecture each week and students do the other (which is pretty pointless, because they just summarize the articles you already read and summarized). Also it is early and up science hill. It is not a lot of work, but it is also incredibly pointless. The topics don't connect from week to week, you cover everything in a very cursory manner, and I came out of it feeling like I wasted my time and accomplished nothing. Nobody seemed to care about what we were doing, which created a very sad atmosphere and one not conducive to learning (or fun, or any feeling of accomplishment or satisfaction).",
    "At the beginning of the class, The Science of Water feels like a crash course in everything-Bill-Nye-ever-taught-you. But don't let that fool you--the class moves on, and moves quickly, into deeper waters (no pun intended) of more complicated physics and chemistry of water, water's role in the universe, and water's place in society-- in some ways, it's a very focused course on the situation of science today, and is very artfully geared for non-major students. On Mondays, Professor Lee lectures on the week's topic. On Wednesdays, a student presents on the week's papers. Every week requires a review on two given articles and a peer review on the presentation, totaling roughly 3-5 pages of writing a week. A relaxed class with a lovely atmosphere. But perhaps the highest recommendation I can offer is for Professor Lee--a frank, conversational, highly knowledgeable professor. Even if the material is not the most interesting, Professor Lee makes it worth the ride.",
    "Overall, I think this course was way harder than it seemed based on the syllabus and the first couple days of class. As a fifth class, it might not be the best idea for people who are taking four other, very intensive courses. The workload for G&G207 was much, much heavier than I thought it would be. Reading responses, peer reviews, a presentation, and a paper doesn't sound like much, but the reading responses actually took longer than I thought they would. And the science articles you have to read and understand are pretty intense and complex, so if you're a non-science major, you might struggle. The course is marketed for both science AND non-science majors, so I feel like perhaps the kids who were great at science and who had been doing stuff like this before were slowed down, and perhaps the kids who hadn't done science as much were sprinting just to keep up. It was an awkward happy-medium that I don't think benefitted anyone. Professor Lee is a sweetheart, but she's very chill and subdued and at 9am, this is basically a recipe for disaster for me. Some of the lectures were pretty cool and I did learn things in the course, but I think I could have spent large chunks of the time that I spent being in and doing work for this class doing better things.",
    "I view this class as the one which, twenty years from now, I will remember as one of the most important I took at Yale. Future conflicts and political confrontations will be about water scarcity and energy shortages. Science of Water--could not recommend it more."
