   "comments": [
    "It was pretty much two hours of just drawing, mostly with just charcoal. It got somewhat monotonous at times, at least for me, but if you enjoy just drawing by yourself without much direction, you might enjoy the relaxing atmosphere.",
    "Absolutely; the skill levels in my class were diverse, and yet the tone of the room was supportive and friendly. Weekly assignments were reasonable and enjoyable, Anna was supportive and helpful in her critiques. I felt as though my drawing skills definitely improved this semester. I wish I could take it again!",
    "Yes, it was a lot of fun, especially good balance for people who are taking multiple QR\/SC...etc classes that use a different part of their brains",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS: working with charcoal is great, you do a variety of different sorts of drawings, you start off with still lives, move on to landscapes and finish with the figure, really great professor and her assistant (manuela) was fabulous, not much homework and what there is is fun",
    "It is basic drawing, do not expect to come out being able to draw perfect comic book characters. You improve as an artist in this class by refining your observational skills.",
    "See question 1",
    "yes, if you are interested in art at all, it'll definitely sharpen your technique",
    "Art 114 05 is a great introduction to the learning about drawing via observation. Students are able to explore a variety of media, and experiment in different types of drawing.I would be pleased to recommend this class, especially to those who hope to experiment and further fine-tune their skills.",
    "was a wonderful way to break up the stress of homework and classes. you get out of it what you put into it. you definitely dont need to be an amazing artist to take the class. definitely enjoyable. i would recommend it to anyone looking to either further their art, or just looking for a creative way to relax.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, because I have observed that a semester of drawing is a very good way to both improve drawing skills (a lot) and relax the mind.",
    "I would recommend Basic Drawing to another student.",
    "This is a basic drawing class that pushes you to think of drawing in ways you never have before, while training you in traditional techniques. I would definitely recommend it to any student."
