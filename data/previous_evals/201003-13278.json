   "comments": [
    "This is a really interesting freshman seminar, where basically you get a new professor every 3 weeks to talk about some up-and-coming topic in science. Each professor has a different style, but the good news is if you don't like a certain professor, they'll be gone soon. The actual topics are really interesting, and the class isn't too hard- there is a short quiz and a problem set for every unit. I'd definitely try to get into this seminar!",
    "I would. If you can handle the hour-and-a-half on fridays, it's a great way for a non-science major who still wants to do some fulfilling science material to fulfill a science requirement. It's also just a really cool environment. Additionally, NO FINAL. The way the work is spread is great.",
    "An engaging class of major issues in contemporary\/popular science, featuring rotating modules of three weeks each with some of Yale's best faculty. I would recommend the class to those not predisposed to majoring in the sciences.",
    "Current topics is a pretty chill class. You get to hear pretty intelligent professors speak, and each of them is really in touch with his subject, but make sure that you scan the syllabus before you take the class to see if the topics at least mildly interest you. Sitting in the seminar listening to something that doesn't interest you is not fun at all. But cookies, coffee, and juice every class is definitely a great perk, and even though it's a full year class, meeting once a week is really chill (except for the 3rd, final week of each module when you'll probably have a quiz, a problem set due, and another random project due).",
    "This is a fantastic course for teaching you just enough about fields in science so that when you read about big scientific events, you can understand what's happening. It will help you understand the actual science behind cloning, natural selection, global warming, and a multitude of other topics, well beyond what you learn from TV. Its worth the Friday time slot, and be careful because it goes for a full year, but I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "If you have interests in lots of different areas of science, or are interested in pretty advanced topics but don't want to go through all of the basic stuff to get there, take the course. Lectures occasionally felt a bit long, but it depends on the guest lecturer. Some of them were really great.",
    "We meet each Friday afternoon, sit around a table and discuss cool topics in science from professors who specialize in those topics. We have 3 week modules, so the topic and lecturer changes every 3 classes, giving us an opportunity to learn about a variety of cutting-edge topics in science. There are usually weekly problem sets, which can sometimes be a challenge but are definitely manageable overall. We also have quizzes on the third class of each module and sometimes presentations. I\u0092m not a science major, but I love this course and am learning so much about fascinating topics in science. We even have baked goods, coffee and tea at each class! I would recommend Science 030 100%!",
    "A professor would come and lecture for 3 weeks about their field and some topic that is important in the world today. It provided a broad overview of many fields, introduced me to current issues, and really got into far more depth than I thought it would [but clearly not as much depth as taking a class in the subject].I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It was really cool to attend the seminar and be able to discuss current scientific topics, and the workload wasn't too bad.",
    "The previous year\u0092s class before this tricked us into thinking that it\u0092d be a very chill class. The current line of professors ensured that was not the case. However, I really loved how each of them taught the different topics. While on paper, the topics such as global warming and stem cells, might seem as over-debated topics that you'd probably be bored listening to the basic concepts again, they really made it interesting by focusing on the intellectual and scientific thought process behind solving the problems in those fields with an emphasis on putting them in today's context. For example, Prof. Leo Buss had us running an evolution simulation program and producing a 3-page research paper complete with an original hypothesis, a very fun, unorthodox but challenging problem set; Prof. Bailyn made us play the role of a research grant committee and debate over which project (which were based on current proposed ones) should be given funding. If you\u0092re the type of person who loves science and wants to know many different varied subject and understand the thought process behind each of them, this is the class for you. Also, did I mention free tea, coffee and cookies every Friday! Which other class has that! If you\u0092re however the type of person who needs time to settle into a subject, you probably shouldn\u0092t take this class as we change topics every 3 weeks. You also have to put up with the class probably ending up with a majority of science majors if you\u0092re a humanities person. However, it\u0092s fun, there\u0092s food, you learn things you wouldn\u0092t learn in a normal science class, take it!",
    "It's a great class! You get a good grasp on a wide variety of less-discussed subjects in science (like exoplanets, or the philosophy of evolution) as well as more popular topics (like global warming). The workload is light, the class meets infrequently, and if you aren't planning on majoring in the sciences, it's a great way to get those credits. Finally, there are cookies and drinks every class. What's not to like?",
    "Interesting class, not too much work. I would recommend it for anyone who finds science fascinating. It's probably appropriate for you whether you have a lot of science background or not much at all. Depending on how much background you have some of the topics may be a bit boring, but I guarantee you you'll learn some substantial new things in this course due to its breadth.",
    "Current Topics in Science is a fantastic course, without a doubt. It covers many controversial and fascinating areas of science, from Stem-Cell Research to Extrasolar Planets to Evolutionary Biology.I would recommend this course to only a specific type of student, however. If you are looking for a course that presents various areas of science that are very active in real world and if you wish to learn about these topics more than you wish to debate them, this class could not be better for you. If you are looking for a forum in which to debate these topics or have a vast background knowledge and simply want to discuss various areas of science with experts, I would look elsewhere.",
    "Take it. The SCIE 030 family is a great bunch. The class in interesting and very low-pressure. It's also a great way to get to know a bunch of faculty really well."
