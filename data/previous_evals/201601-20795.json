   "comments": [
    "You learn all about health inequities and unintended consequences of global health campaigns. I definitely recommend this course - all around a great experience.",
    "General overview to a lot of issues present in public health right now--challenges of intervention, race and gender as sources of stigma. You'll also end up reading a lot of really recent research and literature, so it's definitely a contemporary bent.",
    "I would recommend taking this class, as it allows you to think about the role of health equity in multiple areas of health, as well as thinking about where these inequities and disparities originate. Sometimes Professor Panter-Brick is a bit scattered at the start of the class, but that's only because she is busy doing a ton of really important things (one time she came to class after getting off a phone call with important people about the Syrian refugee crisis). She is really invested in the course and the students, and I would definitely recommend taking it!",
    "This class was by far one of my favorite classes at Yale. We cover topics in structural violence, racism, gender, mental health as well as other topics and relating them to health equity. I learned what it means to have unfair social structures that create unfair health outcomes. Professor Panter-Brick was very encouraging in class whenever anyone spoke up, and she was also very generous with her time in meeting with students and giving students feedback on their writing. It is such a wonderful opportunity to learn from someone like professor Panter-Brick because she is so knowledgeable about health equity and is a leader in her field. Over all, I learned so much from her and the discussions she facilitated. The critical analyses are tough at first but after a few tries you get the hang of it and learning how to write them has helped me think more clearly and become a more organized writer.",
    "Take ANTH 453 if you are interested in medicine. It provides a very necessary perspective that puts accountability to people, especially the most vulnerable, at the forefront. The workload is very manageable, and I don't know of any other class that explores such a breadth of topics from this angle of equity.",
    "ANTH 453 was a really wonderful class with Catherine Panter-Brick, who is really kind, engaging, and extremely knowledgable and experienced in the disciplines of medical anthropology and global health. She'll supplement a lot of discussions with her own anecdotes about her fieldwork around the world (and she's also the senior medical anthropology editor for one of the major journals many of our readings are drawn from!). Workload for the class was much lower than I expected. We write three critical analyses (CAs), which are two page single reading responses, over the course of the semester, as well as a 12 page final paper. Readings are very flexible. She assigns a long list of (relatively short) readings each week but she always told us to just pick a few to read and to be familiar with. Through the class, Professor Panter-Brick really drives home the points about health *equity* (vs. equality), how to distill readings into research highlights, and how to create visuals that capture a message. If you can get in, definitely take this class! It meets once a week for almost two hours, but it passes by quickly.",
    "Would highly recommend! Professor Panter Brick has so much valuable experience to speak from. She also selected excellent readings.",
    "I would recommend a class on these issues to all Yale students, but this particular one needs to be restructured.",
    "Discussion based course that focused on the health inequities in society and different ways to appraxh these issues",
    "A really great class, taught by a wonderful professor. If you haven't studied with Panter-Brick yet, you need to. This class was an overview of the most pressing health disparities in the world today. While we had minimal chance to go in depth with any of the topics we covered, I felt as if we all left class with a working understanding of our largest themes. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. Professor PB is absolutely amazing. She really knows her stuff, you won't find a professor more experienced who also cares so much about her students. It helped me to grow so much as a student. Don't be deterred if you are a non-anth major. She really helps in giving everyone a strong background and helping you if you've never taken an anth class, like me. Definitely shop it, and fight to take it."
