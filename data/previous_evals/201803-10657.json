    "I learned about the topic from different perspectives--the interdisciplinarity of the course was very conducive to learning and expanding one's horizons.",
    "This course was a unique approach to the concept of beauty through close reading of ancient Greek texts and more recent literature on the philosophy of aesthetics and the beautiful. The course provided me with various schemata with which to approach beauty in ancient texts (beauty & nature, beauty & music, beauty & the body), while also serving as an introduction of sorts to some of the most important Western philosophers of aesthetics, such as Kant.",
    "I have a better understanding of Greek ideas about beauty. I now have a little familiarity with modern discussions of aesthetics.",
    "introduction to a broad variety of texts in Ionic, Aeolic, and Attic dialects, all with a focus on ancient ideas about beauty."

   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it attracts students from a wide variety of disciplines (art history, philosophy, literature, history) so the discussions generated during seminar are very interesting. A difficulty is that the seminar was very large, so it made discussions less controlled.",
    "I thought this course was very well-designed. The topics were interesting and challenging.",
    "I wish Prof LeVen could have supplied a more extensive, dialect-specific lexicon, especially when we were reading Sappho, Alcman, Theocritus, and Pindar. The 1-2 page exercises were a helpful introduction to various kinds of scholarly writing. I loved the fundamentals reading--it's very rare that philosophers like Kant, Lessing, Weil would appear in the same syllabus as original Greek texts, and reading them side by side was a brilliant move. Perhaps we could've limited the syllabus, so that we could spend three or four weeks on a single topic rather than just two."

    "Yes, if only for the range of texts you'll encounter, from Alcman to Plotinus. But beware, if you are not already familiar with Aeolic Greek, that the road ahead of you is difficult."
