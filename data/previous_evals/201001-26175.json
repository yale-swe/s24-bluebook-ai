    "Take it if you want a further intro to Spanish.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have taken Spanish before coming to Yale.",
    "This is a challenging but rewarding course. With the right instructor it is definitely a lot of fun. Professor Leon is a great instructor and is always available to offer help and support. She is definitely the reason that I enjoyed this course so much this semester.",
    "A continuation of Spanish 1. Teaches more vocab, grammar, and culture. Highly recommended, especially with Rosamaria.",
    "Take it. It has a lot of work, but it is mindless. It covers a lot of topics and spanish.",
    "This is a great class and actually fun. You learn about language, culture and some other stuff (literature\/movie). I really feel like I have learnt a lot. Yes it is everyday, but that means you get close to your classmates and the homework assignments and exams are spread out so well that you're never very stressed and the final is only 10% of your grade!I cannot stress how important your class environment is. I ended up really looking forward to class, I had a couple friends in it and then Rosamaria Leon is GREAT. So friendly and encouraging, if you miss a class or are ill she will still accept your homework, she doesn't penalize you too much if you're late and she is a very fair grader.Take this class with rosamaria leon if you can!!",
    "Great continuation of level 1 Spanish. I've really enjoyed the Spanish program at Yale, it's been great, and even if I was told I could rewind my freshman year and not have a language requirement, I'd still take it again. Also, the workload wasn't that bad--although the class might be harder if this is the first Spanish class you're taking at Yale, depending on how wellthe entry test determined your abilities.",
    "Spanish 120 is a decent class to fulfill a language requirement. It is significantly more work than Spanish 110. Although it starts off a little difficult in the beginning of the semester, it becomes more manageable towards the end. Like any other language class, it requires a significant amount of work. Professor Leon is great! If you're taking SPAN 120, you should definitely take her section.",
