   "comments": [
    "It was a good course and very eye-opening, but requires some courage to begin.",
    "Take it take it if you aren't afraid to make a fool of yourself and make discoveries. You have to put in a lot of time for the class in terms of work, but it's all manageable and rewarding!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for an easy QR credit that would not mind putting in a significant amount of effort, but I would caution them that I put much more into this class than I got out.",
    "Take this class! It is so interesting and you will not be disappointed. The physics concepts come to life through the dance, and every class is filled with purpose and an intersection between positive exploration. I felt like a researcher in this class and every m=comment or discussion we had in class of our readings, concepts, and movement studies was wonderful. I gained so much from my fellow students and their insights as much as I did by my own reflections on our study. I feel truly fortunate to have had this experience!",
    "Yes, I would totally recommend this course to anyone, regardless of a person's experience with physics or dancing; some people in my class were active dancers, others more on the physics side, and others more in the middle or not at all! The course is extremely open to students of all levels of experience to either, and set up in a way where you would always interact and get to know everyone in the class. After learning concepts of physics, you would have the opportunity to explore and come up with ways to express them through movement studies. We move from learning about basic classical physics (gravity, momentum, work, etc.) to more modern (special relativity), doing Problem sets every other week, which are totally manageable and matched with a movement study assignment to complete with a group of other students. This course is definitely imaginative and does a great job marrying the study of physics and dance.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a fascinating interdisciplinary which approaches physics through the lens of dance. We spend half of the class dancing and then sit down on the floor and take notes of physics for the second half. The work includes discussion question responses to readings, problem sets, midterm and final physics exams, movement studies, and choreographic studies. It's a lot of work! But if you're willing to put in the effort it's definitely worth it.",
    "This class is basically exactly what you think it will be. If you are a brilliant physicist, it's definitely not for you. If you're a brilliant dancer, you might still enjoy yourself. But, if you're basically capable across the board, you will be able to expand your knowledge of both topics. Besides that, it is a really fun way to explore physics."
