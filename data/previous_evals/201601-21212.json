    "Get ready to spend months doing variations on Zeno's paradox. Consider whether it is worth your time to do both the reading and go to lecture. There is an immense amount of overlap. Grades this term varied greatly between the two TFs, who could not be more different from each other. Make sure you end up in the right section.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU'VE TAKEN ANOTHER PHILOSOPHY COURSE. Your grades will suffer if you don't know how to write in the proper philosophical way. Even if you taken loads of WR credits, this one is different. The beginning about sets is definitely rough, but it gets better. Although the work load is light, it is definitely not a gut or an easy A.",
    "A great choice for a QR!",
    "Yes. Cool material, low time-commitment. Yes there are better classes out there, but if you're mathematically or philosophically inclined I don't see how you could regret taking this.",
    "Take this class a hidden Yale gem! Very interesting topics, great readings, amazing teaching. Youll learn so many new, awesome things, and doing the assignments will truly further your knowledge. A class that truly sharpens your thinking, and even your writing. 4 assignments (one was pset-ish, the other are short essays, 3 pages each), and one 10-page paper. Very manageable workload.",
    "It might be hard for people who've never taken a philosophy course, but it's definitely doable.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I think while it covered a lot of different implications of infinity, that was also its problem - we didn't really go in-depth. There wasn't a lot of discussion, and I never felt really motivated to engage with the material.",
    "I really liked the idea behind this course. Infinity is a fascinating concept, and I love the concept of a QR\/Hu that works with both areas in unexpected ways. However, I found the lectures slow and boring, the readings un-engaging.",
    "Fun philosophy class, not too much math, but still interesting. Definitely go for it if you like thinking about things that are kind of impossible... But don't worry, they're framed in interesting ways. And Professor Whittle will stop lecture and help out if you don't get something.",
    "It wasn't a ton of work and had quite a lot of interesting subject material. Definitely a QR to look into if in need, or if just interested in the subject.",
    "Infinity was an interesting class that mainly discussed different paradoxes regarding the idea of the infinitely large, the infinitely small, an infinitely short amount of time, etc. At times, the lectures were a little bit repetitive at times, but the material was still interesting and enjoyable. I took the class as a STEM person looking for a math-y HU credit, but there were also other people taking it for a QR credit with no real mathematical calculating, which led to an interesting grouping of people, and therefore interesting section discussions. The work is not too much, and it makes you think about different ways to respond to paradoxes, which I enjoyed.",
    "Yeah, it was pretty interesting.",
    "Yes and no. It is a great course for fulfilling distributional requirements or learning something interesting, but I do not feel that my time was always effectively used.",
    "Cool paradoxes about infinity. Personally even though I liked the class, I found it hard to follow the super abstract philosophical thinking [that is a personal issue, the class is great but as a super STEM major, philosophy just isn't for me]",
    "A great way to be introduced both to philosophy, and to the underlying principles behind math. More intensive on paradoxes and mathematical principles than I was expecting, with not enough overall discussion of what \"infinity\" means in a larger sense, but still very interesting.",
    "Recommend it. Go to the sections and try to attend every other class",
    "It is an alright class. Not riveting. Not really a QR gut (in the truest since) if that was what you were looking for. The low work rating is likely because a lot of math and math\/philosophy majors take this class either as an easy humanities credit or as a logical reasoning requirement for their major.",
    "Class takes a turn - prof stops posting notes, problem sets become papers, final paper is pretty long and tedious, esp for non-philosophy majors.",
    "Very interesting class, pretty wide variance on grading. Teaches you to think with precision, but you have to be pretty into paradoxes for themselves.",
    "Chill class but grading is way harsh for no reason",
    "Good class, interesting subject matter. Would Recommend, just make sure you do the readings.",
    "Take it if you want a QR that makes you write.",
    "If you're looking for a low-workload QR, take this course. It's an interesting combination of mathematics and the humanities. That being said, lectures can be very dry and confusing. There's not much work, but the course isn't easy.",
    "Infinity is a good QR credit with little work, especially if you like philosophy. It may be difficult if you do not have a background in writing philosophy papers. the lectures are also somewhat dull. I would recommend this class especially if you have taken DS, as those skills translate over nicely.",
    "As a curious computer science major, I found this to be a much better than expected philosophy course. It starts a little slow, going over mathematical theory, but once it begins exploring infinity's many strange philosophical implications it becomes very interesting. Some topics admittedly went over my head (esp. metaphysics), but overall it was thought-provoking and at times mind-blowing. And the assignments are easy and a lot of fun to think about. Take it!",
    "I loved this class. Learning to argue philosophically and really outline and delineate my case well has been such a useful skill to gain. One of my favorite classes this semester and during all of Yale. Professor Whittle is so smart, way smarter than other professors I've had! I wish I had taken more Philosophy at Yale, but especially with him as I loved the mathematical lean of this class. Sad to graduate without having learned more, but I'm so happy to have learned what I have in just this semester!",
    "I would not recommend Phil 281 to another student. I felt that the content was not engaging and the grading was extremely unfair between sections (some TAs are much harsher than others.) Unless you are required for your major to take this course, I would not take it.",
    "Minimal work throughout the semester, and one final paper at the end. The TF is a harsh grader. A couple of stimulating philosophical questions (revolving around responses to Zeno's Paradox) arise, but mostly I struggled to find relevance in the course material. There are better and more interesting QR courses that I could've taken."
