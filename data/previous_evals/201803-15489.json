   "comments": [
    "Because we only spent 1-2 classes on each book, I learned how to analytically read books independently. I was also exposed to the book review genre of writing, and got to practice writing one myself, again through an independent reading of a book. One of my favorite things about the class was that the authors on the syllabus do not cater to a Western audience. They don't always explain the political and social context within the book, which spurs your curiosity and makes you want to explore further outside of class. I always left class with more questions than answers, and a desire to return to each book for further investigation. That's how I know that it's a good class - it made me more curious.",
    "How to write a book review, deeper critical literary analysis, specific cultural knowledge related to the African novels we read",
    "I learnt a lot about the differences in culture in different parts of Africa, and about the history and political situations of specific places.",
    "I learned how to read African literature, developed a vocabulary for discussing post-colonial literature, and discovered some of the questions and controversies surrounding \"post-colonial\" itself, and the literature it is used to define. We read works by authors from different African counties (Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya). I learned about African culture and the traditional Western response to African culture. Perhaps the most interesting thing to me in this class was the discussion of the publication industry as a gatekeeper and even focalizer of \"African\" literature.",
    "Ability to close read a text",
    "An appreciation for the wealth of international viewpoints of students at Yale, that's for sure! I learned how to write a good book review, I learned a lot about national allegory in the African postcolony, and I learned all about connections between Trump's tweets and Rwanda. The reading, writing, and presenting skills were nothing new, but the structure of the class and the good direction from Merry Sheps made them all satisfying to bring to bear on new material, and everything was further enriched by great books and stellar class discussions"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course were the people (I had an amazing set of classmates who genuinely cared about what we read, bringing their best to class discussions), the syllabus (we read books from a set of authors who did not come to play), and the structure (being only a weekly class, I learned how to independently analyze a piece of literature, which is a very good skill to have). A weakness would be that we weren't guided as explicitly on how to independently read and analyze an entire book (it would've been nice if Professor Shepard gave us some more concrete tips for how to go about doing so, at least at the beginning).",
    "Strengths - the novels were all very good and each had something unique to say. Weaknesses - we had little time to study a novel in depth.",
    "Strengths: great book selections; class was generally interesting with largely student driven discussion; each student gave one presentation 5-10 minutes at the beginning of class on a topic (relevant or tangential) to the book we just read, which broke up the 2 hour class and made it much less boring than just a 2 hour discussion. Weaknesses: the pace can be a little challenging, especially on top of a heavier workload. expect to read about 300 pages a week (250 of literature, and then 50+ of literary theory or criticisms). each book is so good that I often found myself wishing that I could spend more time, close reading it, but the fast pace (1 book\/week) made that quite difficult. professor shepard is amazing; she continually provides insight, wit, and funny jokes!",
    "More focus on the actual text and less focus on secondary sources",
    "The presentations! They were a great way to both listen to ideas from our peers and thereby let students jumpstart discussion, and then, when it was our turn to give one, to engage in particular with one of the books. Book reviews were also nice, because they gave freedom to pick a book for ourselves, and they gave freedom from the usual reports we've all written for lit classes before No major weaknesses come to mind! Maybe not adjusting the syllabus midway through-- some students bought books they didn't use and one ended up reading the unassigned one by mistake. But sometimes this is unavoidable, and it's also good to be flexible and receptive to what the best course seems to be for the class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Shepard picks out an amazing syllabus that did not leave me disappointed. I gained so much from being exposed to literature that my American education failed to expose me to.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I found our discussions about the many novels we read throughout the course very enlightening. I particularly appreciated the theoretical readings which accompanied the novels. I loved the liveliness and thoughtfulness of the class environment; I truly enjoyed coming to class every week.",
    "Yes! The novels are all amazing and have particular details about human experiences which are relatable to people of all races and cultures.",
    "Yes! As someone with no previous experience studying African history or literature, I was nervous to enroll in Fathers and Daughters. However, the books are actually very good, and professor shepard really allows you to develop your own interpretation. I completely recommend this course for anyone who doesn't mind reading 300 pages a week, and who is generally curious about non-western literature.",
    "Yes it was great to read some African literature.",
    "Yes! If you're curious about African lit, if you like books, if you can read, take it for sure!"
