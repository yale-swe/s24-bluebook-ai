    "This class is literally no work, but it's not worth it. You really will not learn anything. Just take a fun sounding lecture cred\/D. Professor Roemer is such a talented filmmaker, but he's a less astute scholar of film, and a lot of his ideas are really abstract and rooted in just his gut feelings, not any sort of history, psychology, or even media theory. I know the course description sounds interesting and it seems like it could be a great course, but I promise you it's not. You will read Freud and engage with it like a factual text. You'll also read his book, which is interesting but not particularly academic and is basically a recapitulation of the other three nonsense readings you'll do in the class. You'll talk way more than you've ever wanted about why Holocaust jokes are funny (the answer to that question is often \"They aren't\"). Also, the syllabus is all white men, which just gets to be tired by the end of the year. Seriously, take anything else, it's not worth the insanely light workload. You'll get to watch some fun films, but a three hour seminar cannot be carried on the back of the few good comedies you get to watch during the semester.",
    "Great class in which to watch some legendary films. Developed a newfound love for Chaplin, Marx Brothers, & finally got around to watching Pulp Fiction!",
    "I would recommend American Film Comedy to another student. The course work is easy, only 3 6-page papers and very little reading. Be forewarned that you watch silent movies for about 9 weeks, which gets pretty tedious.",
    "This is a decent American Studies seminar, but I left feeling like it could've been so much more. We spent fully half of the class studying Chaplin, which, while a worthy enterprise, did not make for a very expansive view of American Film Comedy. Perhaps if the course were adjusted to focus on early films, it would be more cohesive. That being said, if you're interested in the subject, you'll find lots to think about and discuss.",
    "This is a very chill class where you watch movies and talk about them, and do little outside work (three 6-page papers). Nonetheless, I had a few grievances about the syllabus: -far too much silent film (five-six weeks worth!) which was at times extremely boring. -literally only white men on the syllabus c.l.a.s.s.i.c.",
    "American Film Comedy is a great intro to film studies at Yale. It's just one 3 hour lecture-seminar-screening hybrid per week, instead of the usual two weekly lectures plus nighttime screening model, which keeps the class feeling low key but still very engaging. I loved the material-- Chaplin came to feel like an old friend-- and Prof. Roemer's off-the-cuff style lectures are enlightening and provide insight into not only the nature of comedy but also the history of the film industry and, sometimes, life itself.",
    "This is a crazy course that I don't think I would ever recommend to anyone. Michael Roemer seems brilliant and perhaps he might be, but his teaching style is basically to talk about whatever interests him and shush people who try to bring critical analysis to the films. This makes the class pretty gutty, which I suppose is nice, and you do get to watch some great (although all white male directed) films, but in general everything about this class left me wanting something better.",
    "I honestly don't think I'd recommend taking this course. Roemer is an eccentric professor who has many life lessons to teach you but watching some of the films was painfully boring and though the prospect of talki about what makes you laugh seem exciting, only about half the films made me laugh. It is a really relaxed environment which is good and different from many other Yale courses, but unless the syllabus chnages, I wouldn't reccomend the course."
