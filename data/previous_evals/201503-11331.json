   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the history of medicine and public health, with just the right amount of reading and writing work. The global focus is entirely appropriate given recent historiographical trends, and I very much appreciated the opportunity to learn from such a generous and thoughtful instructor.",
    "Fantastic class for those interested. Not necessarily a class for those who shy away from speaking",
    "I would highly recommend this course. This is an excellent graduate-level introductory course for anyone interested in the history of medicine, public health, disease, and the body.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "Highly recommend--a book-a-week reading class examining issues of craft in HSHM.",
    "HSHM is a good overview of the field of the history of science and medicine. It provides a good balance of foundational and more experimental works in the field. I would recommend it to anyone interested in investigating science and medicine from a humanities perspective.",
    "This course offers a useful overview of the major issues, both methodological and thematic, in the history of medicine and public health. I would recommend it to any student engaging with science, medicine or public health in their dissertation research."

   "comments": [
    "This course was excellent training for orals. Even more importantly, it inspired me to consider more global topics for my research. I owe Professor Warner a great deal!",
    "This course allowed me to understand various aspects of medicine and public health. The dialogues allowed me to speak openly about the subject matter and add my personal insight.",
    "The course was very useful to understand how histories of public health and medicine have been written successfully and unsuccessfully. What sources and methodologies have been used and how, as a student, I could go about researching and writing my own work.",
    "This course provided me with a good overview of the field of the history of science and medicine, some of the methodology and theory of which I may apply to my research. The course also introduced me to specific books that I may incorporate into my research.",
    "This course provided me with practical and methodological insights into the discipline. It enhanced my knowledge of the field, a necessary component to writing a satisfactory dissertation."
