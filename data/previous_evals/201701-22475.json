    "Thinking about referentiality, relationship between fiction and reality, sentimentality. Writing with more clarity and intensive, rigorous close reading",
    "My knowledge of 18th\/19th century literature grew drastically. The intense political relationship with literature during this time period framed my insights on potential \"public projects\" and the way in which literature can positively impact outside of the English classroom. I also found there to be an intimate connection between the socio-political climate of the time period and modern day. There were so many moments when reading the assigned texts that I felt the threads joining us from past to present."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Jill is an incredible reader of student work. She gives so much detailed feedback that I really appreciated Weaknesses: Our class size was too large, and it was difficult to get a word in during discussion. I wish there was more time and space to think before speaking. Sometimes the conversation did not feel cohesive - too many different strands being pursued at once.",
    "A very well developed and thought out course.",
    "Strengths: The professor, the syllabus, and the importance placed on connecting to our world through the literary. Weaknesses: I think the class size was a little large for a seminar. I felt at times that certain voices were not heard just simply due to a few voices that were overpowering and the amount of people who desired to speak. I think it would have been helpful to have a few more secondary readings directly addressing the texts on the syllabus to help in providing one or two perspectives on how to approach the text. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the assigned reading!",
    "There were so many things to love about this class! I have now been happily introduced to several new, exciting writers in my period, and am delighted to have become more acquainted with them. I really appreciated having the public conversation project, and the class we spent at the YCBA seeing the exhibition. Most of all, however, I really appreciated the level of feedback I got on all of my work--even the ungraded short conversation project! I've never had this level of interaction with my papers, from macro to micro-level commentary, and it is so very, very much appreciated! My only comment about the \"weaknesses\" of the course was that I did feel that the class was a little bit too big--it felt difficult to speak up at times, but that's also on me to be more assertive!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if one is interested in the readings on the syllabus. I found some of the readings a bit boring.",
    "Yes. Dr. Campbell is engaging and helpful and has developed an interesting course that works well as a whole.",
    "I would recommend this course to all. It is a course that every student can gain perspective within and become a better scholar. I received the BEST feedback on my writing in this course and I believe it has provided me the widest sphere to consider the role and purpose of literature and the teaching of literature.",
    "Yes!",
    "I think this course has some great readings that you don't really find compiled in such a way in any other course. The focus on how the writers write and wether their tactics are efficient in creating a reaction\/change is also quite unique. The difficulty lies in the way students react to the material. I think class discussions fell back on classic tropes of english seminar courses, where each student essentially wanted to prove he\/she knew something or had some insight on the material. I think that's a big failure of the course, which could easily have led into real heated discussion about the topics and the more often than not failure of the writers. I think that would have made this course really incredible, if students were more critical and less self-serving in class discussion."
