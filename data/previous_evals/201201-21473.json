    "I enjoyed the class. The material covered in this class is so relevant to the problems facing our generation. The material is genuinely interesting. Nonetheless, very few people show up to lecture, which is disheartening. The beginning of the course started out very dry, but it definitely gets more and more interesting as the lectures go on. Really take time to talk to Professor Schell. He is an expert on this field, and he is very approachable. His lecture style is very dry though, but you get used to it. The essay was not too difficult to write, but it is worth a huge portion of your grade, so devote a lot of time to it!! The readings were very long and expensive, but definitely read as much as you can or else you won't gain much.",
    "Interesting Material, sucky professor. Grade in the class totally depends on your TA and how hard they grade the paper",
    "This is a very fascinating class, and I absolutely loved it. I started taking the class to balance my tough schedule, and I ended up getting completely absorbed into it--reading materials are just fascinating (seriously, do the readings--or you're missing out), and I had a blast taking this class.If you have trouble staying focused in the class, move to one of the front rows and turn off your internet--otherwise, you are missing a lot. His lectures are really well put and Professor Schell is just an incredible person. Also, drop by his office hour and get to know him--he is very friendly, accessible, knowledgeable in the field and talented.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this class.",
    "Good. Not too much work. You can get notes for it from like anybody.",
    "Definitely recommend this class!",
    "lots of information not a lot of work. Paper graded fairly and no homework",
    "Yes. As a whole, it is a good history class.",
    "Lectures are a bit boring but the professor is a brilliant man. Very little work.",
    "Interesting topics, lecture can be a bit boring though.",
    "Basic overview of nuclear dilemmas and political influences.",
    "Take this class, but it is not a gut",
    "No no no. Don't do this to yourself. It's a waste of your credit, your time and your effort.",
    "Two thumbs down. Take The Cold War instead.",
    "Recommended, particularly if you haven't taken a class on the Cold War\/Nuclear Age.",
    "It is a class discussing the political policies and the moral implications of having nuclear weapons.",
    "Take this course. You need to take this course.",
    "sure",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Cool info, not too stressful, you can easily do well if you try when it comes time.",
    "It is an easy credit that doesn't require much work. The essay is a lot of work for about two weeks and you need to study hard for the final, but other than that you can slack off a lot of the year. Though if you want to focus it is an incredibly interesting class if you choose to do the reading and pay attention.",
    "It is great as a gut class if you are ok with your grade depending on only two things. I really want to stress this. Your grade will depend on 2 things.",
    "Take this course if you have access to the study guide that's been passed around for years - it's very helpful. If you have an interest in nuclear war, that's also a requirement as his lectures are really hard to sit through. Most see this as a gut class, and it can be, if you play it right. Beware into thinking, though, that you don't have to go to class or do the readings and still do well.",
    "Great if you're a PoliSci major",
    "Very easy class. Limited work",
    "Gut",
    "Dilemmas is actually really interesting material, presenting in a fun easy setting",
    "Prof. Schell is super kind and knowledgeable. 50% midterm essay (12-15 pages), 50% final exam. Both are not bad at all. When you have a draft, try to talk to Prof. Schell during office hours, especially if you chose a topic of your own. Come to lectures and take good notes (I made the mistake of not listening very closely), so you don't need to do the readings (I'm serious: you don't need to do the readings). I will say I entered this class thinking that the nuclear dilemmas were largely irrelevant to my own life. I am happy that I came out of this class more aware of the history, current events, and both's import for our future. Remember, this class is what you make of it. Just go to class and focus for the hour or so.",
    "Good class for understanding the dilemmas of the nuclear age.",
    "This is a great class. It is a thorough review of all the major developments of the nuclear era and will certainly challenge your mind.",
    "absolutely",
    "If you're looking for a low pressure, yet interesting, course this course is for you. There are basically two big assignment in the class: the 12-15 page midterm paper and the final. Given enough preparation for both, they are not bad at all. Schell's lectures can get long and drawn out at times, but he does convey an amazing amount of interesting information in them. Doing all the readings isn't as necessary if you plan on attending the lectures, where Schell discusses most of the central concepts you will be tested on.",
    "Yes",
    "A large lecture",
    "Easy A, no work.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course.",
    "The class gives an understanding, and analysis to, the dilemmas of the nuclear age, starting from the Manhattan Project all the way to the most recent events. Prof Schell gives his expert opinion and analyses of the dilemma. I would recommend this class to anyone who is mildly interested in the topic, which should be everyone considering this is probably one of the most important topics in political science.",
    "Take this class if you want a gut. Most of this class didn't show up once until the final and I can understand why; Schell just drones on during his lectures and it is impossible to stay focused. Luckily, the entire class is a paper and a final.",
    "The course material is interesting, and I would recommend the class to another student. There is a lot of reading for the course, but the information is pretty interesting.",
    "This class is NOT A GUT, if you do any of the work. Schell assigns 300-500 pages of reading a week, but nobody does it. This makes people say the class is easy, no work, etc. But really it just makes this class very risky. There are only two grades, each worth 50% - a 12 page paper and the final. The final was a lot of spitting back information, but it took a LOT of studying to make up for a semester of not doing the reading. The paper is not hard to write, but you will have no idea how you'll do until you get it back because you don't have a TA and don't know who will grade your paper. So basically this class is potentially easy but really a HUGE RISK.",
    "great class, depressing subject matter that the professor tries to walk every through",
    "Take if you want an easy class. One paper, and one final exam.",
    "Good class, pretty easy and very straightforward.",
    "Well, I took this class because I was under the impression that it was the biggest gut ever (from past reviews). It's kind of true. No one ever goes to lecture, I tried to go to them but I'd just fall asleep, and work piled up in my 5.5 credit schedule (Orgo, Linear Algebra, etc...) so I stopped going as frequently too. It's great that there are only 2 meetings a week, and he often let us go before the hour and 15 minutes was up. Schell's lectures are painfully boring, and its so obvious that he reads from the same notes every year. No one does the reading so don't waste your time .he grading is 50% paper (due during midterms) and 50% final. The paper was graded decently and I did it the weekend before, and the final was pretty easy considering I (and everyone) just studied the night before. To sum up, a really gutty class although I'm not sure I got an A. Great if you have a tough schedule...and make sure you know people in it, it matters come the final.",
    "Easy A if you put in the work, you can end up screwing yourself over though.",
    "Basically a big lecture that is not as bad as people say.",
    "This class is great to take.",
    "It is what it is. I don't especially recommend it, unless it fulfills certain requirements of what you are looking for in a class.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting course and there is not too much work",
    "I would highly recommend this course as a 5th class. There is not a lot of work and the material is relatively interesting if you choose to do it. The midterm was not too hard to write and the final was extremely fair.",
    "GUT.",
    "If a student wants to learn a lot about the nuclear age without working excessively, then nuclear dilemmas is a must take.",
    "It is very easy course and you don't have to do much work at all.",
    "Class consists of a final and a paper due before spring break. Most people do not go to lectures, but i learned a lot about a very interesting subject. Readings are interesting but not really mandatory.",
    "Dilemmas can be a hit or a miss. I'd recommend it if you make sure you have notes and books handy, and especially if you are interested in the material. I wasn't particularly interested in nuclear history and policy before this course, but I found myself truly enjoying the lectures. It's safe to say this class opened my eyes and taught me something new, which is exactly something a college course should do. In addition, the workload isn't too bad at all.Warning: The exam terms are quite unfair.",
    "Yes. Interesting class. Not much work. Boring Professor for sure though.",
    "Yes because it is very interesting and I learned a lot from the class that I didn't know before",
    "take it for credit"
