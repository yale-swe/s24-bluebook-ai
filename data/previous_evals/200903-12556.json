   "comments": [
    "Really Great! It's not that hard and it's really interesting. You also get a good mix in the class of econ majors and people who know nothing about econ, which means interesting discussions, but no pressure.",
    "Great course. Lots of business case studies. Prof Rae also uses the Socratic method to teach so try to keep up with the reading.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is so interesting and relates to the real world. Whenever I read the newspaper I read about an issue that we talked about in this class. Challenging if you don't know some business-related issues and terms but you'll learn them. There is not too much work either (3 short reading responses, a midterm and a final, plus discussion section). Doug Rae is a great, dynamic professor. I loved this class.",
    "A must take course!",
    "Definitely take it - very relevant and thought provoking with a very reasonable workload.",
    "I really really liked the structure of the course. It was engaging and interesting. We covered a bit of everything, from the basic fundamentals of theories of capitalism and production, to SOM case studies used by actual MBA students, to the development-related materials towards the end that forced us to compare capitalism in a global context. I also really liked the interdisciplinary nature of the course, and the varied perspectives it gave me on economic systems as a whole. It was also pretty cool to have distinguished guests come in every few weeks to give us their personal takes on some of the cases we read.Take it if you are interested in interdisciplinary subjects (econ\/political science\/environmental studies -- I was skeptical there were so many cross-listings for this course but it actually fits into them all), if you are considering working at some big consulting\/finance firm, if you are considering working in development aid in impoverished nations, or if you're thinking about majoring in EP&E or getting an MBA, or if you just show up for the first day of class and enjoy Professor Rae's teaching style. Good course, I learned a lot.",
    "As a junior econ and poli-sci major, I learned nothing new in this course that I didn't already learn before or couldn't readily think up on my own. Exceedingly disappointing.",
    "Yes, yes, yes! Take this course at least once when you are at Yale, you won't regret it. It is cross-listed under about four majors and the Professor will keep you entertained. Trust me.",
    "This is an awesome class. I went to the first lesson without knowing clearly what capital is. We learnt a great deal of economic theory and business cases. By the end of the course, the way I think about economic\/ political issues became more systematic.",
    "Take it if you like Econ and Poli Sci.",
    "In many regards, I think this should be a required course; it's fundamentally important to understanding modernity, and sheds light on multiple disciplines. Also, it's not that difficult, highly engaging, and a ton of fun.",
    "Take it, it's easy",
    "This class was a look at capitalism from the view of cases and concepts. I would recommend this class to people that already know a good deal about capitalism and want to take a deeper look into capitalism by way of case studies.",
    "It is an ok class. Interesting readings and business cases. The business cases is by far the best, and it is actually amazing.However, the themes in the class are loosely connected.",
    "AMAZING AMAZING class. I am considering switching to either the political science or economics major (from science) just because I found this course so enlightening. A must if you are considering going into finance.You must take this. Lots of ppl my year did it credit D which was probably good for the grade. But be warned if you do atrociously he will give you a D!",
    "It is basically a mixture of theories and case studies and is very interesting to see the theories applied to real life. I'd recommend because it's very applicable to the world.",
    "This class talks about why capitalism may be the best system. It does mention all of the problems and criticisms and is definitely a class worth taking. Doug Rae is great and will continue to be that way throughout the semester.",
    "Don't be a chump. Take this class.",
    "It is not as interesting as it may seem, but at least the work isn't so bad. 3 short essays, midterm, final.",
    "Good class if you want to get a taste of what SOM might be like.",
    "Any class with Doug Rae is awesome.",
    "Take the course! You'll learn about how the world works.",
    "good survey course on capitalism and some of its pitfalls",
    "I would TOTALLY recommend this course for anyone who has an interest in learning about what's behind most of the articles in the NYT every day. The work load is not easy, but at least there are many assignments\/tests so that the final turns out to only be worth 35% of the final grade.",
    "YES - Absolutely take this class, you will not regret it.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. You learn a lot about how capitalism works as well as about business in general. The professor is a baller.",
    "Great course, excellent selection of readings. The final exam covered the big ideas of the course rather than the little details that everyone will eventually forget anyways. This is the way it should be.",
    "Yes, because everything you learn can be applied to everyday life, and isnt that what matters?",
    "An introduction to how the capitalist system works.",
    "Great class! Take it! A very broad topic narrowed down to very interesting and relevant points. Doug Rae is fabulous.",
    "A relatively easy political science credit that gives students a good introduction to finance and globalization.",
    "The class was a little all over the place. I signed up for it thinking it would be like an introduction to a business class that uses business cases. In the beginning it was like this, but after the first month, not so much. I felt as though a lot of the information was over my head especially since we covered so many different things and devoted so little time to them. Nevertheless, I'm glad I took it because I definitely learned something. More about implementation and real world situations than theory. The theory is there, but it's background.",
    "It's an interesting lecture from which you take away more than you initially expect. Much of this has to do with the breadth of the subject matter. Prof. Rae is a great lecturer and the course is generally relaxed.",
    "Definitely take this class! You learn a lot about the capitalist world through enticing readings, compelling business cases,and a dynamic professor.",
    "Amazing super easy course. Take it.",
    "The course was a general introduction to capitalism.It was pretty interesting at the beginning when we were learning theory, but rapidly petered out in the last four or five weeks. Its a survey course so you come way feeling like you didn't learn a whole bunch.The section on capitalism and poverty has the most potential but was organized in a poor fashion. I wish we had spent more time discussing the Global South.Section was pretty bad. No one did the readings and there was no discussion involved.Its also pretty easy. A good fifth or sixth class...",
    "This class does not have much work, and most of the lectures are interesting. It is not a can't-miss class, but you won't regret it if you take it.",
    "This is a very good class, but seems most geared to those who don't have a background in economics. Since I do not, I found the mixture of theory and cases to be very educational and I learned a lot about the way a capitalist economy works. I especially enjoyed what we learned about development, though week to week the topics seemed rather disjointed. And this is definitely not the class if you've taken micro and macro and expect to learn a lot - if you don't mind being skeptical of the theories, though, the cases are definitely worthwhile.Also, don't be afraid to be creative with your writing! He'll mention it a lot, but actually DO it. it's fulfilling and you'll get better grades!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload isn't too demanding and realistically you don't have to do all the readings (although I'd recommend reading the case studies). But for those students who need to read everything, the readings are very interesting. The course is really well taught, the lectures are interesting, the lectures are not too long, the material (for me) was novel (and if you are interested in the economics of developing countries the back half of the course in largely on that concept), and the courseload is manageable. Take this class.",
    "Take this class -- one of the most fun, most easy classes I've taken at Yale. Not much intellectual rigor, but the appearance of a few semi-famous guest lecturers more than makes up for that. The reading list is worth knowing about. And Prof. Rae is always engaging.",
    "Take it, definitely.",
    "Teaches you some important business concepts, not a lot of work.",
    "Take the class as your fifth credit because the workload is not much. At the same time the material is very interesting and the Professor is a genius. With the case study method and guest lecturers, it is highly recommended.",
    "A GREAT class in terms of learning. But you could get an A just studying from wikipedia, and not doing the readings.",
    "It was an entertaining class with some interesting material, though some will find that its treatment of most topics is fairly surface level. The reading list was great. The cases were sometimes really interesting but often didn't add too much to your understanding of a certain concept. Doug Rae was an awesome professor and a really engaging lecturer, but his assignments were open ended to the point of being frustrating.",
    "Not too sure if I'd recommend. Capitalism with Professor Rae is fascinating, while not the most effective course. The readings are very interesting. Professor Rae is very knowledgeable and insightful. He could make his lectures more focused and better managed (time) and organized. And sometimes the way he facilitates guest speaker talks is not very effective or relevant. I was looking forward to having great guest speakers but that turned out to be weak. You do get a plenty of chances to have fresh concepts widen and challenge your understanding\/view of capitalism. The occasional use of business school cases was the most interesting and helpful part of the course.",
    "Good class. You learn about a variety of interesting topics, and you can really see how the theory, business cases, and current events all fit together. Though there are 3 papers, a midterm, and a final, the workload never feels overwhelming (the papers are 3-4 pages, and 70% of the final is take-home). Prof. Rae brings in a lot of interesting speakers. Beware, though, if you are one of those rare people at Yale who is not planning on going into finance, because you will constantly feel like the only person at Yale who is not planning to do so. I'm an IS major, and I thought this was a good class to fulfill the IPE requirement."
