    "1) The readings were unnecessary and bear no relation to the lectures or homework assignments.2) The professor is admirable. He comes with a wealth of knowledge. The problem is that he was inefficient at structuring the actual coursework. The schedule was not adhered to. The deadlines were not adhered to. The instances where he was supposed to e-mail the students information was always significantly (and inconveniently) delayed. He seemed to structure the course a certain way because he thought he \"had to\" as opposed to fitting in organically with the material he was presenting.",
    "This is the best agriculture class I have ever had. And we have a great teacher! Yale should hire prof. Gollin!",
    "For future courses in this area, it would be much more helpful to have either an Economics PhD or someone with background in the subject area.",
    "The first month was very slow and there was a lot of work towards the end.",
    "For Agriculture and the Environment -- Professor Gollin is an _excellent_ teacher. He puts a great deal of effort into his lectures, and really cares whether students understand the material and have a good experience in the course. He stands out among professors at Yale for this.",
    "Course structure was not organized well and ad-hoc.",
    "I had high hopes for this class. While I found the subject matter very interesting, I think the pace was way too slow. We had some class sessions that were jam packed with interesting info, and others that were terribly boring, without much new material covered. I think that Doug is an excellent lecturer and teacher, but that he was too quick to indulge certain students' commentary. I would have liked the class to be structured more tightly, with a concrete schedule that we could stick to. This was lacking.",
    "I audited the class, so I was not an active participant. I wish I could have attended more classes because my friends all seemed to enjoy the course, but I become overloaded with work for my other courses. Apologies! I wish this class was offered in the spring so that students could take econ their first semester and then take this after. That was why I audited the class--I didn't have the recommended preparation in econ."

    "The teacher was very flexible and open to suggestions.",
    "Happening! F&ES has an important gap in its curriculum and this is agriculture and the environment. This class covered the economic side of it. I also think that the professor, not being an environmentalist, was able to give a very refreshing point of view in all issues within this topic and how non-environmentalist perceive them.",
    "The instructor was intelligent and attentive to the various interests of the students in class. Flexibility on the topics addressed in assignments made the course a great way to explore individual interests related to agriculture.",
    "Learn to think problem from different perspectives",
    "The Professor. He has a deep knowledge in the subject area and made a special effort to help us thing about issues of agriculture from new angles. I especially appreciated that he was willing to challenge current paradigms in environmental thought such as about biofuels and local foods- I think that this class gave all of us both valuable information and new tools with which to process information.",
    "The class was very relevant and used current data.",
    "Agriculture&the Environment - The subject matter. This topic is one which is incomplete if looked at from any single angle, and we managed to cover the wide spectrum of essential issues in good depth.",
    "Only agriculture class available at FES.",
    "The dedication to agricultural economics.",
    "It's the only course focused on the economics of agriculture, which is an area many students are looking to gain experience in. The lectures were interesting and covered a variety of important topics.",
    "the instructor is very considerate!",
    "The professor was extremely flexible in tailoring the course to fit the interests of the students. There was a perfect mix of economics and history\/description of agricultural trends to keep the class interesting and relevant.",

    "completely disorganized. didn't follow syllabus. went WAY too slow. problem sets never discussed in class.",

    "Organization.",
    "The beginning. It was very slow. The problem sets very long. Too much in the second have, compared to almost no work at the beginning.",
    "Agriculture and the Environment - The one thing that would be useful, the next time the course is taught, would be to have a better idea of which of the readings on the syllabus we'll need to get through for each class. I felt a little bit lost in the readings a couple of times, but in all fairness we were warned that this might happen, since it was the first run-through for the course.",
    "Organization, solid class structure.Forming a group based on who you know in the class was not professional. TA or the professor should have given the topics or at least disclosed who's working on what topics so that team formation should be based on one's interest.",
    "Structure, organization.",
    "Since this was the first time this course was offered, there were some kinks to work out. The readings could have been better. I would have also preferred for the group project to have come earlier in the semester so it was not timed just before the final exam.",
    "The course is designed for more discussion, however, the class scale is too big for that.",
    "Pacing. We fell behind schedule with the course material, and towards the end we lost track of what we were supposed to learn. But luckily the final helped summarize the important concepts.",
    "BETTER organization"

    "This fits both into the energy and development aspects of my program. Professor Gollin was great about letting my pursue my interests in bioenergy from the agriculture perspective. Also, this class exposes students to very interesting and relevant aspects of development economics and the role of agriculture in development. I think it is great that FES is offering more classes like this, and I hope they continue to do so.",
    "For people who want to want to focus on policy analysis, i thought this was a very good course. Also, i thought that for people interested in doing work in developing countries like me, it is very relevant.",
    "Agriculture and Environmen - This course is an important subject area for me, since I'm focusingon agriculture in my dissertation. I'm a first-year phd student coming from a pretty solid background in agricultural development issues, and this course was helpful in giving me a concrete framework to put some of my past learning into, and hopefully to carry forward as I do my own research.",

The advantage, in this case, was getting to learn a great deal more about a subject area that interested me than I would've learned had I undertaken the project on my own.",

    "Go with the flow; ask questions; and make sure you get as much out of the problem-sets as possible. Also -- do the readings! Although this is a lecture-based course, one of the best parts of it is the professor's willingness to engage in discussion with students. You'll get a lot more out of it if you have your own questions and critiques of the models presented in the readings to bring up in class.",
