    "learned the fundamentals of general equilibrium theory",

    "In-depth treatment of general equilibrium theory - a more mathematically rigorous expansion of the general equilibrium unit in Intermediate Microeconomics. It takes work to understand the intuition behind the concepts taught in the course, but it was satisfying to get them eventually.",
    "Learnt a great deal about General Equilibrium Theory",
    "Intermediate micro on steroids and then some. Learned the fundamentals of general equilibrium theory and applied what we learned to various models. Math is not necessarily hard but concepts can be difficult at first.",
    "You learn general equilibrium theory, which is helpful but not particularly practical.",
    "This class gives you an intense understanding of a number of economic models and is a core part of learning about mathematical economics.",
    "Learned how to solve problems related to competitive\/general equilibrium, Arrow Debreu equilibrium, Social Security, etc.",
    "A complete understanding of general equilibrium theory in economics and its applications."

   "comments": [
    "A better TA who understood the material in a more comprehensive way would have improved my experience.",
    "Professor Bewley whispers into the board and you cannot hear anything during lecture. It makes lectures a waste of time unless you are completely zoned in and manage to grab a seat in the front row.",
    "the textbook is very very well written (thanks truman!) and the material\/theory is very important. however, it is dense and lectures were not always the most related to problem sets.",
    "The lectures and problem sets were quite different. I wish lectures covered more problem-solving.",
    "Weakness: Lecture, it's very difficult to learn anything because the professor speaks waaay too quietly. Strengths: the textbook and general course material is linear and well-organised so you won't be confused about what you have to learn; the professor is a really nice guy and will take the time to explain things to you in detail if you approach him; there are loads of practice midterms and finals that help you get accustomed to the style of examination so you'll rarely be surprised. Though, make sure you get your hands on a solutions manual, it's key to learning the class material and understanding the homework",
    "Truman is a very helpful and the problem sets were helpful, but I wish lecture could have included less proofs and more examples.",
    "The course is really good at making you learn more economics and economic models. The professor understands the material better than anyone, but its sometimes hard to understand what hes saying in class. He speaks at a soft tone and doesnt stop very often for questions. When you read the book, you get a lot more out of the class than when you dont.",
    "Lectures were pretty ineffective. Most of the time we just sat in class copying what Bewley wrote on the board, which was pretty much the exact same as his textbook. Lectures hard to follow. Definitely had to read the book on your own and do problems to understand.",
    "Very cut and dry course, with the material centered around the content in Professor Bewley's textbook. Lectures were very theoretical\/proof-based and contained few examples. Were not reflective of the material on homework and midterms.",
    "More examples---either in class or in section---would be helpful, e.g. when toward the end of the course Prof. Bewley began providing step-by-step roadmaps\/guidelines\/algorithms for solving the various models. They were particularly useful when the exposition made clear what each step had to do with the models. Sections were not helpful; since solutions were posted, summaries of this week's lessons (e.g. as above) geared toward the current psets would be far more helpful than going over last week's.",
    "The subject and theory are very interesting, but I felt like there was a huge gap in learning how to apply the theory we learned to solving the problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "If you're an Econ+Math major, you don't have a choice. If you're not, I don't see why you would voluntarily sign up for this.",
    "If you don't have to take 350, don't take 350. Yes it's basically just harder micro but the way this class is taught makes it so painful. I couldn't wait for this class to be over.",
    "take it if you're and econ\/math major because you have to or if you def want to go to econ grad school",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in a more rigorous treatment of the material in Intermediate Micro, who are looking to continue studying Economics in the future. It is a great introduction to advanced material taught by a Professor that defined and refined the field, and who really cares about his students (even tries to learn everyone's name, and mostly succeeds by the end of the course).",
    "Take this only if you have to.",
    "Certainly, It's a very difficult course but you learn a lot if you put the time in.",
    "If you're taking this class you're probably either Econ\/Math or Applied Math-Econ so you know what you're getting into. Definitely will learn some things but at times it will feel repetitive.",
    "I'd recommend if it you're interested in micro theory but with more examples, or if you have to take it. Professor Bewley knows his stuff, and is very helpful in office hours.",
    "If youre an Econ Math major you need to take the course. If youre applied math, Id consider starting Credit D.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major. If you're just majoring in Econ, would recommend other courses out there. The problems in this class are interesting but not super well explained\/taught. Mediocre class.",
    "Everyone in the class is taking it as a required course, mostly for Econ and Math. Good prep for grad school, no reason otherwise to take it."
