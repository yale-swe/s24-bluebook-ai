   "comments": [
    "If you're even looking at this class, that means that you've advanced to the point in your Russian language study where this is probably the only organized class you can take this semester. It's a really good class - Professor Titus is hilarious and fair. The reading assignments are really manageable and the writing assignments - as long as the format of 4 1-2 page essays as opposed to one 10 page essay is maintained - are also not bad at all, especially considering Professor Titus lets you turn in rough drafts which she then corrects and returns to you...all but guaranteeing a good grade if you put in the effort. If you're even thinking about taking this class, do it. You won't regret it.",
    "In this class, we got to read short stories from Pushkin, Lermontov, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov and Bunin and discuss them in class. We spent a lot of time on Dostoevsky using the excellent annotated reader for his short story, \"The Meek One\". The course work included writing reading responses (in Russian) of one or two pages as well as a presentation, so it was very manageable. Julia is an engaging and friendly teacher - I usually don't talk very much in Russian classes but she helped me find my tongue. I would recommend this class not only for gaining a basic acquaintance with notable Russian authors, but also for improving composition and oral communication skills.",
    "This is a great course for students of the Russian language with good reading skills that want to improve their speaking and writing skills as well as getting some knowledge in Russian literature under their belts.",
    "A fun and accessible class. Would highly recommend!",
    "A nice, easygoing class for both heritage and advanced Russian students. Read some classic short stories, have some solid conversations and write short responses."
