    "I took it because it was the next class, and I didn't want to stop taking Chinese, but now I think it might have been better to try to design an independent study, which is what I plan to do next year. It would have been good, as much as I hate it, to do more drilling in class--I can recognize and understand the vocab and grammar we learned but quickly forget how to use it. Furthermoe, it would be nice to do more hard-hitting political topics, but that might just be me.",
    "Yes, if you want to keep learning chinese, you should take this course",
    "Take it if you're on the Chinese track at Yale, especially if you're looking to do a Light Fellowship. It won't change your life or revolutionize your Chinese, but it does keep your language ability at a decent plateau during the hectic school year.",
    "No, I really wouldn't. If you can just skip this level and go to one of the upper level courses. I came back from PIB, and I didn't take the first semester of this course, and it was no loss. You really don't learn anything, I don't think I even maintained what I learned over the summer.The course was boring, had no direction, coherence, or structure, but it still managed to be a lot of work. Yes, we learned some new vocabulary, memorized some new characters, red some texts, but because the course had no overarching structure it was impossible to retain any of that information. It became an unpleasant chore.Shen Laoshi was very nice, she was helpful and always available by email, but she wasn't really an inspiring teacher. Most classes involved her lecturing off power point slides and our so called \"discussion classes\" never really worked because people rarely had anything to say about our exceedingly uninteresting texts. She didn't really get us talking or practicing speaking in class. I personally feel like the only way I become comfortable with new words and grammar is to practice using them, and we really didn't do that. She also almost never corrected our tones. On the one hand it was nice to never feel singled out, but its hard to actually make any progress in a language without a demanding instructor.Pretty much the only positive thing I got out of this class were the half hour weekly TA sessions. Yichen was a fantastic TA, and I always enjoyed having discussions with her.",
    "I would recommend it. Helps to maintain my Chinese. Workload is really manageable. 2 Midterms and a Final, and then various assignments that aren't too heavy. Shen laoshi was great to work with."
