   "comments": [
    "Take it. Easy, required for Galois.",
    "I've heard it can be a difficult course with some professors. This semester, it was a joke. Lectures were interesting and engaging, but problem sets were 10-20 minutes at most. And there were only seven of them, with the lowest grade dropped. Tests took less than half the allotted time.",
    "I had heard 350 under Prof. Casson was a grind, but the class under Professor Kapranov was one of my favorites. Prof. Kapranov seems like a naturally kind guy and presented the material in a clear way with a great attitude. Asking questions was easy in this class, and Professor Kapranov answered very well. His teaching style was likewise very clear; he very helpfully explained his general idea as he went about a proof, and kept the class with him. In addition, Prof. Kapranov didn't create a high-stress atmosphere; most of the problems assigned were fun while also illustrating the power of the tools in question. Overall the course presented algebra in a great light. Recommended under Kapranov.",
    "If it is taught by Professor Kapranov, by all means go for it. Professor Kapranov makes the course as accessible as possible to everyone, and does not go off tangent to cover more complicated stuff; that is, he really sticks to the CORE of all different areas, and attempts to ensure that we get the fundamental ideas firmly. As a consequence, it is not a stressful class at all unlike most other Math classes.Also, Professor Kapranov is extremely accessible to allhis students, and is a genuinely nice person. Get to know him. And take his class.",
    "Algebra is a great class for math students and anyone with an interest in abstract math. It is pretty accessible since it doesn't require too much knowledge going in. I really enjoyed the material; it is a very different treatment of math than anything I had done up to this point. Kapranov is a very clear lecturer and covers the material at a good pace. He doesn't assign much work, however, so the burden is on the student to make sure they actually keep up with and learn the material.",
    "Not a lot of work. The lectures are a good survey of groups, rings and fields. I assume that if you're looking at this class you already know whether you have to take it or not. But if you're someone who's looking for a low-stress and interesting high-level math class, take this one.",
    "350 with Kapranov is very, very little work. You'll learn plenty during lecture, but you'll be held to a very low standard on exams and homeworks, limiting the amount you might like to learn.",
    "This course is pretty interesting. Kapranov was always willing to answer questions and help with problem sets. It wasn't so much work, and he intentionally didn't make the work too hard. I enjoyed learning the material, though it is conceptually difficult.",
    "Algebra is a very interesting branch of mathematics. Especially if you've interested in math and been doing calculus for a while, you should take it. I found I liked algebra much more than analysis.Kapranov was a good lecturer, but homework was a joke. Literally, 2% of our grade was dividing 2 complex numbers. Self-study is important if you actually want to learn anything. Luckily, the Hernstein book is excellent.",
    "If you're planning on being a math major, you'll have to take this course. If you're planning otherwise but are interested in math, I would recommend this course, especially because it presents another side of math you probably haven't seen much of before. Algebra is central to modern math, and it's a shame most people don't ever study it. Studying algebra makes you think about math in new ways--more in terms of construction and structure.As for the course itself, it's not terribly difficult. Some of the concepts are indeed \"abstract,\" but it just takes a little getting used to. Some of the results are pleasing, and the course will expand the ways in which you think about math. Professor Kapranov does not give much homework at all, and the tests are straightforward. He provides numerous examples to illustrate concepts, which indeed helps one deal with some of the more abstract constructions.",
    "This class covers a lot of interesting material as an introduction to abstract algebra. Lectures are excellent, and there's very little work outside of class. This can be a problem, though, as the only way to fully understand the concepts is to do problems.",
    "This class, when taught by Kapranov, is an absolute joke compared to the other 300 level math classes I've taken here. Don't get me wrong, the professor is a phenomenal lecturer. He is funny and witty. However, you're not going to do much work in this class as a result of which you're not going to learn much. There were only six problem sets in total, the midterm was quite easy, and the final was a take home. While I'm unaware of his grading policies, I don't think it would be that hard to get a decent grade on this class. Do bear in mind that you're not going to learn much out of this course.",
    "Pretty simple abstract algebra class with Kaprsnov. You learn a lot, and the class is very relaxed and has a low workload for a math class. Nice and easy, you don't even have to go to class usually and can still get 100%... The homeworks were like high school level at times and it isn't very hard to get perfect on the psets, tests and take-home final. Definitely the best way to get an upper level math credit towards the major, and I'd recommend taking it if Kapranov teaches it again.",
    "Great class. 6 psets in total, each takes a max of two hours. Super easy midterm and a take home final. Definitely one of the easiest classes that counts for the math major. Take this if kapranov is teaching it.",
    "With Professor Kapranov (and not with Professor Casson, from what I've heard) 350 is a remarkably easy class. There were only six problem sets all semester; together they probably took a total of two hours to complete. The midterm was straightforward and the final was take-home. I worry that the class was too easy, in fact, so maybe consider taking it with another professor."
