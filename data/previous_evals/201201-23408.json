    "Questions 1,2, 6, 10:For a seminar class, I was disappointed with the lack of structure during discussion. The readings rarely provided enough fodder for meaningful discussion, and often time were not interrelated enough for the topic at hand. I found myself frustrated with the lack of relation among the articles assigned.At the beginning of class it was mentioned that lecture would be minimal, and that was promising. However, the lecture portion seemed to increase each week. For a seminar class, I feel like the discussion should be much more structured, and we should be trying to either dissect policy or issues, or reconstruct viable alternatives.",
    "I'm not sure this class should be taught again unless there's a prof who currently specializes in Africa. It would have been great to have an area expert teach the class. Same goes for the TA. Since so few people actually took the course, I'm not sure there's enough demand for it.Perhaps issue expert guest speakers could have made the class better.The discussions were a bit too loose. They often went in a number of tangential directions. It would have been better to have a shorter class (2 hours) that had a strong direction.The fact that the prof. announced the length of the paper 10 days before it was due was really not cool. There's no reason that the length couldn't have been made clear either from the beginning (in the syllabus) or when we presented our final paper proposals."
