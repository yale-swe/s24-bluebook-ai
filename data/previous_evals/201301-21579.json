    "Chinese 153 is for heritage students looking to expand their knowledge of Chinese. There are daily homework assignments which consist of learning new vocab and reading part of a textbook each day. There are listening and readings exercises assigned weekly and oral presentations and online \"chatrooms\" where students discuss the textbook material with the teacher and TA.",
    "Yes! Chinese 153 is an awesome course where you wil meet great people, learn Chinese from stellar educators, and experience a wonderful language seminar experience.",
    "It's a lot of work but worth it! My Chinese definitely improved significantly and I learned a lot more, and reinforced much of the first semester's class. Xu Laoshi is wonderful and really cares about her students. She also very effectively drills those important grammar structures into your head.",
    "Definitely take this if you've taken 152. I found this semester of Chinese to be even more rewarding than the fall semester.",
    "I would recommend it. It's the next course in the track of heritage Chinese and it teaches you what'd you expect to learn in a well thought-out and effective manner.",
    "Chinese 153 helps heritage students learn more written chinese and grammar. It really helps you learn how to write words you may know how to say but not write and structure sentences correctly."
