I actually really enjoyed doing the experiments, at least a lot more so than in gen chem labs, and there are only three big lab reports, the last of which is more article-reading-based than experimental-results-based. TA's make a difference in grading and expectations, but there's grade correction at the end, supposedly, to make up for this discrepancies. The final exam does studying and understanding procedures and mechanisms, but is overall fair.",

    "Greater understanding and application of organic chemistry reactions",
    "This was an absolutely excellent lab course. I learned so much about organic chemistry principles and even had fun doing it. The lab environment was safe but also lighthearted and I never felt judged for making mistakes. It definitely helped me develop knowledge about how to conduct myself in scientific environments taking notes, asking questions, making deductions.",
    "Refreshed\/practiced a lot of organic chemistry techniques from CHEM 222L",
    "I learned, through much repetition and observation, many important lab techniques to be implemented in an organic chemistry lab. The course followed along with the organic chemistry lecture series seamlessly and I enjoyed being able to put the material I was learning in class into practice in the lab.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Really, overall great lab course.",
    "Did not receive feedback on post lab assignments that would have allowed me to change my approach for the next postlab.",
    "This course was my favorite lab yet! It was fun to have my own bench and be synthesizing all different types of compounds. The teachers were great and so available. I can't really think of improvements.",
    "Solid course. Could be improved by having TA's all grade the same - I did the exact same thing both semesters and I scored around 7 points higher on post-lab assignments during the first semester.",
    "The strength of this course was Prof. DiMeglio. She was super helpful and hyper-organized! Maybe it's the culmination of many years of teaching this course, but every experiment was well-explained in the packet, and the expectations for what we would need to learn were very clearly laid out as well. The material covered in pre-lab lectures and in the Exam Study questions provided in the course packet was very consistent with the material tested in the final exam, which was great! The weakness of this course was that a lot of your laboratory experience depended heavily on the TA who was assigned to teach and lead your section. I know several other students taking this course who had widely varying experiences, from how helpful their TAs were when explaining things during the pre-lab lecture, to how harshly the TA graded compared to TAs from other sections or lab days. (Some of the grading could be quite arbitrary)",
    "strengths: you are an independent learner in the lab",
    "The TAs and lab staff are endlessly helpful. Overall, the course is extremely well organized, and the course packet explains just about everything you need to know to be able to complete each lab. By the end of the course, you will be able to breeze through all of the chemical methods that are used in organic chemistry labs.",
    "Some of the TAs were significantly better than other TAs. There were also some TAS who were much harsher graders than others, so I think there should be a better rubric because that can create an impact on someone's GPA without much reason.",
    "Straight forward labs. They should require that the students do all the lab questions each weeks so that the exam is easier.",
    "Doing more work in partners would take away from some of the monotony (like doing TLC every week) and would facilitate learning because we would have more time to interact with the TA or ask our partner and other students questions.",
    "The course has very interesting lab experiments, which I greatly enjoyed. I was always looking forward to the synthesis reactions that we were going to do in lab the next week. However, some of the grading was a little bit unclear, and took some getting used to. It really depends on your TA, and I was very lucky with my TA who was very clear in his grading and expectations.",
    "Great course, very self-paced which I appreciated.",
    "This course was really, really great. Fair workload, well selected experiments, incredibly sweet prof. My only thing I super dislike about the course is the final! We spend all semester physically conducting experiments and answering long answer questions, then we get hit with a multiple choice final! So strange. I feel like it should be a practical or a multiple choice practice test should be provided, rather than the long answer study questions.",
    "I really like how we do the same labs with different chemicals, really confirms our abilities to perform those techniques. I wasn't a fan of the final exam- would have preferred a lab practical, because the whole course was about technique.",
    "Strengths: -very involved and hands on -accuracy doesn't matter -get really immediate feedback Weaknesses: -not even in regard to ease of grading among TA's",
    "One strength of this class is that at times it matched up with what we were learning in Orgo Lecture II, which was helpful. I was also glad that this semester we mostly built upon lab techniques we learned in Orgo Lab I, so we could just practice what we already knew, which made the class less stressful. I do wish we had gotten to use a bigger variety of chemicals. For the final exam, it was difficult to get all of the reactions straight because they all used the same four or five basic compounds. More importantly, I think it would have been fun to synthesize a greater variety of things.",
    "Strengths: straight forward labs, well-made and well-explained modules. Weaknesses: not enough time spent going over mechanism, sometimes go over mechanisms earlier than covered in lecture",
    "This course is really good in terms of learning how to perform organic chemistry techniques and also at connecting chemistry concepts to lab work.",
    "The course is designed to cover a variety of different reactions and techniques. I do wish there were more continuity from lab to lab however.",
    "Always nice to see abstract concepts taught in lecture applied to the real world. Definitely a strength. Grading is also relatively transparent, and Dr. DiMeglio is great.",
    "No improvements; make sure you like your labmates.",
    "Strengths: the incredible prof. DiMeglio, the straightforward labs, the excellent lab space Weaknesses: Unclear questions in the post lab assignments and lots of variance between TA expectations between semesters.",
    "It's a good course in that there's a lot of instruction and help if you need it. Labs do get a bit repetitive after awhile since the same techniques are being used, but that's also a good thing since you gain familiarity",
    "It's great! Maybe a bit more diversity in the experiments as it felt like we did the same thing everyday.",
    "Weaknesses: repetitive experiments, emphasis on formatting rather than material, our of sync with lecture course Strengths: if you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world, they'll help you out. Dr. DiMeglio is great.",
    "Dr. DiNeglio rocks and the course is super interesting. Very chill as well, especially compared to general chemistry lab.",
    "Honestly, the class is amazing. I think the biggest weakness is the lack of transparency in how things are graded and how the class is curved, but that's not a big deal. The class was well structured and the experiments were educational and often times even fun.",
    "I feel that the Lab course overall is pretty well-structured and planned out. The lab manual and course packet are perfect and I can not think of anything that needs improvement.",
    "I think this is a good, structured course that any organic chemistry student should take. It helped in the lecture part of the course, as well.",
    "The class moves very well and the labs are designed at a good pace with plenty of interesting and useful tasks. I don't think much could be improved as the class really takes you from knowing nothing to feeling like an organic chemist.",
    "An overall good class with clear expectations and fair reasoning\/room for discussion when grading concerns arise - perhaps discrepancies across TA's could be improved, but this might be difficult since each TA has a different style of leading.",
    "Too much of the grading depends on the TF, which can cause major discrepancies between sections.",
    "Strengths include the clear experimental procedures, the booklet, and EP setup. Weaknesses include the structures of post labs reports (seemed kind of off topic and not rewarding) and the lack of intellectual engagement.",
    "Weaknesses: experiments can get a bit repetitive Strengths: Instructors are always very helpful if a mistake is made- never feel nervous to make a mistake.",
    "The TA's and the instructor are really great people and are very patient and willing to explain difficult concepts or techniques.",
    "An incredibly fun course that was helpful in learning theoretical chemistry concepts as well as actual applicable chemistry techniques that can be used in a lab.",
    "Strengths - very useful coursepacket, helpful weekly emails",
    "Great Course",
    "The course was well organized. Maybe coordinate more with the lectures to cover the same material simultaneously.",
    "For a course that's only worth half a credit, the class is a lot of work. On the other hand, it was an enjoyable class. I liked having it as a complement to the reactions we covered in lecture, and it was systematic and well-organized -- I was never surprised by assignments. I do wish it correlated more closely with the material we covered in class -- for instance, the last lab covered Fischer esterification, which we did about halfway through the lecture, and Diels Alder was one of the first reactions we covered in lecture but one of the last labs. I think I definitely would have understood what we were doing in lecture better if it matched with what we did in lab.",
    "Overall orgo lab is designed really well!",
    "The course is great, with a good balance of work. However, I think it (and other lab courses) is deserving of a full credit.",
    "i think some of the ways points are taken off don't emphasize the more important lessons that should be learned from the lab or the report, and make people feel less positively towards the course overall",
    "Too many of the experiments are the same. The collection of TLC and IR data became exceedingly tedious after performing it so many times. I would reccommend a single experiment that, like the NMR workshop, has students analyzing lots of IR spectra from different compounds at once. Additionally, the NMR workshop, particularly the EP, was very confusing and should be re-structured. The EP should be a worksheet that guides the students through the steps of reading H NMR spectra.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the course. It focused a little more on understanding the concepts and the reactions than first semester. The assignments generally felt like they were for our understanding and learning rather than busy work. One weakness was that some labs were very long (as in, I was unable to finish during the lab time) and others were much shorter, but they did not really alternate so sometimes I was multiple weeks behind on data collection. Also, we only learned how to analyze proton NMR spectra-- we never actually took an NMR spectrum during this course.",
    "The course was well organized and taught a lot of great info on synthesis and lab techniques. I think the grading was too focused on format of reports and such than how we actually performed in lab.",
    "In post lab assignments, some questions based on assigned literature are poorly worded and do not seem to be very relevant to the class material.",
    "This course was largely an extension of the first semester of Orgo lab. Each lab required following practically the exact same procedure with minor variations. I would have liked more variation to make things more interesting and to address more types of lab techniques, but all the practice was useful for ingraining techniques.",
    "Weakness: Grade discrepancies between the different TAs. Strength: Labs rarely take the full 4 hours.",
    "A strength was that I learned a lot about important laboratory techniques. A weakness is that we were not given enough time to study for the lab final and it would be extremely helpful for it to occur during finals period instead.",
    "I wish the course stressed understanding mechanisms a lot more. They're included in the course packets and mentioned in class but never quizzed or really understood by most I feel. Then in the final we're expected to know them all, or understand them, and I wish I did know them better. It would have created a stronger bond between the lab and the class.",
    "There was one lab that had an incredibly long reflux period that felt like a waste of time so if an alternative method could be used that would be beneficial. The course is engaging and it's fun to get to be active with hands-on tasks for a few hours every week. The assignments are well organized and the course packet is incredibly helpful and well thought through.",
    "While the labs are very helpful for learning organic chemistry concepts, their can be major improvements in the grading process. From speaking to students in other sections, it seems that the TAs all graded differently. If there already is a grading rubric, perhaps the students' grades should be curved somehow to compensate for individual differences in grading.",
    "Strengths: well organized, built upon concepts already learned, engaging experiments, wonderful instructor and TA Weaknesses: I think the chemical table for the EPs aren't that useful for understanding the lab. I think it would be better to narrow down the chemicals to the ones directly relevant to the reaction.",
    "The course is uniquely well-organized. It is sometimes difficult to gather all of the documents you need to complete assignments, but they are usually very clear and predictable.",
    "No weaknesses - really enjoyed the course",
    "Overall very well-run. Experiments got a bit repetitive, but no real complaints!",
    "It is a pretty straightforward lab, but I wish I received better feedback on the points taken off from my post lab assignments. I am still unclear in some cases exactly where I was wrong, or what the right answer should be.",
    "The strengths of this course were the clear lab manual and TF instructions. The weakness of the course if the final exam.",
    "Some strengths of the course include the variety of experimental and analytical techniques that are taught, the responsiveness of TAs to student concerns and scheduling conflicts, and the opportunity to read contemporary scientific literature as part of post-lab assignments. One weaknesses of the course is the inconsistency of grading criteria for lab reports for individual TAs and among different TAs.",
    "Professor DiMeglio and my TA Kevin were both great teachers, who were invested in us as students. I thought it was helpful to go through the different mechanisms of the experiments and review the techniques needed because it helped provide the context for why we did certain things in the procedure. I think the course could be improved if the course packet was a bit clearer with what it expects. Sometimes it was a bit ambiguous in terms of the procedure needed.",
    "I think that the grading across TAs needs to be more standardized. I think that the grading of PLA in my section was much too harsh and made it very difficult to do well in the class compared to other sections. I wasn't very excited by the experiments and it seemed like we kept going over the same techniques. But Dr. Dimeglio was always very nice and the post labs and experiments were short which was nice.",
    "Honestly a pretty fun class that isn't too time consuming A weakness would probably just standing around during longer reactions",
    "The strengths certainly come through in the teaching staff Dr. DiMeglio and my TA, Jon Ellefsen and in the lab staff as a whole, like Teresa and Lisa and the student workers. Everyone is safe and knowledgeable and goes the extra mile to make you feel like you're taken seriously as a student and a scientist. Also, the pedagogy of the lab manual and every element of the lab process (lab lectures, procedural reviews, self-directed pace) was excellent and well-suited to my skill level.",
    "Strengths: learned a lot of new things, amount of work required was fair Weaknesses: wish it was a 1.0 credit course",
    "The course was extremely well organized and the teaching staff, especially Dr. DiMeglio, were all wonderful! The information was presented clearly, and the expectations put forth for students were also explicitly outlined. A negative aspect was the lack of feedback from my TA on our PLAs. Other than that, my TA was excellent and always willing to help or provide additional explanations.",
    "I really liked when we could pair up and carry out experiments together. I feel like that shortens the time but you learn as much or even more than if you do it alone, because there are some things that your partner may be better than you at or that you may have been doing wrongly but never realized it. And a lot of things are done for many lab sessions, so even if we partner up, we will definitely get to practice most skills at least once",
    "Strengths: I have got to say that I was impressed by how organized this class was. It was very systematic and I know well in advance every week what was coming. The integration of canvas was rather flawless and I just like the entire set up now in the new labs. Weaknesses: I tend to feel like I'm not really learning anything in the class. Sure I'm learning some chemistry, but it's pretty redundant and doesn't help me understand orgo. With gen chem lab, I felt like it really helped me grasp concepts, but with this class, nothing really connected back to lecture. Also, I REALLY DON'T LIKE that a lot of my peers could get away with half-assing the experiments, not take mps and fudge the TLCs, among other shortcuts, and still do justas well in the class as I can. There's something wrong in a class where it's that easy to kind of cheat and cut corners without consequences. Everyone in the section next to me would leave within 90 minutes while everyone in my section would still be working. I also really hated that the grading was very subjective based on the TA you got. I understand it might be hard to execute perfect grading, but the amount of effort I put in this semester on work was much lower, and yet I did better in the class. I don't think it's fair my grade depends on who my ta is.",
    "The organic chemistry labs (both semesters) were the most organized lab courses I have ever taken at Yale, and I have taken quite a few. The protocol left little room for misinterpretation, the expectations were straightforward, and the instructors always had helpful insight. The only weakness in this course is the grading - I think the strict grading guidelines provided to the TA's for the post lab assignments did not give students' hard work enough credit. Also, I am still opposed to the idea of a lab course having a final written evaluation as opposed to a final practical exam.",
    "To me, one of the course's greatest problems was its extreme repetition. By the end of the year, on a weekly basis, I could guess what the procedure for the week would likely involve without even reading it. This grew to be a bit frustrating at times - perhaps greater variety of experiments would benefit this course.",
    "I didn't like getting random points off on EP's for formatting but I guess it was an important thing to get right. I just wasn't very good at it!",
    "A strength is that it is repetitive and you really learn how to do the techniques properly. A weakness is that it does not relate to the lecture material very much, especially in the beginning.",
    "The workload was good. The experiments were interesting. However, sometimes the reflux reactions that required over an hour of heating were too long. Also, I think there needs to be a greater focus on the theoretical. Overall though, I enjoyed the class and had a pleasant time in the class.",
    "The time spent on homework and assignments and effort put into this class are not reflective of its status as a half-credit course. It is as much work as a full credit class. Another weakness of the class is the lack of interesting reactants and products, besides the very last.",
    "This course was a strong course, with a good balance of work required and time needed for the actual experiments. However, aside from NMR I did not feel I needed another semester of organic chemistry lab.",
    "This course was very good. The labs were set up very well and were very informative and straight forward. Some of the labs were a bit long since reaction times were over an hour. The product characterization was kind of long and tedious week after week and made the labs run longer as well.",
    "Emphasizes scientific communication and organization - important skills even beyond organic chemistry. However, this can make the work in the course very tedious. Grading is generally fair, although I feel there may be excessive emphasis on formatting, etc. in lab reports - I accept this may be necessary to instill scientific communication skills.",
    "This course was great! It was much better and much more enjoyable than general chemistry labs. Much like Orgo lab I, I felt like I learned a lot and understood everything that was going on. The workload was also much more manageable. Overall, it was a good experience!"

    "You're probably taking this course since you're pre-med. It's actually not bad - you can learn a decent amount about organic chemistry while also doing some relatively fun experiments in the lab.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this course! You are probably taking this class because it is a requirement for a major or if you are pre-med, but honestly, you should be super happy if this is a required course for you, because it is so amazing! Professor DiMeglio is the BEST, and the material covered in pre-lab lectures and presented in the lab manual is straightforward and easy to understand if you're also taking or have taken organic chemistry lecture. We often finished lab experiments between 3 and 4pm, and the syntheses that you'll get to do are really cool! Take it!",
    "take it if you have to, but be safe in the knowledge that it's infinitely better-taught and more fun than gen chem lab",
    "I would recommend CHEM 223L to any students who are looking to learn chemical lab methods or are just looking for a fun class. You will enjoy it.",
    "You probably have to take this course anyway, but know that it's not nearly as bad\/stressful\/unhelpful as gen chem lab (I pity those of you who have already dealt with Dr. G), and not as boring as physics lab. It requires little preparation outside of class, and the final is pretty easy if you do the lab questions, as it should be for a lab class that is focused on techniques and developing a practical scientific mentality. This is one of the only labs that I felt actually complimented the class well.",
    "Yes, it was very straight forward and easy.",
    "Orgo lab is extremely well-designed. It's not busy work, and while prep time is somewhat high outside of the classroom, that time is well-spent in helping you to understand the material. It's not easy, but it's better than gen chem lab by a mile.",
    "This class will help you understand concepts from the parallel lecture course. Sometimes the experiments are even fun. Leaps and bounds better than gen chem lab.",
    "Great lab course. More interesting than Orgo Lab I. The TA will make or break your experience. Weekly EPs that are graded fairly, 3 post-lab assignments that are also fair, except PL-C (it's a bit unfair to grade for stuff that isn't in the question). Shout out to Jon for being great.",
    "Orgo 2 lab was a great class! You get really familiar with synthetic chemistry and it's fun to make real compounds in each lab and analyze them. It's a low-stress lab worth taking if you're already taking the lecture.",
    "Not terrible, especially as overseen by Christine DiMeglio--she's amazing on all counts. Beyond that, the labs can get a little repetitive but not awfully so, and I know they pretty commonly adjust the lineup depending on what works semester to semester.",
    "It's one of those things required for STEM majors and\/or premed students, but it was pretty enjoyable as well.",
    "I really recommend this course to those who are interested in pursuing chemistry or research. It teaches some very valuable skills, and is very enjoyable.",
    "Professor DiMeglio is great. She is challenging yet fair, strict yet understanding.",
    "YAY ORGO LAB! It's not gen chem lab (aka it's great) and Christine is so kind and encouraging. I imagine you could have a tough time if you TA is bad, but mine was great both semesters, so hopefully that's because she has some say in who she hires and she hires people equally as kind as she.",
    "Most people only take this if they have to, but because of Dr. Dimeglio's kindness and organizational skills, it is a million times more enjoyable than the orgo class.",
    "Definitely recommend- low stress, very straightforward, and pretty fun.",
    "Yes!! Orgo lab was actually my most enjoyable class this semester! It's fun and hands on and if you get a fun section you just get to hang out",
    "I would recommend this class. Orgo lab isn't nearly as stressful as gen chem lab because percent yield doesn't matter, so if you make a mistake it doesn't affect your grade. It was also cool to do something more hands-on that also helped me learn the organic chemistry I had to know for lecture.",
    "Not bad. Keep up with the work and you should be fine.",
    "Yes, fun lab with great teaching staff and DiMeglio is a gem.",
    "I would definitely recommend orgo lab to others. It's pretty chill and you get to make cool compounds.",
    "If you are looking to get an idea of standard organic lab techniques, I would recommend this course.",
    "Not horrible if you have to take it. Just do assignments beforehand. Wouldn't recommend for fun\/without orgo itself (is that even possible?)",
    "Probably only taking if you have to, but sure. Lab is cool. Grades helped too.",
    "If you have to take it you have to take it, but it's a great lab course.",
    "For a required lab, it is a good one. Would I recommend that someone just take it for fun? No.",
    "Yes, but it's best if you're taking the lecture at the same time.",
    "This course is required for most that take it but Dr. D is so so great and it is one of the better chem lab courses!",
    "If you are taking it you have to",
    "If you're premed you have to take this class, but it's really painless honestly and kind of fun.",
    "This class is only worth taking if you need it for your degree, but that being said, it's also one of the better courses I've taken in my major.",
    "Yes! It really helps solidify the orgo concepts.",
    "I would highly recommend this a student that is taking the lecture course concurrently. I think Yale enforces that anyway, but the two blend nicely.",
    "Would definitely recommend orgo labs over gen chem labs! Lab time can be fun, especially if you make friends with the people in your group. If you're pre-med, then you're obligated to take these labs anyways, but orgo is a much more enjoyable experience than gen chem.",
    "Yes I would! The class is a great complement to the lecture course.",
    "I would recommend orgo lab for premeds and those who want to pursue chem research. It makes you very comfortable with general orgo procedures like synthesis of materials, purification, and characterization of products. Every week is quite repetitive with the same techniques usually, but that was also good for making us very comfortable with procedures so that by the end the experiments were almost second nature.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you would like training and hands on experience with chemistry.",
    "Not the best class to take as an elective but if you like working in the lab and learning about chemistry is a very good class.",
    "Yes",
    "Good experience and you learn about organic chemistry procedures. Not too much work and if you put in the effort you'll do well.",
    "Organic lab is basically the same as it was first semester, but with more complex reactions. It's fun and well-organized. Best to prepare early and get used to working on an early system so that you're not scrambling to finish any of the PLs or EPs.",
    "Orgo lab is one of the best labs at Yale in terms of workload! Really not that bad at all!",
    "Definitely take this lab if you are in Orgo 2.",
    "orgo lab is better than gen chem lab if you have to take it and the TAs generally are helpful and supportive",
    "No.",
    "Orgo lab II is generally a fun course-- if you enjoyed Orgo lab I you will probably like II as well. It involves a few more long labs and a bit more work outside of class than first semester but it is still manageable.",
    "This is a great class and very easy to finesse a good grade. I didn't take gen chem, but from what I heard about it, this is much easier.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Dr. DiMeglio is very kind and knows every student by name. It is by far one of the most interesting labs I've taken at Yale.",
    "Pretty painless lab class, DiMeglio is a wonderful professor and is very willing to answer and explain questions in person and through email",
    "Those taking this class likely are required to. Having said that, lab time is enjoyable and satisfying. The lab is structured such that students really understand each experiment. Students get quite a bit of freedom in the lab, which is nice. I'm not sure I would have taken this class if it was not part of my major, but I still enjoyed it.",
    "Not unless you have to take it.",
    "Definitely a good course, not too hard either, if you like labs, which I really do.",
    "This lab is fun and interesting - you get to make acetaminophen and banana oil! It's pretty chill, the emphasis is on understanding the chemical reactions and learning how to make reactions more efficient rather than on percent yield. The TAs are also great at helping you understand not only the chemical reactions going on that day but general reactions that you encounter in the lecture course.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who needs the requirement or who is interested in continuing on in organic chemistry.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this lab",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It is very well organized, predictable, a good environment, and you will actually gain some expertise in organic chem lab techniques.",
    "Only if you need it for a requirement - it's quite time-consuming and is only 0.5 credit",
    "You probably have to take this class anyway if you're looking at this, but you won't hate this class at all.",
    "I recommend this course if you have to take it. It is a straight forward lab with clear directions and reasonable assignments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone, especially those who are currently enrolled in or have completed Organic Chemistry II.",
    "Yes, Orgo Lab II is basically the best lab course you will ever take at Yale so enjoy it while you can. Your experience might vary based on the TA you have, but otherwise is a solid lab course.",
    "I would recommend Orgo Lab II for anyone who is pre-med or interested in further developing their technical lab skills.",
    "Yes. Good course with a nice friendly environment",
    "I would recommend this to my friends. It's a really helpful introduction to working in a lab, and you have a lot of fun while you're there. Plus, the student culture is collaborative. We really educated each other and helped one another out in my lab group, and I made a lot of close friends through my lab.",
    "Great course. Unfortunately, I wish it was 1.0 credits (and not 0.5 credits). The amount of time I spend every week in lab is 3~4 hrs (not including time spent doing homework\/other assignments). This is comparable if not greater than the time I spend in some of my other 1.0 credit courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The wonderful teaching staff, interesting material, fair assignments and great lab experience make this course more than worthwhile!",
    "As we both know, you probably have to take this class because of some requirement. it's your typical lab class. Very few people come in to orgo lab wanting to come in, and that's part of the problem... You're going to face people who come to lab and are like \"not this again.\" To some degree, they are right. This class isn't perfect as it is repetitive. You mix a few chemicals in a tube, let it heat up, check it out, and go home. Sounds simple, right? Because it is. The only issue is that your grade isn't correlated to some master grading system but to your TA. I put in half the effort I did last semester because my TA last semester took joy in deducting points. Even so, less effort still got me a better grade. Just cross your fingers you get a TA, as they are not announced on OCS. Pray to the orgo gods.... This journey through 223L is really what you make of it, and what your TA's philosophy of grade deduction is. Just sit down, buckle up, and reflux that reaction so you can go home already.",
    "Yes, although if you're taking it I assume it is to fulfil a pre-med requirement or a major requirement in which case you have to take it. Nevertheless, this class despite being a half credit is actually quite a lot of work, and bear in mind the final is before reading week.",
    "A class that is fun and informative. You just need to pay a lot of attention to details.",
    "Only if taking chemistry.",
    "Yes, all the labs were so much fun!",
    "Take this class along with organic chemistry II if you need it as a pre-requisite.",
    "Take it if you have to for prerequisites or if you are interested in chemistry. Students who truly enjoy chemistry will enjoy the course, though it can get monotonous and painstaking.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is required for your major.",
    "Chances are that you are taking orgo lab because it is a requirement for your major. It's a pretty good class though. 100 times better than gen chem lab. Labs usually will not run the full 4 hours, which is nice. There are three post lab assignments, and they are usually not too bad. Good luck.",
    "I would recommend this course. Significant amount of work, but fun, especially if you get a good TF.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It was a great lab course and I actually really enjoyed it. The workload was very manageable and the labs were interesting. It was an overall positive experience!",
    "You're probably only taking this course if you're pre-med, so of course if you are doing that you should take organic chemistry lab. However, the grading of this class is not fair. It's very based upon who you have as a TA and therefore you could either get the luck of the draw or not. If you don't, you're doomed to have a bad grade and there's really nothing you can do about it, even if you work with students in other sections and put down the same grades as them. They'll still get a higher grade."
