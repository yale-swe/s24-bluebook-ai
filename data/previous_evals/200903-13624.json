    "Fred Strebeigh is unequivocally engaged with the students in a way that not other faculty at FES is, or even tries to be. He is an exemplary teacher and inspires work that is meaningful and high-quality. He also has solid professional experience that he very readily translates into teaching.",
    "Out of any course I've taken at FES, the work and time I put into this class had the greatest output. It's a shame more people can't take this class.",
    "Among the best instructors I've had in my life and certainly at Yale - encompassing both in his theoretical scope and his practical artistry. I owe to Fred some of the best ideas I've had all semester. Being made to write deeply and clearly has improved the depth and clarity of my own thinking.",
    "Question 2: Professor Strebeigh uses an educational method of asking questions to the class about course readings to get students to draw conclusions about the author's intent\/meaning\/techniques; this (Socratic?) method also has the benefit of forcing students to articulate spoken responses clearly, which is no easy task. There was a bit of grumbling about teaching this way--many students assume that they are being asked for their opinion, not an objective fact about the piece being discussed--but I believe it is necessary and appropriate for a writing class.",
    "I was an auditor so the responses related to work load were answered accordingly.",
    "The class was very useful for me. The teacher is amazingly skilled and helpful. This is not an easy class.",
    "Prof. Strebeigh always responded with thoughtful comments even outside of class time.",
    "This course is ideal for anyone wishing to write for magazine publication, whether in the environmental sciences or not. Fred gives excellent insights into the building blocks of an effective and engaging magazine article, but he allows you to play with your own creativity. I immensely enjoyed this class.",
    "In response to Questions 1-7: this was the best class I've taken at FES. I feel incredibly lucky to have had the chance to work with the professor. How I read, write, and respond to others' writing has fundamentally changed for the better as a result of this class. Professor Strebeigh is the best, most inspiring, and most dedicated professor I've had at FES."

   "comments": [
    "The opportunity to get constant feedback on a piece and write about something you really felt passionate about. It was also great to read other students' pieces and get to know their experiences and writing styles.",
    "The professor's amazingly thorough attention given to each student.",
    "The small group editing process at the end- very useful and enjoyable.Also, excellent feedback from the professor throughout the course.",
    "Finishing with a substantial product that felt, in some way, valuable, worth the effort.",
    "Fred's responsiveness and overwhelming willingness to go out of his way to make sure you succeed. He puts an insane amount of work into this class and it completely pays off.",
    "The course design. The workshop format and gradual transition from reviewing outside pieces to pieces written for the class is stellar.",
    "Excellent comments both from Fred and from my fellows in the class. The readings were helpful, even if I didn't always have time for them. The weekly writing assignments were challenging, but made the second half of the semester much smoother than it would have been otherwise.",
    "The classes were very helpful, as was Professor Strebeigh's personal and detailed comments on articles. I enjoyed the exciting and yet very instructive way that Prof Strebeigh runs the classes - I was able to stay engaged through the whole of the three hour class. The workshop sections of the class were especially instructive and engaging.Also, the front-loading of the writing assignments in the semester was great.",
    "The core content of the course, combined with the breadth of the reading material, is I think integral for non-scientific and environmental communication for general-public audiences. It is, in short, very useful for enviro. professionals.",
    "The in depth analysis of good writing. The course is conducive to participation.",
    "Prof. Strebeigh's comments on each student's weekly submissions.",
    "The instructor is enthusiastically engaged with the progress of his students.",
    "It is well set up, with clear objectives, assignments and pace.The teacher is very good. He can teach.The focus is on skills - writing skills.",
    "The student run workshops were most valuable to me because I enjoyed commenting and critiquing other student work. I believe this helped me to be a more thoughtful writer in my own work."

   "comments": [
    "It kind of drops off at the end. It would be great to have a class on submitting our pieces to various publications, if people are ready for that step.",
    "Can't think of anything significant.",
    "nothing comes to mind.",
    "More clarity at the outset about how developed a story idea should be for the class. (Starting from scratch is extremely challenging in this class.)",
    "Perhaps break into smaller groups earlier in the semester, or have two sets of smaller groups (so people don't get tired of reading the same pieces). This question is difficult because this class is fantastic and really well organized.",
    "Nothing really, though I'm sure Fred will continue to tweak it. One thought would be that perhaps more weight could be given to writers getting started with there research and interviews in the proceeding summer as it makes the writing go much faster...",
    "The three hour class over dinner might happen at a better time, or should have a 15 minute break in the middle.",
    "No suggestions here.",
    "I would have like the auditing period to be longer.",
    "I like the structure of having the first part of the class together and then breaking apart to work on our own and check in -- but I think students should be able to opt out of the student workshop groups and just check in with Prof. Strebeigh instead. I didn't find the student workshop groups at all helpful.",
    "None that I can think of.",
    "Sometimes class discussions are hard to follow.",
    "This is less a critique about the course, but students thinking of taking this course should recognize that additional outside research is often required for developing a rich piece. This work is additional to writing assignments for the class.",
    "Some time building an atmosphere of trust between students who are sharing their work would have been helpful. Some work on unlocking your creativity, and then effectively channeling and expressing your passions would contribute to even more powerful writing and bolster a lifelong writing practice. Training in how to effectively give feedback to others is also a useful lifelong skill. However, this course very effectively does what it does and I don't see great need to tinker with it.",
    "If at all possible, it would be wonderful to have the readings on-line."

As such, this course - in helping me strengthen my popular professional writing skills has been integral in my course of study. These are the kinds of skills we students are talking about when we say \"practical\" courses...",

    "We did not have group projects, but did have group workshops. These had the advantage of discussing our ideas with our peers.",
    "Working in small groups to polish our environmental writing pieces was an excellent way to interact and collaborate with my peers.",
    "It was great to get feed back on a small scale (rather than in the big group format). However, a bit more structured guidance in how to do so would be helpful. For example, readers could read back to the writers sentences or parts that strike them. And they can try to summarize the impression they get from the piece before the author tries to explain (so the author knows what impression s\/he is leaving). These are poor descriptions of many techniques that could be - even quickly - discussed.",
    "Advantages were building stronger relationships with the people in my work group; Professor Strebeigh's suggestions to ask the group about particular parts of my piece was a great way of making the group work more productive."

In the spring, if you know you want to take this course, be sure to grab contacts' info and write down little details, even for natural scientists. It'll help you a lot when you're trying to write the piece.",
