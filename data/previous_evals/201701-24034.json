   "comments": [
    "I learned quite a bit in this course. Not only did this course deepen my understanding of green chemistry, but it also clarified my role as a citizen in advancing green chemistry. It is definitely a course I recommend Yale College should continue offering to students.",
    "The course did a good job teaching not only the fundamentals of chemistry but also why they mattered. The course had lots of real world applications throughout that made it interesting and taught me lots of things related to the environmental impacts of chemicals that have been and are currently used in the US and globally. The course taught critical thinking skills about how to analyze a process (chemical synthesis process or reaction) and how to improve it to make it better for the environment and people.",
    "I really got a new perspective on current environmental issues. I took this class because I was genuinely interested in the topic, and through a chemistry lens proved to be very interesting. Chemistry-wise, I don't think I learned too much above an AP Chemistry level, but it was really neat to re-learn these high school chemistry topics and then be able to apply them to environmental concerns. Neat class.",
    "How to apply green chemistry principles into product design",
    "This is an incredible course. It gave me so much insight into how important design is in reducing waste produced for the environment. The lectures were so engaging and I'm so thankful I took this class.",
    "In addition to learning basic chemistry, this course taught me about the real world applications and importance of understanding the role chemistry plays in the environment.",
    "In this course, we covered the fundamental chemistry necessary to understand the underpinnings of the field of green chemistry. We also learned about sustainability, the twelve principles of green chemistry, alternative energy sources, and basic toxicology. What was really enlightening was learning about these issues from a scientific, molecular approach, which really gave me a new perspective on how we can deal with problems spanning the gauntlet from environmental to global, the human, and the economic. A big thing I learned was about how our current methodologies for dealing with hazard is circumstantial, with entire industries being devoted to cleanup and protection, when we could be negating intrinsic hazard and saving tons of money and lives.",
    "This course reviewed the chemistry basics I learned in high school and provided an overview of concepts of sustainability, toxicology, and climate change.",
    "basic chemistry knowledge and skills, then also knowledge of the chemsitry of industry\/production and how to redesign chemical processes to be more green."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Made the material very digestible, the workload was the right amount, the professor was very engaging, the TA's were supportive and accessible, and the material is something everyone should learn about. Weaknesses: The final was much harder than expected. The course sometimes did not stick to the schedule outlined in the syllabus, and I think having it be 50 minutes instead of 1 hr 15 min would be better for future students.",
    "The course covered a lot of relevant general chemistry material and was able to tie it in with the environmental aspects of green chemistry. Having the class in a lab classroom would be nice so more in class demonstrations of chemical phenomena can be done. While I sort of liked the idea of guest lecturers coming in, Professor Anastas is such a great teacher that I was always a bit disappointed when he wasn't teaching a class even though the guest lecturers were good.",
    "More lecture and examples should be offered to the problem of waste prevention",
    "Prof Anastas is amazing and has done lots of amazing work in the field of green chemistry. He cares so much about his students and puts learning over grades which is so nice. He made sure class discussion was interesting and engaging. Definitely the best class I took this semester.",
    "Professor Anastas is AMAZING. Each lecture was well prepared and fascinating, and his excitement about the topic made me really excited to learn what he was teaching.",
    "This course had a really manageable workload, awesome instructors, and even really interesting guest lecturers. I felt that the pace of the course was done really well, and that the material we learned in the course was all highly relevant and built upon itself. I don't really see weaknesses in this course.",
    "This course tried to do too much-- by the end of it, we were not really able to grasp the ins and outs of the processes we studied and so a lot of things were glossed over or assumed.",
    "If the material and structure of the course were more organized and based in more chemistry rather than abstract information, this could be helpful.",
    "Prof Anastas was really engaging. He made a lot of efforts to make lecture interesting and relevant information for students. He also had a lot of good stories. I learned some basic chemistry skills in the first section. The second section was far less work but also far more interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The professor deeply cares about the material and is engaging. However, he can be a bit overwhelming with all the questions he posed in class; sometimes I wouldn't be able to answer the questions because I simply did not have the background knowledge to do so. Overall though, the course's workload was very manageable, the material is super important and relevant, and the professor actually cares about how you engage with the material. The final exam was hard though, but the midterm was easy.",
    "Great class to learn about chemistry in a more interesting way that gen chem. Professor Anastas is a great teacher and super interesting to listen to. The tests in the class were fair and the workload of the class was not too bad, especially if you've taken a chemistry course in high school.",
    "This is an amazing class. The chemistry wasn't too hard, but it was really interesting to learn how it pertains to environmental issues. Prof Anastas is a really engaging teacher and is super passionate about the class\/the topic. Workload wasn't bad, just weekly readings and four hw assignments throughout the semester. I took it because I was interested in learning about the environment and its issues (not my major, didn't need a science credit), and it's totally worth it. Absolutely recommend this class!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes take this class. It was eye opening and I'm so happy I took it. It's a great science credit and will really change you look at the world.",
    "Yes most definitely. Enlightening class, very fun and very interactive.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to both science and non-science students. Coming into the course as a humanities major, I was nervous about the chemistry part, but it ended ups non-issue as the concepts were taught really well and were reiterated. It was especially interesting to me, as the idea of understanding the science behind different toxicological environmental, and hazardous effects was akin to getting at first principles in Philosophy. The course also touched on policy, but really was a chemistry course at its core. For science majors, the course wouldn't be difficult, but would, I think, teach an important lesson in needing to consider all the factors rather than developing something new and calling it a day; coming away from this course, it would feel like blind progress. Paul Anastas is also a great professor, who loves the field he is teaching and was a pioneer in the subject. His enthusiasm really rubs off on students.",
    "Unless you are set on environmental chemistry and have no prior chemistry knowledge, I wouldnt strongly recommend this.",
    "I would recommend this course, but not if you intend to go further in chemistry, specifically. It doesn't prepare you like the intro chem series would. On the other hand it's interesting material, not something I've seen explored in many other courses here."
