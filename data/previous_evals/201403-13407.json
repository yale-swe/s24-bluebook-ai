    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in art, books, writing, etc.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class, if a student is not taking large course loads.",
    "This was my favorite class my first semester, and really, it's as difficult as you make it. If you really take the opportunity to appreciate the things you'll be viewing and give substantial thought and effort to your projects, the class will be an enjoyable part of your schedule. Creativity or artistic experience is not nearly as important as thoughtfulness. Also, be prepared to spend a lot more time than just class time in the press. It's going to be necessary (though it shouldn't be difficult to find a couple hours somewhere if you really try). Overall, just bring a positive attitude and a willingness to learn -- all the rest will come with time.",
    "ART006 is a fun course: You get the chance to learn about letterpress printing and the art of typography. There is probably no practical application to this class and no future transferable skill, but you shouldn't expect that from an art class either. Prof Richard Rose is an amazing person and he provides a lot of support to you, but beware that the class takes a lot a lot a lot of time. This is not a gut class, and you definitely should take the time commitment into account.",
    "This class was definitely a lot of work, but still a great experience. A student should take it if and only if they are willing to put in long hours on the press to create a piece of art that they would be satisfied with. This class forces your mind to develop a critical eye for aesthetic in typographic design, and to examine books more closely in their role as vehicles for information. Will I ever use the hard skills of setting type, proofing, and printing? Potentially not, but the mindset, the attention to detail, and hopefully a good chunk of the knowledge will stick.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but they must be willing to spend a lot of time in the press room, and they must definitely have a lot of patience.",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Art of the Printed Word is a fabulous course, but it is A LOT OF WORK. That being said, the work definitely utilizes a different side of your brain, so oftentimes it is more therapeutic than actual 'work' in the conventional sense of the word. There is one 4-6 page paper which is not too difficult at all. Most of the class time, however, is devoted to either viewing manuscripts and letterpress printing examples from the past or actually printing things ourselves. We had three main printing projects -- a quotation card, a broadside (basically a large poster), and a small edition book. They were all very fun to do, but again, SO MUCH WORK. SOOOO MUCH WORK. I spent almost 10 hours in one day working on the second project alone. However, the problem solving skills you learn by physically trying to solve printing issues and the opportunity to view historical examples of letterpress work was amazing! I got to flip through an early edition of the Canterbury Tales!!! Looking back, I have a much greater appreciation for books now that I understand all the planning and work that goes into the making of them. Also, Professor Rose is a gem. He's super awesome and very, very understanding of the difficulties involved with the class. I truly believe the class is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn a very hands-on, and very fun, skill (one where you can definitely tell your grandkids about). That being said, be warned -- the class is a lot of time, so only take it if 1) you manage to get in, and 2) you have a true love for books and the art of the printed word.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, because it is a wonderful look into the world of the printing press and into how texts used to be, and to a certain extent still are, produced. This course requires a certain amount of artistic skill, but this skill can also be developed over the course of the class.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes this semester. It was so much fun and so interesting. Where else would you ever get the chance to learn to use a printing press? It's a lot of work, but a completely different kind of work from anything else you would be doing in any other class. That being said, I spent hours every day of reading period working on my final project, so make sure you have the time for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! While the course requires a lot of work for projects, it is also very enjoyable and fun."
