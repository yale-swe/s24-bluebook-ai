   "comments": [
    "I love John Milton's poetry and his general persona, so I'm biased, but I thought this course was absolutely wonderful. John Rogers is one of the best lecturers at Yale, and he's not going anywhere, so definitely take this course with him. John Rogers does a great job of synthesizing the wealth of material in the canon of Milton scholarship to craft beautiful lectures. The reading load is fair. Milton's prose is painfully dense at times, but we only spent one full lecture in his prose, so it wasn't a problem. Also, all of the TAs at least this year were spectacular section leaders. It was an excellent course all around.",
    "absolutely! take it!",
    "This is a must-take. It is one of the best English lectures at Yale. John Rogers is a witty, entertaining, brilliant, brilliant man. And Milton is a singularly complex, interesting, and strange author. I took the class because I get goose bumps when I read Paradise Lost, but now I have a much greater appreciation for the poem within the context of Milton's work as a whole. This is a great class whether you love poetry, or stories, or psychology, or history, or politics, or theology, or philosophy, or the classics. You will think and talk about life and God and suffering and marriage and ambition and poetry in lecture and in section -that is why I came to Yale, to have these conversations. It is a wonderful class.",
    "It's a great course - if you love Milton. Even if you don't love Milton, there are definitely reasons to take it: John Rogers' rich and interesting lectures will do their best to make you interested in Milton, and with only a final and two papers, it's not much work (besides the sometimes tedious reading).",
    "You get out of it what you put into it. It's a lot of reading, but if you want to read lots of Milton, this is it. If you don't; well, why are you shopping this course then? Basically, this class has lots of reading and very little writing.And of course, Professor Rogers is a preeminent Milton scholar; he has interesting readings, of which you will agree with some, and disagree with others (that's a positive thing.)",
    "YES YES",
    "If you have any interest in Milton, you should take this course. It might not always be extra compelling, but you will definitely gain a new perspective on the text. This would be a perfect credit\/D class, take it and enjoy the material, but don't worry too much about attending lectures that don't interest you.",
    "Take this class if you consider yourself (or one day hope to consider yourself) a scholar of poetry, history, religious studies, or political science and you will be rewarded with a better understanding of all of those things. Guaranteed. But expect long readings.",
    "English majors, take it. Milton has written some great stuff that really outstrips Paradise Lost, and this is really the only place you will be exposed to it.",
    "A thorough study of Milton's body of work placed in the context of his era and his life, which made it all the more interesting. I would highly recommend this to anybody who has ever been remotely interested in Paradise Lost or Milton himself; it was a fantastic class.",
    "This is a great class! Everyone with any interest in Milton's work or English at all should take it. You learn so much great stuff, even if you've already read Paradise Lost. It's amazing how much reading his other stuff and help you understand that poem. Take this class!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who really enjoyed English 125 (and Paradise Lost) and would like to look at Milton in more depth.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this if you the pre-1800. This was not the class I was most looking forward to, but Rogers' lectures were fantastic.",
    "For sure, if he or she is interested in learning about Milton. It's a lot, a lot of Milton, that's the bad side. But on the bright side, it's a lot, a lot of Milton.",
    "MIlton is a survey of Milton's best works of prose and poetry, including Comus, Lycidas, Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes. Milton is an extraordinarily complex writer, and I learned so much from looking at his writing over the course of his lifetime. I would definitely recommend this class to another students (in fact, I already have).",
    "\"Milton\" covers the author's major prose and poetry works, including his political treatises, early lyric poems, Comus, Lycidas, Paradise Lose, Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes. I would highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "I took Milton for a pre-1800 and ended up loving the lectures - Professor Rogers is fantastic. The lectures were incredibly interesting. I took the class Credit-D and would recommend that - the TA's were really hard graders.",
    "ENGL 220 covers the range of Milton's work. I absolutely recommend it for anyone who likes Milton. The course is built around a narrative of Milton's poetic development in his relationship to classical literary tradition and Christian theology. Prof. Rogers emphasizes heterodox interpretations of Milton's poetry and helps you see the radical in Milton.",
    "Like Milton... with more sugar and a vitamins boost. Next question!",
    "I definitely recommend this class, especially if you're interested in studying any Western literature after 1667. In other words, this is one of the most crucial and informative classes I've ever taken.",
    "I really enjoyed Milton, and especially this course with Professor Rogers. His lectures, once they got more text-based, were wonderful, and you can tell he's really passionate about what he teaches. I really loved the subject matter, so reading and writing about it was great for me. Just make sure you've at least read Paradise Lost and somewhat enjoyed it, before going into this course, because not everything Milton wrote was as great as PL.",
    "Best English lecture at Yale. Rogers is fantastic. And you really get to know Milton, like, intimately.",
    "Yes, because it is good.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! IT IS AMAZING!",
    "A great survey of pretty much everything that Milton ever wrote. Take it if you've read some Milton and would like to read some more; take it if you've never read anything by him.",
    "A great way to fulfill one of the pre-1800 requirements. John Rogers is incredibly smart, and is a wonderful lecturer. Even though he's been giving the same set of lectures for years, he makes it seem new each time, as if he's just discovering the material. The course load is manageable: two papers and lots of reading. I wish I had read Paradise Lost before taking the course, though. We move through Paradise Lost quickly (1-2 books per week), which is a lot to process if you've never read late Milton before.Still, well worth taking.",
    "Rogers helps you learn to appreciate Milton and his works - definitely an enlightening course.",
    "If you find the lectures engaging and don\u0092t hate the syllabus\/poetry in general, take the course. Rogers is a very captivating lecturer, and even if you don\u0092t come away from the course loving Milton as much as he does, you will understand why some people do, and you will appreciate the influence that Milton has had on later poetry. There are just two papers and a final (no midterm), which is nice, but keep in mind that this is more reading (and heavier reading) than the average poetry course. I\u0092d definitely recommend taking it!"
