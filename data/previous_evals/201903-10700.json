    "Gradient ascent\/descent, image processing, basic neural networks.",
    "Various theories behind computer vision and image processing.",
    "You learn a lot about using computational networks for biology. Zucker is crazy which makes the lectures engaging. If you like biology and math I would recommend it. I would say it might be difficult if you haven't taken linear algebra yet.",
    "Learned about eigenvectors, fourier transforms, and some basic neural networks along with a decent overview of the biological processes of vision.",
    "Through this class, you will learn about the fundamentals of computer vision from a biology perspective. Professor Zucker uses examples from biology to build up an intuition for what a convolution is and then what a neural network is. Through the homework, you'll also get to practice convolutions and other computer vision algorithms.",
    "general overview of computer vision and some of the more basic algorithms used in the field",
    "Learning about the ways we abstract biological processes into mathematical and biological operations was fascinating, even if it was hard to grasp at times with a limited mathematical background. As a result I learned a lot of basic linear algebra as well, although the class would have been a lot easier to follow with a more solid mathematical foundation.",

    "A survey of Computational Vision topics and practice in implementing relevant algorithms like Stereo and CNNs",
    "This class was a wild journey. I developed scattered, unstructured, and limited insights into a sampling of topics in biology, neuroscience, computer science, and mathematics. I question whether it's possible to develop a deep understanding of any of the topics covered in the course given the extreme disorganization of the lectures and the sparsity of resources that accompany them. At any point during the semester, I would argue it's nearly impossible to discern what topic is being discussed and how that topic relates to previous lectures. Zucker does his best to \"tie it all together\" before Thanksgiving break and before the final exam, but he does a poor job of doing so. The material is interesting, important, and challenging, but this high-level presentation is insufficient for learning. In class, Zucker lectures with references to papers we have not read, mathematics we do not understand, and neuroscience we do not know. This contrasts with homework assignments that clarify some of the main points of the lectures but do not impart much more knowledge. Luciano, the TA, does his best to save the students but even his efforts are futile. Given the contrast of the lectures and the homework, when it comes time for the midterm and eventually for the final, students are itching to know more about the structure of the exam. Will we be asked to prove fundamental theorems in differential geometry? Will we be asked to do difficult computations? Will we simply answer short answer questions qualitatively? The answer is...all of the above!",

    "As an overview of computer vision concepts, I think I definitely gained a deeper conceptual understanding.",
    "I learned how linear algebra and multi variable calculus apply to both biology and computer science. Its a really good course if you want to understand biology at a computational level, or how computer science mimics biology.",
    "This course was an interesting overview to computer vision. The biological component is an integral component of the course and should not be understated in your considerations while choosing courses. I would say that the biological component makes the math and computer science principles more palatable, and that it gives more depth and meaning to the concepts you learn. The concepts in the beginning are more abstract, while later concepts pull in more grounded in math. I also gained a pretty decent understanding of linear algebra, since I didn't have much exposure prior to this (and a good portion of the course is based on it.)",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Psets were quite behind the lectures. Midterm content had some curveballs and did not test a lot of things we learned, but oh well. Lectures were entertaining, prof is very funny.",
    "Strength: the psets are interesting and have very well-written instructions; you feel like you actually learn something after doing the psets. The exams (at least the midterm) are also super easy. Weakness: the lectures are terrible and felt useless (don't go to lecture); Zucker's handwriting is terrible and I wondered from time to time why he didn't use slides; he would always assume we had some advanced math knowledge when in fact many people don't (and he didn't even bother putting those up as prereqs).",
    "It was difficult to guess what would be on the exams because the exams were so different from the homeworks.",
    "Strengths: Professor Zucker is one of the best lecturers in the CS department, so it was nice going to lecture. The material is also very interesting. Weaknesses: Sometimes it becomes unclear how much biology versus computer science we needed to retain from lectures. In the end, the tests were pretty fair, but the material could be pretty dense if you tried to memorize everything.",
    "Strengths: really cool intersection of concepts\/subject areas Weaknesses: fairly disorganized lectures",
    "Need Luciano to do homeworks. Would be nice if we didnt have to all crowd into office hours to get advice on how to do them.",
    "Probably could have given us a practice test beforehand.",
    "This course needs better organization. In almost every problem set there were multiple errors and points of confusion. Furthermore, it was incredibly unclear what was actually core material for this class. Lecture notes for this class were 30 pages long and spanned countless different topics, often times explaining very complex ideas in short paragraphs. Do we need to understand backtracking. What about mathematically. What about processes similar to it in the brain. This course needs a syllabus with a clear outline. There need to be practice problems for exams and a clear outline of topics.",
    "Lectures could be a little more clear but overall learned a good chunk of material. Its hard to teach some materials like Fourier Series without going into too much mathematical rigor.",
    "I feel that the course was too broad. I wish we picked a few things and went deeper into those topics.",
    "Lectures were not very useful, I think because you could barely read Zuckers handwriting. Having lecture slides would be great, because all I ended up having to study off of was the book he wrote, which had a lot of excess fluff to move through when studying for the exam. The course topics come together really well by the end, but in the middle I felt confused about how that was the case.",
    "Weaknesses: Lots of material was crammed into few lectures.",
    "Be weary this course requires a strong math background! Other than that it was very well taught, Zucker and Lucianno are both incredible and very willing to help you learn.",
    "Professor Zucker is engaging lecturer and responds to class feedback \/ pace, course covered a broad variety of topics in an interesting way",
    "The problem sets were not well structured to facilitate student learning. There are no point distributions and it is easy to accidentally miss a question hidden in huge paragraphs and lose a lot of points, both for psets and exams. Plus, feedback on your answers is extremely unclear, and there are no answer keys so it is incredibly hard to learn from your mistakes.",
    "Zucker is passionate about the material, but its too bad hes so bad at coherently teaching it that he fails to pass on that inspiration and enthusiasm to his students. Instead every lecture was such a slog and the lecture notes, while detailed and thorough, were also extremely verbose and filled with incomplete sections, random notes to himself, and grammatical errors. Class was not at all conducive to learning and you will basically only self study so beware",
    "Strengths: extensive lecture notes available online, a great selection of topics, relatively light workload, approachable professor and helpful TAs Weaknesses: lecture notes are a bit disorganized and difficult to parse through in preparation for exams",
    "Strengths -- Luciano, the TA, is wonderful. Also, Zucker is an extremely kind and thoughtful professor, he is just a bad teacher. Weaknesses -- disorganized, lack of structure significantly inhibits learning, high-level overview of advanced topics without sufficient background leaves students confused and frightened.",
    "Very interesting class, obviously passionate and knowledgeable lecturer. However, material is organized in a strange non-linear way where the connections between different pieces are not always clear. Topics covered early on are referenced much later in the class, but the topics aren't always clearly motivated. Clearer organization of topics, or more clarity over what material in the lectures we need to know and at what level of granularity would also be helpful.",
    "Strengths: - Course material is very interesting and cross-disciplinary - Problem sets are highly engaging and aid critical understanding of the lecturers Weaknesses: - Lectures are hard to follow - Course notes are hard to follow - Professor is not very good at communicating knowledge overall",
    "The psets are good. Zucker is a fun lecturer who captures your attention. My frustration with the course was that lecture time could have been used more productively. This course aims high at a mathematical level, covering Fourier Series, linear systems and general responses in terms of the impulse response, multivariable calculus, eigendecompositions and the SVD, the Fourier Transform, and so forth. Course time should not have been devoted to anything but a cursory review of elementary linear algebra, but nevertheless, an attempt was made to cram in an introductory treatment of things like eigenvectors in a very short period of time. I have succeeded in a variety of advanced pure math courses at Yale, and even I would have struggled to grasp the notion of eigenvectors and the SVD in a day or two. It felt like these lectures, however entertaining and well delivered, left half the course dazed and confused and another half feeling like they were receiving a retread of Math 222\/225. The course should more explicitly state the expected mathematical background for students in the course and relegate the review of basic linear algebra to office hours\/optional lectures. I applaud the effort to make the course accessible to students of all stripes, but at some level, a course has to be mathematically sophisticated or mathematically handwavy. Under the circumstances, Zucker struck the best balance possible, but it would have been helpful to know which lectures would be completely redundant to veterans of linear algebra. With all this said, Zucker is a real gem - brilliant, captivating, fun, personable, accomplished - and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to study under him.",
    "Interesting material but was often hard in the second half to figure out how it all pieced together. Oftentimes introduced very advanced concepts that were not especially relevant to the core material.",
    "Strengths: The topic material is really interesting and you can tell Zucker is super passionate about the subject and he really tries to inspire that passion to his students. He's definitely an enjoyable and super knowledgeable person. As evidence of his dedication, he writes up his lecture notes in a textbook-like format for his students, which is actually incredible. Also psets aren't that hard. Weaknesses: Zucker's really passionate about the subject, but sometimes that passion doesn't necessarily translate into understandable lectures. Lectures move really fast and are somewhat haphazard in the sense that it's hard to see how things are connected when you're listening to the lecture. It's only right before the midterm or the final when you finally truly understand what's going on. BUT, it's not really a problem because he writes up his entire lecture notes just for his students, and those are really good (so long as you take the time to read them lmao)!",
    "The instructor gave very interesting lectures with clear expression and a sense of humor The review session of final was not enough. Lecture notes need to stress more on what we are expected to know. They are sometimes decentralized.",
    "This was an excellent course! The material was extremely interesting and I really learned alot. The lecture notes were very good and helpful in learning the material. My main issue was that the course felt disorderly at times and towards the end, the lecture notes became more incomplete. Also, so many different topics were introduced at relatively superficial levels that it was at times difficult to fully learn and appreciate any given topic. Nontheless, I thought this was an excellent course that I really enjoyed and learned alot in!",
    "Linear algebra should be a prerequisite, or at least resources to learn the necessary concepts should be provided in advance on the website. Additionally, having practice midterms and finals would have been a huge help to get a sense of the types of questions we could expect and prepare for.",
    "The notes are super in depth, but the class feels like drinking water out of a fire hose. Honestly, the class is really really good if you can keep up, but even if you cant, as long as you spend time with the notes.",
    "You need a good background in neuroscience and computer science for this class. The lectures were fast paced and got confusing very quickly. You need to be focused every second or youll get completely lost.",
    "Professor Zucker is a very engaging lecturer and clearly cares very deeply about the subject. This shows in the story-telling style of his lectures. Although the content was sometimes too fast-paced or math-heavy, his ability to sum it up at the end of lecture usually leaves you thinking that you*kinda* almost got it. The class notes are also very helpful (although typo-prone) and the homeworks are essential to understanding the material and doing well on the exams. I do wish there had been any type of sample materials for either exam, as well as additional ULA\/TA support. Luciano was great, but there was only one of him. The other ULA's office hours were not as helpful for me, because she only had knowledge for Matlab but many people, including myself, were using Python for the homeworks. There were also many typos in the homeworks, which were a pain to find out about several hours or days after you had already started an assignment, only to realize the thing you spent so long working on wasn't even your fault.",
    "To be honest, Professor Zucker's strength just isn't lecturing. The psets are your friend for this course, try to understand the course from that perspective because the lectures are impossible to follow, and the notes posted online are far too in-depth\/long-winded to be of much use. The material is actually very interesting, so I would recommend looking into the topics, but overall this was one of the weaker Yale courses I've taken.",
    "I think the class material is very well organized, particularly because all the lecture notes are on Canvas.",
    "Prof. Zucker is clearly very knowledgeable but doesn't know how to communicate with his students. In lectures, he doesn't pause to motivate any of his math or explain the intuition behind the science. By the end of his lecture, most students are completely lost. His notes are poorly written and often incomplete so you are left completely in the dark for exams.",
    "The information is very interesting, but the lectures were often off topic or confusingly technical. There was almost no feedback from problem sets and no practice exams to help us judge our understanding of the material prior to exams.",
    "I thought the course was good in that it was an interesting way to approach computer vision but its definitely unconventional maybe compared to classic computer vision courses. Zucker was very passionate when it came to the biology and it definitely came across which was cool!",
    "Professor Zucker tries to go through too many things during lecture and it's impossible to follow what he's saying during class. The notes are difficult to understand, and overall did not learn anything from lecture. The homeworks are nice and let you understand what basic topics in computer vision and get you working with numpy and other libraries that are useful. the topics covered for midterms and final were very unclear. A lot of the stuff tested on was not in the homeworks and made studying for them very stressful.",
    "Overall the course covered a very wide range of topics which both made it fascinating and difficult to follow. The course draws from topics in multivariable calculus (gradient and partial derivatives), linear algebra (matrix operations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors), discrete math (graph theory), biology\/neuroscience (neurons, action potentials), physics (circuits), and computer science (basic coding experience, computational complexity), but not in great depth in each area. I felt like I did learn a lot from the course but that I could have gotten more out of it if I had focused on it more. The lectures could have been a little bit clearer in terms of emphasizing the important topics, but this may have mostly been on me for not being able to devote as much time to this class as I would have liked.",
    "This was probably one of my least favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. The material was interesting, but it was presented in a way that made it convoluted and boring.",
    "The strengths were that the lectures were really engaging and the office hours were usually very helpful. The weakness of the course is that a lot of math is introduced really quickly and it might be helpful to host additional office hours for those who want to get a better understanding of the math involved. Separating office hours for the homework and for core concepts might be a good change.",
    "psets were good, but Zucker's lectures were a bit hard to understand since his handwriting is ridiculously hard to read.",
    "I heard people complain about the lack of organization in this class before but I love Zucker's lecturing because this is his life work and his care really shows. Some people might not like the class because it is pretty conceptual and does not go into the math too deeply. It is also unlike any other CS class because it's mostly conceptual math and some biology.",
    "The subject is unique and interesting, and Professor Zucker is a charismatic lecturer. Unfortunately, he presented the material in a very disorganized way, and it was never clear how topics related to one another. Many of his lectures were extremely hard for almost everybody to follow, but the notes posted on Canvas went much more in depth than the course required. This make the homework assignments the best way to learn the material in the first place.",
    "Get a new professor to teach the course, or revamp the course by reorganizing the material and concepts.",
    "Strengths: - Detailed lecture notes for this class are provided, so you'll always be able to catch up if you miss class. - It helps hone intuition about concepts that we tend to learn by rote in statistics classes. Weaknesses: - Lectures went into too much mathematical detail - You need to print out your PSETs, and that was inconvenient",
    "Great class, amazing professor who is clearly passionate about what hes teaching. At times I was unclear what the exams would look like, but they make them pretty fair. The TA is also very helpful.",
    "The content is really interesting. The lecture notes are very thorough. The problem sets are very informative. The class covers so much -- you really need to step back and connect all the ideas because then it gets really cool.",
    "The class is somewhat disorganized and Prof. Zucker's teaching style might feel a bit erratic at times (both in lecture and in lecture notes). However, if you put the time and effort into it, this becomes a really informative class.",
    "I think the lectures feel very fast at times but the PSETS were very well-paced.",
    "The course did a great job of providing a entire framework of vision, as well as explaining how the human brain handles it, without getting bogged down by the biophyiscal details of it. The course continuously built upon previous knowledge, with almost everything we learned in class being relevant to another topic later on. On the other hand, the homework for the class felt somewhat disconnected from the lectures, and the lecture notes were often far more detailed than what was covered in class. This made studying for tests both difficult and somewhat stressful, as it was always somewhat unclear just how much we were expected to know.",
    "Strengths: Material is cool, Professor Zucker is cool, and the TA Luciano is amazing! The lectures are pretty cool, and there are a lot of things that will surprise you about how human vision works and it's amazing to be able to translate that into computational methods. Weaknesses: The course is meant to give you a high level understanding and does not have any biology prereqs and skips over a lot of the math\/CS details, which I think was to make it more accessible, but this often gets frustrating because you end up having to memorise things since you don't actually understand the math\/CS\/biology behind it. We had very little idea about what to expect from the midterm, and it turned out okay, but I would have loved to understand a lot of the details better."

   "comments": [
    "I took it for fun. Most people in the class are CS majors looking for a science credit. You probably should go in with some coding \/ image processing experience.",
    "No, avoid this class like a plague. Unless you just want a Science credit that can also satisfy your CS major requirement without you learning anything.",
    "I would if you have done linear algebra and some form of calculus. It's tough to catch up if you haven't done these.",
    "I would say if the class description sounds interesting to you go for it! Warning, I am not sure if MATH 120 is enough preparation as there is a decent amount of linear algebra in the course so some familiarity with matrices would be helpful. You learn alot about the visual system in different animals and look at how we can use computational tools to model these systems. Overall I would say it was one of my favorite STEM courses here.",
    "Zucker focuses mostly on presenting the main ideas to students. Some of the math people don't like the lack of derivations of why things are the way they are, but I preferred the focus on the end result. The course was more mathy than expected, learned a bit about eigenvectors on my own to understand what was going on in the class, but if you pay attention then you an pick up what you need to without previous experience with the material. He provides accessible notes for each lecture that have the material, but they are long and sometimes filled with tangent material. Go to class if you what to know what material will be emphasized on the tests.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. At the least, you should shop this class. If you like Professor Zucker's lecture style and you find learning about computer vision interesting, this would be a nice fit.",
    "No, unless you're really interested in computer vision.",
    "Ya its worth stretching your mind.",
    "Yes, if you need a Sc credit.",
    "Yes if you want a general overview of how the brain and other biological concepts connect to mathematical models of learning - it is a little high level",
    "Absolutely this is an amazing class",
    "I would, purely because the intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence is, in my opinion, the most interesting subject out there.",
    "Interesting course, though I would recommend listing linear algebra as a prerequisite.",
    "I would but you have to know what youre getting into! This course is far from a gut. Its rewarding but it was hard, we cover a lot of content in the course and it feeds on knowledge of physical, biological and mathematical concepts.",
    "Yes, besides being a terrific science credit for CS majors, also a relevant course for those interested in human cognition \/ vision and intersection between biology + computer science",
    "Only if you are interested in biological vision translated into computational vision. Note that this is not an easy A at all.",
    "No why would you do this to yourself. Not worth the low workload. Take something thats actually fulfilling instead",
    "Yes because you learn a decent amount about Computational Vision with a very reasonable workload. The problem sets are well-written to consolidate the information taught in class. The professor and TAs are all very helpful and genuinely want you to succeed in the class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, save for as a Credit\/D. While the material has the potential to be significant and very interesting, Zucker's horrid lectures ruin it. It's so difficult to parse what is going on at any point in time. His handwriting is illegible (as he'll warn you), the axes on the graphs he draws are never labelled, his notation changes every lecture, etc. His \"lecture notes\" are incomplete and difficult to read. He goes on extended tangents or anecdotes without explanation.",
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to learn the material on your own.",
    "Good content, just confused on what we needed to know",
    "I would, provided you are either interested in math or biology. I was interested in math but had only a middling interest in biology, and I was still very pleased with the course content. If you are a CS major in need of a science credit, this course does double duty for you and is not substantially more work than your average CS class, so it's really a no brainer.",
    "I would if youre interested in computational vision but know that there will also be lots of biology involved.",
    "Yes This class is one of the few that teach you about something interesting and applicable in the real world. If nothing else, you can be inspired by Zucker's charisma.",
    "Yes. Strong teaching team. Interesting problem sets.",
    "Absolutely! This is an excellent course and the material is really interesting! You will learn about a variety of topics and apprecuate how they all tie together and can be used to study computational vision.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who hasn't taken linear algebra. I would have gained a lot more from this course had I really understood the fundamentals of the math behind many of the concepts.",
    "Yes, as long as youre interested in biology",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to computer science students. It's a very good intro to computer vision principles and the biological aspect made it easier for me to understand, personally. It's also a different way of thinking about machines. I can't speak to it for Biology-oriented students, but it seems like it would be just as helpful.",
    "Yes!! It is a very unique class. If you are interested in the mathematical underpinnings to vision, you will not find that material in any other class.",
    "Only if you are desperate for a science credit and you also need electives for the cs major. You cover a lot of important\/interesting topics but the learning is almost entirely on your own",
    "I took this course because it is one of the few SC credits among electives for the CPSC\/AMTH majors. If you need an SC, this course is a good way to kill two birds with one stone, but if you are just interested in the material take 470 instead.",
    "Sure. Its decently interesting and a science credit for CS majors!",
    "No, unless you really want a science credit. Overall, wish I had taken another CS elective. The class is relatively easy, just not nearly as engaging as I would have wanted it.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested in both the computer science\/math and biology sides of the course. Perhaps not if youre only interested in one side or the other.",
    "Yes! It is super super interesting. Professor Zucker is really wonderful. Would recommend sitting in the front row though because his handwriting is a bit difficult to read.",
    "recommend it if you have background in linear algebra and machine learning. Zucker moves really fast and it's easy to get lost if you can't understand Eigenvectors\/dimensionality\/etc.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. Many people in the class are CS majors looking for a science credit. It's mostly math to understand and mainly linear algebra. Zucker's teaching is divisive although I personally loved it and taking it with Luciano as a TF is a great plus.",
    "Unless you're extremely interested in the subject, I probably would not recommend CPSC 475. The content is interesting and the problem sets are a good opportunity to work with Python, but overall the course is just too disorganized. I took this class because I wanted to learn about Computational Vision, yet at the end of the semester I'm really not sure what I learned.",
    "No, I would not. Although some of the concepts were interesting, the course was very poorly organized and the professor was very poor at teaching. Zucker would often go on tangents that would not be relevant to the class. Multiple times throughout the semester I considered dropping the course due to the sheer disorganization and incapability of the professor's ability to teach the class. The prerequisites are also not very clear and indicative of the course difficulty. Clearly there were some students who were more conceptually comfortable with the topics than most people.",
    "Yes! A great science credit that also counts for the computer science major. It was very chill too.",
    "Yes! Great class, pretty manageable, very interesinrbg subject matter.",
    "Yes!",
    "As a CS major, I appreciate having taken this class and being introduced to a lot of concepts in biology",
    "I would recommend it to any student who needs some exposure to basic Comp Vision principles or neural nets. I think the neural net lectures stuck with me a lot and I attribute a lot of my continued interest in the field to this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, with the caveat that it is NOT a traditional computer science course. If you take this expecting to learn computer vision algorithms, or implement convolutional neural networks, you will be sorely disappointed. If, on the other hand, you have a broad interest in science and in the human brain, this is an absolutely amazing class that I could not recommend more. I have learned much about how our brains process vision over the course of the semester. Throughout the course of the class, it feels almost like you're performing the experiments yourself, trying to piece together what the responses mean, and connect them to what you already know. As a result, the lectures are extremely engaging, with immense payoff at the end of every lecture, when everything falls into place and the lightbulbs go off. If you are a STEM-minded individual who loves the thrill of the Eureka! moment, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes! It's pretty cool, even if you don't 100% understand what's going on all the time. However, I would only recommend this if you have a fair background in math\/CS. If you do, it's a good science credit too and can count for your major. But don't take it thinking it's a science gut!"
