    "yes, for a science credit",
    "The syllabus makes this class look more interesting than it is in reality, but its a small workload, and a small class setting where you can ask questions. Good way to get your science credit out of the way, definitely not great though.",
    "This class is a survey of human immunological responses and a series of relevant diseases and illnesses.",
    "A great science credit for people who are actually interested in biology, but don't want to be stuck in a class with science majors. The material was really interesting--the first third focuses on immunology, the second is one lecture and one discussion per week on a different microorganism, and the third is student presentations on a topic of your choice. Workload was very manageable--two problem sets, a short essay, a test, and a paper to go along with your final presentation. Everything was spaced out well, and Professor Kavathas is great and really flexible. I'd definitely recommend this class if you have a chance to take it.",
    "Yes. The beginning of the semester is pretty difficult - lots of memorizing - but once you get the basics down the class is not too hard and pretty interesting.",
    "This wasn't necessarily my favorite class of the semester, but if you're looking for a science class with a lower workload, this is it. Only the first half of the semester has an exam; afterwards, the class is based on discussions about papers on specific diseases. It exposes you to a great deal of information, but it's sometimes difficult to discern exactly what you should be taking out of lecture or putting into an assignment.",
    "Yes, super recommended. Great class, not that hard, midterm was easy, project was fun. This class will not weigh you down and you will learn interesting things!",
    "Immunology is a great course if you liked AP Bio and are interested in learning more biology but aren't interested in a lab class. We started with an overview of the immune system and then switched to learning about infectious diseases. The readings were very interesting for the most part, and they were rarely to difficult to understand. Professor Kavathas is great at answering questions and finding interesting articles to share with the class. I really enjoyed MCSB 109.",
    "Definitely take this class-great material, really interesting, and not too demanding. The project at the end of the semester is actually fun too and Professor Kavathas is great.",
    "Great for a science credit!",
    "Take this class. It\u0092s really, really interesting and next time you\u0092re sick, you\u0092ll feel much better knowing what\u0092s going on inside your body. If this doesn't convince you to go into research, I don't know what will!",
    "The course is divided into two distinct sections. The first half is on immunology, and is quite concept-heavy, and follows the format of traditional biology classes: problems sets and an exam. The second half is an exploration of particular microorganisms that cause diseases. During this half, you draw on concepts you learned in the first half, and the work here is more research-oriented, leading up to your paper. All in all, a fairly interesting and not overly difficult science class for non-science types, provided you're willing to put in the work to learn the concepts for the first half.",
    "Yes!!",
    "This is a great course to fulfill a Sc requirement. It's not a ton of work (midterm, 5-page paper on a book, final paper and presentation on the same topic) and the lectures and discussions are actually really interesting because the topic is so relevant to real life. Dr. Kavathas is the sweetest lady and the seminar format makes it fun."
