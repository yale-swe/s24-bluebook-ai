   "comments": [
    "A consistent level of work, nothing too intense. Fun course with a mix of short stories, videos, songs, and grammar. Recommended!",
    "This course is what it is--a broad overview of German grammar and usage. Not the most compelling material, but the Department works hard to put some worthwhile stuff into it, and it's necessary material if you're interested in learning the language (or completing the requirement).",
    "I am not exactly a german enthusiast, and I took the class just to fulfill langauage requirements. Having said that, this was a pretty painless course to take in order to obtain my distributional requirement, and Marleen was wonderful throughout the course.",
    "If you want to learn German, take it! It is a good way to learn lots of grammar and vocab.",
    "Great class. It is a lot of in depth review of what we learned in L1 and L2, and it was really helpful to go over all the grammar that was easy to forget over summer break.",
    "Hard work. Need to be tedious in your homework but it will pay off",
    "I would recommend German 130 to another student. It provides lots of helpful grammar instruction and vocabulary while developing (albeit perhaps less dramatically as could be wished) one's writing and reading ability. It also seeks to provide general German cultural competency as well.",
    "yes I would recommend if they have enough experience in German and\/or drive to learn."
