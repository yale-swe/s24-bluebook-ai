   "comments": [
    "This course was very helpful as my first course in philosophy, which I had no prior experience with before. Prof. Szabo explained concepts clearly, although at some points I felt lost in the mathematical interpretation of topics.",
    "Logical analysis of arguments, treatment of paradoxes, and multiple approaches to the problem of the infinite and infinitesimal in various forms.",
    "I had never been exposed to any of the kind of material in this course before, so I ended up learning a ton. The first half of the semester was set theory, which was tough for me as a humanities oriented person. But in the end, I appreciated learning about sets as a way of interpreting the world. The paradoxes we encountered were all really interesting (and some deeply unsettling), and I enjoyed thinking about responses and talking about them in section.",
    "I developed a good foundation in the philosophical argument, and the Reductio proof. The metaphysical and mathematical challenges of infinity were clearly and impactfully taught.",
    "This was my first philosophy class, and I learned how to think critically about dense sources. I also learned how to write philosophy papers, and to write proofs that combine math and philosophical thought.",
    "I learned what a paradox is and how to resolve them. I also learned how to make a philosophical argument and deconstruct philosophical claims into their premises. As a math major, I didn't learn all that much new math, except for perhaps ordinal and cardinal addition, and the Von-Nuemann \/ Zarmelo models for natural numbers.",
    "Interesting course that has much more of a quantitative side than the description suggests. Basically an intro analysis course, with more philosophy on the tail end. Psets are can be challenging if you don't have a good grasp of the math, but towards the end seem more manageable.",
    "Learning about set theory, thinking through arguments carefully, encountering paradoxes, thinking about competing theoretical commitments",
    "This course introduced me to the field of set theory in a way that was both introductory and thorough. Considering infinity not just from a philosophical level (through the paradoxes) but also from a mathematical point of view was certainly a challenge for me, but widened my knowledge of mathematical methods and skills, and changed my way of thinking. This course made me seriously question the nature of our world. Does motion really exist? Honestly, who knows!",
    "Mathematics associate with infinity, standard and nonstandard theories of infinity, aplications of infinity",
    "I learned how to think and argue using logical premises and to draw conclusions directly from them",
    "Learn about set theory, some mathematics, and topics related to infinity.",
    "Introduction to philosophical thought. Some basic analytical thinking, argumentation skills, and set theorey. Generally ability to breakdown an argument into series of premises and ways to attack individual premises to discredit an argument.",
    "I developed logic skills and also expanded my general knowledge of number theory.",
    "This course offers great insight into the operation and shortcomings of analytic philosophy.",
    "I gained some basic knowledge of set theory, and I thought more about classic philosophical paradoxes about infinity.",
    "how to better translate mathematical thinking into more abstract concepts. questioning base assumptions"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt that the staff teaching this course had a very weak grasp on the material and it made the lectures and sections honestly pretty miserable.",
    "Strengths: Both Prof. Szabo and my TF (William Ratoff) were extremely helpful in answering questions and responding to my e-mails when asked for help. The course was organized and prepared very well. Weaknesses: Although there are no QR prerequisites for the class (and I feel that is appropriate), it would be more helpful to cover the mathematical concepts in slightly more depth (set theory, probability, etc.)--which seemed to have been expected of us. Although these topics were not discussed extensively, I found myself lost at some points regarding understanding the math behind the concepts covered in class. For those with a strong math background, this was not a problem, but at the beginning of the course I did feel very behind.",
    "This course kept me fascinated with its interdisciplinary and really interesting discussions. The psets, the quiz, and the paper were all manageable while also rewarding. I really can't find major issues that need to be improved. Perhaps tt'd been better if the last pset weren't in the same week as the final paper, since they really add to the extra workload at the end of term, on top of studying for finals.",
    "Psets were tough, especially at first. They certainly do not take 1-2 hours as the syllabus suggests, so it would be helpful if that were removed from the syllabus so as not to mislead anyone.",
    "Better synergy between lecture and section.",
    "Professor Szabo was a great professor who was very engaging and passionate about the course material. Some presentations of the material, however, were a tad confusing, and could have used more clarification.",
    "The handouts are excellent and very clear. I thought the course was very well structured and organized. I do not really have any suggestions for the course besides perhaps splitting it into to difficulty levels. I think half the class was math majors and really familiar with the way of thinking and the material required for the course, while the other half struggled a lot with proof.",
    "More description of the math that will be covered in the course would be helpful.",
    "The professor sometimes go over difficult materials a bit too swiftly, e.g. ordinal and cardinal calculation rules. The TAs do not always have a clear grasp of the problems in class. It would be better if the professor can hold more office hours to go through the material, and the TAs be more knowledgeable in the area.",
    "The portion of the class focused on set theory is taught at a level difficult to grasp in the time alotted, especially for non-Math majors.",
    "Some of the mathematical concepts could be explained a bit more carefully. It is obviously difficult to strike a balance, given the mathematical skill of a lot of the students taking the class, but maybe by separating discussion sections into some having a more maths-based focus and some being more holistic\/focusing on the philosophy would help. A strength is the structure of the course and the coursework. The handouts at each lecture are fantastic, and the structure of the workload as a pset every week and a half or so was good.",
    "The lectures are not engaging. They are often not relevant to the information being tested on.",
    "Strengths- makes you think about complex ideas- really interesting material Weaknesses\/Improvements- lecture format- would be better as a seminar with more opportunities for discussion. Also, sometimes the problem sets took substantially longer than the syllabus said they should take, especially early on in the course (they weren't unreasonable in length, just different than what was advertised). The course description said no math prereqs were necessary, but I ended up using things I learned in calculus in the class and I know some of my friends without this background struggled.",
    "It's hard to understand the set notation without any background, so some rudimentary explanation early on would help.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, lots of cool paradoxes Weakness: Professor Z is almost impossible to follow. Uses a lot of vague pronouns and his stream of consciousness bounces from topic to topic.",
    "Strengths: Presents the paradoxes of infinity clearly. Builds upon material. Visits concepts from different angles Weaknesses: Work load of course is unclear. Syllabus is much more exciting than course is.",
    "Very interesting class, but the homework assignments were particularly hard and not at all taught in class, and the TAs struggled to try to cover the material.",
    "There is no attention to history of philosophy, especially not to the origins of the concept of numbers or of infinity; no credence given to the possibility of thinking anything contrary to the professor's views; no interest in serious philosophical discussion; focus only on presenting the class with \"mysteries\" without entering into any substantive conversation about why they are mysterious, or what this might tell us about how we're doing philosophy; no conscience given to the shortcomings of analytic philosophy; no readings of views contradictory to that of the professor (except David Hume, whose argument was \"disproven\" in class); nothing that would challenge any of the STEM majors in the class to doubt or question the foundations of their disciplines (i.e. mathematics as we do them); no attention to our modern \"best physics\" (quantum theory) that clearly flies contrary to the tenets of the class; constant use of logic to try to prove things about practical existence, which is a false matching... All this was left out, but there was enough space in the syllabus for nearly four weeks of decision theory, whose connection to infinity is slim. No serious philosophers other than Hume were read. Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Leibniz, Levinas, Wittgenstein, Aquinas and the entire Scholastic school, Hobbes, Locke, Galileo, Newtonall discuss the infinite in their philosophies, but none appears on the syllabus.",
    "I thought that this course was well-organized, but it also felt like it died off after the midterm in terms of interestingness and understandability. I still don't really understand extended simples or Banach-Tsarsky so oh well. In a way, I think the paper and the exam should be swapped so that it's a midterm paper and a final exam to keep everyone in the class motivated to keep going and keep trying.",
    "The strength of this course is that it exposes students to new ways of thinking about infinity, no matter whether they have stronger backgrounds in math or philosophy. At times though, those two approaches felt disparate rather than integrated. It was not always clear how the different sections of the course related to one another. Overall, I enjoyed working through the challenging problem sets, but some questions did not seem to be closely connected to the material presented in class.",
    "it felt like the course was stuck in a weird place between being super quantitative vs qualitative. As a STEM major it definitely would have felt nice to feel more catered to in the sense of thinking from the mathematical perspective more"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not; run as far away from this class as you can. If you're a mathy person looking for a gut, the misery you'll experience from taking this class is earnestly not worth it and there's many other classes you could be taking instead of this one. If you already know some set theory (e.g. cpsc 202) this class will not be a challenge to you. If you're not good at math but heard from your mathy friends that this class is easy, you'll probably have a tough time considering you have to learn a pretty sizable amount of set theory for this course. It's easy and graded extremely generously, but it's not really a gut unless you're committed to taking it cred\/D.",
    "HU for STEM people.",
    "Yes, this course helped develop my interest in philosophy and made me want to take more courses in the department. Prof. Szabo is very engaging and welcomes student contribution to discussion during class.",
    "Awesome class with some really interesting topics. Kept me fascinated throughout the term. The psets, the quiz and the paper were all very manageable. One thing is that parts of the class has quite a mathematics\/logic emphasis, since it's a valuable tool to tackle to some types of problem. If you're ok with that I'm sure you'll have a blast with the class, if you love questions that leave you saying \"wait what hold on that's really cool\" every minute.",
    "Do take this course if you're a humanities person in need of a QR credit. We do set theory for the first month or so, which was tough for me, but I appreciated learning the material in the end. It totally frames your thinking for the rest of the course, which is more philosophy-oriented and deals with paradoxes. This class is by no means a gut, though it is also not particularly difficult. Your experience may also heavily depend on your TA. My TA, Kate, was super awesome and helpful and would always be willing to help with psets\/paper writing\/understanding material in general.",
    "Yes--we worked through crucial paradoxes and made important connections between math and philosophy.",
    "I absolutely would. It requires a liking, or at least a tolerance, for math and proofs, but it doesn't require formality. I really enjoyed the introduction to philosophy and infinite paradoxes.",
    "I recommend this course to any math major looking for a humanities credit. You will find this course relaxing and easy, but not completely boring because you can stop to think about the puzzling nature of infinity and all these absurd paradoxes. You can make the class interesting if you pick an interesting topic for your final paper, and you can turn part of you paper a straight up math problem.",
    "If you're a strong QR student, this class is a very manageable HU credit (only 1 final paper).",
    "definitely! Prof. Szabo is a great and engaging lecturer. The materials are interesting. It helps you get an idea of the problems associated with infinity --- it's no longer an empty big word after the class! You get to learn about set theory, think through arguments carefully, encounter many paradoxes, and think about how to choose between competing theoretical commitments. It's a good class.",
    "I would, but I would tell them to understand exactly what the class is before making a decision whether or not to take it. It was certainly more mathematics-based than I had expected, which was actually a really good thing, but I know that it took some humanities-focused students by surprise.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to engage with he material if you want to learn something. This class will make you think- its not the kind of class you can only think about during lecture and while doing the psets.",
    "Yes, I think that the class material is very interesting and relevant to other fields. It is also a class that anyone can take regardless of their background",
    "Would not quite recommend. Although the topics are pretty interesting, there is no overall structure in the class. It just flows through ad hoc topics that seem tangentially related to infinity.",
    "The class itself is interesting and you'll learn a lot, but it's very frustrating. The homework assignments are related to the work but not super clearly, and the things you need to know for them are not taught. Take this class if you already know set theory and formal logic I suppose? But this is supposed to be an introductory class. Overall this class is really not well thought out - the material itself has been thought out, but the class is not set up as an intro or even intermediate class. It has some concepts that are good for phil beginners, but then a ton of really math and phil-logic stuff that wasn't taught.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a strong understanding of quantitative concepts. Although it is a philosophy course, the professor focuses a lot on many interesting mathematical topics.",
    "No. Classes like these are why most people think philosophy is not worthwhile.",
    "I thought this was a really fun course. It's kind of an odd mix of the QR kids who need a HU credit and the HU kids who need a QR credit, but I think it's interesting that everyone brings something unique to the table. Definitely go to lectures because not everything is in the handouts. I am one of the aforementioned QR kids, so I found the math very reasonable, however I could see why someone without the same background would struggle. The most important concepts are infinite series and infinitesimals\/derivatives. You can probably find an hour or two worth of YouTube videos to bring you up to speed on everything you need to know. Study the problem sets for the midterm.",
    "This course is one that is often suggested to Humanities majors so they can receive a QR credit. For those who think that this is accurate information, it is not! I do not recommend this course to those Humanities majors in any way. It is definitely twisted more for STEM majors and it is not well organized or accessible at all to those who are interested more in the philosophical side. The midterm is mainly math with only one philosophical question in total. The p-sets are mainly math orientated and only begins to be philosophical towards the second half of the course. This makes it hard for those interested in the philosophy side to become really hooked into the subject from the beginning.",
    "Yes! The course is engaging and will expose you to new ways of thinking about philosophical problems.",
    "I think for STEM people it's a good balancing course. It looks at interesting concepts but isn't super-tough. It did feel at times for someone not from a philosophy background that arguments were made purely for argument's sake, but that is probably a natural result of personal methods of thinking."
