    "Take whatever capstone Thomas Graham is teaching. He's the best.",
    "Capstone so you have to, and they change every year. but a cool experience that I enjoyed.",
    "My usual philosophy toward picking classes is to pick the professor, not the subject matter. Prof. Graham was wonderful and if he's teaching a capstone on something you're mildly interested, I'd definitely recommend taking it with him. That said, I learned from experience that if you're decidedly not interested in a subject (e.g. \"terrorism\" broadly defined), or are skeptical about the contributions that you as a small cluster of students can make (e.g. as seven undergrads not especially interested in counterterrorism policy), don't take the class anyway just because you like the professor!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend to another student. Take it with Thomas Graham: he is an amazing professor. The workload is not light, but the opportunity to work with Professor Graham and other students on a real-life project is an opportunity you should not pass by (not that you could if you are a Global Affairs major).",
    "I highly recommend this Capstone, especially if you are interested in counterterrorism and national security!!",
    "The capstone project requires a lot of effort and team work (which at times can be arduous and frustrating), but it will be the most rewarding class that you have ever taken at Yale. Being able to deliver a final product to a client alongside your team after months of working together is a unique opportunity to have whilst still in college. Definitely one of the highlights of my Yale education; will make you feel thankful for being a Global Affairs major."
