   "comments": [
    "Its a demanding course but very rewarding. It teaches you to think spatially and express your ideas through alternate forms.",
    "Writing this evaluation seems stupid because you have to take it to be in the major. But here are some recommendations\": one- be careful about signing up for classes that meet in the morning before studio-- you might find yourself wanting time in the morning to finish a project or catch up on sleep. two- we're not given much instruction on how to use the equipment\/build good models, so ask Tim for help in the woodshop- he can actually help you make your models in a time-effective way. three- VERY IMPORTANT- photograph all of your projects the week you turn them in. space is really tight in studio and a lot of stuff gets ruined, so its better to photograph them when they're in good shape. You'll have to turn in a portfolio at the end of semester, anyway, so it will save you panic time.",
    "It's a very intense course that is very enjoyable if you like doing the type things that are being done in an architecture studio, yet even so you end up wondering if all the stress and the sleep deprivation was worth it. We certainly had a very steep learning curve as was told at the beginning of the semester, yet this had a cost on the quality of life of almost all students in class.",
    "This course assigns very open ended assignments, which is definitely a good thing, as it is the start of a whole new way of thinking, but it can also be frustrating at first, because it can be difficult to narrow down your ideas and get to work. This course is very rigorous, with weekly assignments. By the end of the semester, you will be pulling one all-nighter per week and have barely any free time, but the studio atmosphere at Yale is wonderful, with everyone working alongside one another in a state-of the art workspace.",
    "This is very time-consuming class that you will only begin to enjoy once you get into it and begin to infuse your own creativity into it, and that is only really possible once you get past the first semi-boring projects that help you get a foundation in the woodshop\/lasercutting, etc.The teachers are really looking for you to make a system of rules to base your decisions off of, so make sure to make one and stick to it!Also, study models are sooooo important. I don't think that I can stress this enough. Make them, and spend time on them, thinking them through.",
    "No unless you have to take it. If you are an archi student though, it gives you a sneak peek into the life of an archi grad student. You never leave studio",
    "Junior studio is crazy. It is not a rumor. You will be up all night almost every week. However, despite this, the class is extremely rewarding. Looking back at my progression throughout this semester, I realize just how much I learned - I feel like my ability to think spatially and just come up with ideas for projects really improved. If the class had not been as intense and challenging as it had been, I likely would not feel this way. Bimal and Hilary are good professors, but you will often feel on your own with projects. You will have to think independently and really be able to develop your ideas. It is challenging, but extremely rewarding. Welcome to the architecture major!",
    "Studio is quite a lot of work, and sometimes it can be frustrating because you're review may be entirely unsatisfactory. Be prepared to commit a lot your free time to studio and architecture because it's the type of work that can never really be put away. Also understand, however, that it's a process and you take something out of every assignment, gradually building a repertoire of knowledge. Some of the formal exercises can be difficult because they're so arbitrary, but I think the best part is working alongside your fellow majors and learning from them.",
    "This class is really nothing I want to experience again. This is only for architecture majors and it needs to stay that way.",
    "It is required for all junior architecture majors. It was a lot of work. Get ready for a lot of all nighters and late nights. Although, at times people were frustrated with the different projects, I think at the end everyone was happy with the work they produced. You really improve a lot during the semester. It was worth the work. I really enjoyed it. Its the first time we got to design something.",
    "with patience",
    "It's required, but is definitely a crazy new experience. I learned a ton over the semester, but there were many many frustrations along the way.",
    "Only, take Arch. 250 if you are an architecture major. The class is a lot of work. You will be doing weekly projects, which warrant many sleepless nights. The key is planning ahead. Get started on projects as soon as you get them, don\u0092t wait till the last minute.",
    "I mean, it's mandatory. Some advice, though: take a light courseload. Studio, in its current form, requires you to complete one project per week, which is at least as much work as a five-page paper. Stay organized; start assignments early; and, pace yourself, i.e., don't spend too long on any one thing.",
    "This course is an intense introductory studio course. There is a lot of course material condensed into one semester. However, it is extremly rewarding in the end to see how much everyone has improved. Be prepared to pull all-nighters if you decide to take this class."
