    "20 hours of research is probably what you'll be spending in lab if you plan to do anything substantial at all, so I would recommend 495 to anyone who actually wants to have a legitimate project.",
    "Great option to take if you want to be really devoted to a project. Not much direction from the class structure which leaves pretty much everything up to your PI. Get a PI you like and you'll be really happy you took this class.",
    "I would recommend taking MCDB 495, especially if you are interested in doing research after graduation. Twenty hours in the lab is a lot of time but after my experience this semester, it's hard to imagine accomplishing too much with less time in the lab. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who is interested in research and wants to learn a lot about any area of interest."
