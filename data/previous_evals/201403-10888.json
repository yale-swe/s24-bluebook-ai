    "Before this class, I only heard of the term and vaguely interpreted its definition judging from the literal meaning of the term. However, it seems that i am naturally drawn to such black, ironic, and tragic styles as well as suspense and horror films. I found that as a filmgoer, I've been focusing my attention to film noirs unconsciously for a fairly long time. I am interested in all the underground films in China, not just because they are banned, I found they are truly filmed with sincerity and passion devoted by filmmakers, although they are not flawless or even still of coarse quality. And I feel that the future of China is tie to the future of Chinese film noirs, not solely of course. I did some research on the development of the film censorship in America in light of the Production Code of 1930 you shared with us, and to my surprise, film noir thrived under the shadow of this Code. Or optimistically, the Code some how forced the filmmaker to explore other possibility to express themselves. Then they invented such highly stylized and symbolic manifestation. Before, I always take the strict censorship and political terror as an excuse for the suffocation of Chinese film noir or even realist films. Now, I always comfort and encourage my friends struggling in the film industry in China with the history of film noir. Now, I can see the hope and a feasible way to approach film noir. I do wish Chinese film noir all the best in the near future, as Chinese has endured great pains and hardships, as they are the most tolerant people I've ever seen. Thank you."
