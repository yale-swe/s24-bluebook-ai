   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Professor Zeidler is a wonderful lecturer and all of the TAs are great. Not too much work. Great for art history students and newbies alike.",
    "Take this class! It is low on work and high on reward.",
    "Definitely recommend it as you learn about 2 of the greatest artists of the 20th century, the works are beautiful, and the historical context behind their creation is always fascinating",
    "I would only recommend this class if you truly love Picasso and Matisse. Otherwise, lectures will feel slow and boring.",
    "Yes! Take it.",
    "Picasso and Matisse is what it sounds like, a lecture on Picasso and Matisse (this semester, much more focused on Picasso). I immensely enjoyed the lectures but, as a non-History of Art major, I felt intimated in section. It is an eye-opening course that I would certainly recommend and it is also not that much work, except that studying for the exams was a bit brutal, just in terms of being able to identify so many paintings.",
    "Overview of Picasso and Matisse (mostly Picasso though). It may be helpful to have taken an intro European art history class since we do compare Picasso and Matisse's work to historical European (esp. Renaissance) art, but it's not necessary. Recommended to those interested in learning about the beginning of modern art! I didn't enjoy or understand modern art at all before taking this class, and now I at least have a context for understanding it when I go to MOMA.",
    "Yes, Great class. Will learn a lot, and enrich you life.",
    "Absolutely phenomenal course! This was my first art history class at Yale and I loved it. Professor Zeidler gives incredible lectures that are complex but also easily approachable if you are new to the subject. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone and everyone. Picasso and Matisse are some of the most recognized artists in the world, but despite that, no one truly understands their art. This class changed all of that. You get to see these artists through their philosophies, their methods, their contexts. The workload is very light, just a midterm, an essay, and a final. The exams aren't cumulative, and actually quite easy to study for if you attend lecture.If you ever take a class with Zeidler, know that he speaks very quietly, so be sure to sit near the front. He's a genius. It's worth it.",
    "Fairly straightforward course - I liked it a lot. Zeidler's lectures are definitely interesting but he speaks pretty quietly so I had a hard time concentrating if I was already tired. Would recommend, especially credit\/d.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody in a heartbeat. Professor Zeidler is amazing and will teach you to look at art in new ways. The pieces covered are so interesting, and the workload is not too rough, since the emphasis is on the pieces themselves and not the literature written about them. I found it extremely rewarding and am so happy that I decided to take it.",
    "If you like art history and Picasso or Matisse, then the question is why haven't you taken then course?",
    "great lecture. a bit repetitive and hard to hear but very interesting.",
    "PIcasso and Matisse is an art history course---primarily focused on Picasso and Matisse very late in the semester. It is an awesome art history course to start with if you've never taken one, or a great one to take if you've taken many. I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course highly even to those not majoring in HSAR. It is an incredibly fascinating class.",
    "This is a great course for anyone who wants to learn about modern art and listen to very compelling and fun lectures.",
    "Great class! Take it if you are interested in the subject material and can memorize a good amount of information and fact about a lot of paintings. The workload is not very intense and it is pretty easy to get a good grade but it does require studying pretty intensely for the midterm and final. The course was overall a great experience, really interesting lectures and great discussions sections.",
    "Take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend Picasso and Matisse to a fellow student, especially if they are interested in art. It is a wonderful introduction to the work of two important artists and really changes the way you see art in general.",
    "Worth taking.",
    "excellent professor and extremely interesting topic for any major",
    "take it! super chill and super interesting.",
    "Recommended with reservation. This was my first art history class, and I think I would have been better off taking a survey course. It was fun, but I'm not really sure I learned much of anything. Sometimes Zeidler's lectures are great with really amazing observations, and other times I thought they were frustratingly imprecise and flowery. Also need to show up early to get a good seat, otherwise Zeidler is impossible to hear.",
    "You will feel smarter after every lecture. Interesting, well-taught class on two of history's most revered artists.",
    "Yes. Zeidler is a genius who will teach you how to look well.",
    "Yes! Just don't expect a ton of Matisse",
    "Absolutely take this course, totally eye-opening for majors and non-majors.",
    "A really great class. Zeidler is fantastic. Take it if you can!",
    "This is a fun and engaging HSAR class",
    "I would recommend this to students who have some background in art history or\/and love for contemporary art.",
    "This course is amazing. Take a class with Professor Zeidler if you can. Even if you're not an art history major you will love it.",
    "It's a great class to take to learn more about Picasso and Matisse.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the subject matter! I learned a lot about both artists and about work in general. The amount of work wasn't too intense so I would really encourage students to take it. Zeidler is brilliant and each and every class was worthwhile.",
    "I highly recommend this class for students who are interested in taking an art history course but have not taken such classes in the past. Professor Zeidler is a fantastic lecturer and you will gain a great understanding of how to view\/interpret modern art.",
    "It is an ok class. Not as fun as i thought it would be. Some interesting things are said in lecture. Not a ton of work.",
    "Yes definitely! The workload is low and the content is consistently very interesting. Zeidler has great insights.",
    "This class was very rewarding and gave me a new appreciation for both artists and art history in general. Perhaps it would have been better to take a survey course first. The readings are challenging if you've never been exposed to art history writings.",
    "This class was an interesting taste of art history. The overarching themes were very interesting but they were too drawn out. Also many of the points pertaining to women seemed like a stretch.",
    "Take this class! I couldn't recommend it any more highly. It provides an in-depth look at two influential artists of the 20th century.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! Sebastian Zeidler is an incredible and engaging lecturer."
