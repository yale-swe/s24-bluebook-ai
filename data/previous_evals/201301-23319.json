    "Skolnik is wonderful, has amazing practical experience, and loves hanging out with his students; you should take this class just for the opportunity to get to know him! In terms of the material - the course sometimes feels a little condescendingly 101, as every case study presented seems to have the same basic solution. Yet, Skolnik brought in so many awesome guest speakers who were able to touch upon some of these topics with real nuance and complexity, which resolved that issue. Skolnik sometimes forgets to present the downsides of some of the global health \"tools\" he discusses. Overall, though, a wonderful introduction to global health, with a fair workload. I'm so glad I took this class!",
    "take it--an amazing course. You will learn so much and gain important perspective in the world of global health. Professor Skolnik and great--what all professors at Yale should be.",
    "If you are at all interested in Global health, TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much- much more than you could imagine. You will be inspired to tackle health issues after this class. The policy briefs (short papers- you write 3 of them) are actually fun to write. I looked forward to going to class and even to going to section. This class will change your life.",
    "Great, very unique class. Really unlike any other I have taken here in the best sense possible. You really will learn practical, important, and essential information for living in this world, even if you don't want to go into Global Health. Prof. Skolnik is such a character--he's like the super-successful, well-connected, very knowledgeable, and egotistical, yet self-deprecating uncle you always wanted but never had. But seriously--TAKE IT! Go to lectures, take notes, read the book--you'll be fine. And you'll come out of it with an enriched worldview, having spent this semester engaged with how to address important world issues and learning from both Skolnik and like-minded peers.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the topic. You'll learn a lot and meet cool\/important people.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale so far. Great student-teacher interactions, interesting course material, and fantastic community to be a part of.",
    "This is a fantastic introduction to Global Health. I would strongly recommend it if you are interested in gaining a broad and comprehensive view of challenges in global health. Professor Skolnik is a fantastic instructor and valuable resource.",
    "If you have the opportunity, you should absolutely take a class with Professor Skolnik. He will boast to you that he is the most accessible, attentive, devoted professor at the very beginning of the course... and you should take him seriously. I have never seen a professor go so out of his way to accommodate his students: review sessions at 9pm, Skyping into class when he was ill, hosting lunches and dinners with global health leaders, and meeting individually with students after hours and into the evening to make sure we're all engaging with the course material. The three short papers, midterm, and final are all very rigorous, and you should be warned that you will get out of this class what you put into it. Truly, this class has been transformative and worthwhile.",
    "Yes - very engaging class that will teach you a lot about current issues in global health and the most cost-effective approaches to tackle them. This all comes from an expert in the field who's highly engaged with students and truly helpful.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to learn and enter the world of global health. I am really glad I took this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a great class, the professor was engaging, the assignments were interesting, and the sections were fun. It is a lot of work though, but the knowledge is worth it. The professor is very helpful.If the class interests you, keep trying until you get into the class, even if you have to audit it, as it is truly my favorite class.",
    "This should be one of those \"must take at Yale\" classes. Professor Skolnik is passionate, vibrant, and helpful. The way he runs his class is very engaging and a breath of fresh air from the sea of \"learning for learning's sake\" classes at Yale. Though I wouldn't call this pre-professional by any means, I have definitely learned how to write policy briefs and how to have intelligent discussion on matters pertinent to Global Health. Also Professor Skolnik is just AWESOME.",
    "Take it! One of the best taught courses at Yale",
    "I would recommend anyone who is interested in public health and would like to a general foundation.",
    "Overview of health in LMICs. Great course. Skolnik is solid, as is the text book. Might move a little too fast for freshmen and even sophomores. Take the class if you want a solid overview of health in the developing world. I learned a tremendous amount -- one of my favorite classes at Yale.In order to do well:1. Go to every lecture and take extensive notes. You will soon learn that Skolnik cares much about himself and what he says, and the tests reflect that.2. Memorize the main messages at the end of each chapter. He wrote the book so the same logic as above applies.3. Know the figures\/tables in the text really well. They distill the words well.4. Do what he says on the policy briefs. Don't try to do too much. He likes simplicity in everything (thankfully).5. Other readings are helpful to supplement what is said but not very necessary at all.Take it. Have fun.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in learning more about global health. It is really enjoyable and you truly learn a lot of practical information about the realities of health in different parts of the world. I have not talked to a single person who has regretted taking this class or thought that they haven't learned a lot.",
    "Take it! This class provides you with a great broad perspective on health issues around the world and professor Skolnik is an amazing man (his sense of humor may be too much for some, but hey).",
    "This class is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The professor is absolutely amazing and approachable. I would definitely recommend this class, it is a must take class before you graduate. However, it is a lot of hard work and there is a lot of stuff you are graded upon. The class isn't curved so getting an A is quite difficult but not impossible. I would recommend this class as a Credit\/D\/Fail for sure. Having said this, don't let this deter you from taking this class because you would definitely regret it.",
    "Professor Skolnik teaches one of the best classes on Yale's campus. This course is interactive, fact-based, and all of the crap is cut. There is not busy work, you are tested on solid concepts, and YOU LEARN SO MUCH I LOVE IT YAY. But be prepared to do ALL of the reading. You learn how to SAVE THE WORLD. Save it. Saaaave those global people.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Absolutely! Take this class and you will learn a lot about health problems around the world. Everyone must take a class with Professor Skolnik! All Yale professors should be like him! But honestly if you're looking to go into global health then this class is a must! The course load is not heavy bu you must always do your reading! Policy briefs become easier to write once you understand how he wants them to be written, and what should go into the,\/",
    "YES! Take it take it take it if you can get in. The course is organized really well, with a nice array of fantastic guest speakers (that you only get to hear because of skolnik's connections), a textbook that skolnik wrote, and some articles.And it counts as a writing credit",
    "Take it! The format seems intimidating at first but it's super helpful. By far one of the best courses I took at Yale.",
    "Fantastic class that everyone should take!",
    "Great.",
    "This is a great survey class on global health. You cover what is global health, all of the relevant issues, and - most interestingly and importantly, in my opinion - how to address these issues. The class really focuses on theGlobal Burden of Disease study and really helps you understand the underlying issues as well as the current state of progress. Professor Skolnik is super knowledgeable, plus his energy and willingness to know every student makes this class great."
