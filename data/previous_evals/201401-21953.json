    "Good first lab, meticulous, hard to get A.",
    "This is a great class and good introductory into lab life at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you have to, don't if you don't. It will ground you in classical laboratory procedure, but unless you need that for a major, the class will be very full for you. Do as much work as you can before you enter the lab to save time. This includes making graphs, sketching out procedures, etc.",
    "I believe Chem 116L is a class that many STEM majors take because it is a requirement for upper level science classes. In that way, I wouldn't say it was my favorite class, but manageable for one who must take it in order to get to higher level classes.",
    "Just an average general chemistry lab.",
    "This lab is a great accompaniment to Chem 114, since the lessons you learn the General Chem course will translate into the lab during the same week. Four hours may seem like a long time, but more often than not, we would finish and leave earlier than expected. The workload is not too much to handle: just a lab report almost every week and a 15 minute quiz to prepare for on your lab day."
