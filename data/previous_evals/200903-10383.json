    "Yes, if you are interested in artificial intelligence or robotics",
    "Yes,I would because other than course requirements. Scaz touches on various other topics which are not part of the coursework. I particularly liked his occasional digressions into psychology. They keep the class interesting and lively.",
    "I definitely wouldrecommend this course, especially if you're trying to gain background on the subject of AI. This course offers a very good overview of what is AI, brief history and current research in AI, and problems that are still being faced.The problem sets (the coding ones) are quite challenging so I'd recommend taking the course with a few friends.",
    "I would recommend this class to most first year grad students in computer related fields. It gave a great review of the state of the art in terms of high tech computing as well as focusing on the current weaknesses of computer learning applications."

   "comments": [
    "The course have given me an insight into various techniques that exist in AI. Though I may not know each of these techniques in detail. I now know where and how I can look up information if I were to implement any of the techniques covered in the course.",
    "I really liked the overview of AI, from history to current topics to the future. I also really liked the problem sets that afforded me hands-on experience, such as coding a piece of partial order planners, running a neural network in Matlab, generating a genetic algorithm, etc. The neural network topics are directly applicable to my research.",
    "I will undoubtedly use many of the learning algorithms presented in the class in my future robotics research. The class has also helped to develop new control ideas for prosthetics."
