   "comments": [
    "If you are a linguistics or cog sci major, do yourself a favor and take morphology. On the intellectual side, you need to know this material before you can do any substantial research in linguistics, or even follow the theoretical parts of most morphology papers. On the more practical side, this is a good opportunity to review and improve your knowledge of phonology, and to get a handle on some major debates in linguistic theory.Be especially sure to take this class if Steve Anderson is teaching it. His teaching style is not for everyone, but if you are serious about linguistics, you will really appreciate the chance to learn this material from him (one of the world experts, if not THE world expert, on the field). He can be intimidating, but is very nice and has an incredible knowledge of world linguistic diversity.Workload: spring 2012 had 6 psets (I spent about 5 hours on each), with the lowest grade dropped, about 50pp of reading a class, and a 10-15pp final paper.",
    "Exactly as advertised in terms of content but disappointing as a class because the lectures, problem sets, and readings don't interact in any way, so you don't feel like you've walked away with anythingmeaningful. The lectures are valuable but extremely dry and it takes a lot of focus to get through them. I think doing the reading would have helped a lot but there was just no incentive to do so-- it didn't directly connect to anything we were doing.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, at least not with this professor. I was often very confused as to how the different parts of the course came together. That is, it seemed as though what we learned in class differed from what was in the readings, which differed from what was required to do the homework. I understand that the professor had his own theory to push, but there was no integration of the different theories. Occasionally there was a rationale presented, as to how his theory improved upon others, but overall, it was very confusing. Perhaps with another professor, the course would be better.",
    "This course gives a good introduction to morphology and the coursework is manageable. I would certainly recommend it if you are a linguistics major."
