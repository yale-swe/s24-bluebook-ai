    "kind of a heavy reading list but so worth it!! if the class is offered again, take it!!!",
    "This was one of the most illuminating and enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale, and one I cannot recommend highly enough. Professor Homans has done an excellent job of constructing a coherent and complex narrative, not only about the impact of the First World War on cultural attitudes toward gender and sexuality, but of the unique ways in which literature reflects those changes. I feel as though I've come out of this course with a new, and incredibly fruitful, relationship with literature - which was not something I expected to find, but which has been enormously exciting and has really revitalized my appreciation for this discipline.",
    "This is an absolutely fascinating survey of World War One literature, from poems to novels to critical analysis, conducted through the lens of gender, sexuality, and modernity. You will learn a lot about an understudied but extremely critical period - I highly recommend it. The class is an exploration of a variety of persistent tropes - the shell-shocked soldier, the liberated nurse, the homosocial band of brothers, the traumatized or callously indifferent civilians - from multiple angles.",
    "The course demonstrates the impact of world war I on literature, especially on the emergence of new literary forms to attempt to capture the experience of the war. Through these forms, questions of gender and sexuality, and other social transformations are raised by the texts. Texts range from obscure to prominent works by Hemingway and Woolf."
