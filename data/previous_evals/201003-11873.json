   "comments": [
    "Math 120-06 was aimed at preparing students for the tests. There was little to no explanation of the practical applications of the mathematical concepts. For some, this may be exactly what they want, but for others, the class becomes extremely boring. I only recommend this class for students who only care about passing the class and have to take the class.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. I understand that for many it is obligatory one but it will not bring any satisfaction. For good and talented students it will be only a waste of their time and boring sets of exercises-recipes. For weak students, it will be very frustrating, as it is very hard to get an effective help from anyone. They will start to perceive math as a weird mystery, inaccessible to their minds, which is 100% wrong.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I read Dr. Rabin's bad reviews before taking the class and figured that it was just kids upset at getting bad grades or who weren't good at math in the first place. That's definitely not true, the class just sucks! And it's not just Dr. Rabin, the whole structure of Math 120 is really bad\/boring\/painful. I have heard that the engineering department offers an equivalent math course. Take that instead if at all possible. It can't be worse than this class!",
    "The material is interesting enough, but don't expect Professor Rabin to electrify it. If you begin the semester disinterested, there is no hope. The tests aren't particularly absurd, but it would be nice if problem sets counted for more of the grade. It felt almost like a waste of time doing a problem set a week for only 10% of my grade.",
    "If you do not have to take Math 120, don't. There are other ways to put yourself on misery. If you are an engineering student, take ENAS 151 instead.",
    "If you are planning to major in engineering, I would suggest that you take up ENAS 151 instead of Math 120. ENAS fulfills the same requirement you need for your major and is suppose to be a slightly easier course. In addition, the math you learn in ENAS 151 would be more applicable to your major.",
    "I took the class as a freshman coming into my fall semester. I'd done Calc BC in high school (not that important to this class). It's a good class, but it's definitely a basic intro course. Neta Rabin is a good instructor. She's not the best, but she is very nice and sends you emails with the specific homework that you have to do. Plus, she doesn't make you do Mathematica which is a bonus. I would recommend it if it's part of your major. It starts off fairly easy, but gets hard about halfway through. The final was really long and pretty challenging. Take it if you have to, but there are definitely more interesting classes at Yale.",
    "The material in the course is really interesting, especially later in the course. It's also pretty easy until the last 2 or 3 units. Great to see if you're interested in taking more math courses!",
    "Yes, I would very much recommend MATH 120 to another student. Not only is multivariable calculus as a concept crucial in higher-level science courses, the MATH 120 class well-organized and very interesting for the student."
