    "Yes, but be aware that you might not learn anything particularly new or groundbreaking \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a large part of this course is just thinking about a lot of global topics in new ways.",
    "take it, if you don't mind writing policy memos and an unstructured course.",
    "This was a great class; I HIGHLY recommend it. I had an extremely helpful and experienced TA. The speakers that were brought in were high profile experts in their fields, and it was an honor to learn from them. It is definitely a non-traditional lecture style class, but the readings and the lectures were top notch. Some nights are rather heavy in reading, but the workload is manageable overall. The four policy memos which constitute half of your grade were fun to write, and they gave me a chance to gain a deeper understanding of a specific aspect of the particular module. If you are interested in Global Affairs, this class is a must take.",
    "As a prospective Global Affairs major, I was very enthusiastic about this class when I saw it in the bluebook, and it didn't disappoint. The guest lecturers were all very good (and very prominent in their fields--Ryan Crocker gave an entire lecture about a strategic partnership agreement he himself negotiated with the President of Afghanistan). Try to find out who will be teaching the modules, though, because apparently some of the lecturers last year were terrible. There is a lot of reading, and while it's not necessary to do it all, it's definitely helpful, particularly in writing the policy memos. The memo prompts were frustratingly vague, so ask your TF to clarify exactly what he\/she is looking for, because it's not consistent across the board. Overall, a great class for anyone interested in foreign policy and world issues. If McChrystal and\/or Crocker are teaching again, it's a must-take.",
    "It's a good course. Lots of reading, but you learn a lot and grading isn't too difficult.",
    "I would recommend it Credit\/D or if you are interested in that year's topics because class can be very interesting but the assignments are so poorly formulated as to be exceedingly frustrating.",
    "An eye-opening course that exposes students to the best that Yale has to offer in terms of teaching, while allowing for even the youngest of undergrads to have great experiences interacting with giants on the world stage.",
    "Take a good look at the syllabus. If you have a particular interest in the modules and the people teaching them, then definitely take it.Also if you want to be in the government, this class gives you good training on writing policy memos, and brainstorming feasible solutions to problems.",
    "Wonderful class and opportunity to hear first-hand from experts or activists in a variety of fields relating to Global Affairs. Offers a good taste of careers available to people interested in anything international or up-and-coming. Easy to relate to other classes since the subjects are so diverse (economics, health, politics, military, history, human rights, etc).",
    "GLBL 101 is an interesting class; it is divided into 4 modules led by four different professor \"celebrities\" whom educate you on a variety of Global issues. At the end of a each module a two page, single spaced policy memo is required of you and a final based off of many overarching theme based short essays. While this class is not difficult and has the benefit of being very informative, interesting, and a great way to spend your afternoons it is very unpredictable. For this year's class we had General McChrystal teach a unit on leadership which is well done and requests a lot of student participation. The second section was taught my Professor Nattrass whom was an HIV\/AIDS specialist from South Africa: awesome accent and by far the best professor make her the best of all four lectures. The third part was taught by Ambassador Crocker who worked in Afghanistan. This whole unit revolved around Afghanista: history, political analysis, U.S. involvement, etc. I found him to be really difficult to lecture at first but by the end he was having a good time of doing it and was fantastic. The final section, taught by former President of the World Bank, Mr. James Wolfensohn who did a unit on Development of Developing Countries. My recommendations are as follows: take the class Credit D\/Fail at first this way if the professors are bad or your T.A. is a rough grader you have flexibility in your decision making. Second, the class has a lot of \"hype\" because of the professors but that doesn't always make this a good class, attempt to learn something about who will teach the modules before you sign up. Third, DO THE READINGS! they will call on you occasionally to say things and if you don't do the readings you can expect to be dismissed in an unfriendly manner. Finally, DO NOT BE LATE! I did so many a time and was reprimanded a few times so don't.",
    "Do not take this class. It is a complete waste of time. The only time I feel like I learned anything was during section, and that's just because I had a great TF. You had to write 4 policy memos and then had a final at the end, and its not a hard class because you didn't have to do the readings to be able to write the memos, and the lectures didn't teach you anything so going to class was optional. Sure the people they got to come talk to us are famous and well known, but they aren't teachers and have no idea how to function in a classroom environment. The readings they assigned were pointless to actually read (which half the class didn't) and extremely dry. If you want to learn about global affairs, find another class.",
    "Global Affairs is divided into four modules, and each module is taught by a visiting expert. The Fall 2012 modules were: Leadership (taught by Stanley McChrystal), HIV\/AIDS (taught by Nicoli Nattrass), Understanding Afghanistan (taught by former Ambassador Ryan Crocker,) and World Development (taught by former World Bank president Jim Wolfensohn). The quality of the modules really depends on how engaging the speaker is. McChrystal was wonderful even though his module was pretty vague, Nattrass was just amazing all around, Crocker was very reserved but still good, and Wolfensohn struggled a bit. The readings for the course are very, very long. The assignments are a policy memo for each module (they teach you how to write one, which is helpful!) and a final exam. Personally, I'm glad I took the course. But people who have experience in stuff like Model UN and international relations should skip this one. It should be called \"overview of selected issues in global affairs\" rather than Global Affairs 101. It is BY NO MEANS an introduction to global affairs. More like selected sneak peaks.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs has the potential to become a reliably good course (unless Professor Levinsohn sticks to his principle that the class has to ''be different every year''). But from my experience, it was not a worthwhile course. Not anybody can be a teacher. Great generals are great at war. Great ambassadors are great at diplomacy. You can't just throw them in a classroom and expect them to say worthwhile things to a room of intelligent, critical students. The theory that this class is built on seems to be \"bring in famous people.\" It's fun for a day, but it really does not make for an educational course.",
    "When it comes to Global Affairs, it is important to know what you are signing yourself up for. Yes, you get to hear some incredibly famous speakers, and some of them are the experts in their fields. However, it is important to be aware that many of them (in fact, the majority of them) are NOT professors and, as such, do not always know how to run a well-organized, coherent class. You only have three weeks with each unit, which is great if you don't like the current professor, but can be frustrating because it is hard to really go in-depth with any of the topics. The readings can be simply unreasonable at times, and at a certain point most people accept that they can't do all of the readings before every class and just end up catching up over a break or between modules (unlikely, because the next module will have just as much reading). It is a good introduction to the field of global affairs, since it covers such a broad range of topics, but expect to be frustrated with the class at times.",
    "It's a great class, and gives you a very informative view into the key issues of diplomacy and development in the world right now. You also get the unique opportunity to speak to some very famous people who are essentially experts in the subjects they teach - which is great! If you are interested in policy-making, diplomacy and international development - the course is great introduction to all of these things.",
    "I would recommend you take it even if your thinking about the major. It made me not want to even apply. It was an okay course. Your experience really depends on your TA though.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend Global Affairs for people who don't know anything about International Relations. For someone who does, its a waste of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, any one can take this course and will enjoy it \/ learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend it. I just hope the readings are trimmed down in the future to be more manageable.",
    "This course is highly dependent on the caliber of guest lecturers. I would be weary of who the lecturers are if I were considering this course.",
    "This is a fun course. It is definitely not a substitute for any intro political science course - think of it more like a class in Current Events. Stan McChrystal, Nicoli Nattrass, Ryan Crocker and James Wolfensohn were our guest lecturers; they were all enlightening, powerful speakers. There are considerable readings to do, and they tended to be very interesting. However, that's completely dependent on which modules you get.",
    "GLBL 101 is a pretty cool opportunity to hear from amazing people who have done amazingthings. I'd definitely recommend the course as the modules were engaging and very relevant to current events\/the state of the world today. It does have a LOT of reading, which can get especially annoying when the lecturer doesn't even bring the readings up in class. I think that it is possible to not do all of the readings and do well in the class. Your grade is dependent on 4 policy memos and a final, and though the format of a policy memo can take some getting used to, it's a valuable exercise in being concise and presenting your argument.",
    "Global Affairs 101 is a good introductory class to international issues. It has a lot of required reading and a manageable amount of writing. I would recommend the class, as the modules are interesting and informative, but they don't relate strongly one to another.",
    "No. Simply no. Not at all.The same criticisms surface every year and nothing changes. I assumed my year would be different; it wasn't. Don't let the little spiel given in reading weak about how this year is \"one of a kind\" and \"will never be equaled.\" They said that this year, I fell for it. I really regret taking the class. It's not that is was hard to get good grades- just a waste of time.Don't fall for it too. I took it because it was an experience unique to Yale and it was a total waste of a class.",
    "Global Affairs is a useful introduction to international affairs. I would take it if you are interested in the Global Affairs Major. If you are not interested, this is not a gut class. There is tremendous amounts of reading and final preparation took a long time. Furthermore, the policy memos are quite short, but often take a long time to write.",
    "Yes, very good background on some of today's most important issues",
    "Global Affairs 101 is a good class to introduce you to some very important global issues. The visiting professors are knowledgeable and interesting and provide great insights into the issues. It also helps you gain more of a global perspective on the issues facing our world. However, the policy memos can be difficult and vague with their topics and the four different modules make the class a little disjointed. But if you are interested in global affairs and want to learn from the experts on issues, take this class.",
    "Other courses at Yale provide more of an in-depth look at the issues discussed, but if you just want an overview it is good.",
    "This class is for a select few, one of which is not me. GGA was a class I dreaded going to simply because I would almost fall asleep in every lecture starting with the third module. I liked the reading so that's probably the best thing I got out of it, but the lecture had no value for me. Plus, the assignments were not clearly laid out, and the competition within the class was palpable\/almost scary. I would never recommend this class to anyone.",
    "If you can be really hard working and are a self-motivated person, then yes.",
    "I would highly recommend looking at the module topics before choosing. They make a huge difference in how worthwhile the class will be.Furthermore, I took this class with a bunch of friends which made both section andpolicy memos more enjoyable.",
    "A great into to Global Affairs, covers a wide variety of topics to really get you thinking about the world and what you find interesting about it. Even if you end up deciding that global affairs is not your thing (or you already know it) this course is still cool as you get to hear really interesting insights into the work some extremely accomplished people have done. It almost like every class is a master's tea. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the work the people on the syllabus have done. This course is definitely not strictly a global affairs class and is very engaging for people studying anything from health to business administration.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs is a unique course in that it is divided into four disconnected \"modules\" that relate somehow to Global Affairs. That structure is the source of both its strengths and weaknesses. Though each year has a slightly different set of modules, one that always seems to remain is \"Leadership\" with Stan McChrystal. But I couldn't have been more disappointed with that module. Not that McChrystal isn't an extraordinary guy, but when you give someone a crappy assignment, don't expect anything other than crappy results. The Leadership module was a waste of three weeks of my life, trying to pin down broad elements of leadership based on several biographies of leaders throughout history.However, things quickly picked up.By far, however, the module on HIV\/AIDS was my favorite module. In many ways, those three weeks alone justify my taking the course. The professor was brilliant and tied in personal experience in South Africa in her lectures and readings. Afghanistan was theoretically a great module, and I know for many that was the most productive module, measured in terms of learning the most material in a short amount of time. The Global Poverty unit was simply too ambitious in its reach and wasnot able to properly address any one issue.For homework, you should really do the readings. And there are a LOT of readings. Realistically, few people read every word of every reading, but if you want to get the most out of the class, the readings are where you are going to get that knowledge, not the lectures. You will also have policy memos for each module, which are only two pages single-spaced, so you couldn't spend too much time doing research even if you wanted to because of the space limitations.Overall, I'd say this course is a good primer for some of the later courses in Global Affairs, but don't expect an \"Intro\" course. The modules are designed to give you a good overview of specific issues in Global Affairs.",
    "I wouldn't take it.",
    "This class is a survey of key global issues. It's not really the most instructive. You could probably get the same information from very active googling. The best part of this class is hearing the information from people very close to the situations.",
    "Global Affairs 101 was a class I took because it sounded fun. I mainly take other math and science classes, but Global 101 may have swayed me. The structure is 4 modules of experts teaching their fields, and it is a lecture class with a surprising amount of room for discussion and questions. I would recommend global to anyone, and I have. I gained more pure knowledge in that class than in any other, and I was more inspired in it, too. One thing to keep in mind is that there are a lot of readings and it's easy to fall behind.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs is a good course. While it certainly depends on the modules, the class provides a broad introduction to international issues. It can, however, also feel rather sporadic, as many of the lecturers are not professors. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the Global Affairs major or public policy in general, as long as they have the time to do the readings, which are fairly heavy and quite dense at times.",
    "Interesting subject material but you have to be willing to do alot of reading. Additionally, the class structure is very loose so it can be hard to know what exactly is expected in terms of the memos\/the final exam.",
    "This is a tough class to evaluate, because the modules are all so awesome and so relevant, but poorly executed. The lecturers are all super important, but that doesn't mean they know how to lecture. At all. With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed all of the reading for the class, and learning how to write a policy memo is a useful skill. The TA's are also all incredible people and very helpful. Overall I'd say take it if you are willing to do the readings (which can be hefty).",
    "If you are really interested in global affairs, take this class. Don't expect to come out with connections to world experts, but you will have a profound understanding of key global issues if you try. Don't bother taking this class if you're just interested in fulfilling a distributional requirement, it wouldn't be worth it.",
    "Global Affairs is an intro class separated into four modules. While the modules may seem easy, the grading is difficult. Expect to work your butt off to get the readings done by lecture. You must put a lot of time, effort and editing into your memos to have exactly what they want. Take this course with caution.",
    "Yes, but the reading can be overwhelming at times. The lecturers are all fantastic though and this should NOT be a course to skip the lectures for!!!!",
    "Global Affairs consists of a series of modules focusing on contemporary global challenges (i.e. AIDS, Afghanistan, poverty) taught by guest professors that have hands on experience working on the given topic. Although the big names are definitely a draw, and there are some personal stories that make the class worth it, I wouldn't recommend this class. It was disorganized and lacked continuity, and although the professors were interesting, they were usually not great professors - lacking experience organizing classes and readings and framing issues in a way that is most conducive to analysis.",
    "I really enjoyed Global Affairs, and would recommend it for freshmen or sophomores looking to apply to the major. It's great, because you essentially get four mini-classes in one about interesting subjects! One thing to be wary of is that since most of the lecturers are not professors, the modules may not be well taught. Also, they try to make the lecture feel like a seminar, asking students for opinions. If you are taking the course for the famous lecturers, know that you will spend a lot of time listening to other students talk. While I found each of the modules interesting, if you don't, the three weeks and their superfluous readings can be tough. One thing to be aware of is that they assign A TON of reading, and often it could have been consolidated. The sections were decent, but did not add much to the course. The final isn't bad, as the questions are simple and open-ended. Overall, I really enjoyed the course because I liked the modules, but if you don't think you will, do not just take the course because of the famous visiting lecturers.if you do take it, go to office hours. They're a great opportunity to have fascinating conversations.",
    "I loved this class. I would highly recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in global affairs. Especially take this class if General McChrystal and his crew are teaching again, as that was the best of the modules, along with Ambassador Crocker's. Take the class, you won't be sorry.",
    "This course is a great course for anyone who is looking into being a global affairs major because it surveys the different components of the major. Some topics were less interesting than others, but learning how to write a policy memo is very useful in the future for people who want to get into government.",
    "It was a great introduction to the major, and I would recommend it to students who re well versed in global topics.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs offers a very nice chance to study four different topics under experts in that field, which is a unique opportunity. I would recommend this course to anyone who is thinking about being a Global Affairs major or has an interest in development and international policy. There is a lot of reading, and the four policy memos, though short, can be challenging, especially if not addressed in a timely fashion, but overall, this is an excellent course. Take it especially if General McChrystal is lecturing.",
    "take it. Not too much work but very very interesting. will help your understanding of the world and life",
    "This course was very disorganized. It seemed like it was going to be interesting from the outset, with such amazing speakers, but the class did not live up to expectations. There was no overarching theme really connecting the modules, and the speakers, although very accomplished in their own right, were not always the best professors. The readings expected of us were also too much at times, especially when it came to the final. I do not recommend this course to anyone, especially those interested in Global Affairs. It will make you doubt your interest in that major entirely.",
    "A somewhat disjointed but interesting class that delves briefly into a handful of topics pertaining to development and international relations.",
    "I would not recommend it. Though great people speak, the excessive readings make it stressful, and the modular nature of the course made it feel scattered.",
    "GLBL 101 is based on some great ideas about exposing students to some of the issues that affect the world today. However, a lot of the weaknesses from previous years were still present this semester.Most of the lecturers (Professor Nattrass being the exception) were not that great at lecturing.Also, there are no rough drafts or revising opportunities for the four policy memos, so your first submission is the final submission. I would check before taking this course to see if they have changed this policy.Finally, there is too much reading. And most of the information from the reading is not touched upon (even during sections) until the final, which can make studying for the final tough and stressful.However, there is still a lot of potential for this class, and hopefully they make some changes in the coming years. I would not recommend this class though if it remains the way it was this semester.",
    "A survey course of major themes in international relations. This course is what you make of it-- it will expose you to an incredible amount of resources, but your success is dependent upon your initiative. Some of the professors are not as good as others, however, the subject areas are always fascinating.",
    "I would recommend it because it covers a wide range of very important global issues, provides initial experience in policy\/memo writing (which will be an important skill), and provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to engage with some of the most respected and accomplished individuals in their fields.",
    "Brilliant introductory class to a much broader topic. Skimming the surface of global issues in an informative and interesting way. Don't go into it thinking it's like any other class though- more of an experience. Would totally recommend.",
    "Do not take this class. Too broad and biased.",
    "Not really. I liked the class but I think you could get more out of classes on leadership, aids, Afghanistan, or global development.",
    "I would only recommend the class if the modules are interesting. The class isn't all that it's hyped up to be.",
    "Definitely take it! It's an interesting course that gives you an introduction to some of the major themes in international relations. You sometimes will not learn much from the lectures, but it's great to hear from professors with tons of experience in the field.",
    "An excellent introductory course to Global Affairs, well suited for one interested in experimenting with many different areas of International Relations. I do not recommend this course to those who are not keen on reading nor those who are not fond of speaking up in class\u00e2\u0080\u0094this course demands lots of literature and research outside the class, and as the lecturers will call on those without their hands raised, requires one be quite prepared for class and therefore versed in the material: do your homework, and there's lots of it.",
    "Take this class! It's a great survey of different Global-Affairs related issues. Though not all the modules will be equal in quality, you'll definitely learn a lot. The assignments are mostly policy memos. Even if you think you'll never have to write a policy memo during your life, they are incredibly helpful in making your writing more clear and concise. The TFs for this course are also all really experienced in their own right. One thing to note, however, is that this course involves a TON of reading. There will be times when the reading sometimes seems unmanageable, but I think it was (for the most part) worth it.",
    "I'm not sure I would.",
    "This is a great introductory course, but if you are already advanced, you might want to think about it. See who is giving the modules. For me, the last module with Sir James Wolensohn made the whole course be worth it. The other modules were interesting too, but sometimes a bit slow since I am already a senior.",
    "Global Affairs 101 01 has an interesting format that did not necessarily work for me but might be great for another student. I will say that it is difficult to succeed in this class with not prior policy memo writing experience and this is perhaps a flaw of the class that should be remedied as it is labeled an introductory course. The modules, however, are very interesting and students get an opportunity to hear from four different experts in the field who have actually worked on the issues you study. I would recommend the class to students who are prospective Global Affairs majors--but otherwise, I think you can get a better experience studying global affairs issues in other classes.",
    "I would tell another student that global affairs is a good class to take to become knowledgeable in 4 of the most important global issues. I would recommend the class to another student with the hopes that the speakers who were good would be retained, and the ones that were not would be replaced. The department should be able to bring in other great lecturers, and with more organization the class could definitely be very rewarding.",
    "Take it if you want an interesting and not that challenging class in a wide variety of current topics.",
    "Amazing class, you really learn about many different issues across the world. The module format ensures that there will be something fresh every 3 or 4 weeks and keeps you on task.",
    "Global Affairs 101 gives you a broad taste of an ensemble of contemporary global issues (in four modules). If you're at all interested in global issues, such as public health (HIV\/AIDS), conflict resolution, climate change, or development, then this might be a great course for you. The diversity of subjects stretches you to think about the great complexity of today's global challenges, from a micro and macro perspective. You don't need to start off with much experience with any of the specific subjects; you'll develop a introductory yet nuanced understanding ofeach subject through the comprehensive readings and lectures. Therefore, I would recommend the course to almost any student who is concerned about global issues and change-making, and can fit this course into their schedule.",
    "I don't recommend this course if you're not strongly interested in majoring in Global Affairs, and especially not if you don't have a strong personal interest in at least 2 of the four module topics. The Leadership module with McChrystal is excellent, if that is the convincing factor to take this course-audit that part, but don't take the course (or be prepared to withdraw before midterm). I had a hard time staying awake in this class, most of the guest lecturers (3 of 4) were not good speakers. It is hard to understand them, and the information they present is hard to narrow down to what is actually pertinent. The writing assignments are vague, and though not long, require time and research to be successful.",
    "While this course can serve as a good survey for freshman\/sophomores interested in global affairs, do not let the big names they usually get to teach the class fool you: the \"star faculty\" they get to teach the modules are mostly terrible. While their world experience is often remarkable, their teaching experience is negligible which makes for bad professors and incredibly boring\/useless lectures. Of the four modules in 2012, only one was taught well, and it was the one taught by a professor from Cape Town.The class can be interesting, and isn't much work, but there are much better courses out there. I didn't do hardly any of the reading and did well in the class, but the policy memos require work and a particular writing style (and can be graded toughly).The modules change every year, so research all of the professors during shopping week and pay particular attention to teaching experience. But if you want to really learn, find a class that goes more in depth. Three weeks on a topic lends for a very surface-level experience."
