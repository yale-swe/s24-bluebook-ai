   "comments": [
    "NO!!! The worst possible time for this class. I honestly don't know why it was scheduled for this semester. It should occur in 2nd or 3rd year.",
    "Yes.",
    "The lectures were too general and familiar for graduate level architecture students. All the material I saw in lecture was familiar to me through related classes I have taken already. The discussion section and readings were better, but the drawing assignments were redundant and useless. If Andrei taught the readings and ran his reading discussions (which were great), this would make an excellent elective that could possibly dive into less general topics.",
    "This course should be only for undergraduates, and should not be a part of the graduate curriculum.",
    "Given how prescriptive the instruction, and how elementary the depth of material is, this course could have occurred in our first semester, or be an optional course to students who did architecture in undergrad.",
    "Yes, but does not teach fundamentals in Urban Design that should be essential for the architecture student.",
    "I am a Yale SOM student taking this course as an elective. From my perspective, I thought the course was an excellent introduction to urban design and the variety of tools necessary for exploration of the subject.",
    "the timing for this course was appropriate in the overall schedule of the schooling sequence.",
    "Course occurs in a good place in the curriculum.",
    "It felt like an undergraduate course.",
    "the lecture seemed like it was aimed to much toward the undergraduate portion of the class. we have all learned this material in one form or another and instead of giving a survey of the history of urban design, it would be much more useful to look at a series of case studies and examine them in a more more critical way.",
    "This course was in the proper sequence.",
    "If this course is going to stay as a requirement, then it needs to be a GRADUATE class, not the schizophrenic class that it currently is. Asking graduate and undergraduates to attend the same lecture and then asking the graduates to take what equates to an entire other class is ridiculous.",
    "It took place in the proper sequence.",
    "No, the lecture portion of this class has no business as a requirement for a graduate architecture program esp. for students coming from any kind of architecture background. I already knew about 90% of the material covered in the lecture, but because I never took a formal urban planning class, I was not able to place out it. Most of the information is just part of the basic knowledge acquired during architectural theory and history classes. The discussion section was fine, even if they did require a little more reading and work than a non-elective discussion probably should given the heavy load of Studio, Building Project, and Viz III.",
    "I believe that the course provides a useful introduction to the problem of drawing large scale features such as a city, and it is good to have this exposure to such drawings prior to the fourth semester urban studio.",
    "This was a good semester to learn the fundamentals of urban design. It offered a different scale of learning from the more practical studio and visualization courses, and I believe that is valuable.",
    "This class was a requirement, but I had learned the majority of the material already, though not in a comprehensive way. For people with little architectural background it might have been helpful, but I don\u0092t know how to require this class for people who already have a basic understanding of urban studies.",
    "Yes and no - I believe a course introducing us to elements in urban design is key to our architectural education. However, the course as it currently stands might not be the right course for what it tries to accomplish.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "The course's lecture series is too elementary for architecture grad students and becomes unnecessary \"in-class time.\" The discussion had the potential to be successful and interesting, given that students completed the readings. Reading two books in two weeks is absolutely impossible - the instructors should select smaller excerpts to be discussed in section. That way students could really delve into the specifics of the text and have meaningful conversation."

   "comments": [
    "Why on God's green Earth did we have to waste so much time tracing fuzzy satellite images of plazas in autocad? I learned nothing from doing that. All it did was take valuable time away from other more important tasks, such as studio work. I understand having to do the reading assignments and the final paper. I have no problem with that. But the drawings were ridiculous.",
    "The lectures were slightly different from the homework, readings and other material presented in the discussion sections. I find this to be slightly problematic.For although it could be argued that we are being taught two different things and are supposed to be able to relate the two - I think that ultimately many of us found the discussion sections to be more relevant than the lectures - this was due to content difference rather than performance of instructor.The discussion sections were more interesting to me because they were directed at issues I am more familiar with grappling or want to know more about as it bears closer relation to the field of architecture on an urban level.",
    "Again, the lectures were mostly a waste of time. People would come, sign their names and leave or else sleep because the material was very familiar (to me at least) and not presented in a compelling way. The discussion sections, especially when we used them to actually discuss readings, were much more engaging and interesting. The drawing assignments were a waste of time that should have been devoted to studio.",
    "I had already read and studied most of the materials presented in the course. The first assignment was way too time consuming and focused too much on replicated existing drawings as opposed to encouraging individual exploration.",
    "The lecture and the workshop were almost completely disconnected courses.The requirements for the workshop were unrealistically numerous, and I believe the quality of the work suffered as a result.",
    "The lectures by Elihu MUST BE separated from the undergrad lectures. He's good at teaching and knows the subject really well, but if he expect any graduate students to keep up the attendance, the lectures can't be prepared at an undergrad level. Andrei's sessions were run as if it's its own course, which a full list of requirements, and requirements of every possible format. Too much of the assignment is quantity based, not quality based.",
    "Didn't learn anything that wasn't covered in undergraduate Intro to Architecture. All the work done was mindless and useless.",
    "the work flow was well thought and simple to adhere to and was adequate at testing and discovering the urban condition through exercise.",
    "Taken individually, the sequence of the lectures and the discussion sections were well-planned. However, there lacked coordination between lectures and sections, which made it somewhat more difficult to grasp a continuous narrative of the course material. Assignments were well-designed and enjoyable to complete. The assignments were also fairly diverse in scope (drawings, paper, analytical, perceptual, different mediums of representation, etc.), which was beneficial to developing a better understanding of the material.",
    "Reading 8 books and doing drawings every other week were extremely unrealistic expectations. The discussion sections were interesting and seemed more appropriate for graduate level study.",
    "the requirements for this class were completely overwhelming. The assignments need to be tailored to an understanding of what our schedules are and how a 3 credit course should fit into our workload. assigning research and 3 original drawings a week is both crazy but extremely unproductive. the first assignment I don't think I learned anything accept the brute force of tracing historical maps. I didn't have time to be critical and develop a thesis about the city i researched because the assignments were so time consuming. the drawings should be reduced and spread out over the whole semester (one drawing per week, preceded by ample research time) and the paper should focus on the same topic to give us time to reflect on the study that we have done in the drawing section.lastly, the critical texts were extremely valuable. we should be asked to read a specific set of pages from each text to facilitate a more lively discussion.",
    "The lectures were offensively bad. It was an undergrad lecture with handouts in the begging with \"important names and dates.\" The real meat of the class was Andrei's course which had a larger work load than any other 3 credit course. If we got rid of the lectures that would be a start.",
    "This class felt like two completely separate courses, divided between the lectures and the discussion sections. There was no overlap between the two. The lectures did not feel like they were taught at a graduate level. Almost all of the content I had already learned in previous architecture history classes, and the lectures felt very cursory, which was not helped by the fact that there was only one per week. The discussion sections were a great deal of work and not always helpful. The precedent analysis for the first half of the semester was an excellent project, but the weekly drawing assignments often included too many components and were very difficult to complete satisfactorily. Many of the precedent projects had little information available, and it was difficult and time consuming to get even the base drawings done. More time was needed for research and base documentation. It would have been much more effective if there was only one drawing a week due, as it would have allowed for more thoughtful and focused exploration. The reading assignments were also rather unwieldy, especially given the packed nature of the semester\u0092s schedule and the plethora of weekly assignments due for every class. As a whole, however, the content of the discussion section portion was much more stimulating than the lecture portion.",
    "Other than Elihu\u0092s lectures being a repeat of many undergraduate classes, his half of the class was fine.The second half of the class, Andrei\u0092s discussion, was overly demanding for a simple discussion section. We never once talked about one of Elihu\u0092s lectures. We were required to make between 4 and 6 maps each week of an assigned city while also ready and writing responses for 8 books. We were also required to write an 8 page paper on an entire other city at the end of the semester, complete with more map drawings. This was entirely too much work for a class like this. Entirely. By giving this much work to an already over-taxed class, all it accomplishes is resentment towards the class and low morale when one can\u0092t finish the assignments up to his or her personal standards.",
    "I thought that the workshop was interesting, but had almost no connection to the lectures. I really didn't feel like I was getting anything out of the lectures. This may be because I come from an Art History background, but they really felt like they were being given specifically for the undergrads and added no value to our portion of the course.",
    "The readings were very comprehensive and gavea good overview of modern development of urban planning, but when combined with both a visual analysis project and a critical paper, the workload was just way too much. Students could not find the time to give any of these aspects the effort they deserved. Having the readings and only one of the two assignments would have been much more manageable.",
    "the workshop part of the course (taught by andrei harwell) was interesting and valuable, though too demanding. the lectures by elihu rubin were uninteresting and unengaging, while being essentially unrelated to the workshop.",
    "I believe the assignments were very valuable, however, their sequencing and intensity were just completely unrealistic. I believe the Case Study project deserved a full semester's analysis, with perhaps a paper attached. With all the readings, it seemed ambitious to expect us to do full research on a completely new subject towards the end of the semester.The reading discussions were interesting though.",
    "The lectures, being open to undergrads, felt too introductory, and they did not relate to the graduate seminar at all until the final two weeks. The graduate seminar was interesting, but it was hard to find time to read the books in full, and it was certainly difficult to make formal analysis drawings based on maps of cities, especially when most of the required drawings were literal traces of existing drawings by other people\u0097that part was busywork.",
    "The readings were good readings in themselves. However, the amount of work given for this course guaranteed that a lot of things would be done poorly, rather than a few things done well.",
    "I thought that there was a great disconnect between the lectures and the discussion sections. The lectures, although very well organized, were many times too general (in terms of the information presented) and did not go into more depth with specific topics. Coming from an architectural background, I felt the lecture were organized more as an introductory undergraduate course, were as the discussion sections tended to be more specific, diving deeper into the various urban theories. I think the books selected for the discussions were well picked and paired (with respect to each other) and generated a lot of great discussions. It was perhaps a bit unreasonable to expect the students to read two books in a week, but generally I enjoyed the assigned readings and discussions among the peers.",
    "I found the four pairs of readings helpful in developing a comprehensive understanding of urban planning ideas from the mid-19th century onward. The class discussions also helped to clarify the issues. The assignments were sometimes difficult to complete on time and\/or to a high standard, due to the workload from studio and other classes.",
    "The course load for this class was too great considering the restrictions placed on us by other classes. In general, the material was fascinating and well presented but the expectations were far too high in light of the rest of our curriculum.",
    "Too many assignments!!!We had reading responses due every other week, lots of mindless TRACING, plus a full paper at the end.... (and I must add that most people in the class wrote the the responses to the prescribed books WITHOUT reading the texts).These are seminal texts in urban design, and it's important that we have the time to focus on them properly. So, I would suggest, having more focused assignments that get students to get to know the texts and apply them, rather than trying to do every type of assignment."

   "comments": [
    "Had none going in. Now I absolutely hate the class. Not because it was hard or the professors were bad. It was the ridiculous time wasting assignments.",
    "I expected to look at more contemporary trends, specific case studies, and to discuss the role of politics in urbanism. These were rarely met as we tended to concentrate on general historic trends and well-known and isolated case studies.",
    "I had very high expectations for the only Urban Design class I get to take as an architecture grad student. Unfortunately none of the expectations were met by this course. Elihu's lectures were too rudimentary for anyone who has taken some urban courses in undergrad, whereas Andrei's sessions were not in-depth enough to make it a worthwhile experience.",
    "My expectations was to gain a greater understanding in European urban design, did not meet this expectations.",
    "i thought that this course would be an engaging discussion of urban spaces, but in the end it turned out to be a dry review of things i have already learned.the assignments were well conceived but because i didn't have any time to do any of them justice, they ended up being extremely unproductive.",
    "I expected this course to provide insight into the nature and history of urban design. The lectures did not provide this. The discussion section analysis and readings were much more helpful, as they allowed us to go in-depth into many theories of urban design.",
    "The expectation when you come to a school like Yale is that you will be challenged in your education and learn something that you do not already know. Most of our class has an undergraduate degree in architecture; therefore, the large majority of our class has already taken this very lecture. If we are to be presented with material already covered in an undergraduate class, then it needs to be presented at a graduate level. Elihu is a wonderful professor and an enjoyable lecturer, but the material was redundant for many of the graduate students. To be at a university with Yale\u0092s standards, it is absurd to think that one would be required to re-take an undergraduate course.The second urban class, for it truly is an entire SECOND class, was the discussion section with Andrei. The expectation for this class was to learn about our assigned city and to discus the assigned books. Again, these expectations were not met. The discussions of the books were fair, however, there was entirely too much work given to us in regards to our city to be studied. Attempts were made to go over each persons\u0092 work, but it always ended up being a pathetic effort to try to squeeze everyone in, resulting in comments for no one. Not only did we have too much work, but I learned nothing in regard to the city I was to study. We were so busy trying to meet the requirements for the assignments, which mostly included TRACING old maps\u0097completely menial work that is embarrassing at a graduate level, that we had no time to do actual research that would have broadened our understanding of the city and its role within its larger context. The exercises were pointless and time-consuming and consequently no one in the class got much out of them.",
    "I didn't have strong expectations for this course, but I would say that I just didn't feel like I got a lot out of it in the end.",
    "I expected to learn about the development of urban planning as a discipline. The discussion section helped with this, but there was a huge disconnect between the discussions and lectures. Frankly, the lectures were not necessary and too elementary for graduate students.",
    "Except for the unrealistic scheduling of assignments, this class contained all the elements that would be valuable in an urban design introduction.",
    "They were partly met, though not fully. I expected to also get a more practical approach to understanding urban design, in addition to the the purely artistic approach given in this course.",
    "I was hoping the lectures would go a little bit deeper into the main urban theories and projects than they did, but I was satisfied with the content and discussion level of the meeting sections."

   "comments": [
    "This class actually held me back. I wasted so much time on the stupid assignments that I couldn't put more thought and effort into studio. The reading discussions with Andrei were interesting and I did feel like I walked away from them having learned something though. Just ditch the useless drawing assignments.",
    "I think that the course was rather valuable and that I took a lot from it that I can use and apply to my future analyses and designs in studio or otherwise. It was a good introductory course that managed to get us acquainted with the basics.",
    "Not much. Not much new information.",
    "I am a Yale SOM student taking this course as an elective. From my perspective, I thought the course was an excellent introduction to urban design and the variety of tools necessary for exploration of the subject.",
    "Low value overall as spending a semester abroad previously did teach most of the concepts explored in the class. This was not formal enough to replace the class, but it made the class feel like it was going thru the motions.",
    "Since I did not have a formal background in urban design\/studies, I found this course to be an important addition to the curriculum, and one I found very interesting. I wish I could have enjoyed the course even more, but the semester's collective work load made that not possible.While the assignments in this course were interesting and productive, there were some parts that felt tedious and I was not sure what was to begained from it, particularly when we were more or less re-tracing maps in autocad. That said, the material of this course was a nice complement to the other work in second semester and I did enjoy it, overall. The reading assignments were varied and provocative, although the written responses felt like they were an unnecessary requirement for the sake of it, on top of our already very heavy work load.",
    "I thought that of the 6 courses we took this semester, it was very low priority.",
    "Some of Andrei's lectures and assignments were extremely satisfying. How urban design is studied and represented is fascinating and can enhance our own production. Reading 2 books per week and writing a \"response journal\" and doing weekly drawings was a bit much.",
    "I found the reading discussions very valuable, and the books chosen were excellent. It would have been nice, however, if more time had been given to complete some of the readings. I also enjoyed the final paper and the precedent analysis drawings, although combined with the readings, it was too great a workload overall. I feel I could have gotten more value out of these exercises if they were more focused or spread out over a longer period of time.",
    "Elihu\u0092s course:This course would have been very valuable as an undergraduate course.Andrei\u0092s course:One could see Andrei\u0092s intelligence and passion for the subject of urban planning. If we simply discussed Elihu\u0092s lectures at a more thorough level it would have been great. We would have been excited to attend Elihu\u0092s lectures since we would be able to discus them on a deeper level later. It would have tied the TWO classes together. The discussion of the books was always interested and if we had done this in combination with the discussion of the lectures, this class would have been fine. By adding the map component, we lost all of that. We never once discussed a lecture in our discussion section because we were always too busy making a half-assed attempt at covering people\u0092s maps. These assignments completely broke this discussion from the lecture portion of the class, making it a class of its own that no one enjoyed because they got nothing out of it.Again, it is not the subject nor the instructors that made this an unsuccessful course, it is the way it was handled. It was taught as two separate courses and too much work was assigned.",
    "I thought the value of this course was quite low. Although I thought it was helpful to have the readings, it seemed like the drawing a writing requirements didn't add a lot for me.",
    "The reading discussions were very interesting, as was the urban analysis drawing assignment during the 1st half of the semester, however there was not enough time allotted during the semester to get the best experience and proper feedback. Most of the work by almost everybody was done during spring break. As opposed to writing a paper on a completely different topic and project the second half of the semester, it would have been nice to continue with the analysis of the 1st part moving it forward with proper feedback. There are just too unrealistic expectations for students to produce and complete too much work. It is perhaps more worthwhile as a learning experience to be able to spend the proper amount of time on the urban analysis drawings and discussions as opposed to tack on a paper to the course's requirements.",
    "The discussions were valuable as urban planning ideas were actually discussed and debated. The lectures, however, were not informative (at least to graduate students) and somewhat of a unnecessary obligation\/burden.",
    "I think if it were reduced to just the workshop, it is a good course.",
    "This course offered a good background on urban design for me. I really appreciated the introduction to the various theories through the reading. I also really enjoyed doing the research for both of the projects.",
    "I personally enjoy urban studies and mostly found this class very interesting, but the lectures presented very little new information to me, and the seminars were disjointed between reading and drawing. It was useful, I suppose, to finally get a comprehensive survey of urban design, when I\u0092ve only learned it piecemeal, but this course just felt redundant in the end.",
    "As mentioned, the amount of work for this course was way too much. Too much of the analysis work boiled down to being busy-work. Unfortunately I don't feel I gained much from tracing various urban plans. That is not too say that the exercises lacked value - however the value in relation to time spent exhibited a poor ratio.",
    "Generally speaking, this course was not as valuable for me as some of the other classes that I took this semester. As I mentioned previously, I have an architectural background and so I felt that I was quite familiar with many of the topics and issues that were presented in the lectures. I did find the discussion meetings much more valuable, perhaps because they were more specific and \u0093forced\u0094 me to think about some of the issues in more depth. Also, hearing other students talk about their opinions on some of the readings and topics was interesting and time-worthy.",
    "I truly enjoyed this course and feel that I've gained some interesting tools for evaluating and analyzing urban conditions and the history of urban spaces."

    "They were fine. They knew their stuff.",

    "Andrei and Elihu were fine, but the content and their expectation of us were off.",
    "The TAs play a very important role in moderating the discussion sessions.",
    "Given the structure of the course, most of my interaction was with Andrei during the discussion section. Both he and our TAs, Jacqui Hawkins and Bradley Baer were incredibly helpful through out the semester. Despite my lack of formal training in architecture, they were very supportive of my development and curiosity in the course.",
    "Both professors and TA's preformed well and were most helpful in the progression of discussion and work for the course.",
    "Andrei is a highly effective section leader - he's clear, knowledgeable, smart, and is good at asking the right questions that facilitate provocative discussions.",
    "Elihu was an enthusiastic lecturer, but the lectures did not present much that I did not already know, and often felt tedious and easily digressed onto side tangents. Andrei was an effective instructor, but often had difficulty sustaining the reading discussions, and the feedback sessions of our drawings were not particularly helpful, especially as there was no discussion of the actual analysis, but instead focused on graphics and presentation.",
    "The TAs were often the best part of our discussion sections. They were wonderful.",
    "Again, I found the lectures to not be effective at all. I think the workshop portion also needs some work as it was typically difficult to achieve everything that was planed in the time available.",
    "Andrei was great. He was very knowledge and easy to talk with. Unfortunately I think he overestimate the priority of this class in the minds of students. There were just too much work assigned for a none-studio class and it often suffered given the heavy load other, more design oriented, classes placed on students.",
    "I did not find elihu rubin to be an engaging lecturer or the material presented to be interesting.I thought Andrei Harwell was good at conveying ideas of a project and was very knowledgeable and interesting.",
    "Both Andrei and Elihu were great. Andrei was very available, and the discussion sections were always interesting. The TAs were also helpful in clarifying assignments.",
    "Prof. Rubin, though an eager and engaging lecturer, would be a better professor if he developed a critical stance on the material he presents, rather than going over each topic objectively. Often there was very little mention of whether the city planning theories and styles from various historical eras actually found long-term success or influence. However, the final section on urban renewal was great\u0097it was the only part of the course that Prof. Rubin seemed really passionate about and was willing to take a position on. Andrei is a good teacher, but had unrealistic expectations for the graduate seminar, with the drawing assignments on top of difficult reading. I think most of the class enjoyed the reading, but the workload was too great for the semester schedule.",

    "Eliminate the drawing assignments. Just have the reading assignments and the final paper.",
    "More correlation between lectures and discussion sections perhaps.",
    "Just readings, discussions and paper writing.",
    "There is a bit of disconnect between the lecture and the discussion sessions.I appreciate the graduate discussion sessions. I wish the discussionformat is more rigorous, perhaps hinging on some critical questions as opposed to the completely open-ended discussion style.The reading pairs are relevant, however I wish the instructor could have pointed to some critical passages for close reading. This may be more productive.I appreciated the drawing project, although I wish that we were encouraged to take a more critical stand in our analysis as opposed to simply compiling information. One critical drawing for review for each week as opposed to three or five drawings might produce more thoughtful work. As we put a lot of analysis into the Eisenman drawings, we wish we had time to do the same for the urban design class.",
    "It would be better to coordinate the lectures and workshops - otherwise it is as if we are taking two courses for one course worth of credit, and attendance at the lectures suffers accordingly.The requirements for the workshop were too many - the case study assignment for midterm, multiple reading assignments, and the paper and drawing critiques for the final were done hastily because of their apparent push for quantity rather than quality.Completing ONE drawing a week is probably the maximum we can produce, if quality is an issue.",
    "Why isn't Fred Koetter teaching this class?",
    "Most valuable part was reading seminal texts, but Death and Life, etc. were not covered. Also, texts should be more selective, as two entire books for a discussion is unreasonable. Too much work, detracting from quality of our other classes.",
    "I was surprised by the tardiness and general sense of apathy by many of the Arch students in the course. It was pretty clear that they were overworked and this urban design course was low on their priority list. I understand that, but it left me wondering if the curriculum should to encourage better engagement with the first year students.",
    "Better coordination between lectures and section, or the elimination of the lecture component altogether (and find a way to integrate that material into sections).",
    "I think this course (for graduate students) could benefit from tightening up the assignments to make them less time-consuming and more meaningful.",
    "Elihu's lectures were good. He has a capability to convey the lectures. The course however, suffers from a lack of position\/intentionality. All the work done for this class, in the discussion group, has a sense of busy-work. It is not useful.",
    "This course needs a lot of reconsideration regarding material taught, method of presentation and work load.",
    "This course needs to be re-evaluated in the context of the overall semester schedule. The weekly workload was very high, and given the overall schedule demands, it was difficult to complete the assignments with a high degree of quality. This was frustrating given the assignments were stimulating in themselves. The disconnect between the lecture and discussion sections was also very frustrating. There was almost no reason to attend the lectures, especially because I felt I didn\u0092t learn anything from them. I feel like this course should either be entirely focused on the workshop session, or be made into more of a pure lecture course similar to Forster\u0092s Modern Architecture course.",
    "Teach this class as a graduate class! Have a graduate level lecture and then a discussion section that is just that\u0097a discussion of the lectures. The discussion sectionneeds to stop trying to be its own course and needs to actually deal with what we have heard in lecture instead of ignoring it completely. No one at this school is afraid of hard work, but the work that was given in this class was tedious, time-consuming and not educational. There was too much of it. All together too much. The course needs to have a lecture, a discussion section on that lecture, and a paper at the end. Reading 8 books for one course is a lot, but even if that was cut in half and discussions held on those it would be better. This course should take lessons from Forster\u0092s history lecture, which has been the most successful and enlightening class I have taken at this school.Classes like this make students resent Yale, resent how they are treated by the faculty, and resent how much work they are given. If we are asked to work non-stop for a class, we had better be learning something in it. This class neither taught us new information, nor expanded on the information we already had. It was a waste of class time and time that we could have been spending on any other of our 5 courses this past semester. It is incredible that this problem happened at all at Yale University. While attending a graduate school like Yale, you expect better than this.",
    "If the lecture portion remains a requirement than it needs to be much better coordinated. I think eliminating it all together would be the best thing to do though.",
    "Keep the readings, but only have one major project. I would vote for the paper because in it the students are able to apply the ideas discussed throughout the semester toward the actual critic of a urban planning project.",
    "The lecture component of this course was the weak point. This is not to say that the lecture's were bad, on the contrary, they were quite well planned and informative. However, these lectures covered general urban topics in a cursory way that for the majority of us was more review than anything else - in all honesty it felt as if we were in an undergrad class. Coupled with the seminar component, this seemed rather wasteful of time, particularly in what was an incredibly busy semester. I would suggest removing the requirement for grad students to attend the lectures.",
    "eliminate the lectures and make it just a drawing\/analysis workshop.",
    "I would remove the second paper and instead assign the final paper on the case study project. Without the short final presentations, we could have done a more complete case study final presentation throughout the semester. This would have also spaced out the readings more, and made it more realistic.",
    "The lecture portion and the graduate seminar had little to do with each other, so why combine them? I would have liked to have had time to develop a formal analysis of a city over the course of the whole semester, rather than rushing it in a half-semester project and then starting a final paper. If there is meant to be a serious drawing component to this class, there needs to be much more time allowed for it, and the paper should be secondary, or be skipped.",
    "The workload this entire semester has been out of hand. From what I understand, the increase in workload in this course played a huge part in that.",
    "I am not sure whether this would be possible, but my suggestion would be to have two separate classes that could accommodate both groups of students \u0096 the undergraduate students and graduate students with no architectural backgrounds, and the graduate students with previous architectural experience. Also, rather than giving the graduate students to read the entire books for the comparison, which I think was many times unreasonable, it would be perhaps more valuable to have specific chapters highlighted from each book.",
    "The mid-term case study and final essay could be about the same project rather than two different projects.",
    "PLEASE just work on the schedule for this semester! This is yet another class that could have been SO much better if we'd just had enough time to dedicate to it.",
    "The discussion component of this class (for MArch's) needs to be reworked. Seriously. The readings were great - interesting, relevant, etc. Why did we have to read TWO books a week? Plus responses? Plus drawings? Plus a final paper? More work does not mean more learning. It means doing the same amount of work across more assignments, so less rigor, less depth. Here's what needs to happen: one reading a week, with response. Discussion session is over the reading. One final project, either in-class presentation OR paper. Not both. Andrei is a great instructor, but there was too much assigned in that class."
