    "It's econ.",
    "I would recommend taking it",
    "An introduction to macroeconomics with an emphasis on current research.",
    "Yes, it's interesting, and also an important general education (and prerequisite) for many majors.",
    "Take it and let the information change your life.",
    "This class was fun. A lot of people didn't go to class, but I actually liked lecture. Aleh ended each class talking about current affairs which was kind of annoying but other than that, the class is informative, fun and easy compared to the section.",
    "Pretty interesting! Take it for good macro foundation. Probably professor dependant as well.",
    "Good general knowledge to have, but just know lecture is poor, and you will end up teaching yourself all of the material from the book.",
    "A class without too much work that surveys macroeconomics. I would definitely recommend it because Aleh is great and the material is fairly interesting",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. But that is probably true of any econ class.",
    "Econ 116 is a course that gives you an understanding about the flow of the whole economy and how it shifts and changes. I was able to understand how policy decisions and fiscal changes affect the economy as a whole, and I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. Even if one is not particularly interested in economics, the course is valuable as a way to better understand the issues that are in the news everyday and be educated on the challenges our country is facing.",
    "I would recommend this course as a great introductory course for economics as Tsyvinski goes over a good overview of macroeconomic theory with a hint of his own professional opinion of the current state of macroeconomics through correlated current research. Some would say that he has a conservative bias, but I feel as though he gives us the data and some interpretations of data. This simply gives us a different perspective on the matter. Whether one would say it is conservative or not does not bother me",
    "I mean, it's macro. I liked it, some people hated it, but either way, it's a prereq for a lot of classes. And if you have to take it, take it with Aleh--he's really laid back and understands that intro macro isn't necessarily your life priority at the moment. He's also hilarious, and he'll retweet you a lot. Also, if Dima is a TF for any sections, find her section--she's amazing.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand the basics of our economy.",
    "Awful. Take it if you really must. If you must, consider your life choices.",
    "would definitely recommend.",
    "econ 116 is an introductory class so it is large and not the most interesting material in the world. However, I really like econ and find it interesting, it is useful world knowledge and the professor did a really good job making the class as interesting as possible. I'd definitely recommend it if you're interested in having a basic understanding of the macroeconomy.",
    "Good, straight-forward intro course.",
    "Good class, obviously necessary for the major. Not too technical, learned a lot about the economy. Aleh is an engaging lecturer, covers a lot of material not on the exams though. Problem sets aren't too bad.",
    "I'm not an econ person at all and just took this my senior year for kicks. Honestly, best decision ever. It's a really manageable amount of material (which is not typical of Yale courses), the math\/graph\/nitty-gritty work of it all is really straightforward and simple (and fun!), you don't have to do the reading because everything is in the slides, I got to exercise a not oft-used part of my brain, and it feels good that I'm now familiar with this material. I'm so happy I took it. Non-econ people, don't be afraid of taking this class!",
    "Intro Macro with Aleh Tsyvinski is perhaps one of the friendliest courses I have taken in my Yale career thus far. Grading was done without competitive curves, exams were fair, problem sets were extremely short, and the TF's were solid across the board. A \"no-stress\" approach seems to have been taken with the entire class, which may nonetheless incite criticisms that students ended up not learning as much as they could.Though it was at times disconcerting to hear the professor note that much of the material we learned was \"boring,\" his passion for economics came through in frequent discussions on current macroeconomic research and absolutely hilarious jokes on random things. I, for one, enjoyed doing the Harlem Shake, Japanese calisthenics, and making fun of Stalin in the middle of lectures...In the grand scheme of things, Aleh's 116 is a great take on what an introductory economics course should be--not unrealistically demanding, friendly, and manageable. My rating of \"excellent\" for this course takes into account the context of the circumstances in which it is taught--a normally dry subject did not seem so bad at all with Aleh at its helm, and that alone is a noteworthy accomplishment.",
    "A fine introductory course to Economics if needed for prerequisites. The course load is not unmanageable at all. Would also be a good course to take credit\/D\/Fail if you're just interested in having a bit of background in economics without using it towards distributional requirements.",
    "A fantastic introductory course: engaging, straightforward, and valuable! Not only do I feel like I have gained a great set of basic macroeconomic skills, but I also know so much more about the real macroeconomies of the United States and the world thanks to the parts of Aleh's lectures dedicated to current research. An amazing professor, helpful TFs, fair expectations and class policies; what more could I ask for? YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! :-))",
    "Tsyvinski was really chill as an instructor, and made the class about as fun as possible. Other than that, it's intro macro. I wouldn't recommend the class to non-majors just looking to get a perspective on policy; you'll learn about as much just reading Ezra Klein every day.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "10000000% Yes, if Professor Tsyvinski is teaching it. Otherwise, take it if you want to be an econ major. An interesting class for those actually interested in pursuing economics (Professor Tsyvinski always talks about his opinions and current research every class) and not too hard of a class. Tests are straightforward, and Prof Tsyvinski really just wants you to get interested in economics. He doesn't want to fail anyone.",
    "I would definitely take it with Tsyvinski",
    "Class is big and material not too interesting. But Aleh is one of the funniest econ professors around.",
    "Take it if you want to know the basics about how the FED, the money market, aggregate demand etc. work.",
    "Absolutely. Not only is it a prerequisite for many majors, but it gives you a much better understanding of the economy. Many people have complained that it is a very dry course, but if you take it with Aleh, you will be entertained!!",
    "Take this class! Interesting and relevant material (with some emphasis on current research \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very illuminating!), and relatively low workload (short weekly homework assignments, a midterm, and a final \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both quite fair). Section was taught wonderfully, and was a great help even for homeworks and exams. Professor Aleh Tsyvinski is an absolute superstar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 extremely knowledgeable, unbelievably accommodating, and intensely entertaining! It feels amazing to be taught by someone of his stature and experience. He was unprecedentedly reasonable with the workload \u00e2\u0080\u0093 completely in tune with and sympathetic towards his students. He was always open to critique. Most of all, the Econ 116 classes were so much fun! From bizarre calisthenics to elaborate April Fools' pranks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 every Econ lecture was memorable! Even the cold calling was done with a sense of humor! Loved the class!!",
    "If you want to be an Econ major you had to take it. Take it anyway if you can get it with Aleh",
    "Its a basic Macroeconomics class with not that much work required and an interesting teacher with a big personality. If you like current research, you'll enjoy this class even more. Beware of the exams though. They are presented as easy and straightforward, but many questions are worded in complicated and confusing ways that result in mistakes based on confusing questions not a lack of understanding of the material",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!! Tsyvinski is a GREAT professor; he's funny, engages the class (even though it's a big lecture course, he calls on people and gets the class to participate), and incredibly knowledgeable. The course is minimal work but I felt like I learned a lot. Side note: be prepared for the course to present an economically-conservative bias.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you're seriously considering the econ major or want an easy class where you don't have to attend lecture. Even so, it's probably not worth it if you're not an econ major.",
    "The sad thing is you have to take this class to really do anything with Econ, but it's awful. Hopefully Yale will actually learn to stop ignoring Intro Macro and find a good lecturer.",
    "Very good course and definitely recommended. Aleh makes it interesting and makes class really fun. Tests are fair and he prepares you well.",
    "take it if you want to or if it is a prereq. Actually, it is pretty good overall.",
    "This is a good course to take. My smallest workload, and one of my most enjoyable classes.",
    "Take it! Useful information, pretty easy.",
    "the introduction to macroeconomics",
    "Econ 116 is a prereq for many social science majors and other advanced economic classes. This is a large lecture (one of the largest courses offered), so don't expect the most enlightening material in the world. However, Professor Tysvinski really does make an effort to get students engaged during lectures and be funny during class (we did daily calisthenics exercises halfway through every class.)In comparison to the seminar, the lecture isn't as intense and probably goes less in-depth into the material. Also it's a bigger class, so you can more easily go unnoticed.",
    "I would recommend Econ 116. While some of the material is boring, that is the nature of intro econ. Professor Tsyvinski is great, and probably makes it as interesting and clear as is possible. I highly recommend him, and I think this course can be great if you put the time into reading the book and going to lecture.",
    "I would recommend this over Intro Micro because this is way more interesting and it isn't too confusing. There isn't much math in this compared to Intro Micro.",
    "Yes! Macroeconomics is something everyone should learn and understand, with Aleh at the forefront, I guarantee you it will be an amazing educational experience.",
    "Take it, but make sure you take it with Aleh!",
    "I would recommend it",
    "If for some reason Aleh teaches this again, take it. I thought it was going to be the worst class ever and it was actually quite bearable just because of him. He couldnt care less about teaching the stuff in the textbook, so he basically picks out whats important and then goes on tangents into current research and policy debates, which are much more interesting than the actual material. Psets were really short and tests were reasonable. Also the funniest teacher I've ever had.If it's not him, it'll probably be back to the typical econ slog...",
    "Definitely take this course, especially if you're a perspective Econ major.",
    "I would recommend taking introductory macroeconomics. But, if possible, take it will a different professor who takes the class and his students more seriously.",
    "I liked it. The material in the book was kind of boring, but the Professor made it interesting with supplementary material. Most people are taking this because they have to for Econ or EPE, etc. If you get Aleh, count yourself lucky.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. Regardless of what you are going to major in, this class will give you useful knowledge.",
    "ECON 116 is basically what you would expect from an introductory macroeoconomics course. Take it if you need it for your major but otherwise there are probably many much more interesting SO courses out there.",
    "IF TSYVINSKI IS TEACHING IT, TAKE IT.",
    "Aleh was very knowledgeable and it was fun to listen to his lectures. He made the basic course material more interesting by adding in his own perspectives and the perspectives of current research in economics.Sheng Li is a great TA. Sheng was extremely organized and always came to section with a plan for what he wanted to do.",
    "Decent class, Aleh is fun but doesn't do much. A little more relevant than micro. And don't let the lack of a QR fool you -- this course is just as if not more mathy than micro.",
    "Only because they have to take it for the Econ major.",
    "If you need this as a prereq, then take it. It is also a not-so-difficult Social Science credit",
    "Yes. Best class ever. 5\/5. Take this over seminar.",
    "Yes, if it's with Professor Tsyvinski! Great overall!Funny professor, helpful\/nice\/chill TAs, interesting material.Midterm\/finals weren't curved (the message ended with \"Happy birthday to all\"), and the psets were standard, sections not mandatory.",
    "Solid lecture. Good introduction to macro that highlights current policy debates as well as theory. Aleh is clear and funny.",
    "Yes, if you have to.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in economics.",
    "Take it if Tsyvinski is teaching it. Professor Tsyvinski was an inspiring presence in class, and his sense of humor livened the most boring of topics. He went all out to make sure we enjoyed macro and learnt the latest trends and research in the subject. Definitely the best intro macro course you can take: a well structured and fair course that does amazingly considering it's an enormous intro lecture class.",
    "It's not too exciting, it's not particularly informative, but it's almost irresponsibly easy.",
    "Take it with Aleh. He is not boring like other intro macro professors, and manages to really make every lecture worth going to. (And you should go-- sometimes he will give out bonus points!) This class was totally unlike any econ class I have heard of, though, so be prepared for the grading standards to be a little confusing and unclear.",
    "You probably have to take it, so given that Aleh is the best option",
    "I would recommend this course because it was very little work. If you are looking for an easy class to take, this was it.",
    "Econ 116 is a very interesting class. I would recommend it to anyone even if they are not econ majors.",
    "Take if you need to. If you don't, only do it if you're interested in the material. I found that I know a lot more macro than what's taught in this class (I had to take it for a requirement but have been pushing it off; I've done a lot of research and reading about the subjects for macro professors) and it was difficult for me to take this class seriously because it's pretty dumbed down, but ironically, that makes the course harder (a lot of the assumptions they make for simplicity's sake make a lot of the models, at least in my opinion, incoherent).",
    "Really good class. Especially if Aleh is teaching.",
    "A must take class with Aleh. You learn a lot about the economy and it is not too stressful of a class if you stay on top of your work",
    "Econ 116 followed the textbook pretty closely, so it wasn't too hard to keep up. As long as you do the readings, it isn't really necessary to go to lecture. Aleh was a fabulous professor, though. If Aleh's teaching, definitely take the course. He makes lecture really fun and listens to what students suggest.",
    "Ehh, I took it thinking that it would be useful but ended up learning far more from cramming the textbook before exams. Also the final cheat sheet was a joke\/not-helpful at all.",
    "Take this class, even if you are not an econ major. A basic understanding of macroeconomics is very necessary. Professor Tsyvinski may get distracted in lecture at times, but he omits material that he didn't cover well from the exams. Very manageable workload: ten p-sets, a midterm, and final. Almost a gut.",
    "Pretty easy class. Just problem sets each week, midterm, and a final. Not great for inspiring an interest in economics, but easy way to get a good grade.",
    "Good Econ Course",
    "If Aleh Tsvinsky's teaching this again, definitely take it! He's a great lecturer and macroeconomics is pretty cool.",
    "YES! Take it with Aleh -- best professor ever!",
    "I took it because I had to, as most of other people in the class I believe. If Tsyvinski is still teaching it though, definitely take it! I think I learned quite a lot, and overall enjoyed the class. The class would have never been that interesting if Tsyvinski wasn't teaching it, and it would have definitely make it harder to do the readings and go to lecture.",
    "Good introductory course, not hard at all.",
    "I took this class because I had to for the Global Affairs Major. With that being said, it was as enjoyable an experience as possible for someone who does not quite favor economics. Tsyvinski is phenomenal and you absolutely want to have him. The work is SUPER minimal, the material is relatively interesting, it's really not too difficult to get a good grade",
    "ECON 116 with Professor Tsyvinski is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. Prof. Tsyvinski is so knowledgeable, so likable, and so hilarious that you will LOOK FORWARD to lecture. This class teaches you a lot about the economy and how it works in kind of a mathematical\/graphical way, and even though that can be kind of boring sometimes (and I admit that there were moments in lecture when I was pretty bored), Prof. Tsyvinski does an incredible job of making it easy to understand and fun to learn. He has so many quirks (the \"green ray of death,\" which he uses to call on students, the mid-class calisthenics, and his constant jabs at people), but they're all really harmless and funny. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "If you gotta take it, you gotta take it. It's not a bad course, easy grades, and lectures are pretty straightforward.",
    "Basic summary of topics within macroeconomics, low courseload, manageable tests",
    "For a class in which the wonderfully clear and detailed lecture slides are posted up on ClassesV2 and the p-sets are manageable without attending class, this should have freed up my Monday and Wednesday afternoons. But I attended every single Econ 116 class without fail. Why? Professor Aleh Tsyvinski. What a guy. And I'm not talking about his endless supply of jokes and quips (which kept me laughing throughout the semester), or his in-class calisthenics sessions (which I will miss in every large lecture class from here on out). It's because I had never seen the beauty and power of economics until now. Instead of relegating the graphs and concepts to dry textbook fodder, Prof. Tsyvinski brought them to life - real life, that is. He peppered each lecture with real-life implications, examples, and engaging current research. I have never been interested in the macroeconomy before, but this class has made me appreciate it beyond the flat, lifeless text in Mankiw's book. Thank you, Prof. Tsyvinski, for adding color and dimension to what should have been a dreaded standard intro econ course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a very basic introductory course. With a general understanding of economics from Microeconomics at Yale, this class is not a difficult transition.",
    "TAKE IT WITH ALEH. This class is really easy because he is tons of fun. You don't really have to read the book and the problem sets are really quick. Go to lecture\/section and you will understand mostly everything and not be too worried about the exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course over the seminar. the teacher is more interesting and the class has more fair grading. Even if you don't need this course for your major I would still recommend it.",
    "The course is easy, entertaining, and Aleh is a good guy, but doesn't seem to put in too much effort. Take it for intro macro if you have to- it doesn't get much easier.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. I think that all students should take a macroeconomics in college.",
    "Meh. I took it as a So and never went to lecture or section. It's what you expect. Aleh is HILARIOUS in class but econ is \"the Dismal science\" for a reason. Not that it's a science at all.",
    "Aleh was an amazing intro macro teacher and if he's teaching it again, I highly recommend for you to take it. He made it his top priority to keep his lectures interesting and you could tell he honestly just wanted everyone to do well. The material isn't too difficult and the psets were very short.",
    "It's informative and fairly easy to understand. Not difficult to get a good grade and not as boring as a lot of people are saying. Make sure you shop around until you find a good teaching fellow. If Dima is still teaching then go to her section. Just do it.",
    "by all means not a fascinating subject, but if you have to take econ 116, take it with Aleh. lectures are posted online; psets are pretty simple; we could take a cheat sheet into our exam.",
    "I recommend this class for a basic understanding of the way the world economy functions and anyone who has an interest in money management.",
    "If you don't really like Econ, but want\/need to take it anyway, try to get Aleh as a professor, as he will make it understandable and bearable for you.",
    "I enjoyed Econ 116 this semester. If you have a chance to take the course with Professor Tsyvinski, take it.",
    "Aleh=boss.",
    "Take it! It provides a good intro to Macroecon. You probably don't need to go to lecture. Just read the chapters from the textbook weekly and you'll be fine.",
    "I would say it's a low stress introduction to macroeconomics. I'd recommend it if the student wanted to major in economics or get a basic understanding.",
    "It's a decent course to introductory macro. If interested, you should take it.",
    "Your classic macroeconomics course. Take it as a prereq for most of the economics department.",
    "Take ECON 116 with Professor Tsyvinski if you can. I had heard that other professors who taught intro macro were not great, and so I wasn't sure whether to take this class. However, Tsyvinski (who hasn't taught intro micro before at Yale) was very charismatic. He is also extremely willing to listen to students' concerns, and he made changes according to complaints (like shortening psets and adding recaps in his lectures). However, due to his relaxed nature, it can feel like at times you are not learning very much. But for a lecture course, it's not bad.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend it to another student. I learned a lot about the entire economy and also learned a lot about our world economy.",
    "Pretty much your average intro macro course. Not the most exciting class at Yale, but Aleh is a good professor to take it with.",
    "For econ majors, this question doesn't help you.I found this to be a fascinating course of how the world works.",
    "Big lecture class, lecture is great and Alex is funny. Problem sets aren't bad",
    "If you're looking to understand the macroeconomic world around you, may not be the best place to go, but if you need it, take it.",
    "Good class and not too difficult if you put the time in.",
    "Pretty good intro to macroeconomics.",
    "very solid intro econ class. feel prepared for intermediate",
    "Basic into macro, taught very conservatively",
    "An introduction to macroeconomics. I would recommend the course for those who want to get some insight into how our economy functions.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student (especially those interested in economics). The class teaches you a lot, and it is not too strenuous.",
    "I definitely would. It is so great to be able to understand what is going on in our world economy at a base level.",
    "Take even if you aren't an econ major. You should know this material regardless of what you do.",
    "It's an intro macro class. It's nothing spectacular but Aleh does a pretty solid job of keeping it interesting (although the lecture was basically empty by the time the semester ends).",
    "A very poorly taught course. Even though I am interested in economics, the prof treats the lectures like a joke, showing strange unrelated YouTube videos and cold calling on people, making going to lecture run very slowly and feel like a joke. Very little feedback on exams. Tsyvinski's teaching style would probably work much better in a seminar rather than a large lecture.",
    "Standard introductory lecture. Take it because you have to or because you're interested in learning a little bit about how the economy works",
    "Very little homework with relatively easy concepts along with a good teacher. Would definitely recommend.",
    "The course followed the book yet oversimplified a lot of topics. The lecture was interesting, yet superfluous - very important matters were not covered thoroughly enough and the exam tested very niche concepts just to curve it (because midterm turned out to be too easy....). However, the slides and the problem sets were very well prepared. SoI guess you should take this very popular course and learn the concepts well (focus on them), attend the sections! It's crucial to your understanding of the material.",
    "The class is pretty ho-hum but is a relatively easy credit and Professor Tsyvinski is good.",
    "Yes. I think everybody should have an idea how macroeconomics works and they should take this course with Aleh.",
    "Take it with Aleh",
    "Great class. Very straightforward. Good applications with relevant research.",
    "Surprisingly fun for a big intro class!!"
