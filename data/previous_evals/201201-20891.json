   "comments": [
    "This class should be taken by those that have a good background on micro and macro economics.",
    "I would recommend this.",
    "International Economics with Professor Cavallo is not an economics course. It is a chance to learn about the international trade patterns and history of your peers' respective countries, and a chance to listen to several guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds. Little knowledge of economic theory and principles is required. If that is something that interests other students, then I would recommend this class to them.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student.",
    "Definitely recommend if you're interested, though be prepared to teach yourself a lot!",
    "I would not recommend this course because there was not enough actual teaching. Didn't feel i got that ,uch out of it.",
    "Interesting if he\/she is interested in current affairs rather than pure theory",
    "Nice course",
    "Yes, recommend.",
    "Only if he had limited exposure to the subject beforehand.",
    "Econ 702 talks about international trade and finance. We look at country case studies through student presentations to apply the theoretical things we have learned. We also occasionally have distinguished guests come in and talkI would recommend taking it.",
    "Good",
    "yes. because the class is very interactive and involving",
    "Yes; it is a useful class to understand the fundamentals of development economics, and also some of the recently relevant issues.",
    "If you are interested in the real practice of international economics and wants to work in this field in the future, u should definitely take this course",
    "Nice"

    "I was able to and was encouraged by the instructor to concentrate on Russia. This contributed to my researches on the economy of Russia.",
    "Helped open me to new ideas and theories of which I was previously unaware.",
    "International Economics with Professor Cavallo did not increase my knowledge of economics. It certainly added to my knowledge about the political and economy history of my peers' respective countries -- but that's not really what I was hoping to take away from this course.",
    "This course has contributed significantly to my educational experience at Yale. Between the professor, the textbook and guest speakers, i have come away with a strong base in international economics.",
    "Get to know the cases of other countries.",
    "Knowledge of international economic policies in other countries, but it did not add much to the theory I learnt in undergrad.",
    "It will definitely help in my career as a banker",
    "Broadened horizon",
    "this class let me understand more about the dynamics of trade and financial crisis and countries policies and effects relating to it",
    "It deepens my knowledge in terms of real practice in the field. Professor's experience is invaluable.",
    "Wonderful"
