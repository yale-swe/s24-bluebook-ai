   "comments": [
    "It is an overview of labor history in the 1930s and 1940s with a little bit of social, political, and economic history in there as well. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in that topic, but it is really a lot of work so would not take it if you are not interested in it. The readings each week took me a really long time, and there is a reading response every single week which added time onto that. The first paper is a book response which isn't that bad and then the final paper is a 15-20 page paper based on archival research. I would definitely recommend taking the time to look at archives and pick one you are interested in because you work on the paper throughout the semester and if you don't like your topic it can be really painful to write. Overall it's what you would expect out of a junior history seminar. I'm glad that I took it.",
    "Really great syllabus."
