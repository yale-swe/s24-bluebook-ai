    "Math 345 is a fairly low-work class in that we only had 5 problem sets, a pop midterm quiz that everyone failed, and a presentation; but none of the work was easy, and very little of it was interesting. The topic changes each semester, so it is possible that future semesters will have more exciting content, but I would not recommend boolean functions to anyone for a full semester course. Vu seemed to take pleasure in making us squirm with the midterm and did not seem eager to help us understand the material, although he wasn't an extreme outlier. Take a different math class with a slightly more engaged professor and literally any other topic.",
    "Check the syllabus, see if you like the material (it changes every year). Take it iff the material seems interesting.",
    "A fun class if you happen to be taking this iteration of it on the analysis of Boolean functions - turns out all Boolean functions {0,1}^n -> {0,1} can be represented as multilinear polynomials - which happens to be related to pretty cool things like Social Choice Theory (i.e. the mathematics of voting) and results like Dictatorships are the Stablest and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem! We even prove the Central Limit Theorem at the end using all the machinery developed. Also useful knowledge to have if you happen to be an EENG\/CPSC major. Check out the textbook, Analysis of Boolean Functions, even if you don't get to take this iteration! That said, the grading for the class can seem uncertain, so it might be better to start on Cr\/D\/F. We had pop quiz that accounted for 10% for the grade out of nowhere, and 30% of the grade depends on a presentation you do on a subchapter of the textbook during one of the classes in the last few weeks. Homework assignments are about once every two weeks, so even though they are hard, there's generally enough time to finish them."
