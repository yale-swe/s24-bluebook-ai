   "comments": [
    "Primarily learned how to write R code -- most statistical material was review",
    "Learn to apply data analysis techniques to questions of politics and policy.",
    "A broad understanding of the many data science methods used in political science, and an overview of some recent research across many policy contexts.",
    "I learned how data science can be applied broadly to the problems of policy as well as economics and social research. I also learned how to code in R for statistics and how to apply skills from a book to a real life problem for the final project.",
    "I learned so much about statistical concepts (e.g. potential outcomes, internal\/external validation) and how to code in R.",
    "Good introduction into how to apply functions in R to data sets.",
    "Improved coding skills in R and better understanding of experimental identification strategies",
    "This class taught me how to use R to conduct analyses on political information and read academic papers about political and data science.",
    "a lot of R skills, mostly. Also a lot of insight into causal theory that was incredibly interesting.",
    "I learned a lot of new ways to apply data science to politics",
    "I learned a ton about R (even though I had already taken many R classes). I learned a lot about how to design a campaign and looked at lots of interesting data sets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting papers, very applied (you learn how to *do* stuff) Weaknesses: psets can be unexpectedly really hard, and R can be pretty tricky to debug",
    "Pretty good course. One issue is that since students have vastly different backgrounds it is hard to teach it to all levels at once.",
    "The strength of this course is probably the assignments. They are challenging, but encourage you to translate your results into real-world interpretations. I appreciated that the assignments relied on real-world datasets and tackled important issues in politics and social policy. The weakness is probably the lecture-style classes, which were not terribly engaging and could probably be replaced with something a little more hands-on. It might be worth making knowledge of R a prerequisite (e.g. S&DS 230), so that the instructor doesn't have to waste time teaching students have to code- I think that is reasonable for a 400-level class.",
    "I loved the book used in this course as someone who had never coded in R before. It was straightforward and easy to understand. I also appreciated that it was both a lecture and a seminar; truly the best of both experiences. The mini quizzes every other week kept me on top of the material and engaged. The different backgrounds of the students was both a strength and a weakness, as certain people knew a lot more about one thing than others. But the projects were wonderful and generally painless, and I learned a lot.",
    "The strengths of this course were the textbook (very detailed and great explanations), the structured format of the problem sets, Fredrik's availability and accessibility, and the course format. The only thing I would suggest is to have more coding during the lecture-based classes as opposed to more conceptual discussion.",
    "I think the course needed some better planning (but to be fair this was the first year it was taught). Ideally this course should have 2 classes a week.",
    "Very good survey of key issues in data science \/ statistics in social science. It would be great to be broken down into two course, one introductory and one advanced.",
    "Fredrik did a great job teaching the course. The syllabus was great -- I have two recommendations. The first is a no technology policy for the first half of the class to make sure the class is focused, and the second is perhaps we could have a guest speaker talk about how to run campaigns in a data-driven way.",
    "The psets were interesting. The course felt like a statistics course and didn't really touch upon the 'For politics and policy' aspects as much as I wanted it to, but I wouldn't say that's a weakness of the course. The professor was too forgiving in his grades. His comments in our projects were great, and extremely helpful -- each yellow square was always something valid and important. But at a certain point, while doing the projects and balancing my other work, I'd wonder if \"better code\" was worth the time, since the quality of our work wasn't particularly reflected in our grade. It was certainly very nice that it was that way, and it made the class very relaxed.",
    "Perhaps less readings and more r tutorials",
    "I think the course was great!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yeah -- it's an interesting combination of software development and social science that I haven't seen elsewhere. Definitely some growing pains with a first-time course, but interesting nonetheless.",
    "For stat\/data science majors much of the class will be review and for non-stats majors it might be confusing. It is probably ideal for those who have maybe taken one or two statistics classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! This is the first time it was offered, so it will be interesting to see how it develops. I like that it is open to more than just poli sci majors, because the array of perspectives in the room made our discussions quite interesting. If you are from a more qualitative background, you will learn valuable coding skills (but be ready to put in a lot of effort to learn R), and if you come from a more quantitative background, you will get to work with unique kinds of data and get exposed to new kinds of research.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Professor Svje is such a kind, patient instructor and is always willing to help his students. In addition, the material is fascinating without being overwhelming, and the psets helped me feel more confident in R as I went through the course. At first, it will feel too easy for anyone with any background in stats\/policy\/comp sci, as these are the three areas of focus of the course, but you will quickly find yourself challenged in the areas you aren't familiar with.",
    "I would definitely recommend! As someone whose only stats background was some basic Stata language, the learning curve for R was huge. I would recommend this to anyone willing to spend a lot of time outside of class to learn R.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend it to them if they hadn't taken previous classes on statistics or political science, or if they were especially in doing both.",
    "Yes, but only if you actually deeply care about data science and its intersection with politics and policy. You don't even have to be good at it -- you just have to care.",
    "Yes if you are interested!",
    "Definitely! Loved it.",
    "This is not a class for your average Poli Sci major, you must truly be strong in and interested in statistics, data, and coding. You must have a love of numbers as well as an interest in policy. Many students in this first year of the class underestimated the quantitative difficulty but Savje was responsive and adapted the class to better suit our needs. The readings in the class are more heavily focused on how various statistic phenomenons work than on how data plays into specific policy formulations. As this is not an introductory class, I would recommend this to S&DS\/CS majors. I hope in the coming years that Yale will provide students with an introductory version of this class."
