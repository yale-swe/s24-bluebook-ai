    "Strengths- Alessia is the sweetest and most understanding professor... she truly cares and takes time to explain any questions you may have Weaknesses- none, but early mornings are tough",
    "Strengths: Professor Bellusci is a fantastic lecturer, and our frequent trips to other places like the Beinecke and Sterling made me feel like we were fully utilizing the resources Yale had to offer. The course itself is also extremely interesting. Weakness: each lecture is quite long because we only meet once a week-- it can be a little hard to focus around the 1-hour mark. Maybe having a short break in the middle might help?"
