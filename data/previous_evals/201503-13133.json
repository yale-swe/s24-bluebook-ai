   "comments": [
    "Take this course. You will learn a lot about network science and related disciplines. But more importantly, you will learn about conducting research and critically assessing academic work: underlying assumptions, reasoning behind their methods, the validity of the methods themselves, confounding factors, openly engaging and evaluating trade-offs between feasibility and accuracy, and much more. You'll be surrounded by brilliant people from different disciplines that work in the lab or came to visit, and you will learn more about research and critical thinking in general than in any other courses you take, if not more than all of them combined.",
    "It's a weekly meeting with lunch and a presentation on a research project from one of the lab members. Definitely take this course if you want to hear interesting research presentations in the fields tangential to human networks.",
    "This course is a great overview of the different areas of network science. It is highly recommended."

    "I had lightly considered network analysis for my graduate work, but now I feel convinced that it is central to understanding sociology, no matter the sub-discipline."
