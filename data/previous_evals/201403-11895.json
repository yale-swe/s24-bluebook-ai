   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot about environmental science-y stuff, like electric cars, renewable energy sources, and get to tour Kroon Hall and the power plant. A large portion of the class is working on your group presentations and watching others'. It's a seminar style because you learn a lot from your classmates. Professor Prober does quite a few cool demonstrations in class and often gives out quirky little prizes for things. It's a fun class, but also is more quantitative than the course description lets on.",
    "A very easy way to get an SC\/QR credit. The material is fairly interesting, but the way it is covered is quite dry. Nevertheless the workload is pretty light and you never feel like you're under pressure with this class. The exams look a lot like the problem sets. Read the lecture notes and the problem sets and you'll be okay.",
    "Overall, this is a good class. Be prepared for a somewhat heavy workload and to rely on study groups for problem sets and lectures. Workload aside, this is an important topic that every Yale student should be well versed in. The benefit of a class like this is that you come away with a clear sense of how power is prepared at Yale and the economic and political barriers to sustainability. Regardless of your politics, this class is a must.",
    "I would recommend it for an interesting science credit, though it is a good deal of work, and often times an uphill slog during lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course for those who have an interest in energy issues, and also say that the psets include engineering-geared problems- there is a fair bit of quantitative analysis to this course, and a fair bit of AP Chem\/AP Physics style math, so I think it is a fair mix of QR and science. A very engaging science course, if a bit disorganized this semester. Has opportunities to explore your own interests (group presentation, final paper) and you learn a lot about many different aspects of energy, especially the science behind renewables and fossil fuel use.",
    "Only take it as a requirement, otherwise it is not worth it.",
    "This class was a super superficial overview of the energy-related problems America is facing. We didn't do any critical interrogation of the issues at hand whatsoever, but learned a *little* dumbed down bit about the science involved. Prober is a nice guy but he assumed (maybe rightfully so) that we as a majority non-science major class were quantitatively\/scientifically incompetent, so he didn't ever drill down into interesting details. Field trips in class were cool.",
    "Not as easy as it seems, definitely NOT A GUT! Harsh grading, too many assignments: problem sets, presentation, midterm, final. Sometimes confusing, half the teaching was through student presentations. Not a very structured class. However, the topic is very interesting and you really do learn a lot. But it has nothing to do with \"society\", it's as scientific as it can be (as a PHYS 100 class). Remember it's a QR.",
    "I do not recommend this course. The topic is great and the textbook is interesting: this could have been a solid course if the teaching and format were improved. I often left lecture wondering what we had learned in the last hour. You will learn about energy if you are willing to sit through the dead time. Not hard but still a substantial amount of work. Students give 4-5 of the lectures.",
    "I am in Energy Studies so I found it valuable, and you should take it if you are genuinely interested in energy or climate change, but otherwise you might not be happy doing this just to get a Sc or QR. It taught the basics of various sources of energy, uses of energy (electricity generation and transmission, HVAC, transportation), and environmental impacts of energy. It was mostly focused on science and calculations but there was some mention of policy and economics. Prober usually explained pretty well, and guest lectures and field trips were interesting. With problem sets, a midterm exam, a presentation, a final paper, and a final exam, it is a fair bit of work, though it's not hard provided you take the class the seriously."
