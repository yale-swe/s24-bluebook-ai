    "Phenomenal course with an amazing professor. I would highly recommend, but be prepared for some VERY deep conversation from the get-go.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!! Professor Jacobson is amazing, the books you read will teach you to consider history in a different way, and class discussion will always leave you wishing the class were longer. Seriously, best class ever!!!!!!",
    "Amazing, definitely my favorite class this semester. Take this class not only because it's a great Freshman seminar but also because you will learn about U.S. history through the unique lens of different commodities. Matt is an incredible teacher who acted as a mentor to all of us throughout the year, and I learned so much for him. The course is entirely structured around our group discussions, so each class goes in a different direction that is always interesting. The workload is pretty easy, but you get so much out of the class by doing the readings and participating in the discussions.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. I would say that the strength of this course in part relies on the quality of discussion and therefore on the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness the students bring to the class, but I think that under any circumstances the course would be valuable. The course used commodities as a lens through which to examine history, focusing on such topics as slavery, labor, the environment, our role as producers versus consumers, how materials come to assume cultural meaning, our agency as consumers and voters, and what our responsibilities are having learned about the deep implications of these commodities. Because the course touches on so many different topics, I think it would appeal to people with a wide variety of interests and might even expand someone's focus as they consider how their particular area of interest interacts with so many other fields.",
    "Can't recommend it enough. Honestly, every freshman interested in history -- or even just humanities, or even just America and consumption -- should try to take this class. (That's not to say that you have to be a humanities major to want to take it; rather, if you have ANY interest in history and American culture at all, take it.) Matt is incredible: he's so kind and wants to be an advisor in addition to a professor. But beyond his personality, he's so knowledgeable and leads amazing discussions. It's incredible to be able to get so close to such an esteemed professor. In the class, you read 12 books on 12 different commodities and write 3 papers during the term, each on a commodity of your choice. The biggest project, however, is the final research paper, on a meal you have eaten or an outfit you've worn. Very open-ended but extremely interested and a great way to learn how to use Yale's resources. TAKE THIS CLASS! Seriously. Move around your entire schedule to take it. You'll learn so much and have a great time.",
    "This is a fantastic course. I highly recommend it to anyone at all interested in history, especially if you have a mediocre to good background in US history. It's a lot of reading (250 pages per week) but the books themselves are really good. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.",
    "If you do not take this class, you will be missing out on one of the greatest cultural studies of all time. Do it for the fun, for the knowledge, for the eye-opening experience I guarantee you will have. It quite literally offers everything a human being could ask for: history, art, politics, culture, economics, debate, exceptional teaching and so much more. I have trouble finding appropriately enthusiastic words for how much I loved this class, so all I can say is I hope the next group of students loves it as much as I did.",
    "Commodities as U.S. History is hands down one of the best freshman seminars out there. Exciting, intriguing, stimulating, and thought-provoking, this course is an amazing way to learn about US History through an interdisciplinary approach. By surveying 12 commodities that play a huge role in our society, you learn about how every aspect of American history can somehow be tied to a product that we take for granted in everyday life. The books you read are fascinating and incredibly well written, and the class discussions are a great way to get a better take on the commodity of the week. Overall, amazing class and I would definitely recommend it to any prospective student."
