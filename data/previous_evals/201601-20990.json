    "This is a pretty well organized course. The material by nature is a dry, but the professors and TAs are very helpful and accommodating. I also felt that the psets and exams were pretty fair! (also exams are open note which is really nice)",
    "This class starts off slowly and mathematically, but becomes much more interesting once you begin to learn its applications, particularly in image processing.",
    "For a BME major, BENG 352 is a good class that expands your understanding of biomedical signals and images. I wish it werent so dry, but honestly its not too bad. Take if youre interested!",
    "Yes, take this course if you are interested in image processing. This is a class worth taking. It is manageable and you learn a lot of material.",
    "If you're not bme but interested in signals, I'd take this course. It covers a nice range of topics, introduces some good applications, and is relatively low work.",
    "This is a pretty good signals course if you want to learn more about Fourier analysis. The math is complicated, but it doesn't get very hard because you can use transform tables. It's not that interesting, but the 2D signals and cardiovascular system modeling is interesting if you like that kind of thing. The psets are usually pretty easy and section is great if you're confused on how to do something. This isn't a MATLAB heavy course, but you should definitely know how to use MATLAB to do the homework. Exams are open note and generally pretty straightforward."
