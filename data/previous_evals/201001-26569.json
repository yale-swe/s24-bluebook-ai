    "Definitely worth taking if you are considering a field that will address colonial or modern Brazil in some way (and possibly useful for grad students in other departments, keeping in mind it has a serious disciplinary orientation toward history\/historiography). Many of these books will be on my orals list, and I got a reasonable grasp of the historiography too.",
    "I would recommend it to any graduate student, regardless of their previous knowledge of Latin American history.",
    "The seminar is an rather fast-paced move through both classic and less-considered elements of Brazilian social and cultural history, through the lens of books both thematically and chronologically selected.",
    "General history of Brazil through several key monographs. I would definitely recommend this to anyone studying Brazil, Latin America, or colonial history. Or anyone just looking for an opportunity to learn from one of the best."

    "More useful for historiography\/teaching prep, though final paper was a good place to test out some research ideas.",
    "This course expanded my historical knowledge to a region that I had not previously studied.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of the area immensely. It provided critical material for an important component of my dissertation project.",
    "This course really shaped my outlook on the history of Latin America--a year ago I knew less about Brazil than most countries in Latin America and now I see myself studying this region for years to come."
