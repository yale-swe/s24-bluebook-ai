    "Well, on the first day of class, Prof. Ague hands you 5000 flashcards with mineral names and chemical formulas and you spend the rest of the time memorizing them. There's also a lab where you learn how to find oil.OR SO YOU MIGHT THINK BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG!Actually, G&G 220 is a wonderful introduction to the most common (and useful to know) minerals in Earth's crust and upper mantle and the processes that govern their formation\/deposition. Because petrology and mineralogy are so effectively intertwined, the class is never as boring as you might fear. Additionally, the Peabody museum has a superlative mineral collection, so you'll have the opportunity to study beautiful samples of pretty much everything that's mentioned in class. Then, in lab you'll learn how to identify these minerals in the field. There's a smattering of (epic, as usual for the G&G Dept.) field trips. We didn't get a chance to eat lunch in the Target Pizza Hut, which was a shame.Bottom line: take it. You'll love it. Prof. Jay Ague is a wonderful and engaging instructor.",
    "Do not take it if not G&G major. Too hard and you lack the background knowledge.",
    "G&G 220 is a course about the important minerals and their formation. A strong understanding of Mineralogy and Petrology will aid a Geology major, no matter what track he or she is on. I would not recommend this class to a student with no geology background. In order to keep up and appreciate the material, I'd recommend having taken G&G110, G&G212 or G&G207.",
    "220 is the best. Prof. Ague is the best. TAKE IT!!! If you're at all interested in Mineralogy and Petrology, he will be the best prof. you'll ever have.",
    "explained the formation and life cycle of rocks, and gave a hands on display of different minerals. For geology students, and others interested in learning about rocks and minerals, I recommend this class. Because it is very thorough, comprehensive and fun"
