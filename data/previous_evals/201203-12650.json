   "comments": [
    "The course is essentially a survey of various cases of speaking, and how speech is used and perceived in different cultures. The topics are very interesting, including sociological and some psychological topics. I would certainly recommend this course, thanks mainly to Professor Errington's great discussion style and the course content.",
    "some good theories about linguistic anthropology.",
    "Are you interested in the things that both vary and are the same in terms of speech across cultures? Then go for it.",
    "The class can be mind-numbingly boring. Professor Errington is a wonderful human being and scholar but a poor discussion facilitator. Take this only if you're interested in doing independent research or excited about the syllabus.",
    "Fascinating readings and discussions in linguistic anthropology, focused a little more on the anthropology side but Prof. Errington is happy to cater to the makeup of the class. The books are fairly mind-blowing and the final projects, which this year covered everything from rap battles to old Jewish men, are a pretty cool opportunity for creativity and applying the knowledge. Professor Errington is very content to let the class sit in silence if no one's' got anything to say, which I suppose might be some kind of ethnographic experiment in classroom environments, but I might've preferred a bit more liveliness. Great course material though; and the professor is very approachable and knows basically everything."
