    "It was a very engaging seminar, discussions were always interesting",
    "super great set up with each week being themed but chronologically and geographically diverse. in class discussions were helpful and very interesting, I liked how the professors moved through each reading during each class, it was well structured. more readings online (articles or scans) would have been helpful because the books could be hard to find for most of the class in time. also, perhaps a smaller assignment or mid-course feedback on how we are doing would be helpful before going into the final assignments.",
    "This course was the best I have taken at Yale thus far. De and Antonov and incredibly giving professors. Readings were a bit much, but still manageable, and seminar discussions were always meaningful.",
    "Strengths - structure and theoretical exploration. Ambitious reading list. Weaknesses - some class discussions were too broad, not enough practical use of archives.",
    "I loved this class. It would have been helpful to have assignments finalized at least a week in advance, as that caused some confusion. But the professors provided a great compliment to one another and lead interesting discussions."

    "Yes",
    "Absolutely: great intro to legal history.",
    "Yes. But mostly for those with a serious interest in the law or using legal sources in their work."
