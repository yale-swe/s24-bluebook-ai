I am now able to learn about several fields on a top level which gives me the ability to engage in discussion about several extremely pertinent issues!",

    "Very interesting, not too much work, a good way to end the week. Would be better to have an indication of how I'm doing along the way.",
    "This course is certainly strong in its setup of three week blocks. I really appreciate the fact that Professor Kankel brings in different professors so that each person can speak about his\/her field of expertise. I also appreciate the fact that each module ends with an open-note quiz and discussion\/activity which is a non-intimidating way to engage more with the material!",
    "I love that we get to work closely with many different professors. The quick turn-over of the topics is a great way to get information about many different subjects and keeps me interested. The professors and presentations sometimes use terminology that is too advanced i.e. Some subjects assume every student took AP classes in the sciences.",
    "Fascinating lectures and interesting problem sets and activities."

    "Yes, a lot of fun, lots of free food.",
    "YES. Take the course. I am a non-STEM major, and I have been learning a top-level knowledge of so many important dialogues that are going on within the scientific community. Because of this course, I feel comfortable engaging in casual dialogue regarding many of the current issues in science which has certainly helped me in other classes and in life. The workload is not intimidating, and Professor Kankel is extremely understanding of students that do not typically feel comfortable in science. The class is small as a seminar, and you certainly have a sense of community! I would highly recommend this course to anybody that wants a short, easy, and fast way of getting a valuable science credit!",
    "Fantastic overviews of key science topics."
