    "Learning hands-on about mineral deposits and their formation.",
    "This class is very approachable and interesting, and I would certainly recommend it! It's probably best to have a strong background in mineralogy and basic structural geology; without this background knowledge I would have been lost most of the time. It's a pretty unique course in G&G because it fuses mineralogy&petrology with economics and history; this interdisciplinary nature makes it especially engaging.",
    "Mineral deposits is a great class. I can't imagine taking it with anyone else besides Professor Skinner, who is a legendary professor for a reason and really cares about his students. But, I'll also say this-- this was my first geology class, and although it was very intense and indepth, I had a great experience with it because of very friendly classmates and Professor Skinner. G&G students, more than students in any other major that I've met in my last 4 years, really create a community and collaborative approach to studying. The class was an enormously pleasant experience."
