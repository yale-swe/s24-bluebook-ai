   "comments": [
    "I learned much more about contemporary human rights issues across Asia. I also feel like I had a better grasp of the ways that Western media can be pretty biased about China.",
    "I mainly learned about how international agreements shape diplomacy and human rights. Of course, you also gain a lot of insight into current human rights violations in SE Asia and China, including the Rohingya Crisis and the oppression in Xinjiang. Additionally, I gained a lot of skills in writing a research paper from the 15-20 page final paper.",
    "I learned the basics of politics in Southeast Asia and East Asia.",
    "This may perhaps be one of the best courses I ever take at Yale. The class was incredibly fascinating, the readings were pertinent and brought in many perspectives about the region, and I finally felt like I was learning material at this school that actually mattered today in the real world. I cannot rave enough about this class. I left every section feeling like there was no way it could get better, yet each class seemed to prove me wrong. On top of that, the two professors are some hidden gems of this college. Professor Tsu is incredibly smart, passionate, and knowledgeable about the region. She also is a great representation of a strong female voice. Professor Cohen, guest teaching from Stanford, is one of the leading experts on the region. It was the biggest honor to have him teach us. Not only that, but I found him to be a great example of an extremely accomplished person who was down to earth, morally admirable, and truly wanted to support his students and form authentic relationships with them. The two of them combined made class such an enjoyable experience, and any student would be lucky to learn from them.",
    "This course covered the structure of ASEAN, China's Belt Road Initiative (BRI), human rights issues such as human trafficking in Southeast Asia and repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the south China sea dispute, and other related concepts. The only major assignment of the semester was a 20-25 page research paper on a topic of the students' choice. After taking the class, I feel like I have a solid basis of knowledge about ASEAN, BRI, and the major challenges facing Southeast countries today. I also feel much more confident in my research skills after having written the final paper with guidance from Professors Tsu and Cohen."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The two professors brought great perspectives to the class. I wish we had more time to debate the future of human rights and think about ways forward. I also really loved the assignment to research Chinese tech companies and wish we had more time to study the development of the Chinese tech industry more in-depth.",
    "One weakness was that my final paper was pretty much the only thing that was graded and I didn't receive any feedback on how I was doing in the class, so I had no idea if I was on the right track.",
    "Strengths: both Professor Tsu and Professor Cohen are amazing and every single class is interesting.",
    "I really liked the readings but didn't really think we engaged that much with them. Each class we went around saying one thing we wanted to discuss but there wasn't actually any structure in the class. I also feel like we learned so much about China but not very much about other countries. I wish there had been more structure in the class about what exactly we should be taking away from the class.",
    "Strengths: pertinent material, incredible professors, great readings, a great course structure Weaknesses: literally none that I can think of",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the expertise of both Professor Tsu and Professor Cohen. I liked that the class sessions alternated professors and I thought both sections complemented each other. I wish that the course material had continued into the final two sessions, rather than having editing sessions. I felt as though the editing sessions were not especially productive and I think I could have learned more if we had continued with readings in the final sessions or if there were formal presentations of our final projects.",
    "Strengths of the course include its flexibility, which allowed the class to explore certain topics in greater depth according to our interest. Discussion was lively and students were encouraged to ask questions and propose ideas in an open, welcoming environment. A small weakness of the course might be that there was sometimes a lack of structure in discussion, which led to some important ideas or topics not being covered sufficiently.",
    "One of the major strengths of this course was the combination of Professors Tsu and Cohen's teaching styles and professional background. While Professor Tsu's seminars on China and the One Belt One Road Initiative were well-matched with Professor Cohen's expertise as an expert in Southeast Asia and human rights practitioner who works closely with ASEAN. I found the course to be well-structured and engaging. My only suggestion would be to balance out the outside assignments between Professor Cohen and Professor Tsu's lectures. I enjoyed each of these pieces of extra homework, particularly when Professor Tsu asked us to look for unusual sources about a topic related to BRI. I would have appreciated doing similar assignments about ASEAN and related topics for Professor Cohen's sessions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - I think Professor Tsu is one of the only professors I've had that really is able to deconstruct Western perception of China. Professor Cohen also brings a wealth of expertise from Southeast Asia that he brought to class --- super cool that he has real experience with the issues we were studying.",
    "Highly recommended!!!",
    "I would recommend this class to those who are very very interested in China and its relation to other countries in terms of its politics and economics.",
    "Yes, in a heartbeat. It was perhaps the best course I will ever take at Yale. Beyond that, the professors have made such an impact on my life and career goals.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course was well-organized to cover a broad range of topics with sufficient depth, and discussion in seminars was free-flowing and not rigidly controlled.",
    "Definitely! Both Prof Tsu and Prof Cohen are extremely knowledgeable and really interested in building the course around the interests of the students.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. As someone who tends to focus specifically on China in my coursework, I greatly appreciated the opportunity to learn more about Southeast Asia, ASEAN, and China's most recent foreign policy initiatives. These topics could not be more timely. Professors Tsu and Cohen make a fantastic team, and each seminar felt productive and engaging despite their differing teaching styles."
