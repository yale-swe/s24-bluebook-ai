    "Great class that teaches you new ways to give expression to music - goes beyond the basics taught in intro conducting and invites you to think more about artistry - very reasonable workload, fun repertoire (we studied Beethoven 9.4, Tchaikovsky 5.1, Stravinsky's Sacrificial Dance)",
    "Strongly recommend!",
    "This course is a great way to dip one's shoes in the art conducting so-to-speak. I would recommend it to people who are just beginning to be serious about score-studying and conducting, although they must know they will have to often direct their own learning due to the loose structure of the course.",
    "I loved Toshi's conducting classes. It is definitely one of the most chill classes at Yale and you do learn many skills with the baton through practice and Toshi's comments. The main difference from last semester, apart from the difficulty level of the pieces, is the inclusion of rehearsal technique. I really wished we could have gone more in depth with this. Also, although I do understand his \"no textbook\" approach, I wish he could have given us recommended readings. I particularly enjoyed the video of Karajan's rehearsal that he showed us - it really inspired me. The main thing I have to say is I wish this course could have been a little more rigorous. I'd say it's as much work as you want it to be. If you practice regularly outside from class, you will perform well in class and you will get much more out of it."
