   "comments": [
    "Moves fast, decently challenging, but exams are fair if you study adequately",
    "An okay class. Lots of work (pre-class videos and problems + weekly problem sets). Tedious topics towards the second half of the semester.",
    "Take it if you need to take math, I don't know why anyone would take this for fun. Although I kind of had fun during it. Somewhat interesting. Also the structure of the class is fantastic!",
    "You have to take this course with Dr. Jim Rolf!",
    "Essentially BC calc on steroids. If you didn't take BC calc in high school, prepare to invest a lot of time and effort into this class. If you do, it's very rewarding.",
    "Math 115 is your basic integral calculus course. The class is rigorous with long psets and conceptually heavy tests. The class is well taught. I would recommend to another student because it is well taught, organized, and the workload isn't too bad.",
    "I recommend this class especially if you take it after completing Math 112.",
    "Yes. Choose Professor Rolf! Math 115 was not what I expected it to be. I expected it to be boring, basic, unchallenging (stupid me) and a drudgery I just have to get through because its one of those pointless prerequisites. However, Math 115 was so much more and its all because of one person. Professor James Rolf. Strengths: -Professor Rolf was the biggest strength of the class for me. I attended a few other sections in the beginning of the year and I dread the fate of students in those sections! i) Professor Rolf is an amazing teacher. His philosophy alone is a model that many other professors should try to emulate. It basically involves constant interaction in the class. He is very intelligent and will use our ideas to convert them\/built upon them to make them more substantial. He constantly seeks questions and always knows the answer, unlike some professor who get stalled\/give bad answers just to seem like they know the answer. If Professor Rolf is unsure, he admits he will just check and get back to us. ii) Professor Rolf puts in so much effort into the course. Those videos he used this semester took such a long time and effort to make! Every day, he actually looks at our answers from the prep problems and organizes the class based on our answers. iii) Professor Rolf is such a genuine human being. He had meals with us several times and actually wanted to meet with us and get to know us beyond the class. He could literally name every student in a class of 40 unlike some professor who cant do it in a class of 15. He was interested in our lives and interests and understanding of our commitments and uncertainties. iv) Professor Rolf was entertaining and hilarious. In the first class, he asked for our details our favourite song, ambitions and other activities\/fun facts. At the beginning of every class, he would play two songs and introduce two people to the class to introduce us to each other\/create a sense of community. He would also research famous people from each of our hometowns and tell us their names. This is hard to do in a class of 30. In fact, Ive never felt any sense of community in my 15-member classes either. This requires so much effort and it was really commendable that he would give up 5 minutes of his class every day. v) Professor Rolf is innovative. He would use new and weird exercises from time to time. Once, he used Polar Plunge. Another time, he brought us stacks of slabs that we had to pile up beyond the edge of the table as far as we could. He would always connect these back to Math concepts and it was always a valuable addition to the mundane course material otherwise. Talking about mundane material I loved the attempt by Professor Rolf to integrate practical applications of mathematical concepts (just glimpses because we didnt know nearly enough Math) into the course e.g. blackholes, populations, ecology, sound physics etc. vi) Professor Rolf constantly seeks self-improvement and course improvement. He used surveys quite often and even promised to give us 5 points extra on the final exam if we did the survey. He is an honest man. The course philosophy and workload: i) The new course approach of using prep problems and videos before the class was successful. It expected more from us and was sometimes (rarely) a bit unreasonable because we were expected to answer questions about concepts that we had learnt ourselves through videos and without any sort of discussion in class. However, overall, it kept on top of the material, reinforced it and made me succeed. The videos were brilliant and I even rewatched them before the final exam. The class is very generous with grading. Partial credit was always given for no reason on every question. There will be moments of bad luck, silly mistakes and disasters. Thats just Math. But overall, about 40% As\/A-s are expected to be awarded. I dont know what Ill get but the course attempt was always to help people get better grades.",
    "Only take it if you genuinely enjoy math and are willing to put in hours to master the concepts, or if you HAVE to. Be prepared to have to utilize outside resources like Khan Academy to put everything together",
    "Get professor Rolf, and you will absolutely love this class. It is hard, but will pay off in the end, when you understand how different functions behave infinitely, how everything in the universe goes at speeds less than the speed of light (according to mathmatical end points), and what e^x actually means. As a non-math person, I found all of these fascinating, and worth all the work I put in. And don't be intimated by flipped classroom. It is truly helpful in the end, when you have a preview of the hardest material to be learned in class.",
    "Challenging but interesting",
    "Yes. Take this. Even if you're not a STEM student and looking to get QRs out of the way, take it. It's a solid math course, and will impart valuable math skills to you.",
    "Tough class but you will get it with time.",
    "I would describe it as an intensive way to learn Calculus BC, but a highly-educational experience. I would recommend this course to students, but only if they ere going to be in Rolf's section, because I think students in other sections would not benefit as much form the course as those in his--I know of some students who transferred into our section. It is a necessary course for many majors and it teaches students to keep up with the material being covered in class.",
    "It's time consuming but if you need to take it, take it.",
    "It is a Calulus II class. You should take it for your major.",
    "This course has a heavy workload, with reasonably long psets and other homework. It's doable for someone who isn't great at math as long as you study hard for the tests. The flipped classroom is a good way to leave enough time in class to get to higher level material, but sometimes it feels like more practice of the basic concepts in class would be useful. Good classroom atmosphere and Rolf is fun",
    "Overall, I would recommend this class for a decent QR credit or as part of a requirement for something else. Don't take it just 'cuz unless you have Jim Rolf. Structure: The flip-course concept involves watching lecture videos before coming to class and delving deeper into the topics during lecture. This was a great set-up and really allowed us to tackle some harder problems, but it added more work. Professor: Jim Rolf is a great instructor and I would honestly have hated this course if I had one of the other professors. Workload: Since we have to watch videos outside of class, do prep problems, and still do psets, I would consider the workload to be fairly heavy but definitely manageable.",
    "Don't be afraid to take the class if you need it. Be prepared to work and to make use of peer tutors, office hours etcetera and just don't fall behind and you will be fine. If you don't need it or love calculus then I would take a different QR that might be more fun.",
    "If you are on the fence about taking this class, I suggest you don't. It's a time consuming class and there are far more rewarding courses to take at yale."
