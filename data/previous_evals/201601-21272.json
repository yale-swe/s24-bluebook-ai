    "Good for your brain. Also good for Econ grad school.",
    "Yes, it's hard. And VERY time consuming. If you take it make sure the rest of your schedule is not too full. Other than that it's an excellent course. The best (by far) in the Econ & Math major. Take it if you can!",
    "A very fitting capstone to the econ\/math major. Challenging and with a heavy workload, but worth it",
    "This class is very hard but very good. Game theory is fascinating. It is an economics course but the examples are not exclusive to economics. The problems are complex, the math is tricky, but the ideas are elegant. Dont be intimidated by the course evaluations. The problem sets take a long time but they are graded on a check minus\/check\/check plus scheme which means the impact on your grade is minimal. Similarly, the exams were tough but the curve is generous. The final in particular was astonishingly difficult (hardest exam Ive ever taken). But once youre done, you will feel very proud of yourself.",
    "Assessment of the course? Absolutely fucking brilliant. Hated the fact that psets were due Monday (i.e. no weekend 4 u) but looking back on it, with that giant stack of notes compiled together (the tests are open note but as Professor H\\\"{o}rner will tell you, \"that won't help you anyway\"), I can't help but believe I learned a fuckton about the beauty of game theory. If you have some grit and determination and a willingness to plunge into the depths of hell, take this course and come out re-fucking-born. This was one of the most fantastic introductions to game theory any undergraduate could ever experience. Indeed, it's taught at a level similar to the 1st year Econ PhD. Strengths include a both depth-and-breadth covering of game theoretical topics: nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, bayesian nash, perfect bayesian equilibria, sequential equilibria, repeated games, infinitely repeated games, auctions, knowledge, and a bit of mechanism design. The lecture and the lecture notes are both intensely theoretical -- like General Equilibrium Theory for those who have taken it with Truman Bewley, the course is steeped into abstract arguments, but unlike General Eq, you actually have to understand it to do (1) the homeworks and (2) parts of the exam. For the most part, however, exams are going to be more computational than proof based. **GO TO THE TF'S OFFICE HOURS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPUTATION.** This is critical for you to pass the exams! Weaknesses include the often way-too-quick glossing over of topics or notes that are way too technical. As just mentioned, the TA is the only one that really bridges together the notes and the exam problems. Nonetheless, math is critical even though the exams are not too proof-mathy (although H\\\"{o}rner could throw some shit like that on the exam -- I wouldn't put it past him), I would recommend a background of MATH 250 (or 230\/231) at the least in order to understand most of the arguments. A preliminary knowledge of real analysis is helpful and indeed, sometimes assumed. As he said with a grin on his face in the first lecture: \"If you are an econ major, or computer science, or philosophy, I'm not going to tell you not to take the course...\" Please be smart and have a good foundation in formal logic before you take this course. It is far too difficult to learn the game theoretical material concurrently with the math that is presented. In addition, I might add here that the other game theory (ECON 159?) will not help you as much as a math class will as far as preparation goes for the course. To conclude, most important I believe is your mentality and the approach you take to this course. It is easy to give up (your homework grade is determined on a check, check-, check+ basis and checks are almost always given) and simply think of this course as something you must complete to finish the major, but by doing so, (1) you will not get as much out of the course and (2) you will not do as well. You should be ready to drop 20 hours every week (especially in the latter half) to really understand the material and grind out the problem sets. Although I never went to his office hours personally (so take this with a grain of salt perhaps), I hear Professor H\\\"{o}rner is very willing to help his students. The latter half of the course is significantly harder than the first half, so please make a point of understanding the material before moving on come late March\/April. The exams are hard (bi-modal usually, so loosely there is a cluster of kids who just grind out the class, and a cluster of kids who just don't care all that much), but you can do this if you expend the time and UNDERSTAND what the fuck this man is writing on the board. That is how you pass the class with flying colors. Those steps aren't hard to do -- it's simply putting in the time. It comes down to (1) how willing you are to take them, and (2) how much time you have between all your other coursework. Best of luck!",
    "This class will devour your weekends like the eagle devoured Prometheus' liver, which grows back only to be eaten again. You'll start on Friday, work all weekend, and still sleep only two hours Sunday night (or should I say Monday morning) to hand in your pset at 1:00pm on Monday. And you'll still get half the pset wrong because your higher brain functions shut down around 4am. But you're going to love it. I think more clearly after having taken this class, something I can say about only two of the classes I've taken. Hrner is the crucible that forges you into an analytic weapon. The weak perish. Only the strong survive to claw their way out of the final, sunlight warming their faces for the first time in months, sweet victory tinged with the bitter knowledge that they can never experience this again. Just kidding! Now you get to take Hrner's micro theory class. This game theory class will break you. But if you're willing to get back up, you will reap incalculable rewards. Take this class, but don't half-ass it. You can't afford to.",
    "You've made it this far, don't drop to Econ because of one class. It's hard, but it's one of the more interesting ones out there.",
    "Do not take unless you have to or unless you have a penchant for ridiculously hard classes. It will take away your social life. It will make u suffer from PTSD. But it is a cool overview of game theory and v applicable to several other fields etc. so idk, your call.",
    "Get ready for a VERY hard class. Ok L, that depends on your math background, but chances are, if you're Econ\/math and you have to take it, then you're probably not very prepared. The lectures were hard, the problem sets IMPOSSIBLE (this class makes math 250 and 300 look like a piece of cake). Johannes gave us a midterm with 4 questions - nobody could solve one, and most people didn't even solve half of it.. The final was horrible (he asked us to derive third price auction from scratch....). We could have studied an additional three weeks and it wouldn't have helped (this is someone who probably put in 50hours for this class during reading week) . BUT on the bright side of it all, besides the fact that he gives impossible psets and exams were impossible, Johannes is a great professor, and Daria an amazing TA (if you guys are lucky to have her next year..). Johannes is a very good instructor. Always well prepared and organized, he cares a lot about everyone understanding, even though the concepts are quite tough and abstract. I do feel, sometimes, that he could slow down the pace of his very fast lectures to match the level of understanding of the average students. His notes are abstract and dense, but they are clear and make a lot of sense (after you read them twice). Johannes' office hours are super helpful - he is very patient and is always willing to help anyone who asks for help. He is also a hilarious person which helps keep us in check in class when things get really abstract and math-y. One area of improvement is to make the problem sets more doable, as well as the final, which was according to everyone impossible.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I repeat, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. As I write this review, I debate whether or not I should let Game theory take more minutes out of my life, but I would rather save fellow students from the pain I went through. What is the big problem with Econ 351? It severely lacks resources! Lecture notes are simply not enough to learn the material. A lot of the times i struggled with the homework simply because Johannes had not bothered to go through examples in class and the lecture notes were just a useless file of definitions. You spent a lot of time struggling\/googling answers for the homework, and, on top of that, you are still not prepared for the exams because those two were completely unrelated. Exams were hard, mainly because Johannes never bothered to go through similar problems in class or in the problem sets. You take a class like game theory expecting to gain some insight into its real world application, but the theory in the end just felt too disconnected. If you must take this class, a word of advice, which I learned very late in the game: do not bother with the lecture\/lecture notes. Just get yourself some game theory textbook: Gibbons was a really good one! Do the application-type problems in the homework and just dont bother with the rest. Trust me, this WILL save you a lot of time.",
    "Read the syllabus and talk to Professor Horner if you just wanna take this class for fun. It's very interesting, but it's also fairly challenging (which is a good thing, but just be up for it if you're gonna take this). Professor Horner is an excellent professor, and you will learn a lot from him.",
    "Fun class. Can expand to take up any amount of time.",
    "Incredibly challenging but rewarding class. You come out of it really having a solid understanding of the foundations of game theory. I didn't take real analysis before this class, and I found that I couldn't very easily understand a lot of the mathematical proofs and foundations behind some of the concepts, and struggled a lot with the notation-heavy notes. But you didn't really need analysis to apply the concepts once they had been understood. Prof. Horner is an excellent instructor who really cares about his students. Sometimes he might move a little fast in class, especially for those with a less rigorous mathematical background, but he will always take questions in class and he makes himself very readily available to students. I don't think I've had another professor who holds office offce for as a long duration of time and as available on request as Prof. Horner. Take it if you want a more rigorous introduction to Game Theory beyond what is offered already in the Econ department."
