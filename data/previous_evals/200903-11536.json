   "comments": [
    "It's a great class. Taking analysis will help but Prof. Denardo teaches what you need to know.You will learn a lot about not only optimization but also linear algebra, vecotr calculus, analysis and convex analysis.That being said however if you are week in those areas don't worry as the testing (two take homes) doesn't ask about these.Take it. Prof Denardo is absolutely fantastic",
    "Yes. I would recommend this class to another student. Of any math course I have ever taken, this one was by far the most interesting and most applicable to everyday life. I am leaving the class with a good understanding of operations research theory as well as an ability to formulate and solve real-life problems using Microsoft Excel. Some of the concepts are quite difficult and the course jumps around without going into intense depth on any particular topic. Though I have not yet taken a proof-based math course, I feel that this course provides a solid introduction to writing them. Professor Denardo is very accessible and holds open office hours, and he will help you pretty much whenever you happen to show up at his office. Both the mid-term and the final were 96-hour take-home exams, which I found to be quite a bit less stressful than a traditional test.",
    "I would recommend Optimization. You learn a lot of useful things, especially with respect to setting up maximization problems and using Excel. I don't think class is really worth it, since you end up learning most things from the book, but face time is worth it since Denardo really makes an effort to learn everyone's name.",
    "If you need some sort of mathy credit and want to take a semester learning something cool and different, this is it!",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Prof. Denardo is a fantastic and unique instructor. There will be a lot of time spent in class watching him prove theorems on the blackboard, or learning the simplex method by tediously going through the material step-by-step. Going to class is a good idea, but you don't need to go to every class. I learned a lot about linear programming, and very much enjoyed the class. If you want to do well in this class, speak to the TA about the homework in advance of when it is due, and if the TA is unhelpful (this year's was always helpful) drop by Prof. Denardo's office hours, which are anytime.There are two take-home assignments. Go see Prof. Denardo about these, and he will give you hints while you are taking them.If you need optimization for something (I needed it for econ) you can't go wrong with this class.",
    "A class in optimization of linear programming that has roots in linear algebra with lots of applications to economics. Yes I would recommend this course to other students because the subject material was interesting, the professor was funny and passionate, and the skills I've learned in this class will definitely help me in my future math classes.",
    "I would summarize it as a strong introduction to both the theory and applications of linear and nonlinear programming. I would recommend it to any student in applied mathematics, engineering, or economics (both math econ and normal econ if you can do any math) or anybody who is even mildly interested in the subject."
