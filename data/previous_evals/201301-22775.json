    "Every student should take this course and if they cant they should encourage their instructors to incorporate some of the ideas and approaches to this class into their own. Best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "This class is awesome (and this year it was CASSAVAWESOME)! But actually. You get to work with a team of people from all around the university, including SOM, to think about real problems and to actually build something. This is one of the few classes I have taken at Yale that seems as though it has a purpose beyond just putting a grade on a transcript or learning material that you'll probably forget. It's a chance to meet new people and work together in an academic setting. ALSO the professors are AMAZING.That said, this class will not be perfect, and I think that's kinda the point. This year, we faced some substantial roadblocks and frustrations. Especially because you can't travel to the place you're interested in, the potential for your project will be constrained by the initial topical choice of the professors. It will also be constrained by the mix of people who end up joining the class...this year, we had very few engineers, which was too bad. That said, though, you'll have to work on teams after and during yale, and you'll face problems...at least being in a classroom takes some of the risk away.SOOOO take this class!!!!",
    "Tech team and comm team, choose one, devote semester to project. Totally worth it.",
    "Design classes are awesome, and this class was, overall, a lot of fun. Still, it misses the mark on a lot of fronts. There are too many students, which led to an inequity in work load. You have to choose to fully engage with the course to get anything out of it, or else seems like it can turn into a semester long arts and crafts project.",
    "This course could be incredible. It could lead to something that quite literally changes the world. It's relatively new and completely unique at Yale, however, so someof the kinks are still being worked out. (I don't want to bother explaining what the course is like here, but definitely read the syllabus or go to the first day to find out.) It seems like a lot of time is spent asking questions, but no one actually bothers to do the research to answer them properly (instead we just use our preexisting assumptions as answers). As a result, it's hard to feel like we did as good of a job as we told ourselves that we did. Still, it's pretty cool to work with both undergrads and grad\/SOM students as one big group excited about achieving an awesome goal. Shop it.",
    "I highly recommend 491 for anyone looking for real world experience and problemsolving skills.",
    "If Joe is involved with the class I would definitely still recommend it, despite the points I listed above in response to question 1.",
    "It was a good class to take and I would take it again. There is so much depth to my knowledge of cassava now it's kind of disgusting. Would be better for students who are self-motivated, have engineering backgrounds, and are already familiar with the CEID. Also better for students who are comfortable with being uncomfortable, have extremely flexible out-of-class commitments for impromptu spur-of-the-moment meetings and are generally ok with a great disparity between the amount of work they put in from week to week.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It's a lot of time but I honestly looked forward to every minute of it. You bond with the other students a lot during the semester and you become an integral member of the whole team. It's very rewarding."
